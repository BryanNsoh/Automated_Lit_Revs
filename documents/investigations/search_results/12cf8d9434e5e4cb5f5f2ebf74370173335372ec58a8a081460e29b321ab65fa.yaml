    Learning Introduction Sub-Saharan Africa is a region whose agriculture is heavily
    reliant on unpredictable rainfall. According to the FAO, the total area of land
    under irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa was estimated at 7 million hectares in
    2020, representing only 5 % of the region''s arable land [1], [2], [3]. Globally
    freshwater resources are limited and unevenly distributed, with many regions experiencing
    physical and economic water scarcity (UN [4]). Despite the ongoing challenges
    related to water scarcity, there are global developments in irrigation that hold
    promise for enhancing agricultural productivity and building resilience against
    the impacts of climate change [[5], [6], [7], [8],4]. The world is currently witnessing
    the fourth industrial revolution, characterized by the integration of emerging
    technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Blockchain, the Internet of
    Things (IoT), Big Data Technology, Drones, Robots and 3D printing [9,10]. The
    use of these modern intelligent technologies in irrigation is emerging in sub-Saharan
    Africa and is set to transform farming by allowing smart and precise irrigation
    [11,12]. For instance, IoT sensors can be used to monitor soil moisture levels
    and automatically adjust irrigation to optimize water use efficiency, whereas
    AI applications can predict weather patterns and optimize irrigation scheduling.
    To enhance water-use efficiency and contribute to Sustainable Development Goals
    (SDGs), particularly Goal 6 and Target 6.4, it is essential to implement innovation
    in irrigation systems. As such, there is a need for increased investment in irrigation
    infrastructure and adoption of modern intelligent technologies to ensure sustainable
    irrigation practices in sub-Saharan Africa. The importance of smart irrigation
    cannot be overstated in today''s world, where climate change is affecting global
    freshwater resources and increasing water scarcity. Manual irrigation of crops
    is not only time-consuming but also inefficient, while irrigation based on fixed
    timers does not account for changes in weather or soil conditions that affect
    moisture levels [13], [14], [15], [16], [17]. Smart irrigation systems take into
    account weather and soil conditions to optimize irrigation, resulting in significant
    water savings of up to 30 percent [18], [19], [20], [21]. As a result, smart irrigation
    has emerged as a more effective and sustainable approach in irrigated agriculture.
    The essence of smart irrigation lies in its conceptual framework, which amalgamates
    technology and agricultural practices to optimize water use efficiency. This framework
    revolves around several key components. Sensors and monitoring systems, ranging
    from soil moisture sensors to weather instruments, gather real-time data on variables
    critical to irrigation decisions. This data is then subjected to analysis using
    cutting-edge approaches like artificial intelligence and machine learning models,
    providing insights that inform irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop
    management. The actual irrigation is optimized through precision delivery mechanisms
    like drip irrigation, which directs water directly to plant root zones, minimizing
    losses through evaporation and runoff [22]. Automation and control mechanisms
    enable real-time adjustments based on collected data, enhancing the efficiency
    of irrigation practices. The integration of these components is facilitated by
    the connectivity and communication capabilities of the IoT, enabling seamless
    data exchange, remote monitoring, and control of irrigation systems [13]. Central
    to the smart irrigation discourse is the concept of Water Use Efficiency (WUE)
    in agriculture. WUE measures the ratio of agricultural output to the amount of
    water used for productively by the plant [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28]. Smart
    irrigation systems have the potential to enhance WUE significantly by tailoring
    irrigation schedules to crop water requirements [29,30,23,31,[24], [25], [26],
    [27], [28]]. Leveraging real-time data on factors like soil moisture, weather
    conditions, and plant stress, these systems enable precise irrigation, optimizing
    both water use and crop growth. The incorporation of 4IR technologies further
    enhances WUE by enabling accurate predictions of water demand. AI algorithms analyze
    historical data and environmental factors to forecast crop water needs, ensuring
    timely irrigation application. This predictive ability, combined with real-time
    weather monitoring, empowers farmers to adapt irrigation schedules proactively,
    thus optimizing water use efficiency. Despite various studies investigating irrigation
    technologies and practices, a significant research gap persists regarding the
    effective integration of 4IR technologies into smart irrigation systems. Recent
    systematic literature reviews have focused on the applications of 4IR in other
    domains like manufacturing, health, transport, fashion, labor force among others
    [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. Therefore,
    the primary objective of this systematic review paper was to examine the role
    of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation and their potential applications in the
    context of sub-Saharan Africa. Specifically, the review aimed to: a) explore the
    utilization of AI in irrigation systems for precision irrigation, water demand
    prediction, crop yield estimation, and soil moisture management; b) investigate
    the role of IoT and Drone Technology in generating and managing data for improved
    irrigation management practices; c) examine the potential applications of Blockchain
    and Machine Learning in irrigation, particularly in data management and decision-making
    processes; and d) identify the constraints, challenges, and opportunities associated
    with leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation within the context of sub-Saharan
    Africa. This paper provides insights for researchers, decision-makers, and practitioners
    interested in enhancing the efficiency and sustainability of irrigation practices
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Research methodology A systematic review approach was used

    regarding industrial revolution The Industrial Revolution marked a significant
    turning point in human history, propelling societies into an era of unprecedented
    technological advancements. Throughout the various stages of the Industrial Revolution,
    irrigation technology played a crucial role in enhancing agricultural productivity
    and sustaining growing populations. In this section, we explored the evolution
    of irrigation technology from the Industrial Revolution 1.0 to 4.0 and the timelines,
    showcasing the remarkable advancements that revolutionized the way water was harnessed
    and distributed for agricultural purposes. The first Industrial Revolution, starting
    in the late 18th century, witnessed the emergence of steam power as a primary
    driving force [47]. This technological breakthrough led to advancements in irrigation
    systems. Steam-powered pumps and engines were introduced [48], enabling the lifting
    of water from rivers and reservoirs to higher elevations. Canal systems were developed
    to transport water efficiently across vast distances, promoting agricultural expansion
    and increasing crop yields [49]. The second Industrial Revolution, characterized
    by the widespread adoption of electricity and mass production techniques [50],
    had a profound impact on irrigation technology. Electrical pumps and motors replaced
    steam-powered machinery, providing more reliable and efficient water delivery.
    Farmers gained greater control over irrigation schedules, leading to improved
    water management, and increased agricultural output [51]. Electric-powered sprinkler
    systems and drip irrigation methods were introduced, optimizing water distribution,
    and minimizing waste. With the advent of the third Industrial Revolution, automation
    and computerization revolutionized irrigation technology [52]. The integration
    of sensors, data analytics, and computer systems into irrigation infrastructure
    enabled precise monitoring and control of water usage. Automated irrigation systems
    adjusted water flow based on soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant
    requirements, ensuring optimal irrigation while conserving water resources. This
    era witnessed the emergence of smart irrigation technologies, empowering farmers
    with real-time data and insights for efficient decision-making [53]. The ongoing
    fourth Industrial Revolution, characterized by digitalization and the IoT [54],
    is transforming irrigation technology in unprecedented ways. Advanced sensor networks,
    drones, and satellite imagery are utilized to monitor soil conditions, water availability,
    and plant health with exceptional precision. Machine learning algorithms analyze
    vast amounts of data, providing predictive insights to optimize irrigation strategies
    and maximize crop productivity. Smart irrigation systems, integrated with AI-driven
    controllers, remotely manage water distribution, reducing water waste and enabling
    sustainable agricultural practices. Fig. 5 summarizes the remarkable industrial
    revolution with the different technologies. Download : Download high-res image

    [54]. Fourth industrial revolution technologies for smart irrigation In 2011,
    the German government unveiled a novel concept known as \"Industry 4.0″ during
    a trade fair. This initiative primarily aims to enhance collaboration among individuals,
    machinery, and resources [55]. At its core, Industry 4.0 revolves around the idea
    of bridging the gap between the physical and virtual realms [56]. It establishes
    connections among machines, functions, and systems through intelligent networks
    that span the entire value chain, allowing them to operate autonomously and interact
    with one another [57]. The term \"Industry 4.0″ refers to both partially and fully
    automated advanced manufacturing processes driven by technology, where equipment
    can communicate independently throughout the value chain [56]. This innovative
    concept encompasses various technologies such as digital manufacturing, network
    communication, computing, and automation, all integrated within the adaptable
    and intricate systems of Industry 4.0. The application of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in irrigation (Fig. 6) represents a significant leap forward in modern
    agriculture. This transformative era is marked by the convergence of digital,
    physical, and biological systems, and it brings with it a multitude of innovative
    tools and techniques that enhance irrigation practices. One of the key pillars
    of this revolution is the IoT, which involves embedding sensors and devices in
    irrigation systems to collect real-time data on soil moisture levels, weather
    conditions, and crop health. AI and machine learning algorithms then process this
    data to make precise and timely decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, optimizing
    water usage, and minimizing waste. Furthermore, drones equipped with advanced
    imaging technology are employed for aerial monitoring of fields, providing farmers
    with a comprehensive view of their crops and irrigation needs. Additionally, blockchain
    technology is being utilized to create transparent and secure systems for water
    resource management and supply chain tracking, ensuring the efficient distribution
    of water resources. These 4IR technologies collectively empower farmers with unprecedented
    control and insights into their irrigation practices, ultimately contributing
    to increased crop yields, resource conservation, and sustainable agricultural
    practices in an era of global environmental challenges. Download : Download high-res

    for smart irrigation. Artificial intelligence in smart irrigation AI refers to
    the ability of machines to learn and make decisions based on data [58]. AI plays
    a pivotal role in smart irrigation systems, enabling advanced analytics and decision-making
    capabilities [59]. AI algorithms can be used to analyze data on weather, soil
    moisture, and crop water requirements and to make automated decisions on irrigation
    scheduling [60]. This can improve the accuracy and efficiency of irrigation management
    and reduce the risk of over- or under-irrigation. AI enables farmers to collect,
    analyze, and interpret data on a large scale, allowing for more precise and accurate
    irrigation decisions [61]. AI can analyze large amounts of data and provide insights
    that can be used to optimize irrigation. For example, AI can analyze data on soil
    moisture levels, temperature, humidity, and crop growth patterns to identify the
    most efficient irrigation strategies for specific crops and soil types. Fig. 7

    image Fig. 7. Integration of AI in Smart Irrigation. Predictive modelling for
    water demand and crop yield AI-based predictive models for example neural networks,
    ensemble, regression, classification, and time series forecasting models are utilized
    to forecast water demand and crop yield based on historical data and environmental
    factors (Kuradusenge et al., 2023; [45]). Such models use historical data, weather
    patterns, and crop-specific information to estimate the irrigation requirements,
    facilitating efficient water allocation. Kuradusenge et al. (2023) used rainfall
    and temperature data analyzed through Random Forest, Polynomial Regression, and
    Support Vector Regressor to predict crop yield of Irish potato and maize. Random
    forest was recommended for early crop yield prediction of potatoes and maize (Kuradusenge
    et al., 2023). AI algorithms are employed to analyze real-time data from soil
    moisture sensors and determine the optimal irrigation timing and volume [62].
    By continuously monitoring soil moisture levels, smart irrigation systems can
    ensure that crops receive adequate water while avoiding waterlogging and excessive
    runoff [63]. One example of the application of soil moisture monitoring and management
    in sub-Saharan Africa is a study done by (Wanyama et al., 2023). The authors have
    developed a cost-effective green technology intelligent irrigation control system
    kit that improves precise irrigation water application. This kit is a photovoltaic
    system that powers a water pump, a soil moisture sensor, and an Arduino microcontroller
    unit mounted on a moving frame. The soil moisture sensors were placed in the field
    and sent real-time soil moisture values to the microcontroller via a wired Universal
    Serial Bus (USB) communication channel. The microcontroller connected the water
    pump, the tank water level sensor, the soil moisture sensors, and the water tank
    outlet solenoid valve. Therefore, the system could schedule irrigation thus improving
    the traditional irrigation technology. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms are employed
    in smart irrigation systems to analyze data patterns, make predictions, and optimize
    irrigation [64], [65], [66], [67]. ML algorithms learn from historical and real-time
    data, enabling adaptive decision-making and improving irrigation efficiency [68].
    Machine Learning algorithms can analyze historical data on weather, soil conditions,
    and crop performance to predict future irrigation requirements [62]. By providing
    accurate forecasts, ML-based predictive analytics support farmers in making informed
    decisions regarding irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management.
    ML algorithms can be utilized to develop adaptive irrigation control systems that
    adjust irrigation parameters based on real-time data inputs [69,70]. These systems
    continuously monitor soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and plant water
    stress, allowing for dynamic irrigation control to optimize water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. The synergy between AI and smart irrigation is transformative,
    offering data-driven insights and automation for efficient water management. AI
    processes copious data from sensors, weather forecasts, and soil conditions to
    optimize irrigation schedules. ML models are trained on historical data and environmental
    cues to predict crop water requirements. Table 3 summarizes other applications
    using AI in irrigation operations. In another study, Ikudayisi et al. [71] conducted
    research focused on managing crop water requirements at the Winterton irrigation
    scheme in South Africa, aiming to address the challenges posed by water scarcity
    and its impact on agricultural efficiency. To achieve their objectives, the researchers
    employed a combined approach involving artificial intelligence, namely an artificial
    neural network (ANN), and a crop growth simulation model. The study aimed to estimate
    various aspects of crop irrigation water requirements, including the crop-water
    demand from planting to harvest, the timing of irrigation, the optimal stage in
    the drying cycle for water application, and the volume of irrigation water to
    be applied. Five feed-forward backward propagation ANN predictive models with
    varying configurations were developed and assessed. The optimal ANN model, characterized
    by 5 inputs, 5 neurons, 1 hidden layer, and 1 output, was employed to predict
    monthly reference evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Winterton region. This optimal
    ANN model demonstrated a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.67, a Pearson correlation
    coefficient (r) of 0.97, and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.94. The
    validation of the model revealed a correlation (r) value of 0.9048 between the
    measured and predicted ETo values. Table 3 summarizes other applications using
    AI in irrigation operations. Table 2 Table 2. Artificial intelligence applications

    machines that are connected to the internet and can exchange data with each other
    [77]. In smart irrigation systems, IoT devices such as sensors and controllers
    can be used to collect and transmit data on weather, soil moisture, and crop water
    requirements. This data can be processed and analyzed in real-time to adjust irrigation
    schedules and optimize water use. IoT plays a crucial role in collecting and transmitting
    data in smart irrigation systems [78,79]. IoT sensors and devices are deployed
    throughout the irrigation infrastructure to monitor various parameters and facilitate
    data-driven decision-making. connectivity. In IoT applications, connectivity between
    gateways, remote clouds, and users is typically over broadband communication networks.
    However, in most of sub-Saharan Africa''s rural countries, broadband connectivity
    is either very expensive or non-existent. Affordable broadband technologies like
    TVWS have been tested in South Africa and around the world and can provide both
    backhaul and last-mile wireless connectivity for remotely deployed agricultural
    IoT-based systems in various locations [80] Data generation and collection through
    IoT sensors IoT sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, weather stations, and
    flow meters, collect real-time data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    and water flow [81,82]. These sensors provide a continuous stream of information,
    enabling farmers to make informed decisions regarding irrigation management. Nigussie
    et al. (2020) proposed an IoT-based irrigation management system for smallholder
    farmers in South Africa, Kenya, and Ethiopia`s rural areas. Sensors in the system
    detect soil conditions (moisture, temperature, nutrients, and pH) and provide
    data on the water level in the storage as well as microclimate conditions. The
    actuators in this system direct the flow of water to the farm via sprinklers,
    pumps, valves, and water gates. The IoT network connectivity technology used in
    this system was Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN). This is because LoRaWAN
    is a fully open standard solution with no subscription fee, making it less expensive
    for IoT connectivity devices, and it is well-suited for long-distance. Cloud computing
    for data management and analysis Cloud computing has emerged as a revolutionary
    technology that can transform the way we manage and optimize irrigation systems.
    Cloud computing platforms are utilized to store and process the vast amount of
    data generated by IoT sensors in smart irrigation systems [83]. Cloud-based solutions
    provide scalable storage, computational power, and data analytics capabilities,
    allowing for efficient data management and analysis, [84]. One of the key benefits
    of cloud computing in smart irrigation is the ability to store and process large
    amounts of data in a centralized location. This allows farmers to easily access
    and analyze data on things like soil moisture levels, weather patterns, and crop
    health, which can help them make more informed decisions about irrigation. With
    data driven irrigation optimization, farmers can reduce water waste and ensure
    that water is used only when and where it is needed, leading to improved water
    use efficiency. In sub-Saharan Africa, cloud services create additional running
    costs for irrigation management systems. To address these issues, the most commonly
    proposed IoT architectures typically provide local processing and storage in gateways
    created for data processing, network management, irrigation decisions, and communication
    with farmers. This avoids the need for broadband networks and cloud services (backend
    servers) [80]. Maitethia et al. [85] executed a groundbreaking IoT smart irrigation
    system in Kenya, setting a remarkable precedent for precision agriculture in Africa.
    By integrating a network of sensors, weather stations, and cloud-based analytics,
    their pioneering initiative ushered in a new era of data-driven irrigation management.
    The remarkable outcomes encompassed substantial crop yield improvements, significant
    water conservation, substantial cost reductions, and enhanced climate resilience,
    ultimately bolstering food security and elevating the socioeconomic status of
    local farmers. Although initial investments and the need for comprehensive technical
    training posed initial challenges, the unparalleled potential of IoT-driven smart
    irrigation holds the promise of fostering a sustainable and prosperous future
    for African agriculture. Table 4 presents other applications of IoT in irrigation.
    Big data technology in smart irrigation Big Data Technology plays a significant
    role in unlocking the potential of data in smart irrigation systems [94]. By harnessing
    large volumes of data, valuable insights can be gained to optimize irrigation
    management practices. Big data analytics involves the use of advanced analytical
    techniques to extract insights from large and complex datasets. In smart irrigation
    systems, big data analytics can be used to analyze data on weather, soil moisture,
    and crop water requirements and to identify patterns and trends that can inform
    irrigation management. Big data refers to large and complex data sets that cannot
    be processed using traditional data processing techniques. In the context of precision
    irrigation, big data can be used to analyze large volumes of data on weather patterns,
    soil moisture levels, crop water requirements, and other factors that affect irrigation
    needs. Big Data analytics techniques are applied to historical and real-time data
    to identify patterns, trends, and correlations related to irrigation and crop
    performance [95]. This enables farmers to make data-driven decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling, water allocation, and crop management. Rabhi et al. [96]
    explored the application of big data analytics in the context of smart irrigation,
    with a specific focus on digital agriculture in Morocco. Their research aimed
    to leverage big data analytics to enhance predictive irrigation techniques. They
    noted the growing importance of intelligent agriculture, characterized by widespread
    adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) analysis solutions, which has led to more
    precise irrigation scheduling. The research took place utilizing an irrigation
    dataset that considered moisture and temperature factors. To analyze this dataset,
    the authors employed neural network (NN) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms.
    The computational aspect of their study was conducted using the big data platform
    \"databricks,\" which implements the Spark framework for processing large datasets.
    The results from their models were promising, with SVM achieving an accuracy of
    97.00 % and NN reaching an accuracy of 98.50 %. In their future work, the authors
    intend to expand upon the 19,440 enterprise metamodel, introducing additional
    constructs related to advanced technologies such as big data analytics tools,
    IoT, AI, cloud computing, and machine learning. This extended metamodel is envisioned
    to be applied in the context of a smart farm, aligning with the principles of
    Agriculture 4.0. The use of Big Data in smart irrigation systems raises concerns
    about data privacy and security [97]. Safeguarding sensitive information and ensuring
    secure data transmission and storage are essential to maintain trust and protect
    the integrity of smart irrigation systems. Blockchain technology for managing
    big data in irrigation Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and transparent
    framework for managing and securing data in smart irrigation systems [95]. It
    provides an immutable ledger that records and verifies data transactions, ensuring
    data integrity and enabling trusted collaborations. Blockchain technology offers
    a decentralized and transparent framework for managing and securing data in smart
    irrigation systems [98]. By leveraging Blockchain, data can be stored and managed
    in a distributed manner across multiple nodes, eliminating the need for a central
    authority [99]. In smart irrigation, Blockchain can provide an immutable ledger
    that records and verifies data transactions related to water usage, irrigation
    practices, and resource management. Each data transaction is cryptographically
    linked to the previous transaction, creating a chain of blocks that ensures data
    integrity and transparency. By utilizing Blockchain for data management, smart
    irrigation systems can enhance trust and accountability in water governance [100].
    All stakeholders, including farmers, water authorities, and researchers, can access
    and verify the data recorded on the Blockchain, enabling transparent and auditable
    irrigation practices. The decentralized nature of Blockchain also mitigates the
    risks of data tampering and unauthorized modifications. Since data is stored across
    multiple nodes in the network, any attempt to alter the data would require consensus
    from a majority of nodes, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or manipulation
    [101,102]. Moreover, Blockchain can facilitate trusted collaborations and data
    sharing among stakeholders in the irrigation ecosystem. Smart contracts, which
    are self-executing agreements coded on the Blockchain, can automate and enforce
    rules and conditions related to water allocation, usage rights, and payment systems
    [103]. These smart contracts enhance transparency and efficiency in irrigation
    governance, reducing the reliance on intermediaries and streamlining administrative
    processes. However, the adoption of Blockchain in smart irrigation systems comes
    with challenges. The scalability and energy consumption of Blockchain networks,
    especially in resource-constrained environments, need to be addressed. Additionally,
    ensuring data privacy while maintaining transparency is crucial, as sensitive
    information may be recorded on the Blockchain. Despite these challenges, Blockchain
    technology shows promising potential in revolutionizing data management and governance
    in smart irrigation systems. Further research and pilot projects are needed to
    explore the practical implementation and scalability of Blockchain solutions in
    the context of sub-Saharan Africa. Blockchain''s smart contract functionality
    can be leveraged to automate and enforce irrigation governance rules [104]. Smart
    contracts enable the execution of predefined rules and conditions related to water
    allocation, usage rights, and payment systems. This enhances transparency, reduces
    disputes, and ensures fair and accountable irrigation practices. Drone technology
    in smart irrigation Drone technology has emerged as a promising tool for enhancing
    smart irrigation practices in various agricultural contexts. Drones, also known
    as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), offer unique capabilities for remote sensing,
    high-resolution data collection, and precision irrigation management. Drones equipped
    with advanced sensors and imaging systems enable remote sensing and high-resolution
    data collection in agricultural landscapes [105,103,106]. These sensors capture
    data on various parameters, including soil moisture, vegetation indices, temperature,
    and crop health. The collected data provides valuable insights into the spatial
    variability of soil and crop conditions, allowing for targeted irrigation interventions.
    In Kenya, certain farmers have embraced innovative approaches such as employing
    near-infrared cameras affixed to drones for pest and disease identification, among
    other applications. Additionally, within the Kenyan context, there exists a beta-stage
    AI tool named Nuru, accessible on Android devices with or without internet connectivity
    [107]. This advanced technology specializes in the diagnosis of crop diseases,
    with a particular focus on identifying mite and viral infections in cassava and
    detecting armyworm infestations in maize. KDHI Agriculture reports that a substantial
    number of cassava farmers, approximately 28,000, have already reaped the benefits
    of this tool''s implementation. One of the key applications of drone technology
    in smart irrigation is the monitoring of soil moisture levels [108]. Drones equipped
    with specialized sensors can capture near infrared and thermal imagery to assess
    soil moisture content across fields. This information helps farmers understand
    the spatial distribution of moisture and make informed decisions on irrigation
    scheduling and water allocation. In addition to monitoring soil moisture, drones
    can assess crop health and water use efficiency through multispectral and thermal
    imaging [109,108]. By analyzing vegetation indices and thermal patterns, drones
    can identify areas of stress, disease outbreaks, or water stress in crops. This
    data aids in targeted irrigation interventions, optimizing water use, and maximizing
    crop productivity. Drone technology enables precision irrigation by providing
    real-time and site-specific information for irrigation management [110]. With
    the collected data on soil moisture, crop health, and water use efficiency, farmers
    can determine the optimal irrigation needs of different areas within a field.
    This enables precise water application, minimizing water wastage and ensuring
    efficient water use. Constraints in leveraging 4IR technologies for smart irrigation

    academia, research institutions, and extension services can facilitate knowledge
    transfer and skill development, addressing the capacity gaps and promoting the
    effective use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation practices. Integration with
    existing agricultural practices Integrating drone technology into existing agricultural
    practices requires farmers to adapt their workflows and decision-making processes
    [119,97]. Farmers need to understand how to interpret drone-generated data and
    incorporate it into their irrigation management strategies. Extension services
    and farmer-to-farmer knowledge sharing platforms play a crucial role in facilitating
    this integration. Opportunities for leveraging 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    Enhanced water use efficiency and crop yield optimization Leveraging 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation presents significant opportunities for enhancing water use
    efficiency and optimizing crop yields [121,122]. Through the integration of sensors,
    AI algorithms, and real-time data monitoring, smart irrigation systems can precisely
    assess soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop water requirements.
    This data-driven approach enables farmers to apply water resources more efficiently,
    minimizing water wastage and maximizing crop productivity. By ensuring that irrigation
    is tailored to the specific needs of crops and adapting to changing environmental
    conditions, 4IR technologies can significantly contribute to sustainable water
    management and improved agricultural outcomes. Data-driven decision-making for
    improved irrigation practices The use of 4IR technologies in smart irrigation
    facilitates data-driven decision-making processes, enabling farmers to make informed
    choices regarding irrigation practices [121]. By collecting and analyzing large
    volumes of data from various sources, such as sensors, satellites, and weather
    stations, smart irrigation systems provide valuable insights into soil conditions,
    crop water requirements, and irrigation scheduling. This wealth of information
    empowers farmers to optimize irrigation strategies, adjust watering schedules,
    and apply the right amount of water at the right time, leading to improved water
    management and increased crop productivity. Data-driven decision-making also allows
    for proactive responses to changing climate patterns and helps mitigate the risks
    associated with water scarcity and climate variability. Precision irrigation and
    resource conservation Precision irrigation, made possible by 4IR technologies,
    offers the opportunity to precisely target water delivery to crops, thereby conserving
    water resources [121]. By utilizing data from sensors, drones, and satellite imagery,
    smart irrigation systems can identify variations in soil moisture levels, plant
    water stress, and water availability across different areas of the field. This
    information enables farmers to implement site-specific irrigation, providing water
    precisely where and when it is needed. As a result, water wastage is minimized,
    and the overall water use efficiency is significantly improved. Precision irrigation
    also contributes to reducing nutrient leaching, minimizing soil erosion, and optimizing
    fertilizer application, leading to more sustainable agricultural practices. Empowering
    smallholder farmers and rural communities 4IR technologies have the potential
    to empower smallholder farmers and rural communities by democratizing access to
    information, resources, and market opportunities [123]. Through the use of mobile
    applications, remote sensing, and digital platforms, farmers can access real-time
    data on weather conditions, market prices, and best agricultural practices [124].
    This information enables them to make informed decisions, improve productivity,
    and increase their income. Additionally, 4IR technologies facilitate the integration
    of smallholder farmers into agricultural value chains, connecting them with buyers,
    financial services, and extension services. This enhanced connectivity and access
    to markets can contribute to poverty alleviation, economic growth, and the overall
    development of rural communities. Prospects of fourth industrial revolution technologies
    for smart irrigation in sub-Saharan Africa Scaling up adoption of 4IR technologies
    in smart irrigation To fully harness the potential of Fourth Industrial Revolution
    technologies in smart irrigation, it is crucial to scale up their adoption across

    Introduction Agriculture is the biggest field which consumes fresh water and electricity
    in the whole world [1], [2]. About 70% of water is used for agriculture and it
    consumes huge units of electricity, as well. Out of this, only around 25% of water
    and electricity are being consumed efficiently, and the remaining is being wasted
    away [3], [4]. Water is useful for entire process of agriculture and electricity
    is being used in various activities such as planting, sowing, spraying, weeding,
    and harvesting. So, the usage of fresh water and electricity is high, likewise,
    the wastage is also high. The optimization techniques reduce the usage of water
    and electricity [1], [2]. On the other hand, the effective usage of water increases
    crop productivity. Thus, for the efficient usage of water and electricity, optimization
    method is needed for today’s society. The trending technologies have decreased
    the water and electricity usage in various fields and it is essential in today
    world. Different electronic components, techniques, algorithms have been introduced
    by different researchers on optimization [4]. Nowadays, IoT and machine learning
    technologies, helps in many ways to decrease the energy usage and to increase
    the productivity in many fields. Few application fields of IoT and machine learning
    are, Industries, Road Transport, agriculture, Optimizations, etc. This work has
    used both IoT and machine learning for energy optimization and effective utilization
    of water in irrigation systems. IoT is the combination of interrelated devices
    such as firmware, mechanical, and few programming as well. The IoT devices are
    used to collect data, and, the collected data are being managed, using cloud computing.
    Machine learning is an automated technique that improves efficiency through past
    experience. Some of the efficient machine learning algorithms and mathematical
    models are Bayesian Statistics, KNN, Neural Network, Support Vector Machines (SVM),
    Decision Tree (DT), etc. These learning mathematical models are used to make effective
    analysis and decision-making in various applications. An article [27] has been
    introduced to automate the agriculture process as small, moderate and high to
    reduce the cost. KNN, Logistic Regression (LR) and DT algorithms have been proposed
    to handle loads of agriculture for 562 former cases. An advanced machine learning
    based agriculture for smart cultivation has been proposed [28]. In this work,
    parameters like phosphorus, rainfall, surface temperature, crop rotation have
    been taken to test performance of smart agriculture. Multiple linear regression
    was the algorithm introduced to check the performance. The IoT and Machine learning-based
    technique for energy optimization and effective utilization of irrigation systems
    has three processing layers, such as: i. Data gathering/collection and transmission
    ii. Data processing and intelligence layer iii. Application Layers The above layers
    have different functionalities and components. Data gathering and transmission
    are performed in the first stage and it collects the information from the fields
    or agricultural grounds, and transmits for data processing. For the data collection
    and processing, certain physical components (sensors) are used. The components
    of data collection and transmissions devices are, Wi-Fi or Mobile data connections,
    ZigBee Network for local area data processing, Wireless sensor Node (Single Sensor
    Node, Multiple sensors Node) for data collection from the ground and atmosphere,
    Raspberry Pi, controlling components and other physical devices, are for controlling
    the motors [5]. The second layer is data processing and intelligence. It is used
    to process the gathered data with the help of machine learning and intelligent
    techniques. Using the second layer, decision-making is performed. The third layer
    is the application layer; it receives the data from the second layer. Based on
    the second layer’s output, the third layer is planned for irrigations and optimizations
    [7]. Entire data is stored in the cloud for future planning. The layers, components
    of IoT, and machine learning algorithm for general irrigation system representations
    are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (158KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Layers and Components of irrigation system. Fig. 1 mention
    about each layer, and overall structure of data processing, which has different
    challenges. The main challenges which are related to layers and overall structure
    are as follows. i. The entire irrigation applications are not fully automated.
    ii. The integration part of each layer has different difficulties such as data
    collection from the bottom layer to transmitting to the next layers. • The integration
    of different processing layers. • Land slope measurement calculation and water
    calculation of each entire land. • Water optimization is calculated based on the
    rain, moisture, and atmosphere activity. These are the main issues of the irrigation
    system. This proposed work, considers the following issues, such as moister level
    of ground and soil of plants, land slope monitoring, and maximum utilization of
    plants, month-wise water usage, optimized usage based on power utilization. The
    topics discussed in this research paper in the subsequent sections are as follows.
    Section 2 discusses current and related work on irrigation methods, various projects
    carried for irrigations. Section 3 delves into the working methodologies, components
    based on IoT and machine learning. Section 4 contains the implementation and performance
    analysis of the proposed work along with the existing work, followed by the conclusion.

    irrigation techniques, frameworks, and models for agriculture. The second one
    is, Machine learning techniques and algorithms for irrigation system. Irrigation

    in this article. Many researchers have considered different parameters for intelligence
    irrigation systems. Authors of [6] have presented a climatology and geography
    model, with important factors such as moisture of soil, the wetness of the soil,
    monthly and daily soil moisture, weather report, evaporation of the soil are considered
    for smart irrigations. The Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) model is presented in
    [7] framework to achieve water saving, and irrigation management, based on shade
    temperature distribution of plants. In this work, water is optimized in the interval
    of time and continuously checked on the plants. The authors of [8] have presented
    an automatic irrigation technique to schedule the direct water soil management
    and with this technique, the efficiency of water utilization is improved. The
    evaporation-based techniques [9], [10] have presented a control-based scheduling
    system for irrigation. The main advantage of this method are the different parameters,
    which are considered here, such as, wind, velocity, humidity, and soil moisture,
    etc. The authors of [11] have presented a sensor-based irrigation system. In this
    system, sensors, sense the soil moisture, and the wet and dry status of soil is
    also considered. Mobile application is used to monitor, various activities of
    irrigations. The recommended system of irrigation system [12] presents various
    activities based on machine learning. In this work, regression model, Deep Neural
    Network (DNN) and GBT methods are used to increase the prediction. The accuracy
    of the prediction and recommendation are improved, and the accuracy rate of prediction,
    in various parameters is 93%. The researchers of [13] have presented an intelligence
    monitoring system using thermal images. The imaging camera is mounted on the drone
    and captures image based on various parameters, such as water requirement, leaf
    potential, non-uniform irrigation, etc. The authors of [4] have presented IoT
    and machine learning-based smart irrigation systems. Using this system, various
    parameters are calculated such as environmental parameters, various soil conditions,
    air temperature, and nearest futures are considered. The [14] have presented an
    optimized watering system for crops, using Wireless Sensor Network (WSN). The
    main aim of this work is node sensors, which are used to control and manage the

    and data are managed. Using this data, future information is calculated and predicted.
    The water management system using IoT with multi-sensor [15] presents a new technology
    with inexpensive efficient component, which is used to measure different parameters
    such as temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and rain sensors. The predicted
    output is controlled manually and automatically. The authors of [19] presented
    various monitoring and control system for irrigation system. The authors of [20],

    Inexpensive components are used to manage different parameters. Produces optimal

    In agriculture, for data prediction, and analysis, different types of machine
    learning algorithms were used. With the help of machine learning, environmental
    data, irrigation management, moisture analysis are predicted and recommended for
    the future. The work [1] introduces irrigation planning using a genetic algorithm.
    Using this work, maximize the output, and calculate various recommendations made
    for irrigations. The authors of [2] provide solutions for sequential irrigation
    issues with the help of a genetic algorithm. The proposed genetic model provides
    a solution using non-continuous scheduling. The researchers of [3] proposed a
    weekly irrigation plan with supporting data such as weather and metrological data.
    The boosted regression and classifier, which are used for data analysis, is based
    on this irrigation recommendation. With the help of this, 93% and 95 % accuracy
    are achieved in regression and classifications. The optimized irrigation allocation
    method, is introduced in [4] for location-wise demand of water. The genetic algorithm,
    which is introduced for optimizations, uses the genetic algorithm with previous
    day’s data, so, new irrigation plan is introduced. The Intelligence IoT with [5]
    KNN machine learning method is used to analyse the sensor data for planning the
    irrigation. This work is fully automated, and data is communicated from machine
    to machine. The work of [6] machine learning for farm enhancement, was introduced
    for heterogeneous data using IoT. In this work, decision trees are used to predict
    the related data for irrigation. The authors of [7] uses, logical regression to
    predict the water requirements from time to time. The works of [8], [9] decision
    tree, is use to predict the speed of the wind, temperature, and humidity. The
    SysFor [10] provides better results compared to the other decision trees and provides
    better accuracy in prediction. The irrigation demand prediction SVM [11] algorithm
    is used, but the accuracy of recommendation is very less. The related works and
    existing works of irrigations methods have various limitations. Some of the limitations
    are as follows. • The most popular works do not consider the land slope and water
    flow in the agricultural ground. • Different machine learning algorithms are used
    for prediction. But most of the works has only one classification or prediction
    algorithm which is used for moisture calculation, wind, and humidity calculation.
    So, the predictions do not provide accurate results. • Most of the works and solutions
    are manual-based. Some of the smart devices produce automation. Contributions:
    The main contributions and novelty of this work is, i. optimize the water and
    save the energy in banana agriculture using IoT devices and Machine learning algorithms.
    ii. Especially, the optimized technique is applied into banana varieties and maximum
    water and month wise usage of water is fully calculated and to indirectly reduces
    the energy usage. iii. Compared to the traditional irrigation system in banana
    agriculture, remarkable percentage of water is optimized using this proposed smart
    hybrid irrigation system. Materials and methods This work was carried out in department
    of Computer Science Engineering, Galgotias University, India. Four different algorithms
    have been taken to yield water optimization. The data is collected from real time
    Nendran variety banana cultivation in some places like Kanyakumari and Trichirapally
    of India with different epochs ranging from 12 to 72 for dataset collected from
    February 2020 to November 2021. The pre-test power (G Power) obtained is 80 %
    and alpha value is 00.5. The dataset training and testing calculation of various
    durations is listed in Table in section 4. The outcome of this proposed hybrid
    method provides an optimized solution for irrigation, energy, and increasing the
    yield of crops. Using the optimization reduces the cost of agriculture and increases
    productivity. In this proposed method, 3 algorithms have been connected and correlated
    and hence, the proposed idea would produce better performance. KNN machine learning
    algorithm has been used to sensing information of agriculture land and neighbors
    land information. To predict observation based real field results, GBT has been
    introduced appropriately. Finally the LSTM algorithm was used for ranking correlation
    among gained results. For water requirement parameters, KNN, GBT and LSTM algorithms
    have been used to predict the efficiency. Further Spearman''s rank correlation
    has been called out to make decisions. Thus this proposed idea introduces novelty
    for the dataset and thus novelty is manageable as the dataset grows. The proposed
    system and the layers are shown in Fig. 2. The proposed system has three layers.
    i. data collection and transmission layer: It is used to collect and transfer
    the data from the ground level. This layer is used in different components, to
    collect and transmit the data. ii. Data processing and intelligence: it is used
    to process the data from the first layer, and intelligence techniques are used
    to make decisions. In this layer, machine learning techniques are used to make
    the decision, and based on the decision; the irrigation planning is being done.
    iii. The application layer is used to visualize the data from the data collection
    and processing layers. The application layer continuously monitors the present,
    previous and historical data of the crop. Download : Download high-res image (175KB)

    and intelligence consists of proposed intelligence methods to process the data
    and make decision. This proposed method is performed with the help of an ensemble-based
    hybrid model. The hybrid model consists of KNN, LSTM, and GBT. The KNN is used
    to find the nearest values from the root of the plant. GBT is used to find both
    regression and classification. With the help of GBT, it can improve the real prediction
    accuracy with sufficient optimized value. The LSTM is used to predict the time
    series prediction value and with the help of time interval data it can be predicted.

    values from the predicted sensors. It is a non-parametric algorithm, and without
    any assumption, it produces the real values. The Input consists of K nearest values
    in the dataset or data, from the sources. The output of the prediction depends
    on the nearest neighbour’s distance or prediction. The output class is predicted
    using the vote of its nearest prediction. The training data of KNN has multiple
    multi-dimensional features and space in each class of the supervised label data.
    The prediction values depend upon the continuous or discrete distance of the features.
    The distance between the feature’s predictions depends on Euclidean Distance.
    The representation of nearest neighbours’ prediction with various × parameters
    is shown in equation (1). (1) Y - is the predicted output, C - is the nearest
    features, n is the number of features, w is the weight, {x1,…,xn} is the various
    weight. The distance between each feature × is defined using the Euclidean equation
    is shown in equation (2). (2) D - is the distance, n- is the number points of
    particular features ×, i - and j - are the starting and ending points. Gradient
    boosted tree The GBT regression is the machine learning algorithm for classification
    and prediction which generates a real prediction tree [17]. The gradient boosting
    is a decision tree, to a base learner. The gradient boosting combines multiple
    bases, which are, weak leaner and strong leaner, in the iteration process. The
    GBT has m-th step decision tree denoted as dm(x), to pseudo-residual. The Nm is
    the number of leaves. The decision tree is portioned into Nm, which has disjoint
    space {Sm1, Sm2,…,SNm} and prediction values of each space. The output of dm(x)
    for various input features (x) is represented in equation (3). (3) where, bmi
    are the predicted values of each space of Sim. This GBT model builds the stage-wise
    fashion and builds the optimized model in each stage. The various outputs such
    as moister, temperature, and humidity is observed at every 12 h of prediction.
    Then, the ARIMA model is used to generate time serial analysis of the various
    parameters in the time series. Using this model predict the future of various
    parameters using current and future data. The representation of the ARIMA model
    is shown in equation (4). (4) where L is the operator, ∞ is the parameters of
    autoregressive, ψ is changing parameters, θ is error rates, Xt is time-series
    data. The input data is generated using various time intervals such as 12, 24,
    36 and 48 h and based on that a real data requirement is predicted. Long short-term
    memory: The LSTM is an artificial recurrent neural network and it works on deep
    learning, it is used to classify and predict the data based on the time series.
    The LSTM consists of an Input gate, forget gate, and output gate. The cell remembers
    the time interval, and the three gates are used to control the flow of collected
    information with the help of entering and exit gates. The function of forget gate
    is represented in equation (5). (5) where, ft –forget Activation function, ht-1–
    hidden vector of previous unit t-1, xt – input unit, bf – bias parameter, sigmoid
    function. The sigmoid function values are generated between 0 and 1. 1 represents
    information is in remember and 0 represents that the information is forgotten.
    The sigmoid function is represented as S(t) in the equation. (6) The function
    for which new information is added in remember cell, is represented in equation.
    (7) The information which needs to add to the new state (Sn) is shown as. (8)
    Using this LSTM, the past 4 to 6 data has been collected simultaneously in the
    interval of 12 h. Various supportive data such as moisture, speed of wind, and
    direction are collected at 12 h interval. Hybrid model The structure of the proposed
    hybrid model flow representation is shown in Fig. 5. The structure of the proposed
    model consists of KNN, GBT, LSTM, and Spearman''s rank correlation. Using this
    correlation, the co-efficient, without assumption predicts the values at various
    time intervals. The model is designed with the same configuration in three different
    places for data collection and processing. So, the model of linear, with non-parametric
    parameters is collected frequency in the different distribution. The non-parametric
    values are calculated by correlation co-efficient in 12 h’ time interval, every
    day. The data is collected at 12 PM and 12 because during FN the moisture range
    is changed according to different climatic conditions, so easily it can predict
    the real and requested data. The structure of the proposed workflow consists of
    three types of models that predict the non-parametric values at the same time
    and is ranked using Spearman''s rank correlation (SRC). The observed values are
    ranked using co-efficient and correlation functions. Download : Download high-res

    is a relationship between machine learning algorithms KNN and GBT with Spearman''s
    rank correlation since predicted value is correlated with real value of water
    irrigation. Results In the experimental and data analysis, the Banana (Musa) crop
    irrigation data is being used. Different varieties of banana specifications are
    represented by the national horticulture board of India [18]. In this work, Nendran
    variety cultivation fields are used to collect the data, because it requires large
    amount of water. Data is being collected from the southern part of India, Kanyakumari
    (8.2604° N, 77.2671° E). Two major reasons for choosing this location. i. Nature
    of soil, which supports different types of crop culture, and the climate condition,
    also changes dynamically, each and every month. ii. In this location, different
    types of banana crops are cultivated. Basic data requirements are collected with
    the help of farmers and the National Research Centre for Banana, Tiruchirappalli,
    India. Basic water requirements, number of nodes and duration of cultivation,
    and other parameters for Nendran variety are shown in Table 3. Table 3. The basic

    The data is collected from two zones of cultivation fields and of two cultures.
    The requirements and other data are collected from Feb 2020 to Nov 2020 and Feb

    data splitation is also shown in Table 5. The min–max scale is performed using
    equation no. (9) where, Min, Max is the feature, which ranges between the minimum
    and maximum values. The coefficient of determination (R2) and root-mean-square
    error (RMSE) are used to predict the variation and value observations. Table 5.

    section may be divided by subheadings. It should provide a concise and precise
    description of the experimental results, their interpretation, as well as the
    experimental conclusions that can be drawn. In this work, each epoch, has the
    best model data, which is calculated from the two different cultivation fields,
    and best-optimized data is observed, using, Spearman correlation. The variance
    and observation of the best consolidated data model are calculated using R2 and
    RMSE. In this hybrid model, the KNN algorithm is used to predict the nearest parameter
    values and the other two models GBT and LSTM are used to predict the requirements
    of water. The epochs are calculated based on the 12, 24, 36, and 48-hours intervals.
    The coefficient of GBT and Spearman correlation in 12 and 24 h is 0.72 and 0.78
    which is comparatively more as R2 was achieved as 0.70 [7]. The LSTM spearman
    correlation is 0.68 to 0.72. The hybrid model of zone 1 and zone 2 values are
    calculated and consolidated in 12 h time intervals. The R2 values and RMSE values
    were also predicted in 12 h duration and the consolidated values are shown in
    Table 6. The R2 values of GBT and LSTM ranges between 0.93 and 0.99 and 0.92 and
    0.99 and once again more almost 20 to 20 percentage [7]. Therefore, no major difference
    between GBT and LSTM values in terms of variance in zone 1 and zone 2. Similarly,
    the RMSE values of GBT and LSTM are 0.23 to 0.7 and 0.22 to 0.6 in prediction
    in zone 1 and 2 when compare with existing work, RMSE is efficient [7]. The consolidated
    values of the prediction of various epochs are shown in Table 6. The combination
    LSTM and GBT is similar in performance to zone 1 and 2, during different time
    intervals. Similarly, the performance time (PT) of LSTM and GBT ranges of zone
    1 and 2 are 12 s to 39 s per epoch [8], [9]. Finally the Spearman correlation
    is decreasing with number of epochs increasing where as the R2, RMSE and PT were
    increasing with number of epochs increasing. Table 6. Spearman correlation, R2,

    Month-wise Water optimization in 2020 and 2021. The water requirement and water
    optimization of 2020 and 2021 calculated with the help of minimum requirements
    (40 Liters) of water for cultivation. In the starting of the cultivation (Feb
    2020 and 2021) the water requirements is very less because the root length of
    banana tree is very less in initial stages. But after one month the water requirements
    is increased automatically. The second and third month wise the root of the banana
    tree is increased and spreads surrounding. So automatically the requirements of
    water increased up to 6 to 7 months. The last two month of the cultivation again
    the requirements of water reduced, because the nip of the root is decomposing,
    so automatically again water observation is reduced. In the prediction of water
    requirements of two cultivations, as per Fig. 6 (A) and Fig. 7(B) requirements
    the rain fall is very less in 2020. So water requirements of tree are increased.
    But in 2021, initially the rain fall is less but last three months the rainfall
    is high in cultivated location. So the water requirements are 0 in last three
    month of cultivation in 2021. The entire water requirements and optimized water
    of single tree banana cultivation (2020 and 2021) are shown in Table 8. The 2020
    single tree requirement of water is 273 and optimized water of single tree is
    127, so 31.14 percentage of water is optimized for single tree [15]. Similarly,
    2021 due to heavy rain in that cultivation around 50.1 percentage of water is
    optimized [20]. Due to this water optimization, indirectly the energy usage also
    reduced. Table 8. Water requirement and optimization of 2020 and 2021 cultivation

    Water in 2021 26 6 0 4 6 14 28 40 40 40 The results of all the parameters such
    R2, RMSE and PT were compared with existing works [7], [15], [20] for performance
    evaluation. It is very clear that R2 is best with the proposed approach with considerable
    gain. The work [7] claimed more RMSE with agriculture cultivation with IOT and
    thus proposed work is best suited dynamically. Finally work [20] measured the
    PT of agriculture time and it is compared with proposed work and claimed considerably
    less time than existing work. Spearman''s rank is used to correlate the real and
    time series values of water irrigation after receiving predictions. In Kanyakumari
    (8.2604° N, 77.2671° E), two weather based climate seasons are introduced, but
    if only one climate based location for which this proposed solution is proposed
    then certainly some changes have to be made to reduce water usage and thereby
    increase in efficiency. Conclusion and future work In this work, proposed hybrid
    model used to predict and forecast the requirement of irrigation using various
    parameters. The proposed method has built using KNN, GBT, LSTM and Spearman''s
    rank correlation algorithms. The KNN is used to collect different parameters with
    the help of sensors. The GBT is used to predict the real requirements of water
    at the specific time and the LSTM is used to predict the time series wise predict
    the requirements in the different time intervals. Using Spearman''s rank correlation
    the predicted and forecasted data is consolidated and sent to decision making.
    The combination of GBT and LSTM the real time series data is forecasted as various
    time intervals. With the help of the forecasted data, a month wise and entire
    cultivation requirement is for single node is calculated. For implementation of
    proposed work is done with the help of banana species and month- wise requirement
    of water and entire cultivation requirement for one banana tree or node is calculated
    in the year of 2020 and 2021. With the help of experimentation of entire cultivation
    of 2020 the entire water requirements is 273 and optimized water is 127. The 31.14
    % of water usage is reduced using the various parameters. Similarly, 2021 cultivation
    also around 50.1 percentage of water is optimized. Hence this work is achieved
    a novelty for water optimization and it could be used in many applications such
    as paddy, banana, sugercane, corrot cultivations in India and abroad with ranges
    of moisture and heat. Since, this work has introduced optimization of water usage
    for irrigation systems and certainly the novelty of efficient water usage proved.
    Thus the proposed work might be best suited in the irrigation system of hot land
    areas, step down agriculture of hills, and some rainy based agriculture cultivation
    systems. Finally when the external interference, and climate of location are being
    varies then optimization is also change considerably since difference locations
    have different moisture as key parameters. Also if noise of signal is considerably
    more then it also affect the water optimization. There would be direct and indirect
    correlation between performances of this proposed work with respect to climate
    changes in respective areas. The performance would be slightly more if the weather
    of land changes cold and performance would be slightly less if the area keeps
    hot than ordinary. It may be noticed that, is there any internal factor which
    reduces or increases the water efficiency for irrigation. The factors are sunny
    and rainy. The external factor rainy will be reducing the requirements of water
    in irrigation and another factor sunny will be increasing the requirements of
    water in irrigation. Usually wind will be changing the climate slightly to cool
    the environment, certainly increasing the efficiency of the irrigation system.
    In future work, ensemble and unsupervised learning algorithms are recommended
    to improve the accuracy of prediction and better decision making which could introduced
    deep prediction and might solve the issues of signal of noise and other external
    interfences. The water flow and land slop also considered for better prediction
    of requirement of irrigation system. In future, this work would be extended with
    introducing automation of irrigation and its algorithm would be coined. Also there
    is chance to introducing security of water pouring would be extended to strengthen
    this work. Auto irrigation systems will be implemented as future work and parameters
    considered here are moisture and humidity based rainy and sunny climate. CRediT

    2030 agenda for sustainable development to address the economic component of sustainable
    development goal (SDG) target 6.4, More Crop Per Drop happens to be the universal
    motto for using water more efficiently in the agricultural sector. A fool-proof,
    transparent, integrated approach across different governing sectors is essential
    to optimally allocate the limited available resources amid the competing agricultural
    activities. This study has attempted to integrate a linear programming model on
    a geospatial platform to develop a spatial decision support and management system
    for integrated command area management. The study shows that the geospatial approach
    enhances the visualization of conventional optimization outputs under different
    irrigation efficiencies and fixed water allocation conditions. The geomatic model
    highlights water-stressed regions with 45% and optimal cropping patterns at 57%
    irrigation efficiency. The spatial optimization technique suggests geographic
    distribution of optimal cropping patterns to attain more agricultural productivity
    per unit of water. Introduction In India, 60.43% of the land area is occupied
    by agriculture (WorldBank and FAO 2018). India is the largest producer of pulses
    and the second-largest producer of rice and cotton (FAO 2018a). Agriculture in
    India is resource-intensive and regionally influenced, leading to sustainability
    issues. Although 80% of India’s water resources are used in agriculture, most
    are unregulated and lack water use efficiency (Dave 2019). One of the significant
    challenges in the agricultural segment is enhancing productivity per unit of water.
    Modernizing irrigation and drainage management systems (Daniel et al. 2007) and
    prioritizing schemes that promote more efficient water delivery mechanisms with
    considerable agricultural benefits (Palanisami et al. 2011) would increase the
    water use efficiency. In many countries, improvements in irrigation infrastructure
    through modernization and automation with real-time control for optimization in
    irrigation water management have demonstrated water savings (Camilo et al. 2018;
    Richard and Philip 2018; Shaughnessy et al. 2016; Wahlin and Zimbelman 2018).
    Optimization models are used in irrigation water management for water allocation
    problems and economics associated with maximizing net agricultural returns. Among
    various optimization models, linear programming (LP) models are among the simplest
    models for optimization formulation in evaluating irrigation systems (Daghighi
    et al. 2017; Gong et al. 2020). Several researchers over time have used LP methods
    to optimize cropping patterns with the availability of limited water resources
    and command area constraints (Difallah et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018; Osama et al.
    2017; Singh 2015; Zhang and Guo 2015). It is evident from research studies that
    optimization models in irrigation systems can provide judicious water supply management
    strategies. However, optimal solutions for the desired reliability in irrigation
    resource management are not amenable for routine optimization methods because
    of the complexities involved. The models attain limitations for significant multidimensional
    real-world problems with massive data inputs. In irrigation water management models,
    constraints and variables proliferate, making it difficult for decision-makers
    and water managers to make field-level judgments. Moreover, traditional models
    typically provide the optimum solution in numerical forms, which is a major setback
    when viewing the findings in a graphical mode and allocating resources geographically.
    Hence, there is a need for a rigorous mathematical model with advanced tools to
    offer geospatial results. India’s irrigation water use efficiency is 46% lower
    than the world’s average, i.e.,  0.41 USD / m 3 compared to 0.6 USD / m 3 globally
    (FAO 2018b). Increasing agricultural water productivity is thus an important strategy
    for improving water use efficiency, especially in agriculturally dependent countries
    (FAO 2021). In India, a comprehensive action plan is framed by the National Institution
    for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog to implement four goals set under the Prime
    Minister’s Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) scheme of the government. The four
    components are the Accelerated Irrigation Benefits Programme (AIBP), Har Khet
    ko Pani (Water for Every Farm), Per Drop More Crop, and Watershed Development
    (NITIAayog 2017). Irrigation system efficiency plays a pivotal role in allocating
    water resources for the command. The component Per Drop More Crop aims explicitly
    at improving water-use efficiency using suitable water conveyance and promoting
    precision water application strategies to produce more output per unit of water.
    Under the Jal Sanrakshan task, the scheme promotes the adoption of a suitable
    cropping pattern to obtain maximum benefits with the use of available water. On
    similar lines, the National Water Mission under the National Action Plan on Climate
    Change has set one of the five goals as increasing water use efficiency by 20%.
    The overall irrigation project efficiency in developed countries is 50%–60%. The
    efficiency of the surface irrigation system in India is about 35%–40% (ICAR 2019).
    This has led to water supply issues to the tail end reaches of the command area.
    Hence, it is planned to improve the project irrigation efficiency to 50%–60% by
    implementing PMKSY objectives. Under the AIBP scheme, 99 irrigation projects have
    been prioritized on a national level to implement canal automation systems to
    modernize irrigation system operations under the PMKSY program. Although national
    policies promote plans to improve water use efficiency, there are a few shortcomings
    in the integrated approach. It is also well understood that increasing water use
    efficiency does not increase agricultural productivity per unit of land by itself.
    The economic yield of crops and land use efficiency are additional governing factors
    that convince farmers’ expectations as end-users (Levidow et al. 2014; Singh et
    al. 2008). Despite government efforts, the trade-off between farmers’ aspirations
    and national-level policies happens to be a vital issue. At an individual level,
    it may not be optimal for both farmers and administrations. But augmenting the
    necessary parameters, such as farmers’ benefits, productivity per unit of water,
    and equitable water distribution, will bring overall prosperity as envisaged in
    several government schemes in the irrigation sector without redundancy. Hence,
    it is necessary to incorporate farmers’ level information, aspirations, and agricultural
    market statistics into the decision-making model apart from the water management
    strategies for the holistic, sustainable, and more profitable development of the
    command area (Salman et al. 2001). To achieve optimal allocation and integrated
    management of resources, optimization at the farm level with village-level outreach
    is required (García-Vila and Fereres 2012). In such cases, the combination of
    a decision support system with a geographic information system (GIS) and a database
    management system, more popularly known as a spatial decision support and management
    system (SDSMS), is suitable for making land-use–based decisions (Barton et al.
    2004). An SDSMS accommodates and handles large geographical data and an archive
    of nonspatial information that is used in the potential models programmed within
    the system for geoprocessing functions and, thus, facilitates spatial decision-making.
    An SDSMS can incorporate farm-level inputs, the basics of an optimization model,
    net agricultural returns, water availability, system efficiencies, and several
    other parameters of interest. SDSMS are built by customization on a case-to-case
    basis, depending upon the governing factors of the model and required outputs.
    This research considers a typical irrigation project in an arid region to demonstrate
    the integrated geospatial methodology. The Narayanapura left bank canal (NLBC)
    irrigation system is one of the top listed projects in the country and the first
    in the state of Karnataka to be identified as a benchmarking project to improve
    water use efficiency and canal water management. To accomplish this, supervisory
    control and data acquisition canal automation and modernization under the AIBP
    scheme of PMKSY are implemented along with canal lining works. Earlier, in the
    NLBC irrigation project, in the absence of proper regulating arrangements in the
    distribution system, the upstream reaches utilized excess water, resulting in
    the tail end not getting enough water. To increase the water-use efficiency and
    mechanized distribution of water in the command area, an automation system comprised
    of SCADA operated through a GIS-based irrigation network management information
    system (INMIS) was undertaken. However, the mechanism to optimally allocate water
    resources based on volumetric assessment at outlets is lagging in this system.
    Apart from haphazard water management, poor irrigation efficiency owing to surface
    irrigation methods is leading to low or no canal water left in the lower part
    of the command. Despite SCADA operations and canal lining works, improper canal
    water management has led to water stress regions in the command. Hence, it is
    necessary to frame optimized strategic management and the redistribution of allocated
    water resources to achieve the maximum cultivable command area using SDSMS tools.
    In order to ascertain the points that are of prime importance from the goals of
    having more farmed areas per unit of water, optimal water distribution, and maximizing
    net agricultural returns, this study is planned with a threefold objective. The
    first step is to create SDSMS integrating ground records of land from the land
    parcel information system (LPIS) and existing canal networks with outlets from
    INMIS. In the second objective, when the SDSMS holds hybrid data about farmers’
    land and irrigation supply systems, an optimization model is developed within
    SDSMS to perform geospatial operations. Then, the optimization results within
    SDSMS are linked with farmers’ land to provide spatial results based on different
    iterations. Lastly, the overall geospatial results are validated with the values
    derived from conventional optimization outcomes. In the current study, an attempt
    has been made to build an SDSMS using INMIS and LPIS to visualize the optimization
    results on a spatial platform. The method adapted by the authors will be able
    to integrate all influencing parameters at a micro level, thus aiding the assessment
    of results feasible for implementation by stakeholders. The results would provide
    greater information on a spatial scale for the policymakers to take necessary
    decisions to devise an appropriate cropping pattern and optimize the water use
    efficiency of the projects located in water-scarce regions of India and other
    countries. Study Area and Methodology The study area is located in Hunasgi Taluk
    of Yadgir District in Karnataka State. More than 75% of the entire geographical
    area of Karnataka, including interior regions, witnesses arid to semiarid climate.
    The study area chosen lies in the arid region of Karnataka. The demonstration
    area in this research is a command of 2,764.78 ha) under distributary-8 of the
    Narayanapura Irrigation Project. The irrigation project lies in the drought-prone
    region of the state where there is limited water availability. Hence, the water
    allocation for the command is also limited. The irrigation project has gained
    national-level importance to improve the water-use efficiency and productivity
    per unit of water. The area of interest extends from longitude 76° 18’ 44.7″E
    to 76° 45’ 56.2″E and latitude 16° 13’ 22.1″N to 16° 39’ 52.2″N (Fig. 1). The
    study area falls under northeastern dry agro-climatic zone 2 in India. The annual
    rainfall varies from 633.2 to 806.6 mm (Ramachandra et al. 2004). The distributary
    runs for the length of 10.680 km with a design discharge of 1.357 m 3 / s , and
    there are 10 lateral outlets with varying discharges from 0.017 m 3 / s to 0.459
    m 3 / s . The distributary is a contour canal, and the command area extends on
    the left bank up to the valley. The study area has four major crops from the revenue
    records: paddy, jowar, cotton, and pulses. The command is cultivated extensively
    during the Kharif season. Fig. 1. Index map of the study area. SDSMS Framework
    The spatial decision support and management system is a computer-aided graphical
    user interface system that can assist decision-makers in solving and managing
    complex spatial problems (Densham 2021). It comprises an extensive database of
    nonspatial data in conjunction with related spatial layers, such as land use and
    transportation networks. The flowchart in developing an SDSMS for integrated command
    area management for this study is shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Algorithm of geospatial
    optimization process using SDSMS. Land Parcel Information System The LPIS is a
    geospatial layer developed by creating a spatial database of beneficiary land
    parcels from the irrigation network in relation to the distributary main canal,
    laterals, and outlets. Land parcels are digitized from field-based revenue survey
    maps published by the Public Revenue Department of Survey, Settlement, and Land
    Records with high-resolution satellite imagery as base maps. The attributes for
    each land parcel are attached from the Records of Rights, Tenancy, and Crops (RTC)
    from BHOOMI (a land records management system by the Government of Karnataka).
    Essential information, such as crop cultivation history, soil type, total land
    extent, wasteland extent, and the cultivable land extent, is extracted from RTC
    and attached to individual land parcels based on a unique code and survey number.
    A vector-based analysis is more suitable because the farmers-based digital plots
    information system can be represented at its original resolution and form with
    multiple attribute information. Whereas, in the case of Raster-based analysis,
    the cell size determines the resolution at which data is represented and inherently
    reflects only one attribute or characteristic for an area. Raster-based operations
    are more often an outcome of remote sensing data products. Because most field
    data, such as land parcels, are in vector form, raster data conversion was not
    required. However, the accurate geographic location of data is maintained in vector
    form for efficient encoding of topology. As a result, more efficient operations
    can be carried out using vector-based GIS operations. Hence, in this study, the
    spatial analysis is carried out based on vector-based operations. Irrigation Network
    and Management Information System Another important spatial layer complimenting
    LPIS is the irrigation network geospatial database. The NLBC automation project
    hosting SCADA-based water regulatory irrigation structures is geographically mapped
    as the Irrigation Network and Management System (Sidharth and Loliyana 2019).
    Vital information about canal design discharges from the main canal to laterals,
    the hierarchy of the canal network, outlet discharges and locations, dimensional
    details, and the status of canal lining are attached in INMIS. Using INMIS, field
    data, contours, and drainage maps for the study area, the land parcels are grouped
    to each discharge outlet of INMIS. Nonspatial Data Nonspatial data such as evapotranspiration
    and crop coefficients are collected from a regional publication from the India
    Meteorological Department for agro-climatic zone 2. In addition, rainfall records
    of 58 years (1960–2017) are collected from the Karnataka State Natural Disaster
    Monitoring Centre and Water Resources Development Organization (WRDO) for nine
    influencing rain gauges in and around the command area. The average rainfall data
    over the command area is determined by drawing isohyets. The nonspatial data are
    used in CROPWAT version 8.0 software to arrive at net irrigation requirements
    (NIR) for each crop and gross irrigation requirements (GIR) for the optimal cropping
    pattern in the study area are computed within the optimization model for various
    combinations of irrigation efficiencies. Formulation of Optimization Model The
    major outcomes from spatial inputs are the parameters such as water allocation
    in the irrigation network from INMIS, the total cultivable command area, existing
    cropping patterns from LPIS, and collateral inputs, such as irrigation water requirements
    and net agricultural returns to optimize the available resources. A robust geospatial
    tool needs to retrieve large data from spatial layers and execute optimization
    on a spatial platform. In recent times, Python has emerged as a well-established
    powerful scripting and supported high-level programming language with an emphasis
    on rapid development. It has been infused into several GIS software such as ArcGIS
    and QGIS to automate geoprocessing tasks and handle large datasets. Data types,
    functions, and statements can be used in Python scripts to build geoprocessing
    tasks. PuLP is one of the Python libraries that can be used to develop linear
    optimization models in the Python programming environment (Barton et al. 2004;
    Mitchell et al. 2011). In this study, Python tools such as ArcPython version 2.7.12
    and PuLP version 1.4.6 are integrated into ArcGIS ArcMap version 10.5 software
    to utilize the potential of reading spatial land parcel information systems for
    optimization analysis and for preparing in-house optimization models in the SDSMS.
    Conventionally, linear optimization can be carried out using simple mathematical
    programming software, such as LINGO, MATLAB, or even Solver. In this study, LINGO
    18.0 was used to obtain optimal results for resource allocation, and the results
    were compared with those of the spatial optimization in SDSMS for validation.
    The linear programming model for both conventional and geospatial approaches is
    executed with the following objective functions, variables, and constraints. Objective
    Function The objective functions in this study are • to maximize net agricultural
    returns [Eq. (1)], • to maximize theutilization of land resources [Eq. (2)], and
    • to maximize the utilization of allocated water [Eq. (3)] Max Z n b = N B p a
    × A p a + N B c o × A c o + N B j o × A j o + N B p u × A p u (1) Max Z i r =
    A p a + A c o + A j o + A p u (2) Max Z w r = W R p a × A p a + W R c o × A c
    o + W R j o × A j o + W R p u × A p u (3) Variables The variables in this optimization
    model are the extents under each of the crops [Eqs. (4) and (5)] A p a , A c o
    , A j o , A p u (4) A x = Σ a i x (5) where A x = total cultivable command area
    under crop x ; a i x = land parcel area of individual farmers under x crop, and
    x can be paddy, cotton, jowar, or pulses crop. Constants Constants are as follows:
    • Water availability constraint [Eq. (6)]: the major constraint is water availability.
    The operating design canal discharge for the command is 1.357 m 3 / s . Therefore,
    the total maximum water allocation is collected from project authorities based
    on canal discharge for the entire base period of the existing cropping pattern
    W R p a × A p a + W R c o × A c o + W R j o × A j o + W R p u × A p u ≤ Waterallocation
    (6) where W R p a / c o / j o / p u = gross irrigation requirement for respective
    crops. • Land availability constraint [Eq. (7)]: the land availability constraint
    is fixed to the upper limit of the cultivable command area. Additionally, the
    land availability at the microlevel is the total extent of land parcels available
    with individual farmers. Therefore, the total cultivable command area on the gross
    level, 2,655.7 ha-m, is the upper limit for land availability constraint A p a
    + A c o + A j o + A p u ≤ C C A (7) • Area of individual crop constraint [Eq.
    (8)]: the variables A x are subjected to upper and lower limits in the optimization
    model. The limits are varied in different percentages, and the results are analyzed.
    Hence, the area of individual cropland parcels is subjected to the following limits
    − y % × Σ a i x ≤ A x ≤ + y % × Σ a i x (8) where A x = total cultivable command
    area under crop x (an outcome of optimization); a i x = existing land parcels
    area of individual farmers under x crop, obtained from the attribute data of the
    land parcel information system; y% = permissible limits of variation of existing
    cropping area in percentage; and x can be paddy, cotton, jowar, or pulses crop.
    • Other nonzero constraints [Eq. (9)]: the cropping pattern should have minimum
    limits for each crop and should be greater than zero A x > 0 (9) where A x = total
    cultivable area under crop x (an outcome of optimization). Constants Constants
    are as follows: • Crop water requirements: the crop net irrigation requirements
    were computed from CROPWAT software for each crop using the regionally published
    evapotranspiration data, crop coefficient, observed rainfall, and practicing crop
    period. For computing the gross irrigation requirement (GIR), the project scheme
    irrigation efficiency ( e ) is taken as 45% for the existing conditions. Subsequently,
    optimum irrigation efficiency is computed during different trials using combinations
    of irrigation methods. The scheme irrigation efficiency is the product of conveyance
    efficiency ( e c ) and field application efficiency ( e a ) (Brouwer et al. 1989).
    Conveyance efficiency for existing canal-lined conditions is 75% (CWC 2014), with
    an application efficiency of 60% for the surface irrigation method (Brouwer et
    al. 1989). The application efficiency of microirrigation methods, such as sprinkler
    irrigation, is 75%, and drip irrigation is 90% (Brouwer et al. 1989). Water requirements
    of crops are denoted by W R p a for paddy; W R c o for cotton; W R j o = for jowar;
    and W R p u for pulses. • Net agricultural returns: the average net agricultural
    returns for the individual crops are considered for the Yadgir district of the
    Karnataka state of India. The net agricultural returns are based on estimates
    of the cost of cultivation/production and related agricultural market data of
    principal crops in India (GoI 2018). The net agricultural benefits for each crop
    are abbreviated with N B p a for paddy; N B c o for cotton; N B j o for jowar;
    and N B p u for pulses. Analysis and Results Data Inputs for Optimization The
    data inputs are as follows: • Land parcel based information system: using LPIS,
    cultivated extents of landholdings under each farmer as per the official records
    from BHOOMI are obtained on a spatial platform. The LPIS shows that the major
    crop in the command area is paddy, followed by pulses, jowar, and cotton [Fig.
    5(a) and Table 1]. The soil is predominantly black cotton soil (vertisols). •
    Irrigation network: the INMIS has the geospatial layer of the irrigation network
    in the command area. There are 10 demand nodes where the SCADA gates are installed
    as a part of the lateral take-off and are plotted in the canal network map labeled
    as L1 to L10, as shown in Fig. 3. The land parcels in LPIS are grouped into subcommands
    under each lateral outlet (Fig. 3). The area under each subcommand is given in
    Table 2. Grouping of land parcel aids in visualizing geospatial optimization results
    to the outlet level. • Crop water requirements: nonspatial data, such as evapotranspiration,
    are crop coefficients for agro-climatic zone 2 and are shown in Table 3. The average
    rainfall for the command area is calculated by drawing isohyetal maps for every
    fortnight and monthly monsoon and on an annual basis. The results for the fortnightly
    average rainfall over the command area are shown in Table 3. The average monsoon
    rainfall is 388.03 mm, and the average annual rainfall is 571.46 mm. • The NIR
    from CROPWAT is found to be 561.9 mm for cotton, 672.9 mm for paddy, 170.8 mm
    for jowar, and 155.7 mm for pulses. The GIR per hectare is 1,249 mm for cotton,
    380 mm for jowar, 1,495 mm for paddy, and 346 mm for pulses for 45% irrigation
    system efficiency. The GIR for different irrigation efficiencies are computed
    within the optimization model using NIR. • Water availability: the total collective
    base period considered in the command area is 199 days, including cotton, jowar,
    paddy, and pulses. The allocated water for the distributary based on a design
    discharge of 1.357 m 3 / s is 2,403.518 ha-m. It is worth noting that the supply
    discharge cannot go above the design discharge for any cropping pattern. Hence,
    water availability constraint is limited. • Net agricultural returns: individual
    crops are computed based on the yield of crops as per the Karnataka agriculture
    price commission, the cost of cultivation/production from the central agriculture
    price commission data, and the agricultural market prices from Krishimaratavahini
    (an agri-market portal) from the Government of Karnataka during the years 2017–2020.

    18.0 software to obtain optimal results for resource allocation with the following
    inputs for the existing conditions at e = 45 % . In addition, this trial was used
    to validate the spatial optimization results. • Objective functions: The objective
    functions are as stated in Eqs. (1)–(3). Constraints The constraints are as follows:
    • Water constraint [Eq. (10)] W R p a × A p a + W R c o × A c o + W R j o × A
    j o + W R p u × A p u ≤ 2403.518 ha - m (10) • Land availability constraint [Eq.
    (11)] A p a + A c o + A j o + A p u ≤ 2655.71 ha (11) • Upper and lower limits
    of optimal cropping pattern [Eq. (12)] − y % × Σ a i x ≤ A x ≤ + y % × Σ a i x
    (12) Constants The constraints are as follows: • W R p a = 1.495 m ; W R c o =
    1.249 m ; W R j o = 0.380 ; and W R p u = 0.346 m . • ₹ N B p a = ₹ 46,218 ; ₹
    N B c o = ₹ 21,962 ; ₹ N B j o = ₹ 10,570 ; and ₹ N B p u = ₹ 28,777 . • y % =
    0.01 , 0.03, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.30, 0.35, 0.40, 0.45, and 0.50. •
    Σ a i p a = 1596.76 ha ; Σ a i c o = 312.04 ha ; Σ a i j o = 323.02 ha ; and Σ
    a i p u = 423.89 ha . Optimization Results The optimization trials are executed
    for incremental percentage change of upper and lower limits in the existing area
    (%y) starting with ± 1 % up to ± 50 % change. Finally, the results are tabulated
    in Table 4 to observe the changes in the total cropping area and the overall benefits
    from the optimized command area for different percentage limits. Table 4. Linear
    optimization results for maximization of net benefits Percentage change in existing
    area (1) CCA (ha) (2) Total benefits (million INR) (3) 10 — Infeasible solution

    It is observed that under the constraint of water allocation of 2,403.518 ha-m,
    the net benefits gained from the optimized command area vary proportionately as
    percentage limits are increased (Table 4). The optimization returns infeasible
    solutions for less than 22% of changes in the existing cropping pattern. It is
    found that by only starting at 22% ceiling limits for changes in existing cropping
    patterns, the global optimal results are observed. However, considering the farmers’
    monocropping tradition (GoI 2016), the deviation in the optimized area must be
    kept to a minimum compared to the existing cropping pattern. As a result, the
    optimal cropping pattern with 22% is deemed practicable in order to prevent significant
    alterations to the existing pattern. Accordingly, the net returns from the command
    are 77.37 million Indian rupees. The area that could be irrigated with 45% irrigation
    efficiency is only 2,150.64 ha. Geospatial Optimization Approach Scenario 1: At
    the Existing Irrigation Efficiency of 45% This scenario is carried out to validate
    the results of spatial optimization with conventional optimization results so
    that further optimization trials can be carried out for different options in the
    geospatial platform. The analysis shows that at 22% of changes in the existing
    cropping pattern, the values obtained from both spatial optimization and conventional
    optimization are the same (Table 4 and Column 3 of Table 5). Table 5. Results

    96,854,590.00 Total water utilized (ha-m) — 2,403.52 2,403.52 In general, geospatial
    optimization also provides similar results as conventional optimization models
    but with an added advantage of cartographic visualization and rapid combinatorial
    optimization trials for various options of decision-making. The SDSMS optimization
    model considers all objectives equally important. The goals include supplying
    canal water to irrigate the entire command area, optimally redistributing the
    allocated water supply to avoid water stress regions, and also returning maximum
    benefits from the command area. Because the water availability is already allocated
    to the sector, there are equitable canal water distribution issues due to unplanned
    existing cropping patterns in the system. As such, the maximum utilization of
    the water objective ( Z w r ) is already saturated. The existing situation also
    indicates that their maximum utilization of the land objective ( Z i r ) cannot
    reach 100% with the surface irrigation method’s efficiency. However, the objective
    function of the maximum net benefits ( Z n b ) is worked out for every iteration
    and desired to be maximum. Considering low irrigation efficiency (45%), the allocated
    water supplies would be insufficient, leading to water-stressed regions. The geospatial
    model proposes optimal cropping patterns within the supply reaches [which would
    be less than 100% of the cultivable command area (CCA)] highlight the water-stressed
    regions of tail end reaches [Fig. 5(b)] and obtains maximum possible net benefits.
    At the existing irrigation efficiency of 45%, it is found that only 81% (2,150.65
    ha) of the cultivable command area can be cultivated for the allocated water of
    2,403.518 ha-m. At this stage, the net agricultural returns are 77.37 million
    Indian rupees. The irrigation potential generated is 0.89 ha per ha-m of water.
    The cropping pattern from the spatial optimization is as shown in Columns 3 and
    4 of Table 5 for different irrigation efficiencies. Scenario 2: To Find Optimal
    Irrigation Efficiency Multiple trials are carried out to find the optimal irrigation
    efficiency with percentage changes to existing cropping patterns versus changes
    in irrigation efficiency, and the results are plotted in Fig. 4. Under the prevailing
    irrigation methods and canal network design capacity, it was found that any irrigation
    efficiency below 57% will reduce the existing cropping intensity up to 81% in
    CCA at 45% system efficiency (Column 3 of Table 5 and Fig. 4). Fig. 4. Plot showing
    %y (minimum) versus e and corresponding net benefits and percentage of CCA irrigated.
    To attain 100% farming in the cultivable command area, the required workable irrigation
    efficiency is 57%. To reach overall irrigation system efficiency of 57%, the conveyance
    efficiency ( e c ) is to be at 75% [the Central Water Commission (CWC) has proposed
    75%] for lined canals and the weighted sum of field application efficiency ( e
    a ) at 76% for the optimized cropping pattern. An optimized combination of sprinkler
    methods for pulses and sorghum, drip irrigation for cotton, and surface methods
    for paddy is suggested to achieve 76% field application efficiency. It should
    also be observed that the change in cropping patterns required to achieve the
    global optimum is just a 5% change of the current pattern. Therefore, this combination
    provides the maximum benefits of 96.85 M Indian rupees from the command, complete
    cultivation of the CCA (100%), and the full utilization of allocated water of
    2,403.518 ha-m. The irrigation potential generated is 1.10 ha per ha-m of water.
    Cartographic Results The SDSMS provides geospatial results for the optimization
    models within the platform. The optimization model accounts for the travel distance
    of water delivery and allocates the optimal cropping pattern. In this study, at
    a 45% irrigation efficiency, the SDSMS proposes the optimal cropping pattern,
    and tail-end water stress regions are shown in Fig. 5(b). A total of 19% of the
    cultivable command area is affected by water supply issues with low irrigation
    system efficiency (Column 3 of Table 5). Furthermore, utilizing the SDSMS database,
    58 land parcels with water supply issues as tail-end water users are identified,
    and their information can be retrieved. This trial also shows the extended capabilities
    of geospatial optimization to identify water-stressed regions in the command area
    to farm-level. Fig. 5. (a) Existing cropping pattern; (b) optimized cropping pattern
    at e = 45 % ; and (c) optimized cropping pattern at e = 57 % . When the SDSMS
    optimization model determines the optimum irrigation efficiency based on the cropping
    pattern with suitable microirrigation methods, the findings reveal a 57% efficiency.
    In this scenario, the model geographically distributes the optimized cropping
    pattern with just 5% changes to the original cropping pattern [Fig. 5(c)]. The
    optimal cropping plan is generated considering the geographical location of the
    landholding, irrigation supply conveyance distance, and canal distance. Accordingly,
    the SDSMS optimally redistributes the allocated water at every demand node L1
    to L10 for different scenarios. Considering the previous system, the unplanned
    cropped areas require more water than the irrigation system is designed to provide.
    The unplanned cropping pattern has an irrigation demand of 3,046.59 ha-m (Table
    6) out of a total water allocation of 2,401.77 ha-m, leading to water stress conditions.
    The geospatial model irrigates the same extent of the cultivated command area
    of 2,655.71 ha with an optimized cropping pattern (Column 4 of Table 5) while
    using 27% less water due to optimal canal water redistribution and irrigation
    system efficiency. The redistributed gross irrigation requirements for 57% irrigation
    efficiency are given in Table 6. The geospatial results of the optimized cropping
    pattern are cartographically presented in Fig. 5(c). Table 6. Optimal redistribution

    The majority of traditional optimization models produce numerical outputs. For
    instance, such conventional models commonly suggest total optimal cropping area
    estimates for various crops. However, it is often difficult to put these findings
    into the field. As a result, optimization results at the decision-making level
    are confined to the feasibility study stage. Hence, the need of the hour is to
    find the latest methodologies with geospatial integration in delivering a cartographic
    representation of outputs for field implementation and management. A new methodology
    using the geospatial approach is developed in this study with the basic concept
    of conventional optimization to indicate the directions of action plans. Using
    the geospatial approach, it is evident that optimization models can also be performed
    at the field scale for efficient water management. In this study, water-stressed
    regions of the tail end reaches are spatially identified for low irrigation system
    efficiency [Fig. 5(b)]. This approach provides a spatial decision platform for
    decision-makers and water managers to take a suitable action plan for water-deprived
    reaches in the command. Apparently, public agencies are promoting several microirrigation
    schemes at the national level to enhance water-use efficiency. Complimenting this,
    the proposed novel technique with the SDSMS model suggests the geographical distribution
    of an optimal cropping pattern [Fig. 5(c)] to assess the impact of improved system
    efficiency. The SDSMS model can also be used to execute a volumetric assessment
    of water requirements at every canal outlet and the optimal redistribution of
    allocated water (Table 6). The optimization of the cropping pattern and the redistribution
    of allocated water with optimal irrigation efficiency has led to a 24% increase
    in the cultivation area per unit of water from 0.89 ha per ha-m of water to 1.10
    ha per ha-m of water. This research demonstrates that the spatial optimization
    model using SDSMS optimally allocates resources at the outlet level of the irrigation
    network and farm-level results so as to obtain maximum net returns for command
    area development. To maintain a sustainable cropping pattern and accomplish the
    goal of more crop per drop, the geospatial analysis suggests that project scheme
    irrigation efficiency must be improved to a minimum standard of living canals
    ( e c = 75 % ) and encourage water-efficient irrigation methods. This can be achieved
    by the modernization of canal systems, optimization strategies to manage water
    resources by canal automation, and developing suitable cropping patterns (Daniel
    et al. 2007; FAO and KBJNL 2009). The model extends the capability of geospatial
    optimization with large datasets for irrigation management using python modules
    in the GIS environment. The spatial database and attributes give superior inputs
    to optimization models and reliable results compared to conventional methods (Tables
    4 and 5). Because the inputs are drawn from geospatial layers, the inputs can
    be dynamic for yearly changes in cropping patterns. Dynamic inputs to the optimization
    model and customization within the model are possible and provide location-specific
    results for any extent of interest. The model can incorporate multiple-sector
    dynamic inputs from the farm level, the agricultural market, and water management
    strategies for decision-makers. The SDSMS can list beneficiary details from the
    optimization model outputs, group the results to lateral outlets for onfield management,
    and highlight optimized locations in the command area and sectors that need attention.
    This is quite beyond the bounds of the use of conventional optimization methodologies.
    Thus, the SDSMS holds the power of scalability in treating the irrigation ecosystem
    to a larger extent. Moreover, it is a tool that works on geospatial data common
    among all water sector agencies, i.e., government, private, and nongovernment
    agencies, and, hence, holds the promise of successful implementation. Conclusions
    The SDSMS geographic optimization model was developed for a typical arid to semiarid
    environment command for providing cartographic results. The following are certain
    conclusions drawn from this research: • Under unplanned cropping patterns and
    limited water supply conditions, the innovative geospatial technique proposed
    in this study aids in identifying water-stressed locations. This assists policymakers
    and decision-makers in identifying the water-scarce reaches in command and devising
    an action plan for sustainable, optimal cropping patterns. • The proposed GIS
    technique helps in understanding how we can irrigate the entire land within the
    command by optimizing the irrigation efficiencies to obtain maximum agricultural
    returns (i.e., to assess at what efficiency the system has to work so as to irrigate
    the whole command with minimal changes to the existing pattern). • The geomatic
    technique cartographically represents optimal cropping patterns with appropriate
    irrigation methods to fit the system’s workable efficiency in irrigating the whole
    command. This helps in assessing the influence of microirrigation on command-area
    development. • The geospatial approach optimally redistributes canal water supplies
    from the allocated water reserves so as to achieve an equitable distribution of
    water to the entire command and reduce water stress regions in the command. •
    The SDSMS geospatial model demonstrates its competence in optimum water management
    by redistribution of allocated water resources, as well as proposing feasible
    system efficiency and marginal improvements to achieve an ideal cropping pattern
    to cultivate the maximum command area. • The geospatial model can be reframed
    to meet other aims based on the decision makers’ requirements and the study’s
    temporal frequency. Furthermore, as the SDSMS extends its capabilities, this methodology
    paves the way for future researchers to incorporate additional parameters into
    the model that may influence the irrigation system. Data Availability Statement

    resource, is still an elementary requirement for life on Earth; the upsurge in
    population growth and climatic changes over several decades has affected water
    utilization, and water is now in high demand [1,2]. The resources available for
    agriculture are being depleted at an alarming rate; hence, traditional methods
    have to be replaced with new methods for the effective utilization of available
    resources. Soil and water are the two main resources for agriculture. As per the
    Food and Agriculture Organization [FAO] report on Aquastat, India, where more
    than 55% of the land is a cultivable area of approximately 183 million ha, irrigation
    is the major consumer, accounting for more than 80% of the water resources. The
    origins and history of irrigation in India have been identified from remains of
    Indus Valley civilization. Irrigation is a process that has been followed for
    thousands of years and has undergone several changes and refinements. Supplying
    the appropriate amount of water to the crop at the appropriate time requires a
    complexity of irrigation techniques or irrigation management [3,4]. Water use
    efficiency (WUE) and better yield are the key factors for effective irrigation
    management application (FAO 2001); this is an important and essential issue to
    be resolved as the demand to feed the exponentially growing population is high
    [5,6,7]. Irrigation optimization is essential to meet the demand for natural resources.
    Irrigation optimization has been evolving for a long period and has gained attention
    since the 1970s. Automatic irrigation technologies in precision agriculture based
    on control theory would result in irrigation optimization [4]. AquaCrop-Open Source
    is a crop simulation model implemented using MATLAB. Among the water-driven crop
    models, AquaCrop accounts for a wide spectrum of water stress impacts on transpiration.
    AquaCrop is a specifically designed simulation model used to simulate the essential
    factors such as water requirements, growth, biomass production, and harvestable
    yield of herbaceous crop types [4]. Irrigation optimization includes multiple
    factors that are not static and change completely with the climate, available
    resources, crops planted, evapotranspiration, stress coefficient, crop coefficient,
    electrical conductivity, and many more factors [5]. Irrigation optimization complexity
    exists due to the heterogeneous problem statements of irrigation. A prescribed
    static irrigation model will result in a limited scope of improvisation, whereas
    a dynamic irrigation model would result in high precision. Available technologies,
    such as IoT, machine learning, and cloud-based decision support systems, reduce
    the complexity of implementing dynamic irrigation optimization. The adoption rate
    of modern technologies and data management tools in agriculture is steadily increasing.
    However, the technologies adopted differ from region to region. Soil sampling,
    computers having high-speed Internet access, yield maps, and yield monitoring
    have the highest rates of adoption among farmers. New technology implementation
    would result in an increase in yields by 70%. The application of the right quantity
    of water at the appropriate time is an important criterion for developing an irrigation
    management application. The use of machine learning and artificial neural network
    models will tremendously increase the feasibility of developing a better irrigation
    management application [6]. This paper reviews the basic technologies, tools,
    and approaches that can be easily converged to provide solutions to the intricacies
    in irrigation management. However, this paper does not discuss the economic betterment
    or government’s geographical policies that may also impact on the solution. 1.1.
    Evolution of Irrigation We examine the evolution of irrigation from the references
    in four different time periods ranging from 1970 to 2018 (present). The evolution
    is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. Evolution of irrigation from 1970 to present.
    From 1970 to 1985, the emergence of automatic control systems and the scarcity
    of water for irrigation processes attracted the attention of researchers regarding
    irrigation optimization [7,8,9,10]. Water use information and efficiency were
    implemented in the late 1970s as the demand for water started to increase with
    the exponential rise in the population and depletion of natural resources [11,12].
    The scenario triggered the necessity for the optimization of the irrigation technique.
    Several factors were identified to attain optimization in irrigation, such as
    the stress day index (SDI), the evapotranspiration crop canopy, and climate conditions.
    The emergence of the Internet for public use after 1989 has driven Internet-based
    control systems and enabled data storage on the web. Wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) have started to emerge as an easy and powerful technology for environmental
    monitoring [13]. Sensors and actuators have been developed for various applications
    of WSNs, including agriculture. Smart applications and methodologies for irrigation,
    soil fertilization, pest control, and disease forecasting have attracted important
    attention among researchers in the field of precision agriculture [14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24].
    1.2. Factors to Be Considered for Effective Irrigation Several irrigation systems,
    or characteristics of irrigation systems, exist based on the application or utilization
    of the water to the surface or the crop. These are normally classified as surface,
    drip, or sprinkler, and localized and subsurface irrigation. Surface irrigation
    irrigates by applying water on the surface of the agricultural land. Drip or sprinkler
    irrigation uses less water for irrigation as it applies the water drop by drop
    or sprinkles it like artificial rain, whereas localized irrigation applies water
    to specific places on the surface, and, in subsurface irrigation, water is applied
    to the crop’s root zone [25]. Many factors are dependent on the type of irrigation
    optimization that is performed [15,16,17]. Furthermore, all of the factors differ
    based on the geography, crop, soil type, irrigation methodology, and the amount
    of rainfall [18,19]. Below are some of the vital factors affecting irrigation
    optimization: Soil moisture. pH value. Electrical conductivity. Crop growth metrics.
    Climate data. Crop canopy. Evapotranspiration. Given the difficulty of establishing
    successful irrigation, it is prudent to estimate the irrigation need and optimize
    it through the development of an irrigation optimization approach that takes into
    account all of the complicated irrigation characteristics. 1.3. Irrigation Optimization
    Irrigation optimization is a complex task as it involves the processes of data
    collection, analysis, and interpretation of acquired data and optimization decisions.
    Optimization is attained using different factors as the irrigation impact differs
    based on various factors. Montesano et al. (2018) designed and deployed an automated
    irrigation system where soilless substrate was taken for growing basil and stated
    that a wireless sensor network can be used as an effective tool for real-time
    monitoring and sensing of substrate water status in greenhouse soilless conditions
    for effective irrigation management of basil [20]. Difallah et al. (2017) developed
    a linear programming model along with a knapsack decisional form to attain irrigation
    optimization with weather and soil conditions as vital factors, and the results
    reduced the utilization of water by 28.5% [21]. Consideration of other external
    factors of importance, such as relative humidity, soil nutrients, wind speed,
    and sunshine duration, would result in better optimization. An integrated hydrological-irrigation
    optimization modeling system was implemented for the Central Vietnam rice irrigation
    scheme [22]. The model comprises a distributed hydrologic model, a simulated inflow
    for the reservoir, and an irrigation methodology that optimizes the irrigation
    of rice. Continuous flooding is replaced with alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    throughout the summer–autumn season, and the reservoir capacity and reservoir
    release are considered to be important factors. Zhang et al. [23] irrigated tomatoes
    at different crop evapotranspiration (ETc) percentages, such as 40%, 50%, 60%,
    80%, and 100%, finding that the highest yield was obtained with 80% ETc, and recommended
    80% ETc as an optimal irrigation standard for the Hetao Irrigation District comprising
    sandy soil. A smart drip irrigation system combining technologies such as the
    cloud, data mining, and Android [24] was developed by Ghosh et al., and they achieved
    remote control over the drip irrigation. Humidity, temperature, light, and moisture
    are considered as important factors in irrigation control. Factors such as temperature
    and humidity in the air, soil moisture, wind speed, and solar radiation can be
    considered universal variables in agricultural applications. Before optimizing
    the irrigation, the right irrigation technique must be chosen based on the farm
    and other factors [21]. Several irrigation techniques are available among these,
    of which flood, drip, and sprinkler irrigation are the most applied techniques.
    Other irrigation methods have also been followed as per the geographic demands
    and research process. 1.4. Remote Monitoring and Control of Irrigation for Optimized
    Irrigation Irrigation monitoring is critical for optimization; thus, manual monitoring
    should be phased out in favor of automated or remote monitoring. Numerous irrigation
    systems are used across the world, and Table 1 summarizes the numerous strategies
    used in the reference articles. In 2018, Karimi et al. [25,26] developed a web-based
    monitoring system for vineyards and grape drying, and the results proved it was
    a complete monitoring system that provided efficient monitoring. Table 1. Various
    irrigation techniques. Das et al. considered four key data fields, namely, the
    morphology of the plant, canopy, leaf area index, and fruit counts, using sensor
    suites containing a laser range scanner, multispectral cameras, a thermal imaging
    camera, and navigational sensors. Using the sensor suites, they were able to monitor
    the agriculture process effectively [26]. Gosh et al. developed a remote monitoring
    and control system where the field data were collected using preconfigured sensors
    and passed on to the controller, which passes the information to a computer on
    the farm, from which the data are transferred to the cloud [24]. The emergence
    of critically designed IoT devices and controllers enables the field data to be
    directly stored in the cloud without a computer to interface the field and cloud
    [38]. Precision agriculture has to be complemented with emerging technologies,
    such as the Internet of Things (IoT), and has enabled technologies to improve
    the quality of farming [39]. Monitoring the field and fetching data from the farm
    helps in monitoring and analyzing other processes in precision agriculture [40],
    such as the soil nutrient depletion rate, crop canopy, and other parameters. Researchers
    used cloud services to save the data for further analysis. An automated cloud-based
    dynamic decision support system for acquiring data from different sources was
    developed by Tan in 2016 and was tested successfully. The system was able to provide
    decisions that were application specific, and the field devices could be controlled
    from the cloud [41]. These cloud-assisted platforms increase the scope of analytics
    and decision support systems in precision agriculture [27]. Imaging platforms
    have also been used for remote monitoring [42], as several parameters, such as
    the canopy, detection of leaf width, and infection in plants, can be performed
    using image processing algorithms and other approaches in combination with image
    processing. Irrigation optimization, remote monitoring, and remote control complement
    each other to enable precision agriculture. The process cycle is depicted in Figure
    2. Figure 2. Components of precision agriculture. 2. Architecture or Deployment
    Models for IoT in Agriculture Irrigation Management A remote monitoring system
    based on the Internet of Things employs a variety of methodologies for a variety
    of applications, and hence the design and deployment patterns are diverse. There
    is no one-size-fits-all approach to IoT architecture. Consolidation of the Internet
    of Things architecture is based on a three- or four-layer architecture. Three-Layer
    and Four-Layer Architectures The common architecture is the three-layer architecture
    represented in Figure 3, comprising the physical, network and application layers
    [43]. Figure 3. Generic three-layer architecture. The sensor and actuator layer
    (physical layer) has the sensors and actuators connected to it, allowing sensing
    to gather information from the environment and to control the actuators The network
    layer (data management layer) connects other devices, servers, and things in the
    IoT application. This layer is sometimes called the communication layer, as it
    merges some of the functions, such as data aggregation and preprocessing. The
    application layer delivers application-driven services or functions to the end
    users. The functions and process differ based on the application in which it is
    used, such as smart homes, smart cities, and smart agriculture. In the four-layer
    architecture depicted in Figure 4, the service layer is added to the three-layer
    architecture, and the service layer classifies the data for the application layer.
    The data are classified based on applications such as visualization, security,
    storage, communication services, and analytics. The service layer is accountable
    for the creation and management of services needed for applications. It acts as
    a middleware for the application and network layer, and is responsible for maintaining
    the services registry for discovery of services, API (application programming
    interface), and composition of services. Reliability management is also taken
    care of by the service layer. Figure 4. Four-layer architecture. 3. Commonly Used
    Cloud Platforms in IoT As per the National Institute of Standards and Technology
    (NIST), “cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand
    network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks,
    servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned
    and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction” [43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50].
    The integration of the cloud platform is an important factor for developing an
    effective application in the IoT. Most IoT applications are developed to complement
    data collection in an analytics application. The cloud also helps attain scalability
    and flexibility, and, with clouds, features such as visualization and data analysis
    are easily carried out, reducing the time and cost required of applications. Multiple
    cloud platforms are compared and contrasted in Table 2. Table 2. Cloud platforms
    of IoT comparison. 4. Commonly Used Sensors and Controllers in Agriculture 4.1.
    Sensors in Agriculture The sensor collects data from the field and aggregates
    it for processing in an IoT application. The actuators in the application are
    mostly activated by detected data. Sensor data is gathered and used in analytics
    and visualization-based applications. The following are some of the more obvious
    sensors mentioned in the cited article(s): Soil moisture sensor. Weather station.
    CO2 sensor. DHT11 digital. TGS 813 sensor for SO2 gas. PIR motion sensor. Soil
    pH sensor. 4.2. Hardware Platforms in the IoT Hardware platforms connected with
    sensors and actuators are the heart of the IoT. In the case of IoT hardware, it
    is designed or amended depending on the application in which it is used. The hardware
    used in the IoT consists of two types of ARM controllers, as compared in Table
    3, and Single Board Computers, as contrasted in Table 4. The tables present the
    available and commonly used hardware platforms, with parameters of supply voltage,
    processor, processor speed, system flash, system memory, IDE, GPIO, I/O, connectivity,
    and network interfaces. Table 3. Comparison of ARM-based controllers. Table 4.
    Single Board Computer-based hardware for IOT. The data collected from the farm
    using the IoT devices and cloud platform enable the analysis of data through which
    several complexities can be visualized and resolved, such as estimation of evapotranspiration
    and irrigation for the upcoming days, prediction of yield, and scheduling of irrigation
    based on the acquired value. To perform the analysis, machine learning and neural
    networks are deployed. The following section discusses some of the many studies
    for irrigation management that use machine learning models or neural networks
    for effective irrigation. 5. Artificial Neural Networks and Machine Learning for
    Irrigation Machine learning is the process of building a mathematical model that
    uses the available data to learn decision making using the patterns and features
    of the data. The sample or the training data are the base of the machine learning
    models, which generate decisions or predictions without a traditional program
    that explicitly instructs a computer to do so [44]. Neural networks embed the
    process of imitating the operations of the human brain to perform tasks through
    a non-explicit programming structure, where sample data or training data are used
    to fetch insights from the available data resources. Machine learning is considered
    the subset of neural networks [50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61]. With the
    enormous amount of data, machine learning or artificial neural networks would
    help in identifying the pattern hidden inside the data. Machine learning and neural
    networks for the betterment of irrigation management use several factors as parameters;
    among the parameters, reference evapotranspiration (ET) is the most widely used.
    Cordeiro et al. predicted soil moisture for irrigation management as soil moisture
    data was not properly retrieved from the farm due to sensor failure. A fog-enabled
    smart system for irrigation was deployed using neural networks [62,63,64,65,66].
    Optimal water application or control was achieved using a convolution neural network
    (CNN) for a sugarcane crop. The proposed CNN provided better water control with
    high accuracy compared to other models [67,68,69,70]. Although several factors
    help in attaining irrigation optimization, evapotranspiration is the most preferred
    as it is derived using other key parameters. Evapotranspiration is a significant
    element, not only in irrigation management, but also in many other applications.
    Evapotranspiration (ET) estimation depends on several models, and the Penman–Monteith
    model is a highly followed standard across the globe among many researchers for
    the estimation of ET [46]. Mohammad rezapour et al. in 2019 estimated ET by comparing
    and contrasting three models, namely, the support vector machine (SVM), adaptive
    neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), and gene expression programming (GEP). All
    three models estimated the potential evapotranspiration for semi-arid land [47].
    The simulation of ET was performed for the data ranging from 1970–2010, with inputs
    of five different combinations in southeastern Iran. Among the three models, ANFIS
    is a neural network model, SVM is a machine learning model, and GEP is an evolutionary
    computing technique. The SVM-based model performed better than the other two models,
    with sunshine hours, humidity, relative humidity, air temperature average, and
    wind speed as the input parameters for the model [70,71,72,73,74]. Feng et al.
    estimated the ET for the collected data from two stations in China for the years
    2009–2014 using the temperature-based random forest model (RFM) and generalized
    regression neural network (GRNN) model [48]. From the results, it is clear that
    both models can be used for the estimation of ET on a daily basis, and both the
    RFM and GRNN perform well in terms of daily estimation. However, the slight performance
    improvement of the RFM makes it a preferred choice compared with the GRNN model.
    Yamac and Todorovic estimated the daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc) for potato
    using K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) and ANN (artificial
    neural network) models. The three models were tested for four different input
    parameter setups. The estimation of the models was compared with the ETc estimated
    using the standard Penman–Monteith methodology. The meteorological data collected
    from a test plot in southern Italy for the durations of 2009 and 2010 were used
    for comparison. The results show that the KNN model performed well for the scenario
    with limited input data. The ANN performed well with a complete set of input data
    [49]. The estimation of ET for the data collected from two meteorological stations
    in Turkey was examined by Sanikhani et al. in 2019 with six different AI models.
    The models used limited climatic data for estimation. The examined models were
    multilayer perceptron, radial basis neural network (RBNN), GEP, ANFIS with grid
    partition (ANFIS-GP), ANFIS with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC), and GRNN.
    The models were verified with the Hargreaves–Samani (HS) and Calibrated Hargreaves–Samani
    (CHS) approaches of estimation. The results show that GRNN and the GEP performed
    well at a station named Antalya, and at another station named Isparta; the ANFIS-SC
    and the RBNN models performed well in comparison with other models [50]. All six
    models, except the multilayer perceptron, performed well compared to CHS and the
    HS empirical approaches. ET-based irrigation management models are reliable models,
    but they require many input variables that are not easily available and are not
    easily collected from farms using IoT devices. Research to extract the data required
    for ET estimation is in high demand [46]. Along with the reference ET method,
    many other parameters, such as canopy cover, rainfall data, water stress index,
    and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), are also used for irrigation
    management. Machine learning and artificial neural networks not only encourage
    researchers to make irrigation recommendations but also encourage the use of many
    other factors, such as crop suitability, yield prediction, plant disease classification,
    and profitable plantations [56,57]. Many of the previous research works have been
    enhanced with machine learning-based models for better classification and artificial
    intelligence-based predictions for more accuracy and efficiency [58,59]. 6. Tools
    or Software Available for Irrigation Management Because irrigation management
    has been the subject of research for a period of several decades, multiple tools
    have been developed for irrigation scheduling and the estimation of irrigation
    requirements, which are considered to be a part of irrigation management. This
    paper discusses some of the notable tools or software for irrigation management.
    6.1. CROPWAT 8.0 CROPWAT is a crop water decision support tool for the estimation
    of evapotranspiration, yield prediction, and irrigation schedules, and estimates
    crop performance for irrigated and rain-fed conditions. Developed by Smith M in
    1992 [51] by the Land and Water Development Division of Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO), CROPWAT has several evolutions and still meets the needs of modern farmers
    and researchers by providing features, such as the calculation of water requirements
    and the development of user-adjustable irrigation schedules, allowing the use
    of the CLIMWAT database tool by the FAO for climate data [52]. CROPWAT is an easy-to-use
    GUI-based tool where sample files and data are provided. In conjunction with the
    compatibility of interactions with CLIMWAT, the tool helps to reduce the multiple
    complexities of irrigation management. The tool is open source and easily downloadable
    from the FAO website [54]. 6.2. Aqua-Crop Aqua-Crop is another software package
    from the Land and Water Development Division of FAO with the ability to simulate
    canopy cover, ET, yield response, and biomass of the crop under different irrigation
    regimes [53]. Similar to the CROPWAT tool, AquaCrop can also be used to assist
    the management of irrigation for rain-fed and irrigated agriculture practices.
    The main feature of the tool is that it enables understanding of the response
    of the crop to changes in the environmental conditions, and the development of
    schemes for deficit irrigation conditions. 6.3. SAPWAT Developed based on the
    paper by Allen, Periera, Raes and Smith, SAPWAT is an irrigation water requirement
    estimation tool based on the Penman–Monteith procedure for the calculation of
    ET [55]. It includes more than 50 years of weather data for approximately 3262
    weather stations in South Africa. Features such as enterprise budget analysis
    distinguish this software from other existing tools used for irrigation management.
    SAPWAT seems to be inspired by the features of CROPWAT and has been developed
    as an alternative to CROPWAT. In addition to the three tools/software mentioned
    above, many other tools exist, most of which were specifically designed with geographical
    constraints or for use in a particular project. 7. Observations and Discussions
    Many cloud platforms are available for the IoT, and each platform has its own
    specific features. Among the many available cloud platforms, ThingSpeak, Thingsworx,
    AWS IoT, IBM Watson, and Microsoft Azure are the eminent players. Figure 5 showcases
    the most preferred cloud services utilized in the irrigation control and monitoring
    sector. The data in this section were observed from the papers referred to for
    this review. Open-source access, device management, security, implementation ease,
    data analytics and machine learning tools are the key factors that determine the
    use of cloud services for applications related to irrigation. ThingSpeak is highly
    utilized because it is highly instinctive and offers an open-source service for
    basic features. Remote monitoring is an important aspect for the implementation
    of IoT systems. The parameters that need to be monitored are the core factors
    that influence irrigation optimization. Figure 6 displays the parameters that
    are most considered for irrigation systems using IoT, where the temperature and
    humidity correspond to the air. Figure 5. Key players in cloud service for irrigation.
    Figure 6. Key parameters considered for irrigation. Soil moisture, humidity, temperature,
    and rainfall are the key parameters considered for irrigation using the IoT. Other
    parameters, such as precipitation, wind speed, sunlight intensity, and wind direction,
    are also monitored in the implementations. Although evapotranspiration is also
    effectively utilized, it is derived using the other parameters; hence, it is not
    shown in Figure 6. The figure showcases only the parameters that are monitored
    in real time from the agricultural field. Other parameters, such as canopy and
    evapotranspiration, can be measured or calculated using the parameters that are
    monitored from the field. Machine learning and ANN models for irrigation optimization
    have been in high demand in recent times, and some of the most utilized machine
    learning algorithms are compared with ANN models in Figure 7. Several ANN models,
    such as RNN, GRNN, and RBNN, are considered under the umbrella of ANN. The ANFIS,
    SVM, and GEP are the most preferred machine learning models. Machine learning
    models are more implemented and utilized for irrigation optimization than ANN
    models. Figure 7. Most commonly used machine learning and ANN models. 8. Future
    Challenges The Internet of Things (IoT) presents several challenges researchers
    must address. In this paper, some vital challenges are discussed. 8.1. Standard
    Protocols The varied ranges of sensors, controllers, and actuators utilized in
    the IoT lead to multiple challenges in the standardization of communication protocols,
    and varied devices or gadgets need to be integrated for IoT-based applications;
    hence, global standards are required so that adaptability and interoperability
    can be achieved. Difficulty in the Internet of Things is caused by the number
    of components involved, interoperability, communication protocols, and power sources.
    Devices use different communication protocols, such as MQTT, ZigBee, and TCP/IP.
    Although TCP/IP is the most utilized protocol, it leads to many complex issues.
    Therefore, many studies have been conducted to address the issue of complexity.
    8.2. Security in IoT-Based Systems When data are involved, security must be taken
    into utmost consideration, but due to the evolving nature of the IoT system and
    lack of standards, security is a decisive challenge that triggers ambiguous implementation.
    Security in communication protocols is not the only challenge, and security in
    routing is also very complex and still evolving. Security needs to be guaranteed
    for effective application utilization. 8.3. Connectivity Providing Internet connectivity
    for agricultural fields may not be as easy as anticipated in developing and underdeveloped
    countries. Although connectivity seems to be feasible, the available bandwidth
    needs to be increased for many IoT applications. The Internet service providers
    need to expand their territory and range to reduce the key complexity of connectivity.
    8.4. Reliability of the Devices Involved The Internet of Things converges heterogeneous
    devices in one application, and the selection of durable devices is a critical
    factor for the reliability of the implementation of IoT applications. If one device
    fails, the entire application will fail. 9. Conclusions Agriculture is an application-specific
    domain in which the implementation of the IoT and other emerging modern techniques
    and tools can provide new solutions for traditional problems. In this paper, several
    aspects of irrigation management using the IoT, and the available tools and approaches,
    are reviewed. The review can be summarized as follows: The IoT has facilitated
    the accumulation of information over a long duration, and since data are available,
    the implementation of machine learning and neural networks can result in identifying
    several insights that lead to the solution for a complex problem. The initial
    deployment cost for IoT enabled solution is an important concern for small scale
    farmers. Development of more agriculture specific sensors (soft or hard) needs
    to be undertaken. Hard sensors are traditional sensors that are available as physical
    hardware to sense the data, whereas soft sensors are a process/formula that converts
    the available various sensor data into intricate output data that require a very
    complex sensor to sense it. The development of soft sensors will reduce the cost
    and serve as an affordable alternative for expensive hard sensors. The service
    layer adds more modularity by acting as a middleware between the network and application
    layers. As IoT handles heterogeneous data and diverse services, the service layer
    adds more adaptability in developing applications. IoT-based cloud platforms increase
    the effectiveness of the applications developed, but cost effectiveness, resource
    management, security, and configuration of IoT empowered devices need enhancement.
    Most of the test cases test only one crop cycle and are not applied to different
    crops. Labor and operation costs were not considered in most of the work. Machine
    learning and neural network approaches need to be provided with adequate data
    for effective analysis. The irrigation scheduling tools are effective but need
    to be provided with an ample quantity of data for useful results. Area-specific
    tools need to be developed. Irrigation management tools should be developed with
    direct access to sensor data from the field. A complete framework for the IoT
    in agriculture, starting from sensor deployment, analytics, and recommendation,
    has to be developed. Author Contributions Conceptualization, R.R. and I.H.; Data

    • AquaCrop and MOPECO models were parameterized for a barley crop (cv. Cierzo).
    • Yield and soil moisture evolution were properly simulated by both models. •
    Aquacrop offers a higher number of crop simulated variables than MOPECO. • If
    the aim is just to simulate yield, MOPECO is also valid and easier to parameterize.
    • Both models are suitable to analyze the effects of deficit irrigation strategies.
    Abstract This study describes the processes of calibration and validation of AquaCrop
    (the FAO water productivity model) and MOPECO (economic optimization model of
    irrigation water) for the simulation of a barley crop (cv. Cierzo). We compare
    the complexity of implementing this process in the two models and the accuracy
    of the results. A 3-year field experiment conducted during the period from 2011
    to 2013 in a semi-arid region located in southeast Spain was used for this purpose.
    Six irrigation treatments were applied combining different levels of water deficit
    depending on the phenological stage. Both models were suitable for the simulation
    of yield and soil moisture evolution. In addition, AquaCrop correctly simulated
    the harvest index, the evolution of canopy cover and aboveground biomass. The
    comparison between the two models showed that AquaCrop is a better model for assessing
    the effect of a particular irrigation schedule on a crop (i.e. biomass and canopy
    cover development, soil water balance…) than MOPECO. Nevertheless, if the objective
    is to estimate yield depending on the irrigation schedule applied, MOPECO is easier
    to calibrate and furnishes results as valid as those provided by AquaCrop. Previous

    scarcityDecision support systemCrop simulationSemi-arid environment 1. Introduction
    Society demands highly efficient use of natural resources in order to reduce negative
    impacts on the environment. Agriculture accounts for 70 % of global freshwater
    withdrawals, and more than 90 % of its consumptive use (Bruinsma, 2009; ICID,
    2009). In this sense, all cropping areas and, in particular, irrigated areas,
    require suitable governance of natural water resources where both useful tools
    and management strategies are key in addressing the current challenges to satisfying
    the increasingly high worldwide demand for food. These challenges include climate
    change, salinization of agricultural soils, freshwater scarcity, and overexploitation
    of water resources. One way to achieve this aim is through the development of
    irrigation strategies that improve water productivity, and which can be tested
    through crop simulation models (CSMs). There are currently a large number of CSMs,
    such as CropSyst (Cropping System Simulation Model) (Stöckle et al., 2003), DSSAT
    (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) (Jones et al., 2003), AquaCrop
    (the FAO crop model to simulate yield response to water) (Steduto et al., 2009)
    and MOPECO (economic optimization model of irrigation water) (Ortega et al., 2004)
    among others, which simulate the key physiological and hydrologic processes of
    the soil-plant-atmosphere system. Models like Aquacrop and MOPECO do not consider
    the nitrogen, phosphorus and carbon cycle, as it happen with CropSyst or DSSAT.
    Consequently, these last models often require a large number of input variables
    and parameter values that are not easily available to end users (Vanuytrech et
    al., 2014). The authors describe AquaCrop and MOPECO as crop water-driven models
    and focus on promoting their use in the productive sector to improve the crop
    water productivity and efficient use of irrigation water (Ortega et al., 2004;
    Steduto et al., 2009). AquaCrop is a crop water productivity model developed by
    FAO to assess the effect of environment and management on crop production. The
    model simulates yield response to water of herbaceous crops, and is particularly
    suited to addressing conditions where water is a key limiting factor in crop production
    (Vanuytrech et al., 2014). This model has been calibrated for many crops across
    the world by and is widely used for research (wheat, Andarzian et al., 2011; barley,
    Araya et al., 2010; sunflower, García-Vila et al., 2009; maize, Hsiao et al.,
    2009; rice, Maniruzzaman et al., 2015; potato Montoya et al., 2016; cabbage, Wellens
    et al., 2013). MOPECO was conceived to maximize the profitability of irrigated
    farms through a more efficient use of irrigable area (López-Mata et al., 2016)
    and irrigation water (Domínguez et al., 2012a; Leite et al., 2015a). The model
    is based on FAO-33 (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and FAO-56 (Allen et al., 1998)
    methodologies, and has been calibrated for different annual crops (carrot, Carvalho
    et al., 2014; potato, Domínguez et al., 2011; maize, Domínguez et al., 2012c;
    onion, Domínguez et al., 2012b; garlic, Domínguez et al., 2013; melon, Leite et
    al., 2015b). Final crop yield, root depth evolution, and daily actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) are the only crop parameters simulated by MOPECO (Domínguez et al., 2011).
    AquaCrop, however, differentiates between evaporation and transpiration, and also
    simulates biomass, yield, root depth and canopy cover evolution, among other processes
    (Steduto et al., 2009). In consequence, the number of crop parameters required
    by MOPECO to simulate yield is much lower than that required by AquaCrop. Barley
    (Hordeum vulgare L.) is the eleventh most-produced crop in the world and the fifth
    in harvested area with 147 million Mg and 47 million hectares, respectively. Europe
    accounts for more than 61 % of the world production with 49 % of the global area
    (FAOSTAT, 2018). In Spain, barley is the most cultivated crop with a total area
    of nearly 2.6 million hectares and a production of 9.2 million Mg per year. Due
    to its extensive root system, barley is highly resistant to drought (Fischer and
    Maurer, 1978). Furthermore, stress tolerance in barley is related to gas exchange
    in the leaves. Stomatal closure causes a decrease in the rate of CO2 assimilation.
    In this way, the plant is able to maintain relative maximum water content in the
    leaves (González et al., 1999; Thameur et al., 2012). However, yields can be highly
    compromised when severe stress occurs. Day et al. (1987) and Francia et al. (2011)
    concluded that the impact of water deficit on barley yields depends upon its intensity
    and on the crop growth stage when it is imposed, with flowering being the stage
    most sensitive to water deficit. The low profitability of this crop and the low
    availability of irrigation water in many areas where this species is cultivated,
    is causing farmers to demand irrigation strategies that increase the efficiency
    in the use of irrigation water by this crop. Aquacrop and MOPECO models can be
    two useful tools to achieve this goal. The two objectives of this paper are: 1)
    to calibrate and validate AquaCrop and MOPECO models with the aim of parameterizing
    a barley crop (Cierzo cultivar); and 2) to compare the complexity of carrying
    out this process in both models, assess the accuracy of the results and evaluate
    their ability for advising farmers and technicians in irrigation scheduling. This
    work is the first stage towards using and evaluating the irrigation strategy tools
    provided by both models to apply full and deficit irrigation to improve irrigation
    water productivity in a barley crop, which will be analyzed in a subsequent paper.
    2. Material and methods 2.1. Site description The agricultural area of Castilla-La
    Mancha (CLM) comprises 3,773,029 ha, of which 557,851 ha are irrigated land (MAPAMA,
    2018). The region of CLM cultivates 0.78 million hectares of barley, which represents
    28 % of national production (MAPAMA, 2018). The use of irrigation in the area
    is the result of low average annual precipitation of about 400 mm year−1 (CES,
    2006). However, reference evapotranspiration values surpass 1100 mm, characterizing
    the agricultural area as semi-arid (Domínguez and de Juan, 2008). For this reason,
    1655 hm3 of water was used for irrigation in 2016 (INE, 2019), making up more
    than 82 % of regional water consumption. Moreover, around 64 % of total is groundwater,
    being two regional aquifers declared overexploited (CES, 2006). This provides
    insight into the importance of achieving high water productivity in this sector.
    In the case of barley, average irrigation water requirements in the area are stated
    in 2500 m3 ha−1 (JCRMO, 2019), being solid set and center pivot the most common
    systems used for irrigating this crop. 2.2. Study site The data set used in this
    study was obtained in a field experiment conducted over three cropping seasons
    (from 2011 to 2013) at \"Las Tiesas\" farm, located near Albacete (Spain; Fig.
    1) (2° 5′ longitude west; 39° 3′ latitude North; and 695 m.a.s.l elevation). The
    climate is semi-arid, temperate Mediterranean, with 314 mm of average annual precipitation,
    mainly concentrated in spring and autumn, and more than 1200 mm of average annual
    reference evapotranspiration. Average mean, maximum, and minimum temperatures
    are 13.7, 24.0 and 4.5 °C, respectively. Description of the climate of the area

    years (g: T1; h: T2; i: T3; j: T4; k: T5; l: T6) for the six irrigation treatments.
    Meteorological variables over the three seasons were measured with an automated
    weather station located over a reference grass surface less than 150 m from the
    field test. All sensors were installed between 1.5 and 2 m above the grass surface,
    and meteorological data were registered in 15-min, hourly and daily time steps.
    Variables measured were as follows: air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
    and direction, short and longwave radiation and rainfall. All data were stored
    in two dataloggers (CR10X, Campbell Scientific). Reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) values were estimated with the daily time step FAO56 Penman-Monteith equation
    (Allen et al., 1998). For a description of the weather station, see López-Urrea
    et al. (2016). According to Soil Taxonomy (Soil Survey Staff, 1999), the experimental
    field soil is classified as Petrocalcic Calcixerepts. The average depth of soil
    is 0.4 m, which is limited by a petrocalcic horizon. The texture of the soil is
    silt-clay-loam (Table 1), with basic pH (8.1) and low organic matter content (1.5
    %). The average slope soil of the plot is around 1–2 %. The physical and hydraulic
    soil properties were obtained from texture class by means of pedotransfer functions
    (Table 1) (Saxton and Rawls, 2006). Table 1. Physical and hydraulic soil properties

    experimental years, barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Cierzo) was sown in rows 0.15 m
    apart with a density at harvest of about 400 plants m−2. The experiment used a
    complete randomized block design with four replicates of six irrigation levels.
    Irrigation treatments supplied different levels of crop water requirement as follows:
    T1: 50 % of potential crop evapotranspiration (ETm) over the whole growing season;
    T2: 75 % ETm; T3: 100 % ETm; T4: 50 % ETm from sowing to maximum canopy cover
    (CC) (Phase I), and 100 % ETm from maximum CC to harvest (Phase II); T5: 75 %
    ETm in phase I and full-irrigated in Phase II; T6: 100 % ETm in Phase I, and 75
    % ETm in Phase II (Table 2). Individual plot size was 10 m long by 2.5 m wide
    and the experimental area was located in the center of a 50 m × 50 m barley plot.

    was installed with four drip lines per experimental plot and 3.5 L h−1 emitters
    placed 0.5 cm apart. The system was designed to apply 11.2 mm h−1 of water with
    an average pressure in the lateral pipe of 100 kPa, allowing 100 % of the soil
    surface area to be wetted. The irrigation depth applied to each treatment during
    the irrigation events was controlled by flow meters. In all treatments, fertilizers
    were applied before sowing at a rate of 15–59−37 kg ha−1 of N-P-K, respectively.
    Additionally, liquid fertilizer was applied during the vegetative phase for a
    total of 50 kg ha−1 of N. Traditional pest and disease management practices were
    used to avoid effects on the final crop yield. Crop coefficient values used for
    the reference treatment (T3) were as follows: Kc-ini: 0.3 during crop establishment
    (from sowing to reach 10–15 % of canopy cover); Kc-mid: 1.15 for the reproductive
    stage (from 80 to 85% of CC to pasture grain); and Kc-end: 0.45 for the crop ripening
    (Allen et al., 1998; ITAP, 2004). To reach the percentage of ETm for the deficit
    treatments, Kc values were multiplied by 0.75 and 0.50 according to the irrigation
    strategy considered for the different treatments. Full irrigation depth was then
    computed in order to maintain the soil water content in the root zone between
    field capacity and readily available water (Allen et al., 1998), while deficit
    irrigation treatments received a percentage of this amount of water (Table 2).
    2.4. Crop growth and soil moisture monitoring Over the three experimental seasons,
    barley crop phenology of T3 (control) was monitored weekly following the BBCH
    scale (Bleiholder et al., 2001). This information was used in the simulation of
    barley with both models (Table 3). Table 3. Key stages of barley development during

    period; Ky (iii): yield formation; Ky (iv): ripening. Additionally, canopy cover
    (CC) evolution was monitored during the three cropping seasons, obtaining 12 measurements
    for the first two seasons and 10 for the last experimental year. Using digital
    images, CC was estimated following the methodology proposed by Cihlar et al. (1987).
    Every 7–10 days, a digital picture of each repetition was taken at midday and
    vertically from an approximate height of 2 m above ground. For a more comprehensive
    description of this methodology, see López-Urrea et al. (2014). Biomass evolution
    was monitored every 15–20 days only during the first experimental year. Thus,
    seven 0.25 m2 samples of barley plants were analyzed per treatment to obtain the
    total dry matter evolution. Samples were oven-dried at 60 °C until they reached
    a constant weight. Soil water content was monitored from sowing date until the
    beginning of irrigation using gravimetry technique. Thus 3, 2 and 1 soil samples
    for the first 0.40 m depth were collected in the control treatment in 2011, 2012
    and 2013, respectively. Samples were oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching constant
    weight. These values were transformed into volumetric soil water content using
    bulk density (Table 1). The experimental plots were harvested after the crop had
    reached the fully ripe stage and yields were corrected to 12 % of grain moisture
    content (Table 2). The aboveground biomass and yield obtained in the three experimental
    seasons were similar depending on the total amount of water received by the crop.
    During the three experimental years, T1 treatment reached the lowest biomass and
    yield values. According to Tukey’s test, T1 showed significant differences with
    respect to the rest of the treatments excepting biomass for the second experimental
    year, where all treatments showed a high standard deviation. Broadly speaking,
    average yields ranged between 6275 and 9000 kg ha−1 for the most deficit and the
    non-deficit treatments, respectively (Table 2). Finally, the variability of the
    observed biomass and yield data in the three experimental seasons could partially
    explain that the harvest index did not show a clear tendency with respect to the
    irrigation treatments (Table 2), being 0.52 the average value. 2.5. AquaCrop model
    (version 5.0) AquaCrop is a model of crop water productivity (WP) that simulates
    the yield response of herbaceous crops to water with a daily time step (Steduto
    et al., 2012). The model simulates the biomass (B) evolution using the daily soil
    water and salt balance, certain atmospheric parameters (temperature, rainfall,
    ETo, and atmospheric CO2 concentration), and the physiological characteristics
    (i.e. water productivity, thermal time, crop coefficient, etc.) and management
    (i.e. irrigation schedule, type of irrigation system, soil fertility, surface
    mulches, etc.) of the crop. The effect of extreme temperatures affecting the crop
    phenology and biomass accumulation, as well as the harvest index (HI) of grain
    crops, is also considered. The soil water balance in combination with particular
    key crop parameters (canopy development ability, stomatal control of transpiration,
    canopy senescence, and HI) allow the effect of water stress on the development
    of the crop to be simulated (Steduto et al., 2009). Thus, water stress has a major
    impact on productivity and yield depending on timing, severity and duration (Abrha
    et al., 2012). The curve number method (USDA-NRCS, 2006) is used to compute the
    effective precipitation (Pe). The daily B production is computed by AquaCrop using
    the normalized water productivity (WP*) and the accumulative ratio of daily transpiration
    and the daily evaporative demand of the atmosphere (Raes et al., 2012; Steduto
    et al., 2009). (1) where B is the biomass (g m−2); WP* is the normalized water
    productivity (g m−2); Tr is the crop transpiration (mm); and ETo is the reference
    evapotranspiration (mm). Then, crop yield is calculated by multiplying biomass
    times HI. Starting from flowering, AquaCrop uses the reference HI (HI0), target
    end point of the crop under unstressed conditions, which is adjusted in response
    of the crop to water deficits during the crop cycle (Steduto et al., 2012). For
    the simulation of crops, the model differentiates between two types of crop parameters:
    conservative and non-conservative. The conservative parameters are crop-specific
    but do not change with time, management practices, geographic location or climate,
    while non-conservative parameters are affected by planting, field management,
    conditions in the soil profile, or the weather (Hsiao et al., 2009; Steduto et
    al., 2009). 2.6. MOPECO model The aim of MOPECO is to maximize gross margin (GM)
    of farms through the efficient use of irrigation water and cultivable area (Domínguez
    et al., 2012a; López-Mata et al., 2016; Ortega et al., 2004). MOPECO uses the
    model proposed by Stewart et al. (1977) for estimating crop yield as a function
    of the actual versus maximum evapotranspiration ratio (ETa/ETm) in the different
    growth stages. Daily ETm is calculated by multiplying daily crop coefficient (Kc)
    by daily reference evapotranspiration (ETo) values (Allen et al., 1998), while
    daily ETa requires a daily balance of soil water content for its calculation (Domínguez
    et al., 2011). Doorenbos and Kassam (1979) considered several growth stages according
    to the different sensitiveness of crops to water deficit. The crop yield response
    factor (Ky) expresses how sensitive the crop is to water deficit at each growth
    stage. When ETa < ETm, the plant suffers from water deficit stress, which may
    cause a loss in yield. (2) where Ya and Ym are the actual and maximum crop yields
    (kg ha−1); k, the actual growing stage; Kyk, the crop yield response factor by
    growing stage: vegetative (i), which includes establishment (Domínguez et al.,
    2012c); flowering (ii); yield formation (iii); and ripening (iv) in the case of
    barley; ETa and ETm are the accumulated actual and maximum crop evapotranspiration
    in each Ky growth stage (mm). 2.7. Calibration and validation models The calibration
    of both models was carried out by using the observed data for the six treatments
    conducted during the second experimental season (2012), because they showed a
    wider range of stress levels, while data for years 2011 and 2013 were used for
    validation. 2.7.1. Parameterization of AquaCrop model The crop development stages
    under non-deficit conditions (Table 3) were used to generate a crop file whereby
    crop development was represented in growing degree days (GDD), where the conservative
    parameters were constants for the three experimental years. Maximum rooting depth
    was established at 1.0 m (Allen et al., 1998), although its development was conditioned
    by a root restrictive layer (0.40 m; Table 1). Canopy growth (CGC), decline coefficients
    (CDC), water stress coefficients and shape factors affecting leaf expansion, stomatal
    closure, and early canopy senescence were calibrated in an iterative process simulating
    the development crop canopy in order to find the best fit between observed and
    simulated CC for the six treatments. Moreover, the date and the measured value
    for both the maximum CC (CC*) and the onset of decline of CC were used to parameterize
    AquaCrop, with the reference treatment (T3) being used for to that end. On the
    other hand, WP* was also calibrated with the previously mentioned method to find
    the best match between simulated and observed biomass at harvest by the six treatments.
    Finally, the selected HIo value was taken from the T3 treatment of the calibration
    year (Table 2). Both HIo and water stress coefficients affecting HI were adjusted
    through a trial and error procedure until the best match between simulated and
    observed yield at harvest using all experimental treatments. As well as the data
    obtained in the field experiments, the conservative crop parameters were determined
    using data from other researchers (Abrha et al., 2012; Araya et al., 2010; Pereira
    et al., 2015; Tavakoli et al., 2015) and data included in the reference manual
    (Raes et al., 2012) (Table 4). Finally, the model parameterization was evaluated
    with the observed crop data during 2011 and 2013 cropping seasons, using the measured
    biomass evolution during 2011 as well as canopy cover evolution, soil moisture
    and harvest (biomass, yield and harvest index) data set from both experimental
    years to be compared with the simulation model. Table 4 shows the preliminary
    conservative values for the simulation of barley by AquaCrop under the semi-arid
    conditions in CLM. Table 4. Parameter values for the simulation of a barley crop

    of MOPECO model In the case of MOPECO, the calibration and validation processes
    followed the steps described in Domínguez et al. (2012a,b): a) Set the Ym value
    according to the results of the field tests; b) Set the crop coefficients (Kc)
    (Allen et al., 1998) by using the values in the bibliography or calibrating them
    by using experimental data; c) Obtain the ETa/ETm rates for every Ky stage; d)
    Calibrate the Ky (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) to find the best fit between observed
    and simulated yields; e) Validate the values assigned to each parameter by simulating
    the irrigation treatments of at least one more experimental season; f) Determine
    the maximum ETa/ETm difference between consecutive Ky stages to restrict the effect
    of optimized regulated deficit irrigation (ORDI) methodology and avoid excessive
    stress in the less sensitive stage (Domínguez et al., 2012a). In the simulation
    of barley, Kc values used in the simulations were those proposed by the Irrigation
    Scheduling Service of Albacete (Initial: 0.3; Mid-season: 1.15; Late season: 0.45)
    (Montoro et al., 2011), which are similar to those proposed by Allen et al. (1998)
    (Table 5). Therefore, the calibration of the Kc values was unnecessary. According
    to Danuso et al. (1995), barley corresponds to ET group number 3 (Table 5). The
    lower and upper developmental threshold temperatures were stablished as 2 °C and
    28 °C, respectively (Pardo, 2018), being both of them used to obtain the duration
    of barley growth stages in terms of accumulated GDD throughout the double triangulation
    method (Sevacherian et al., 1977). Table 5. Parameter values for the simulation

    developmental threshold temperature or the temperature at and below which development
    stops (Pardo, 2018); e: maximum difference of deficit between two consecutive
    Ky stages (Domínguez et al., 2012a). 2.8. Statistical analysis A set of statistical
    indicators were used to evaluate the model performance, being the root mean square
    error (RMSE), the mean bias error (MBE), the index of agreement “d” (Willmott,
    1982), the Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970)
    and the coefficient of determination (R2). (4) where RMSE is the Root Mean Square
    Error; n, is the number of observations; Si and Oi are the simulated and observed
    values, respectively. (5) where MBE is the mean bias error. (6) where EF is the
    Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (if EF = 1, there is a perfect match
    between the model and the observations); Oav is the average value of the variable
    observed. (7) where d is the index of agreement (if d = 1, there is perfect agreement
    between S and O). Determination coefficient (R2) close to 1 indicates that most
    of the variance of the observed values is explained by the model. RMSE was used
    to analyze the variance of the error; this statistic was minimized to keep that
    close to 0 during the calibration and validation processes. The MBE expresses
    the average size of the estimated errors and it was used to indicate the under-
    or overestimations of the model. Finally, the d and EF statistic (non-dimensional)
    were used as indicators of model quality, where values close to 1 mean there is
    a good agreement. EF can range from minus infinity to 1 while d index ranges between
    0 and 1. These statistics were computed using the number of independent observations
    for each treatment for canopy cover and biomass progression. However, those statistics
    were calculated for final biomass, yield and harvest index with the data set obtained
    from the six treatments. Finally, the model performance analysis for soil moisture
    was carried out with all data set collected during the three experimental years
    since this data set was quite scarce. Moreover, both models were considered to
    have an adequate goodness of fit when the differences between observed and simulated
    biomass and yield at harvest and HI were equal to or lower than 10 %, and when
    the percentage of simulated yields satisfying the preceding requirement was equal
    to or higher than 70 % (Domínguez et al., 2012c; Farahani et al., 2009; Heng et
    al., 2009). 2.9. Comparison of models According to the authors of both models,
    AquaCrop (Steduto et al., 2009) and MOPECO (Ortega et al., 2004) were designed
    to be used by farmers and technicians. From this perspective, the most interesting
    characteristics for these types of users are the simplicity in the use of the
    models, the accuracy of the yield forecast and the use of both models for determining
    the most suitable irrigation scheduling (and the most profitable distribution
    of crops in the case of MOPECO). In addition to climatic and other specific data
    concerning the area, farm management, irrigation system and economic data (depending
    on the model), AquaCrop requires a higher number of crop parameters (28 conservative
    and 15 non-conservative) than MOPECO (9) to carry out simulations. Naturally,
    the majority of these values are not available for farmers and technicians and
    many of them must be calibrated and provided by an external institution that should
    preferably be located in the area. This handicap increases with the language used
    by the software, which should be that of the end users (AquaCrop is available
    in English and French and MOPECO in Spanish). Consequently, in practice, neither
    of the models in their current state can be used by farmers or a great number
    of technicians, despite the final aim of both models being to improve irrigation
    water productivity in agricultural systems. For this reason, both models were
    compared from the point of view of researchers aiming to calibrate both models
    for experimental use. The comparison focused on the number and complexity of the
    required data for simulating a certain crop, and the results provided by each
    model and their accuracy. This comparison is valid only for barley and maybe other
    determined crops like wheat or maize, which exhibit almost a linear relationship
    between irrigation and yield, while this comparison would not be valid for crops
    like cotton where a regulated deficit irrigation may lead to an increased yield.
    A statistical analyze was performed with the measured variables at field and simulated
    by both models. In this case, soil moisture and yield were the only two variables
    which could be analyzed in this research. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used
    to evaluate variables obtained with both models during the 3 simulated years.
    Tukey’s test was used to compare the means of each group (not significant, p ≥ 0.05;
    significant, 0.01 ≤ p < 0.05; p < 0.01 highly significant). Finally, the evaluation
    of the irrigation and other strategy tools provided by both models are not analyzed
    in this work. This will be done in a subsequent paper. 3. Results and discussion
    3.1. Calibration and validation of AquaCrop 3.1.1. Canopy cover The simulated
    and the observed evolution of the canopy cover (CC) for the 6 treatments in the
    calibration and validation years showed an adequate agreement during both the
    crop growth stage and over the maximum CC period (Fig. 1). The crop growth coefficient
    (CGC) was properly calibrated (Table 4) during the second experimental season
    since the difference between simulated and observed values was between 2.6 % and
    6.5 %, with tendency to underestimate this growth stage in T5 and T6 treatments
    (Fig. 1a–f). With respect to the period when the crop reached the maximum CC for
    the calibration year (from 88 to 120 days after sowing; Fig. 1a–f), the maximum
    simulated CC values with AquaCrop were found to be slightly lower than the observed
    ones, with differences lower than 8.2 % in all treatments excepting the T3 treatment
    (average overestimation of 4.5 %; Fig. 1c), and whose standard deviation from
    the observed data included the simulated values (Fig. 1a–f). Finally, the onset
    of canopy cover decline and the final CC were properly simulated during the calibration
    year (differences lower than 13.7 %), with the last CC data being properly simulated
    in all treatments (Fig. 1a–f). The mean bias error values showed the model slightly
    overestimated CC during all the crop cycle (between 0.32 % and 6.96 %; Table 6)
    excepting the T5 treatment which one was underestimated (0.44 %; Table 6). Table

    Willmott''s index. The simulated CC evolution for the two validation years (2011
    and 2013) showed a similar one to the observed dataset from each experimental
    year (Fig. 1g–l). CC during crop growing stage (from sowing to 80 days after sowing;
    Fig. 1g–l) was well fitted by AquaCrop during the first experimental year (average
    differences between simulated and observed data around 0.6 %) while these average
    differences were somewhat large for the last experimental season (around 12.5
    %). However, the maximum CC period was slightly overestimated by AquaCrop during
    2013 (differences around 3.2 %) and underestimated in 2011 cropping season (between
    9.2 % and 12.8 %). With respect to the late season stage (between 115 days after
    sowing and physiological maturity; Fig. 1g–l), CC was overestimated during both
    experimental seasons with minimum and maximum differences of 5.4 % and 16 %, respectively.
    Overall, AquaCrop model underestimated the CC evolution for all irrigation treatments
    during the first cropping season (minimum and maximum MBE of 0.02 % and 1.49 %,
    respectively; Table 6) due to the large differences obtained during the mid-season
    stage, while the crop cycle during the last cropping season was overestimated
    since the computed MBE was between 8.77 % and 15.10 % (Table 6). In general, the
    model performance was very similar during the three experimental years, where
    low estimation errors (RMSE) and a high goodness of fit (R2, EF and d index) between
    simulated and observed data was achieved according to the statistical parameters
    used. Thus, RMSE took values between 8.8 % and 15.1 %, with a strong linear relationship
    (R2 > 0.87) and high agreement (d > 0.93 and EF between 0.67 and 0.94) for all
    treatments (Table 6). Other authors using the AquaCrop model with cereal crops
    (barley, wheat or maize) have reported similar RMSE, R2, d index and EF values
    (Abi Saab et al., 2015; Abrha et al., 2012; Araya et al., 2010; Heng et al., 2009;
    Hsiao et al., 2009; Pereira et al., 2015; Tavakoli et al., 2015; Toumi et al.,
    2016). The value of the conservative parameters that describe the CC evolution
    (canopy growth and decline coefficients, the canopy size of average seedling at
    90 % emergence, the water threshold stress for canopy expansion and senescence
    together with their shape factors) are similar to those reported in the AquaCrop
    manual (Raes et al., 2012) and other papers simulating barley with AquaCrop (Abi
    Saab et al., 2015; Abrha et al., 2012; Araya et al., 2010; Pereira et al., 2015;
    Tavakoli et al., 2015), with the exception of the upper threshold for early canopy
    senescence (Table 4). This last parameter was significantly different from the
    references already cited (0.85 vs 0.55) because this cultivar is tolerant to water
    deficit as shown by the observed CC evolution for most of the deficit treatments
    over the three experimental years (Fig. 2a,b). Download : Download high-res image

    and observed soil water content (SWC) during the three experimental years by using
    AquaCrop (a) and MOPECO (b). The dashed line shows a 1:1 function. 3.1.2. Soil
    moisture The simulated soil water content (SWC) showed a suitable agreement with
    the observed data (Fig. 2a), reaching a high linear correlation (R2 = 0.88) and
    a strong goodness of fit (d = 0.96; EF = 0.87). The largest difference between
    observed and simulated data was reached in 2011(only one point; Fig. 2a) due to
    a significant rainfall event on the day before soil sampling. Nevertheless, errors
    were low (RMSE =6.32 mm), tending towards overestimation (MBE = 1.43 mm). Although
    the compared soil moisture dataset may be considered somewhat scarce, the statistical
    results are similar to those reported by other authors (Abrha et al., 2012; Pereira
    et al., 2015). 3.1.3. Aboveground biomass Independently of the treatment, aboveground
    biomass progression during the first cropping season (model validation) was properly
    simulated with respect to the observed data (Fig. 3). The large differences between
    simulated and observed data were obtained during the first growing stages (between
    1.28 × 103 kg ha−1 and 1.89 × 103 kg ha−1) while that differences were lower from
    mid-season stage to maturity (around 0.58 × 103 kg ha−1) (Fig. 3). Thus, the computed
    estimations errors for this variable were somewhat large (around 1.74 × 103 kg ha−1
    as average value), with the result that all treatments were overestimated by the
    model (MBE ranged from 0.38 × 103 kg ha−1 to 1.80 × 103 kg ha−1; Table 5). Nevertheless,
    observed and simulated values had a strong linear correlation (R2 > 0.91) and
    model efficiency and goodness of fit were high (EF > 0.79; d > 0.95; Table 5).

    Fig. 3. Observed vs. simulated aboveground biomass evolution for the six irrigation
    treatments during the first experimental season. The dashed line shows a 1:1 function.
    Abrha et al. (2012) simulated the biomass evolution of barley crop and reported
    mean RMSE values of around 1.5 × 103 kg ha−1, with variations between 0.6 and
    6.3 × 103 kg ha−1. Similar RMSE results have been reported by other authors when
    simulating this variable for crops such as maize (Abedinpour et al., 2012; Heng
    et al., 2009; Katerji et al., 2013), wheat (Andarzian et al., 2011) or barley
    (Abi Saab et al., 2015). The model parameters that had a significant influence
    on the simulated biomass evolution as the crop transpiration coefficient, the
    thresholds for stomatal closure, their shape factor and the cold stress were similar
    to those reported in the manual (Raes et al., 2012) (Table 4), and to the findings
    of other authors in studies on barley (Abrha et al., 2012; Araya et al., 2010).
    However, the normalized water productivity (WP*) calibrated as 18.5 g m−2 (Table
    4) was significantly higher than those parameterized in other works (between 12
    and 15 g m−2) (Abi Saab et al., 2015; Abrha et al., 2012; Araya et al., 2010;
    Pereira et al., 2015). This may be justified by the higher carbon assimilating
    rate of the cultivar used in this study (Table 2). Nevertheless, the WP* value
    obtained is within the range proposed by Raes et al. (2012) (15−20 g m−2). 3.1.4.
    Biomass, yield, and harvest index During the calibration year, biomass, yield
    and harvest index were adequately simulated, showing estimation errors of 0.73 × 103 kg ha−1,
    0.30 × 103 kg ha−1 and 0.02, respectively. In addition, the calibration model
    showed a well goodness of fit for the three analyzed variables (EF and d index > 0.90;
    Table 7), although the attained EF statistic for biomass and harvest index was
    moderate (0.65 and 0.70, respectively; Table 7). Nevertheless, the model showed
    a slight tendency to underestimate yield and harvest index, with a strong linear
    correlation between observed and simulated data (R2 > 0.90; Table 7). The obtained
    deviations between simulated and observed data for all the irrigation treatments
    were lower than ±10 % in three analyzed variables, being T6 at that limit (Table
    2). Table 7. Statistical indicators for biomass, yield and harvest index at harvest

    in B and Y); d: Willmott agreement index (dimensionless); R2 was obtained from
    the linear regression between simulated vs. observed values. Statistical indicators
    obtained for the validation process showed an adequate performance with the yield
    variable (low estimated errors and high index of agreement, Table 7). In addition,
    total biomass and harvest index attained moderate and poor goodness of fit for
    2013 (0.78 and 0.43 for d index and 0.39 and 0.14 for EF, respectively; Table
    7) and a poor d index and EF at harvest during 2011 (d = 0.18 and EF = −12.28;
    Table 7), with low or no linear correlation (R2 < 0.20; Table 7). Although, there
    was a lack of linear adjustment, the statistical errors obtained were low for
    both variables, showing a good fit with each other. These errors are similar to
    those reported by other authors (Abi Saab et al., 2015; Abrha et al., 2012; Araya
    et al., 2010). With respect to the deviations between simulated and observed harvest
    data during the two validation years, it is highlighted that almost all irrigation
    treatments computed values lower than ±10 %. Only T1 in 2011 and T6 in 2013 were
    outside this criterion for the simulated yield and biomass, respectively (Table
    2). The deviation results are similar to those reported by Pereira et al. (2015)
    using AquaCrop for barley. In general, the biomass and yield results of AquaCrop
    model during the three experimental seasons showed that an underestimation of
    biomass implies a similar result for yield, while this trend was not found for
    the harvest index (Table 2). Furthermore, the standard deviation of the observed
    data showed that the simulated values were included within their range. In addition,
    the number of treatments whose results showed deviations lower than ±10 % was
    higher than 75 % of the total (Table 2). On the basis of these results, AquaCrop
    was considered calibrated and validated for simulating a barley crop (Cierzo cultivar)
    under the semi-arid conditions of CLM. 3.2. Calibration and validation of MOPECO
    3.2.1. Soil moisture The simulated soil water content (SWC) showed an adequate
    goodness of fit to the observed data (Fig. 2b), achieving a good linear correlation
    and good agreement (R2 = 0.73; d = 0.87; EF = 0.55). Estimation errors were slightly
    high (RMSE = 11.50 mm), tending towards overestimation (MBE = 7.34 mm), but similar
    to those reported by other authors (Abrha et al., 2012; Pereira et al., 2015).
    3.2.2. Maximum yield (Ym) The average yield of the non-deficit treatments was
    9.000 × 103 kg ha−1 (Table 2), which was considered as Ym during the simulations
    (Table 5). This potential yield is lower than that observed by Jamieson et al.
    (1995) for a “Triumph” cultivar cropped in New Zealand (9.670 × 103 kg ha−1),
    and similar to the yields obtained by Domínguez et al. (2017) in CLM for the “Scarlett”
    cultivar (9.236 × 103 kg ha−1). In addition, it was within the range of the values
    reached by Cossani et al. (2009) in Agramunt (Spain) for three cultivars under
    non-deficit conditions (between 3.800 and 10.200 × 103 kg ha−1), and higher than
    the yield obtained by Abrha et al. (2012) in 5 different Mediterranean areas cropping
    5 cultivars under no water deficit conditions (between 2.000 and 6.000 × 103 kg ha−1).
    3.2.3. Yield response factor (Ky) By using the soil water and evapotranspiration
    balance simulation module of MOPECO, as well as the data collected by the weather
    station at the experimental plots, the ETa/ETm rates were calculated for each
    Ky stage (Fig. 4). Treatments achieved the lowest global ETa/ETm rates in 2012
    (Fig. 4b). Nevertheless, in none of the three years was the crop under water deficit
    conditions (ETa/ETm = 1) during the first Ky stage, conditioning the calibration
    of the Ky value for this stage (Fig. 4). This finding is common for the majority
    of the crops sown in winter in the area because it is a rainy season and the evapotranspiration
    demand of the atmosphere is low (Domínguez et al., 2012b, 2013). Moreover, treatments
    in 2012 showed a higher variability in the ETa/ETm values reached at each Ky stages
    suffering water deficit conditions at least during two Ky stages. For that reason,
    this year was selected for the calibration of the model. In 2011 and 2013 (Fig.
    4a and c), the maximum water deficit occurred during Ky (iii), while in 2012 it
    was during Ky (ii) (Fig. 4b). Download : Download high-res image (182KB) Download

    observed one, the dot will be placed on the continuous line. Dotted lines represent
    the maximum and minimum accepted variation (±10 %) between simulated and observed
    values. The fit to the model in the yield simulation (RMSE < 0.33 × 103 kg ha−1
    and high goodness of fit, d and EF > 0.82; Table 7) was better than that achieved
    by Rötter et al. (2012) using nine crop models for simulating 44 growing seasons
    of spring barley at seven different study sites in Europe (Czech Republic, Denmark,
    Finland and Slovakia), and by Abi Saab et al. (2015) using CropSyst and AquaCrop
    to simulate barley (cv. Ponente) in Southern Italy. In contrast, Abrha et al.
    (2012) found a slightly higher goodness of fit simulating 5 different cultivars
    of spring barley (Birguda, Ponente, Arabi Abiad, Beecher and Maris Badger) at
    different locations in Ethiopia, Italy, Syria and Montana (USA). According to
    the Ky values obtained in the calibration and validation process, Ky (ii) “flowering”
    was the most sensitive stage to water deficit (Table 5). Hence, the yield of T4
    in 2013 decreased by 18 % with regards to T3 when a 28 % deficit (ETa/ETm = 0.72)
    was applied in Ky (ii) (Fig. 4c). This result coincides with the conclusions of
    other authors in research on cereals (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979; Farré and Faci,
    2006). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have been conducted using the
    equation proposed by Stewart et al. (1977) to simulate barley. Consequently, it
    was not possible to compare the Ky values obtained in this study with those proposed
    by other authors. According to Albrizio et al. (2010), the response of this crop
    to water deficit is similar to that of spring wheat. Moreover, Ky values proposed
    by several authors for wheat (Day et al., 1987; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979; Francia
    et al., 2011) are similar to those determined for barley in the present research.
    As it was not possible to calibrate Ky (i) (Fig. 4), we assumed the value recommended
    by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). MOPECO uses global Ky to simulate the response
    of crops under salinity conditions (Domínguez et al., 2011). The value obtained
    in the calibration and validation process was 1.10 (Table 5), which is slightly
    lower than the one stated by Pereira et al. (2015) for the whole growing period
    (1.25). On the basis of these results, MOPECO was considered to be calibrated
    and validated for simulating a barley crop (Cierzo cultivar) under the semi-arid
    conditions in CLM up to global deficit levels of ETa/ETm > 0.73. Therefore, the
    calibrated values must be applied with caution under more restrictive conditions,
    mainly if stress is caused during the Ky (i) stage (not calibrated). 3.2.4. Maximum
    ETa/ETm difference between consecutive Ky stages for ORDI methodology The ORDI
    methodology requires stating the maximum difference “e” in terms of deficit (ETa/ETm)
    between two consecutive Ky stages (Domínguez et al., 2012a). Instead of the average
    values (Fig. 5), we compared the results of all the repetitions with the simulations.
    Thus, differences higher than 0.25 increased the percentage of non-fitting cases
    (Fig. 6). For this reason, e = 0.25 was stated for the ORDI methodology (Table
    5). This value is lower than those determined for other annual crops in the area,
    such as maize (0.3), onion (0.4) and garlic (0.4) (Domínguez et al., 2012a,b,
    2013). Therefore, in barley, it is important to accurately control the deficit
    in the different stages in order to avoid excessive values in certain Ky stages
    that may notably affect the final yield. Download : Download high-res image (170KB)

    3.3. Comparison of models In terms of crop simulation, AquaCrop provides more
    information than MOPECO as the objective of the two models is different. Consequently,
    compared to MOPECO, AquaCrop facilitates a more-in-depth study of the effect of
    the irrigation schedules on different physiological and growth parameters of the
    crop (Table 8). The simulated soil moisture and yield data by both models showed
    that there were no differences between AquaCrop and MOPECO with respect to the
    observed data (Table 9). Soil moisture was overestimated between 1.8 % and 8.8
    % by AquaCrop and MOPECO, respectively. In other hand, differences between simulated
    and observed yields were similar (around 1.6 %), being over and underestimated
    by both of them, respectively (Table 9). Among experimental years, there were
    significant differences for soil moisture, which could be due to randomly, while
    crop yield was no affected (Table 9). Table 8. Main parameters simulated by AquaCrop

    not used in the calibration and validation of both models were compared (infiltration,
    percolation from root area, ETm and ETa) (Table 10). For both models, the amount
    of infiltrated water was practically the same. Differences may be attributed to
    the fact that MOPECO considers the decimal values of the amount of rainfall and
    irrigation, while AquaCrop uses entire numbers. Nevertheless, MOPECO systematically
    simulated higher volumes of percolated water than AquaCrop at both treatment level
    and across experimental years. This difference is a result of the different methodologies
    used by the models when simulating the movement of water in the soil. AquaCrop
    uses the drainage function (Raes et al., 2012), which is more precise and requires
    a higher number of parameters (Table 2) than that used by MOPECO (when the amount
    of water in the root area is higher than field capacity, the difference is considered
    as percolation) (Domínguez et al., 2011). In the simulations, AquaCrop reduced
    the amount of percolated water with respect to MOPECO by between 30 and 70 mm,
    which may also justify the higher values of ETa achieved by all the treatments
    when using the former model (Table 10). Table 10. Comparison of the simulated

    ETa: actual evapotranspiration; Aq: AquaCrop; MO: MOPECO. The simplicity of MOPECO
    in terms of algorithms used in the soil water balance (Domínguez et al., 2011),
    as well as the use of the single Kc instead of the dual Kc procedure (Allen et
    al., 1998), generates larger errors in the SWC estimation than AquaCrop (Fig.
    2). In this study, MOPECO overestimated SWC, determining higher volumes of percolated
    water. As a consequence of the previous results, the values of ETm simulated by
    both models show large differences over the three experimental years (around 95,
    136 and 78 mm for 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively; Table 10). Analyzing the
    reference treatment (T3), MOPECO simulated similar values of ETa and ETm (differences
    between 0 and 9 mm; Table 10), which implies that T3 reached the maximum yield
    (Ym) as this treatment did not undergo water deficit stress (Eq. (2)). However,
    ETa and ETm values simulated by AquaCrop for the same treatment were notably different
    in the three years (43, 86 and 53 mm in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively; Table
    10). According to the results, AquaCrop considered that the irrigation management
    in T3 reduced the potential evaporation from the bare soil (around 55 %) and during
    the first stages of the canopy develops (until reaching the 60 % of maximum CC),
    which were lower than those considered as maximum by the model (70 %, 56 % and
    78 % of the maximum evaporation in 2011, 2012 and 2013, respectively). In this
    sense, it is worth noting that the maximum soil evaporation coefficient (Kex)
    used for the calibration and validation of AquaCrop was 1.10 (Allen et al., 1998).
    Moreover, Torres and Calera (2010), in a study carried out in an area with similar
    soil properties to those in this research, stated that FAO-56 methodology overestimates
    evaporation from bare soil (consequently, also during the beginning of the crop
    development), which may justify the differences between the maximum and real evaporation
    simulations when using AquaCrop (Table 9). Nevertheless, the water requirements
    of the crop in T3 were fully satisfied during the three years, as considered by
    MOPECO (Table 10). The great results obtained by both models highlight the importance
    of adapting these tools to the knowledge and necessities of the productive sector.
    In this sense, the SUPROMED project (GA-1813) funded by PRIMA and coordinated
    by the UCLM group aims to adapt and transfer MOPECO and other tools to the productive
    sector through an online platform. The objective is to improve the resilience
    of Mediterranean agricultural systems to global warming using existing methods
    and technologies not yet available for the productive sector. 4. Conclusions The
    AquaCrop and MOPECO models were calibrated and validated for a barley crop cultivated
    in the semi-arid conditions of southeast Spain. The results of AquaCrop for evolution
    of canopy cover, biomass, crop yield and soil water content showed high goodness
    of fit between simulated and observed values. In the case of MOPECO, similar results
    were obtained for the final yield, and for the evolution of soil moisture. The
    calibrated values of Ky for MOPECO will allow simulations of barley in this area
    and will serve as a reference in others, given the lack of information about Ky
    parameters for this crop in the literature. Moreover, the calibration of this
    model will facilitate the implementation of optimized regulated deficit irrigation
    (ORDI) strategies in order to achieve higher productivity of the irrigation water
    supplied to this crop. The comparison between the two models showed that AquaCrop
    is a better model for simulating and analyzing the effect of a particular irrigation
    schedule on a crop compared to MOPECO. Nevertheless, if the objective is to estimate
    yield, MOPECO is also valid and simpler to calibrate. In the present study, the
    use of both models improves the simulation of the effects of deficit irrigation
    strategies. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have

    1 Introduction Operation schedules of canal irrigation systems have often been
    developed based on previous irrigation management experiences in many irrigation
    districts of China. Due to the lack of rationality of water allocation schemes,
    some canals with low-flow allocation will probably lead to long-distance transportation
    of water over the whole canal system. More irrigation water is lost to leakage
    the longer water is entrapped in the canal system. In order to reasonably arrange
    operation schedules of canal systems and achieve higher system utility, it is
    necessary to develop irrigation water allocation models for canal systems. A number
    of optimization models for irrigation water allocation have been developed and
    tested in various irrigation districts. For example, Wang (1995) presented a zero-one
    programming model for optimal flow scheduling in irrigation canals. Calderon et
    al. (2016) proposed a dynamic model obtained from an identification procedure
    based on real-time data. Its aim was to achieve effective control of water allocation
    in an irrigation canal system, improving operational efficiency and reducing water
    losses. Bolea and Puig (2016) developed an optimization model considering uncertainties
    in the estimation of delays in water allocation and variations of plant characteristics.
    The above models were mainly for optimal flow regulation and reducing operation
    frequency of head gates. A major deficiency of these models is that they do not
    consider the influence of groundwater on crops, which restricts the model application
    to well-canal combined irrigation districts where surface water and groundwater
    are the main water sources. The combined use of groundwater and surface water
    for agricultural irrigation is a main irrigation pattern for most irrigation districts
    in China. Groundwater, an important irrigation water resource, should be integrated
    into agricultural water resources management (Wu et al. 2016). In order to optimize
    irrigation water allocation accurately, many models considering the utilization
    of groundwater have been developed in recent decades. For example, Tabari and
    Mari (2016) proposed a model based on the Manning equation for optimum design
    of a canal section with the least water loss in transferring networks of irrigation
    water. To provide the exact amount of canal seepage loss, the groundwater level
    was considered in the model. Kilic and Anac (2010) developed a multi-objective
    planning model in order to achieve economic, social, and environmental benefits
    and applied it to the Menemen Left Bank Irrigation System of the Lower Gediz Basin
    in Turkey. Using these models, decision makers and stakeholders can increase the
    total irrigation area and reduce water losses through allocating limited water
    resources. However, these models do not consider uncertainties in the utilization
    of groundwater. Instead, the amount of groundwater is regarded as a constant of
    optimal models, which is too simple to truly reflect the impacts of variance in
    groundwater utilization during irrigation. It is necessary to consider uncertainties
    of the utilization of groundwater in water allocation management models for irrigation
    canals. In fact, because of pre-existing groundwater wells in most irrigation
    districts, the wells cannot be rearranged and used optimally by decision makers
    and stakeholders. Furthermore, the management of irrigation districts faces challenges
    in making and implementing a detailed irrigation scheme related to the distribution
    of groundwater. Because groundwater wells are discretely distributed in space
    and due to stochastic distributions of groundwater utilization in time, the actual
    area irrigated by groundwater has an increasing trend with a prolonged waiting
    time for irrigation. The area irrigated by groundwater increases rapidly with
    waiting time for irrigation by surface water, but increases slowly at a later
    stage owing to the limited groundwater availability and the limited total irrigation
    area. To account for this phenomenon, queuing theory can be adopted to describe
    the utility distribution of groundwater over time. At present, few studies combining
    queuing theory with groundwater irrigation have been conducted. Batabyal (1996)
    was the first to apply queuing theory to model a groundwater management problem
    from a long-run perspective. The proposed models, however, are simple because
    they are based on the M/M/1 and the M/G/1 queues. The first letter, M, represents
    a Poisson process for input, and the inter-arrival times of the users depend on
    a negative exponential distribution. The second letter, M or G, refers to the
    fact that the input is a Poisson process, and the service provider’s supply times
    depend on a negative exponential distribution or general distribution. The number
    1 means that there is only one service provider in the system (Inoue 2019). Various
    optimal management software/decision support systems (DSS) for irrigation water
    have been developed, such as the DSS for available surface and groundwater resources
    (Page et al. 2012), the DSS based on GIS (Urrestarazu et al. 2012), the DSS based
    on WEBGIS (Chen et al. 2009), the DSS for reducing the gap between canal supplies
    (Rao and Rajput 2009), the DSS focused on agricultural non-point sources pollution
    (Li et al. 2014), and the DSS based on uncertain water availability (Yang et al.
    2017). The DSS for irrigation water management has attracted increasing attention.
    However, the DSS with queuing theory integrated into the management of groundwater
    in an irrigation canal system is lacking. This study developed an irrigation water
    allocation model based on queuing theory. The model was then applied to the Shijin
    irrigation district in China. On this basis, an IOMSD (Irrigation Optimization
    Management for Shijin irrigation district Decision Support System) was designed.
    2 Study Area The Shijin irrigation district is located in Hebei province of China.
    Its designated irrigation area is about 1.67 × 105 ha. Irrigation surface water
    comes from Huangbizhuang Reservoir and Gangnan Reservoir through an irrigation
    canal system, and groundwater comes from wells. There are five main irrigation
    subareas that occupy more than 99% of the irrigation area in the whole irrigation
    canal system, which are considered the study area. The distribution of irrigation
    canals is shown in Fig. 1a, and surface water flow goes from west to east. The
    irrigation region is concentrated in the southern part of the main channels. The
    structure of the canal system has a dendritic morphology, including main channels,
    trunk canals, branch canals, lateral canals, and other smaller canals. In order
    to simplify the optimal model, only main channels and trunk canals are considered.
    Distribution of main channels and trunk canals are shown in Fig. 1b. Surface water
    flows through main channels (a1, a2, a3, a4, and a5), and then through trunk canals
    (b1, b2, b3, b4, and b5) that carry water to each subarea. Subarea divisions (c1,
    c2, c3, c4, and c5) are shown in Fig. 1c. For local wheat, spring irrigation is
    supplied once in a normal year. Fig. 1 Irrigation canal distribution and subarea
    division Full size image 3 Model 3.1 System Objectives Water transportation time
    directly determines the management and power costs of agricultural irrigation.
    When water is entrapped in a canal system for a long time, there is higher leakage
    of irrigation water. High water supply is needed to ensure a sufficient amount
    of irrigation water, which results in increased power cost. Therefore, the minimum
    water transportation time is regarded as the primary goal, and is determined as
    follows: $$ \\min \\kern0.5em {f}_1=\\max \\left({Te}_i\\right) $$ (1) where f1
    (d) is the first objective function, and the last end time for irrigation of all
    the channels is used to represent the end time for irrigation of the whole irrigation
    system; i is the index of the main channel or trunk canals; and Tei (d) is the
    end time of irrigation of channel bi. To make the irrigation system more manageable
    and reduce the difficulty of the solving process, Tei was regarded as an integer.
    In other words, irrigation conditions of each day are considered constant over
    the whole irrigation period. Because of the integer nature of Tei, the optimal
    results may occur with multiple schemes. Although these schemes have equal irrigation
    objectives, f1, the loss of irrigation water for each scheme, is likely to be
    unequal. Hence, the second objective is defined as follows: $$ \\min \\kern0.5em
    {f}_2=\\sum \\limits_{i=1}^I\\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T\\left(Q{a}_{it}^{\\prime }+Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime}\\right)
    $$ (2) where f2 (m3) is the second objective function, which represents the loss
    of irrigation water during an irrigation period; t (d) is the irrigation time;
    I is the number of tubes; T (d) is the planned days of irrigation, i.e. max(Tei);
    \\( Q{a}_{it}^{\\prime } \\) (m3/s) is the conveyance losses of flow of main channel
    ai at day t; and \\( Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime } \\) is the conveyance losses of flow
    of trunk canal bi. When solving the model, the objective f1 was solved first to
    determine the minimum irrigation days. Then objective f2 was solved to determine
    the specific irrigation water amounts and periods. 3.2 System Constraints The
    objective functions are subject to irrigation water amount, flow velocity, irrigation
    time, etc. (1) Surface water supply constraint The total water allocation should
    not exceed the available water during the irrigation period. Because all the irrigation
    water amounts will go through the first part (a1) of the main channel, the flow
    and seepage quantities of the terminus of a1 were calculated as the actual water
    amount: $$ \\sum \\limits_{t=1}^T86400\\left({Qa}_{1t}+Q{a}_{1t}^{\\prime}\\right)\\le
    Ws $$ (3) where Qa1t (m3/s) is the flow at the terminus of the main channel a1
    on day t; \\( Q{a}_{1t}^{\\prime } \\) (m3/s) is the conveyance losses of flow
    of main channel a1 on day t; and Ws (m3) is the maximum water diverted for irrigation.
    Assuming that the lining structure of the main channel and trunk canal are the
    same, the transportation losses can be expressed as (Buras 1972): $$ Q{a}_{it}^{\\prime
    }=\\frac{ALa_i{Qa}_{it}^{1-m}}{100}\\kern2.5em \\forall i,t $$ (4) where A is
    the permeability coefficient of the channel bed; m is the permeation coefficient
    of soil of the channel bed; and Lai (km) is the length of the main channel ai.
    The flows and the losses at the cross points of main channels and trunk canals
    should be balanced. The mathematical formula can be expressed as follows: $$ {Qa}_{it}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{Qa}_{i+1\\kern0.5em
    t}+Q{a}_{i+1\\kern0.5em t}^{\\prime }+{Qb}_{it}+Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime}\\kern2.5em
    \\left(i<\\mathrm{Imax}\\right)\\\\ {}{Qb}_{it}+Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime}\\kern14em
    \\left(i=\\mathrm{Imax}\\right)\\kern0.5em \\end{array}\\right.\\kern2.7em \\forall
    i,t $$ (5) where Qbit (m3/s) is the flow at the terminus of trunk canal bi on
    day t; and Imax is the maximum quantity of the main channel or trunk canals. In
    order to avoid changing the flow of trunk canals frequently and reduce the management
    cost, the flow will maintain constant intensity when the trunk canal is working.
    Therefore, Qi is introduced in the following formula for the flow of the trunk
    canal. $$ {Qb}_{it}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{Q}_i\\kern2.5em t>={Ts}_i\\kern0.5em
    \\&\\kern0.5em t<={Te}_i\\\\ {}0\\kern3em \\mathrm{other}\\end{array}\\right.\\kern2.5em
    \\forall i $$ (6) where Tsi (d) represents the start time for irrigation of trunk
    canal bi; and Qi (m3/s) is the flow of the terminus of trunk canal bi when it
    is working. The conveyance losses of trunk canals can be expressed as: $$ Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime
    }=\\frac{ALb_i{Qb}_{it}^{1-m}}{100}\\kern2.5em \\forall i $$ (7) where Lbi (km)
    is the length of trunk canal bi. (2) Water conveyance capacity constraint The
    flow of the canal head for each part of the main channel should not exceed 1.2
    times the corresponding designated flow: $$ {Qa}_{it}+Q{a}_{it}^{\\prime}\\le
    1.2{ Qa g}_i\\kern2.5em \\forall i,t $$ (8) where Qagi (m3/s) is the designated
    flow of the main channel ai. Similarly, the flow of the channel head of each trunk
    canal should be within a certain scope. This scope varies from 0.8 to 1.2 times
    the designated flow: $$ {Qb}_{it}+Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime}\\ge 0.8{ Qb g}_i\\kern2.5em
    \\forall i,t $$ (9) $$ {Qb}_{it}+Q{b}_{it}^{\\prime}\\le 1.2{ Qb g}_i\\kern2.5em
    \\forall i,t $$ (10) where Qbgi (m3/s) is the designated flow of trunk canal bi.
    (3) Constraints on irrigation water amount in subareas Irrigation water sources
    in subareas include surface water and groundwater, and the total irrigation water
    amount of subareas should satisfy the designated irrigation water amount of the
    subarea: $$ \\sum \\limits_{t=0}^{Te}\\left(86400{\\eta}_a{Qb}_{it}+10{Ar}_i{P}_{it}\\right)\\ge
    \\left({Ar}_i-{ Ar g}_i\\right)M\\kern2.5em \\forall i $$ (11) where ηa is the
    irrigation efficiency of trunk canals; Ari (ha) is the total irrigation area of
    the studied area of subarea ci; Pit (mm) is the effective rainfall of subarea
    ci at day t; Argi (ha) is the irrigation area irrigated by groundwater in subarea
    ci; and M (m3/ha) is the irrigation quota of the studied crops. (4) Groundwater
    availability constraint The groundwater for irrigation should not exceed the allowable
    amount of groundwater withdrawal. $$ {Arg}_iM\\le {\\eta}_b{Wg}_i\\kern2.5em \\forall
    i $$ (12) where ηb is the utilization efficiency of groundwater; and Wgi (m3)
    is the allowable amount of groundwater withdrawal in subarea ci. (5) Irrigation
    area constraint Surface water and groundwater are the two irrigation sources.
    The irrigation action of surface water involves unified planning of the whole
    irrigation area, while the irrigation action of groundwater involves autonomic
    activity of farmers. Groundwater wells are discretely distributed in the whole
    irrigation district, so the irrigation time and amount cannot be assessed by scientific
    management. During the critical periods of crop growth, when surface water is
    not available for irrigation for a long time, groundwater will be used by farmers.
    In other words, there is a relationship between the area irrigated by groundwater
    and the waiting time in the irrigation period. Yang (2016) developed a model based
    on queuing theory involving M/M/C queues for the combined use of groundwater and
    surface water. The third letter, C, refers to finite service providers. The changing
    area irrigated by groundwater with time approximately follows a Poisson distribution,
    and the relationship can be expressed as: $$ F\\left(\\frac{\\lambda_i}{Arg_i}{Te}_i\\right)\\le
    1-\\Pr \\kern2.5em \\forall i $$ (13) where F is the probability distribution
    function of the irrigation queue of groundwater, and the influential parameters
    include Argi, λi, and Tei; λi is the average value of increased area irrigated
    by groundwater per unit time; and Pr is the design dependability of area irrigated
    by surface water. (6) Irrigation time of canals constraint For a certain canal,
    the end time of irrigation is higher than the start time. $$ {Ts}_i\\le {Te}_i\\kern2.5em
    \\forall i $$ (14) (7) Non-negative constraint The decision variables are Qait,
    Qbit, Tsi, and Tei. These variables should be non-negative. $$ {Qa}_{it}\\ge 0\\kern2.5em
    \\forall i,t $$ (15) $$ {Qb}_{it}\\ge 0\\kern2.5em \\forall i,t $$ (16) $$ {Ts}_i\\ge
    0\\kern2.5em \\forall i $$ (17) $$ {Te}_i\\ge 0\\kern2.5em \\forall i $$ (18)
    4 The Developed IOMSD As the core module of the developed system, the model above
    was established for supporting irrigation scheduling decisions. Based on the model,
    a computer program for a mathematical solution was programed, and the IOMSD was
    developed. The structure of the developed IOMSD is described in Fig. 2. The system
    consists of four main layers: interaction, database, program, and model. (1) The
    interaction layer was designed with three main functions: canal system information
    input, solving parameter set, and chart results display. All the functions can
    be operated using buttons in the software interface. Their communication with
    other layers can be achieved by operating the database. (2) The database layer
    was designed with four databases: canal system information database, solving program
    parameter database, optimal irrigation scheme database, and Geographic Information
    System (GIS) database. The main functions of the database layer are transmitting
    data information between the interaction layer and the program layer. For example,
    the canal system information database contacts the canal system set to the optimal
    irrigation scheme solving program; the solving program parameter database contacts
    the solving parameter set for the optimal irrigation scheme solving program; the
    optimal irrigation scheme database contacts the optimal irrigation scheme solving
    program for the chart results display; and the GIS database auxiliary links to
    the chart results display. (3) The program layer was designed to solve the optimal
    irrigation model using the canal system information database. The solving efficiency
    of the program is affected by the solving program parameter database. The optimal
    solution gives a detailed water allocation scheme for different times and canals
    in the irrigation district. (4) The model layer, the core of the developed IOMSD,
    defines the logical framework of the system, and directly determines the forms
    of input data and optimal irrigation scheme solutions. Fig. 2 Structure of the
    IOMSD. Arrows show the direction of information flow Full size image As shown
    in Fig. 2, these four layers together constitute the developed IOMSD. Decision
    makers can obtain a detailed water allocation scheme by operating the IOMSD. According
    to the optimization model and the system framework, the IOMSD was developed. The
    particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm was adopted for solving the optimization
    model. The system includes three modules: the data input module, the model solution
    module, and the results demonstration module. The IOMSD interface is described
    in Supplemental Material S1. After solving the model using this tool, the corresponding
    solutions are dynamically displayed in a topographic map. 5 Results 5.1 Analysis
    of Results By operating the IOMSD, the optimal distribution schemes of water resources
    in the Shijin Irrigation District in China can be obtained. The optimal flow of
    the terminus of the trunk canals is shown in Fig. 3. The figure indicates that
    trunk canal b1 starts watering on the first day and lasts 27 days, and water supply
    intensity achieves 14.200 m3/s. Trunk canal b1 is the nearest to the canal head
    (Fig. 1b), in other words, the distance of subarea c1 from the canal head is the
    shortest. In the same type of canals, the shorter distance leads to lower water
    loss and higher utilization efficiency of surface water resources. There is a
    major advantage to using surface water to irrigate this subarea, and the optimal
    results show that this subarea was irrigated by surface water only. Fig. 3 Optimal
    flow of the termini of the trunk canals Full size image The irrigation area (c2=8379
    ha) of trunk canal b2 is smaller than c1, c3, and c4, but the conveyance capacity
    is not lower, reaching 15 m3/s. There is sufficient time to irrigate over the
    whole irrigation period. Therefore, the subarea c2 can be irrigated from day 19
    to day 36, and a more detailed allocation strategy of the subarea will be developed.
    The irrigation conditions of trunk canals b3 and b4 are similar to that of trunk
    canal b2, and they start irrigating several days after the start day. Trunk canals
    b2, b3, and b4 finish irrigating at day 36. In comparison, trunk canal b5 is relatively
    unique. Its irrigation cycle began at day 6 and finished at day 54. The reason
    is that trunk canal b5 has the smallest water supply capacity (4.4 m3/s), which
    requires a longer time to irrigate to satisfy water demand. As shown in Fig. 3,
    the main working times of the five trunk canals are before day 36. At the beginning
    of day 37, the utilization rate of the system is particularly low, with only trunk
    canal b5 functioning. Therefore, if the irrigation time of trunk canal b5 is adjustable,
    i.e. finishing irrigating at day 36, then the conveyance efficiency of the whole
    system will be increased significantly. One feasible method includes transforming
    trunk canal b5 by widening the canal to decrease the whole irrigation time and
    the loss from leakage. Another method is to decrease the planting area of crops
    with high water requirements in subarea c5; in doing so, the cultivation ratio
    of low consumption crops would increase relatively, and then the water demand
    will decrease. In order to study the impacts of flow of trunk canals on the main
    channel, the relationship between flow and time was plotted (Fig. 4). Because
    canal head a0 and the terminus of the main channel a1 were simultaneously affected
    by variations in the flow of all the trunk canals, the flows of these two checkpoints
    can be modified. For the canal head, the peak flow occurs at day 27 with the flow
    of 80.348 m3/s, and this peak point only lasted 1 day. The lower values of irrigation
    occur from day 37 to 54 with the flow of 7.466 m3/s lasting 18 days. The changing
    trend of flow of the terminus of a0 is similar to that of the main channel a1.
    The peak point appears at day 27 with a flow of 71.266 m3/s and it lasts only
    1 day. The peak point of the terminus of the main channel a2 appears from day
    27 to day 34 with the flow of 53.684 m3/s. The peak point of the terminus of the
    main channel a3 appears from day 19 to day 34 with the flow of 38.708 m3/s. The
    peak point of the terminus of the main channel a4 appears from day 15 to day 34
    with the flow of 18.528 m3/s. The flow of the terminus of the main channel a5
    is stable with the flow of 4.482 m3/s. Comparing these results and Fig. 4 shows
    that the main channels in the lower reaches have fewer irrigation subareas, so
    changing the canal’s flow is smoother. On the contrary, changing the canal flow
    is more complicated in the upper reaches of the canal head, and the peak flow
    is also high. Fig. 4 Relationship between flow and time. a1, a2, a3, a4, and a5
    represent the five termini of the main channel. a0 represents the canal head.
    Dashed lines indicate the average water flow from day 1 to 36 and from day 1 to
    54 Full size image Using the asymmetrical coefficient of water diversion (dividing
    the maximum value by the average value) to describe the changing conditions of
    the flow of the canal head results in an asymmetrical coefficient of water diversion
    from day 1 to day 36 of 1.793 (80.348/44.817), and an asymmetrical coefficient
    of water diversion from day 1 to day 54 of 2.482 (80.348/32.366). 5.2 Scheme Improvement
    From Figs. 3 and 4, it can be seen that the adjustment frequency of the trunk
    canals is high. From the beginning to the end of irrigation, it needs to be adjusted
    10 times. A high frequency of operation means higher working loads for the managing
    personnel. This could cause the flow of the main channel to change significantly
    (see the changes of a0 in Fig. 4). In order to decrease the artificial adjustment
    times of the main channel, and let the trunk canals with approximately the same
    start times and end times operate at the same time after adjustments, a hierarchical
    cluster analysis was conducted. The input data of the hierarchical cluster analysis
    are the start times and the end times of irrigation of the five trunk canals.
    A dendrogram using average linkage is shown in Supplemental Material S2. Through
    a cluster analysis, similar operations can be merged to reduce operation of the
    canal system. According to the dendrogram, the time period was divided into five
    groups. The first group includes the final irrigation times of b2, b3, and b4.
    The second group includes the final irrigation time of b1 and the start irrigation
    time of b2. The third group includes the start irrigation time of b3 and b4. The
    fourth group includes the start irrigation time of b1 and b5. The last group is
    the final irrigation time of b5. The optimization strategies were improved by
    condensing the irrigation period to 36 days to increase the efficiency of the
    whole system. After day 36, subarea c5 still needs irrigation. In order to obtain
    sufficient water supply, ground water exploitation and changes in planting configuration
    (such as planting more low water consumption crops) were encouraged. The improved
    optimal water allocation flow of the terminus of the trunk canals is shown in
    Fig. 5. Fig. 5 The improved optimal water allocation flow of the termini of the
    trunk canals Full size image From Fig. 5, it can be seen that the trunk canals
    were only adjusted four times. The irrigation time of trunk canal b1 remained
    unchanged. The operation time for trunk canal b2 was postponed 1 day. The start
    irrigation time of trunk canal b3 was moved forward by 2 days, and its flow changed
    from 18.125 m3/s to 16.313 m3/s. The irrigation time of trunk canal b4 was postponed
    2 days. The irrigation time of trunk canal b5 started from the first day and ended
    at day 36. All trunk canals ended irrigation at day 36 except trunk canal b1,
    which ended at day 27. The improved flow of the main channel is shown in Fig.
    6. Compared with Fig. 4, the changes in flow of the canal head are obvious. There
    are only two ranges of variation, 25.355 m3/s and 62.210 ± 0.855 m3/s. Fewer changes
    in the flow benefited monitoring and management of canals. The peak point decreased
    from 80.348 m3/s to 63.065 m3/s, and the asymmetrical coefficient decreased to
    1.375 (63.065/45.877). The decrease of the peak flow value resulted in canals
    with greater space for water diversion to cope with emergencies, and the whole
    irrigation system would thus be safer and more reliable. Figure 7 compared utilization
    rates of trunk canals (the percentage of the usage days of trunk canals for the
    whole irrigation period). Improved schemes increased by 8.3% (b2) to 25% (b1).
    Higher utilization rates of trunk canals can make management more concentrated
    and convenient, and thus result in higher utilization rates of the system. Fig.
    6 Improved flow of the main channel. Dashed lines indicate the average water flow
    from day 1 to 36 Full size image Fig. 7 Utilization rates of trunk canals Full
    size image The irrigation water demand of subarea c5 of the improved schemes decreased
    by 3.937 × 106 m3. If the planting configuration remained unchanged without decreasing
    irrigation areas, 126 wells need to increase up to a water yield of 42.5 m3/h
    per well. Subarea c5 is located far from the water source, leading to higher irrigation
    costs. Therefore, planting more low consumption crops in subarea c5 was suggested.
    Conveyance losses between the optimal scheme and the improved optimal scheme are
    shown in Fig. 8. Conveyance loss at day 36 is 34.35 × 106 m3 in the optimal scheme
    as shown in Fig. 8a, and it is 31.87 × 106 m3 in the improved optimal scheme as
    shown in Fig. 8b. Conveyance loss at day 36 is not too different between the optimal
    scheme and the improved optimal scheme, because the gap is 2.48 × 106 m3. Nevertheless,
    irrigation needs to continue until day 54 for the optimal scheme, so the total
    conveyance loss is 39.11 × 106 m3. In the last 18 days, the conveyance loss is
    high, since only subarea c5 is irrigated. For the improved optimal scheme, more
    well water is used to meet the demands of subarea c5. The additional groundwater
    loss is 3.35 × 106 m3, with groundwater irrigation efficiency of 0.85. The total
    conveyance loss of the improved optimal scheme is 35.22 × 106 m3, which would
    reduce the loss by 3.89 × 106 m3. Fig. 8 Comparison of conveyance losses between
    the optimal scheme and the improved optimal scheme Full size image 6 Discussion
    In this study, an irrigated water management model based on queuing theory has
    been established, which considers the stochastic characteristics of temporal and
    spatial distributions of groundwater utilization. This kind of model is rare in
    past agricultural water resource management models. It is difficult to deal with
    the groundwater quantity as an uncertainty variable. Many previous models assumed
    it is a constant (Ren et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019), an interval value (Xie et
    al. 2018), or a fuzzy number (Pal and Datta 2019). To handle the uncertainty of
    groundwater, queuing theory is undoubtedly a feasible method. The IOMSD was also
    designed on the assumption of queuing characteristics of groundwater utilization.
    The system consists of an interaction layer, a database layer, a program layer,
    and a model layer. The input and output data of the IOMSD are mainly water quantity,
    for which input data includes the designated flow of the terminus of the main
    channel and trunk canal, the effective rainfall and the allowable amount of groundwater
    withdrawal; output data includes the flow of the terminus of main channel, the
    conveyance losses of flow of the main channel, the flow of the terminus of the
    trunk canal and the conveyance losses of flow of the trunk canal. Besides these
    conventional water quantity parameters, water quantity irrigated by groundwater
    was described by a Poisson distribution. The key of IOMSD application is determining
    the average value of increased area irrigated by groundwater per unit time, λi.
    In addition, irrigation water is assumed to be constant in days, and changes in
    flows are assumed to occur only at the same moment during irrigation. The IOMSD
    is suitable for use where groundwater wells are discretely distributed, and farmers
    are free to choose when to use groundwater for irrigation. In such irrigation
    districts where groundwater is concentrated in terms of distribution and management,
    the IOMSD is not favorable to reflect uncertainty of groundwater. 7 Conclusion
    An IOMSD was developed to support management of an agricultural irrigation system.
    The optimization model, which is the core of the system, was developed with the
    objectives of minimum irrigation periods and minimum leakage losses of flow, and
    queuing theory was integrated to describe the utilization conditions of groundwater.
    The developed IOMSD included modules of data inputs, model solution and results
    demonstration, and is simple to operate. The PSO method was adopted to solve the
    optimization model and the results were displayed using GIS. The developed IOMSD
    was applied to deal with issues of canal water optimal distribution of the Shijin
    Irrigation District. Results show the system utilization rates are particularly
    low between day 37 to day 54, and only trunk canal b5 was irrigated independently.
    The flows of the trunk canals need to be adjusted repeatedly from the first day
    to day 36, leading to significant changes of the flow of the main channel and
    high peak flow. Therefore, the optimal results can be improved. A hierarchical
    cluster analysis was adopted to simplify the operation of trunk canals and decrease
    the whole irrigation period. The improved optimal schemes are more concise, and
    the utilization rates of trunk canals are higher (increases by 8.3% to 25%). The
    asymmetrical coefficient of the main channel decreased to 1.375, and the irrigation
    system was more stable and more efficient. References Batabyal AA (1996) The queuing

    IEEE Conference Location: Bucharest, Romania SECTION I. Introduction Irrigation
    quality is a crop performance indicator, its influence being realized both directly
    and indirectly. If we refer to the high quantity of water that crops need, we
    see it as a direct influence factor, as soon as its indirectly role could be seen
    in the influence on the other nutrients availability and on the timing of cultural
    operations. Irrigation requirements are very different from a region to another,
    thus energy efficiency and economic use of water resources depend on a function
    of soil and crop type, climate and moisture [20]. Many factors influence the potential
    water-use efficiency. The meaning of the word potential refers to the maximum
    water-use efficiency that can be achieved when the system is operated properly.
    Global temperature has increased with 0.2-0.3 [ºC] in the last 30 years. The growing
    season in viticulture is very influenced by high or low temperatures. [17] has
    shown that for a 1, 2 or 3 [ºC] rise of temperature, it will also be a crop water
    demand increase with 11%, 19% and even 29%. This paper presents an energy efficient
    proposed system for irrigation management in vineyards. To understand the system
    structure, section II presents the monitored parameters with a huge influence
    on crop productivity. Section III show the main advanced control methods currently
    used in irrigation management, due to the necessity of an advanced irrigation
    system able to manage the installation and receive alerts. The integrated automation
    and telemetry solution for irrigation management in precision agriculture considering
    criteria to energy efficiency and economics, along with the latest control technologies
    is proposed in section IV. SECTION II. Monitored Parameters in Irrigation Management
    Precision of measurements is of high importance in vineyards productivity, modern
    techniques frequently used is focused on the optimization of the oenological potential
    that vineyards have. Precision viticulture is characterized by a crop that is
    dependent of a specific region climate and soil type. This dependence expresses
    the weather influence in vineyards and some of the arguments that support this
    idea are: Daily temperature trend has a huge influence on the grape quality and,
    consequently, on wine [15]; Bunch temperature offers an information related to
    the phenolic compounds maturation [16]; Solar radiation has an impact on phenolic
    compound biosynthesis [18]. A. Air Moisture and Temperature Crop is certainly
    a function of temperature if water is available for optimum satisfaction [1].
    Temperature has a great influence on seeds germination. Due to the biochemical
    processes, the germination phases that include hydration and enzyme activation,
    its degradation and embryo growth are temperature dependent. Validated arguments
    that show the necessity of temperature monitoring are: From 5 to 37 [ºC], the
    rate of photosynthesis is doubled at every 10 [ºC] increase in temperature; The
    respiration rate becomes double at each 10 °C above the optimum temperature; The
    minimum threshold is the temperature below which no growth is possible. Relative
    humidity offers an information regarding the water vapor that is in the air, this
    parameter being in a strong dependence with temperature. Dew point temperature
    explains this dependence, because temperature goes down when the relative humidity
    increases and if the temperature gets cold enough, the air gets to the point in
    which it holds the highest quantity of water vapors. Due to these arguments, air
    moisture and temperature must be monitored in an irrigation management system.
    B. Soil Moisture and Temperature Soil is also very important in irrigation management
    as it is a major source of atmospheric C O 2 and a storage reservoir for carbon
    with soil moisture being a driving force. Some advantages of soil moisture monitoring
    are: The influence in temperature and weather forecasting, due to the fact that
    it has an rise of the evaporation rate that increases the temperature [3]; The
    increasement of the humidity caused by the evaporation rate of the soil moisture
    that increases the dew point; The dependence between temperature and precipitation.
    This is highlighted by the low pressure systems that will condense if air moisture
    is due to the soil moisture evaporation. The result is precipitation occurrence.
    Irrigation management is of high importance in a vineyard. In many regions, growers
    apply irrigations when soil moisture is above an established limit (for example
    50%). Soil moisture is also important because it indirectly influences irrigation
    (the water application and movement across the field, assuring the intake rate).
    The application rate depends of sprinkler and low-volume methods such as deep
    and micro-sprinkles that uses mechanical devices as nozzles [5]. Water that is
    lost by evaporation could be saved by an efficient irrigation appliance capable
    of reducing evaporation with 5 to 15 % depending of the frequency that is used.
    Irrigation without soil moisture monitoring is not indicated, due to the fact
    that this parameter has an influence in the balance between canopy size and fruitfulness
    [19]. The main objective of irrigation is to optimize the plant water stress and
    this could be done by an efficient soil moisture monitoring. The readings of soil
    moisture sensor are temperature dependent and field measured resistance needs
    correction when some differences appear between calibration and field measurements.
    Soil temperature monitoring is influenced in an important proportion by solar
    radiation and humidity. It is considered that soil temperature should be measured
    by sensors that have no moving parts and that do not need calibration. C. Evapotranspiration
    A very important parameter for crop growth and health is evapotranspiration. This
    irrigation management variable is computed based on weather information (air temperature
    and humidity, wind speed etc.). Explanation of the interdependence existing among
    evapotranspiration and meteorological data collected from on-site weather stations
    is offered by using Penman-Monteith method [13]. E T 0 = 0.408Δ( R n −G)+γ 900

    View Source SECTION III. Control Strategies for Irrigation Systems Based on the
    monitoring of several parameters, as seen in chapter II, different control strategies
    and methods can be applied for optimization and efficiency of irrigation systems.
    Different approaches can be used for designing the control strategy in drip irrigation
    systems: constant open-loop control, open loop on/off, feedback control, [23].
    A. Classical PID Control Classical control methods such as proportional, integral
    and derivative methods show good results, Fig. 1. Figure 1. Classical control
    system Show All In [21] a discrete PID controller is used to control an open irrigation
    channel. The actuator is the opening gate and the controller provides the signal
    for position of this gate. PID control is used in [22] in a modified manner, with
    a constrained integral function, and the goal is supplying the appropriate amount
    of water to meet the needs of the plant during the diurnal cycle. A diagram of
    the PID control for soil moisture in dripping irrigation system is presented in
    Fig. 2. The controller computes the command signal based on the error between
    the measured soil moisture from the transducer and the reference one. The actuator
    is represented by a control relay that acts on the water supply valve. Considering
    the varying solar radiation levels, the controller can still follow the soil moisture
    reference, which proved this classical method gives good results. Figure 2. Soil
    moisture PID control Show All B. Fuzzy Control Systems Fuzzy control is a strategy
    used for irrigation management considering several controlled parameters: soil
    moisture, water supply, loss minimization etc. The general architecture for fuzzy
    control of soil humidity is presented in [24], Fig. 3. The water supply is assured
    through a reservoir house height acts as actuating variable h . The soil moisture
    error is the difference between measured soil moisture and the reference one.
    The system has a variable reference depending on the stage of growth of the plant.
    Figure 3. Fuzzy control architecture Show All The soil humidity error''s membership
    function assignment, which is of high importance in fuzzy control, is based on
    the rule that the higher sensitivity membership for little error and the fine
    stability membership for larger error. Totally, there were 16 fuzzy rules in this
    system. C. Decision Support Systems In [6], a decision support system (DSS) is
    proposed for water supply prediction and control. This system collects data from
    a specific weather station. Then, collected data and weather predictions from
    three different sources are analyzed and the result is an evapotranspiration prediction
    and an estimation of plant daily development forecast for the next 10 days. A
    water distribution planning solution is proposed in [8] for irrigation in an arid
    district. Optimal water delivery scheduling for irrigation canals is implemented
    through a DSS system. The DSS structure consists of a water demand module, a supply
    module and a planning module, Fig. 4. Figure 4. DSS architecture for water supply
    scheduling, [8] Show All D. Model Predictive Control Model predictive control
    (MPC) approach is common used in industry offering a number of features: is robust
    against uncertainty system constraints can be handled is easy to accomplish tuning
    is used in multivariable control applications In MPC control strategy the future
    evolution control sequence of the system is determined based on system model by
    minimizing a cost function. The cost function is obtained by minimizing the deviation
    from set points over the prediction horizon, Fig. 5. Figure 5. MPC control Show
    All In [25] a Model Predictive Control framework for real-time irrigation scheduling
    is developed. A state space formulation of the water balance model is developed.
    The accuracy of the water balance approach is affected by uncertain measurements,
    such as evapotranspiration and precipitation and constraints such as limited water.
    The soil moisture deficit set-point tracking is accomplished by the MPC controller.
    The MPC controller also incorporates input and output constraints. The controller
    successfully tracks the commanded set-point as well as meets the constraints.
    SECTION IV. Proposed System for Irrigation Control in Vineyards Irrigation control
    strategies should be integrated in complex automation and telemetry systems. There
    are several such systems in the world, adapted on specific crops and weather.
    Two of the implemented irrigation management systems are presented further. The
    Advanced Scientific Irrigation Management application is a complex SCADA systems
    used for optimization irrigation in an arid district in USA, [6]. In order to
    implement the irrigation program, it is used a 6 six days sample code for each
    of the 369 parcels. Then, code is transferred to the SCADA master system which
    controls the 93 RTU stations by radio communications. Irrigation channels are
    controlled by a Decision Support System (DSS), as described in section III. Advantages
    of this system should be summarized as the overcome of water infiltrations, water
    costs, water-supply shortages, some specific irrigation issues. In [7] an implementation
    of an automated irrigation system, installed in Australia is presented. Efficiency
    of the irrigation system can be improved by an information infrastructure including
    sensors, actuators and supervisory control and data acquisition communication
    network. The task of the supervisory control is to ensure that the physical flow
    capacities are not exceeded. An irrigation system model is constructed based on
    the interconnection of the individual pool models. In order to achieve an entire
    irrigation system under closed loop control where water orders are met in real
    time on demand, the research and development effort has focused on controlling
    water quantity and quality in open channels. Due to knowledge and existing technologies
    in the third wave of the information processing, communication and computing,
    a new telemetry system for precision agriculture should be integrated into the
    Cyber-Physical System (CPS) concept. The CPS paradigm has two connotations. On
    the one hand, it solves the issues related to the way in which inquiry is done,
    whereas the second one is a model that underpins all specific states of the components
    of the process [4]. Considering the analysis on the control systems implemented
    over the world and the specific conditions in the Romanian context, an energy
    efficient irrigation system for water supply control in vineyards is proposed,
    Fig. 6. The irrigation management system for the precision agriculture could be
    seen as a MIMO system. The control strategy follows a fuzzy approach and it considers
    soil moisture control and the disturbances can be air temperature and evapotranspiration,
    as it is a plant disease indictor. Thus, the system must be fully interconnected
    and decentralized, being equipped with the following: One or more telemetry stations
    that establish the irrigation necessity. Considering the arguments exposed in
    the 2nd paragraph, it is of highly importance to have sensors for air and soil
    temperature, air and soil humidity and evapotranspiration computation, [26]. With
    these parameters, they could be calculated the precipitations necessity and the
    irrigations efficiency. A SCADA system (a SCADA master and clients) that receives
    all information from process and, using some specific decision algorithms, sends
    commands to actuators. It must be done a software application that collects and
    processes data from sensors and that has the capability of displaying it in a
    logical format. The main characteristics that a SCADA system for irrigation management
    must have are presented in Fig. 7. A RTU (Remote Terminal Unit) that includes
    solar panels and batteries for independent operation is used for acquisition of
    other field parameters and actuators control. The actuators consist of pumps,
    valves and other Figure 6. Proposed irrigation control system Show All Figure
    7. Main characteristics of the SCADA system in irrigation management Show All
    SECTION V. Conclusions Irrigation management systems should be focused on the
    adequate supply of water in order to increase crop productivity. This study focuses
    at first on the main parameters that must be monitored in an irrigation management
    system to discover the advantages and effects of their control. Both soil and
    air moisture and temperature are monitored with specific measurement probes and
    evapotranspiration can be calculated using Penman-Monteith, Priestley-Taylor or
    Makkink method. The control strategies for irrigation systems are classified into
    4 categories, from classical to new trends equipment that operate directly to
    irrigate the vineyards. All these are chosen for energy efficiency of the system,
    but also for efficient water management. in irrigation control: PID control, fuzzy
    control systems, decision support systems for water supply prediction and control
    and model predictive control. The main contribution of the paper is the proposal
    of an irrigation control system for vineyards, from a Cyber-Physical Systems perspective.
    The SCADA architecture allows a CPS approach and the fuzzy control strategy is
    suitable for the Romanian context. Based on the high quality of measurements,
    the system computes the water supply necessity based on a fuzzy controller. The
    communication system based on GSM modules at the field level brigs flexibility
    and ease of use for the telemetry and automation system. The system architecture
    has many other benefits such as low energy consumption, low administration costs
    and forecasting and diagnosis functions. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work was supported

    Introduction The optimal design of a sprinkler irrigation system is a combinational
    optimization problem that consists of sizing the pipes and equipping proper number
    of sprinklers so as to convey water from the source to the sprinklers with lower
    cost or lower energy consumption. It is a non-linear, constrained and multi-modal
    problem included in the category of NP-hard (Non-deterministic Polynomial-time
    hard) problems. Over the years, it is solved under the suggestions from the extensive
    research contributions on the water distribution systems (WDSs) or the trickle
    irrigation systems where a large number of methods have been employed (Yildirim
    2009; Izquierdoa et al. 2008; Dercas and Valiantzas 2012). Inspired by the finite
    element method (FEM) used in the trickle irrigation systems, for a sprinkler irrigation
    system Trung et al. (2007) applied the back step method in the basic part based
    on unsteady-flow analysis, while employed the forward step method in the determination
    of distribution of the pressure head along each lateral (Mohtar et al. 1991; Wu
    et al. 2010). In general, most of these hydraulic models were designed for exact
    problems or solved by the step-by-step (stepwise) method which is time-consuming
    and requires high skills (Singh 2012; Zhao et al. 2006). Genetic Algorithm (GA)
    is a kind of heuristic method that is computationally simple, adaptive and robust.
    It is effective in solving the optimization problems. Earlier application of GA
    in irrigation was centered on the irrigation scheduling, channel irrigation, or
    the pipe work layout (Raju and Kumar 2004; Pais et al. 2010; Singh 2014). It was
    also utilized in the optimal design of tapered diameter pipeline with multiple
    outlets on different slopes (Bai and Wang 2005). But the disadvantages of GA include
    the chance-dependent outcome and lengthy computation time. Recently, Gil et al.
    (2011) observed that a new Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) implementation with the
    objective function of minimal total investment cost subject to pressure constraints,
    obtained better results than the Genetic Algorithm and scatter search implementations
    in the design of typical Alperovits-Shamir and Hanoi networks. Similarly, in the
    multi-purpose reservoir operation, ACO model was found to perform better than
    GA model in terms of higher annual power production, especially in the case of
    long-time horizon reservoir operation (Kumar and Reddy 2006). Ant Colony Optimization
    is currently a new alternative in the design of delivery systems (Hossain and
    El-shafie 2013; Hassanzadeh et al. 2011). And it has been widely used in variety
    of combinational optimization problems such as sequential ordering and scheduling
    (Dorigo 1992; Dorigo and Blum 2005; Moeini and Afshar 2012). Maybe due to proper
    availability of traditional methods, the application of ACO in the optimization
    of sprinkler irrigation systems is neglected and few contributions are found.
    Though much attention has been paid to the optimization of water distribution
    systems (WDSs) and trickle irrigation systems, the design of sprinkler irrigation
    systems still differ from the former two systems in many aspects. Firstly, optimization
    of sprinkler irrigation systems involves the sizing of pipe diameters and numbering
    of sprinklers while the optimization of WDSs focuses on the routing of water in
    different pipelines connecting consumers. Secondly, in WDSs, several pumps or
    reservoirs operate simultaneously, but in the average sprinkler irrigation systems,
    only one pump works, so the pump-pipeline cooperation should be considered (Wang
    et al. 2010; Tu et al. 2012). Compared with the design of drip tapes or laterals,
    the optimization of sprinkler systems aims at the least cost or the minimal energy
    consumption. In drip irrigation, where energy consumption is fairly low, and hence
    neglected, is however targeted at lowering head loss along the pipeline to ensure
    the emission uniformities through the spacing design of outlets. Further, most
    previous studies of sprinkler irrigation systems focused upon performances of
    sprinklers, indicators for irrigation quality or hydraulic calculations of pipelines
    (Colaizzi et al. 2010; Fátima et al. 2013; Khan et al. 2008; Martinez et al. 2004).
    Few discussions were found on the optimal design of small-scale sprinkler irrigation
    systems with the advantages of low cost, homogeneity, mobility and good adaptability
    to different topographies and crops (Tu et al. 2012). Main contributions of this
    study contain to employ two methodologies, GA and originally designed ACO, in
    the design of four small-scale sprinkler irrigation systems, and then to compare
    the optimal results with the experimental findings obtained from the field tests.
    2 Problem definition In the design of an irrigation system, the type of sprinklers
    to choose depends on the soil, plant and meteorological information of environment.
    Whereas the number of sprinklers, the pipeline and pipe fittings are equipped
    according to the hydraulic parameters of the pump (Tu et al. 2012). In a small-scale
    sprinkler irrigation system shown in Fig. 1, the power of the pump is usually
    less than 11 kW and the working pressures of sprinklers are lower than 0.4 MPa.
    The pipelines are plastic-coated pipes in order that the system can be moved more
    easily and more suitable to sloping lands. Moreover, they are cheaper than aluminum
    pipes. Therefore, this kind of system have been widely used by small-scale farmers.
    The pipelines are often laid in one line with rotating sprinklers of identical
    sizes. They will be shifted to the next location for the irrigation of a larger
    area when one patch of land is watered. The optimization model first developed
    by Wang et al. (2010) was introduced. Fig. 1 Layout of the pipeline in a small-scale
    sprinkler irrigation system Full size image 2.1 Objective function Previous research
    shows that the specific energy consumption, defined as energy consumed per depth
    of water sprayed over a hectare, can be used as the objective function to design
    the system, presented in Eq. (1). It reflects the working conditions of components
    included in the system directly and helps to forward the control of fuel consumptions
    in agricultural systems. In this work, the optimization of the system involves
    minimizing the specific energy consumption by selecting the pipe diameters, adjusting
    the pressure heads and flow rates of sprinklers as well as controlling efficiency
    and working condition of the pump. $$ {E}_p=\\frac{H}{36.7{\\eta}_b{\\eta}_d{\\eta}_p}
    $$ (1) where, E p is the specific energy consumption of the system, kW · h/(mm · hm2);
    H is the pump head, m(H2O); η b is the pump efficiency; η d is the motor efficiency;
    η p is the efficiency of water application in the field, exactly, from the pump
    outlet to the land wetted. 2.2 Constraints In the problem, constraints are formed
    to guarantee the performance of the whole system. Minimal working pressure of
    sprinkler, sprinkler working pressure deviation range, number of sprinklers and
    the pump-pipeline operating conditions are chosen as the constraint conditions
    (Tu et al. 2012). Range of flow velocity and decreasing pipe diameters along the
    pipeline for instance, are integrated in the optimization procedure. The optimization
    constraints include: (1) according to the current standard in China “GB/T 50085-2007
    Technical Code for Sprinkling Engineering”, any sprinkler should work under the
    pressure no lower than 90 % of the design value; (2) pressure difference between
    any two sprinklers along the line should be lower than 20 % of the design pressure
    of sprinkler to ensure the normal operation of sprinklers and irrigation uniformities
    (Carrión et al. 2014); (3) the maximal or minimal number of sprinklers is decided
    in reference to the lateral design with multiple outlets on the flat ground (Zhang
    GX 1990); (4) the actual working condition of sprinkler irrigation system is determined
    by the intersection point of the characteristic curves of the pipeline and the
    pump, which means the agreement between the working conditions of them. Therefore,
    the discharge of pump Q obtained from the characteristic curve provided by the
    factory, is equal to the flow rate Q 0 at pipe inlet through hydraulic calculation
    of the pipeline. The relationship between the pump head identified on the curve
    and the inlet pressure of the pipeline calculated can be expressed in Eq. (2)
    (Tu et al. 2012). $$ {H}_0=H-{h}_b $$ (2) where, H 0 is inlet pressure of the
    pipe network, m(H2O);h b is head loss from the inlet of suction pipe to the pump
    outlet (or the inlet of pipeline), plus elevation between them, m(H2O). In the
    hydraulic calculation of the pipeline, the back step method is introduced in view
    of assuring the pressure head of the end sprinkler h n, considering there is usually
    no pressure regulators in a small-scale sprinkler irrigation system (Kang and
    Nishiyama 1996). Hence the pressure head and discharge at the sprinklers and pipe
    nodes respectively are calculated from the end to the inlet of the pipeline, interpreted
    in Fig. 1. The discharges from all the outlets are assumed to be identical. Darcy-Weisbach
    Formula is used in the calculation of friction loss and equivalent length in the
    local loss. And the relationship between flow rate and pressure head of an impact
    sprinkler is considered in Eq. (3) based on orifice flow equation. $$ {q}_n=\\mu
    \\frac{\\pi\\ {d}_p^2}{4}\\sqrt{2g{h}_n}=0.01252\\mu {d}_p^2{h}_n^{0.5} $$ (3)
    where, q n is the sprinkler discharge at the Node n, the end of pipe, m3/h; h
    n is the pressure head of sprinkler at the end of the delivery pipeline, m(H2O);
    μ is the discharge coefficient of sprinkler; d p is the orifice diameter of nozzle,
    mm. Based on these above, when the pressure head of end sprinkler is input and
    the pipe diameters are determined, the flow rates and pressure heads at all the
    sprinklers and pipe nodes can be obtained sequentially from the end to the inlet
    along the pipeline and finally coupled with the characteristic curve of the pump.
    3 Methodology Two types of meta-heuristic algorithms were utilized: ACO and GA.
    3.1 Ant colony algorithm ACO algorithm, exactly an Ant Cycle System operated on
    Matlab (Matrix Laboratory) R2007a , was applied in the design of sprinkler irrigation
    systems for the first time. An ACO model of a combinational optimization problem
    consists of: a search space S defined over a finite set of discrete decision variables,
    namely, solutions for the problem, a set Ω of constraints and an objective function
    f to be minimized (Blum 2005; Dorigo and Blum 2005). The search space S in the
    optimization of sprinkler irrigation systems is defined as follows: A set of pipe
    diameters d j i for n sections of pipe are given in Eq. (4): $$ {d}_i^j\\in {D}_i=\\left\\{{d}_i^1\\dots
    {d}_i^{D_i}\\right\\},i=1\\dots n $$ (4) Different diameters chosen will result
    in different working pressures of sprinklers. And the number of pipe sections
    n is equal to the number of sprinklers which is further decided by the pressure
    head at the end sprinkler. Therefore, the decision variables are the number of
    sprinklers, the pipe diameter and the pressure head at the end sprinkler. A feasible
    solution, s ∈ S, is a complete assignment that satisfies the constraints. The
    set of constraints Ω and objective function f have been stated earlier. Comparing
    the optimization of sprinkler irrigation systems with the real ant foraging behavior
    or typical Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), the available pipe diameters of
    each section connecting two pipe nodes are the paths between two cities, number
    of sprinklers or pipe sections is the number of cities, as shown in Fig. 2 (Xu
    et al. 2006). The specific energy consumption dealt with penalty function, presented
    in Eq. (5), is the total length of the route in TSP. It makes the fitness (Fit
    1) and it is used in the pheromone updating. Head loss in each pipe section representing
    distance between two cities in TSP, is introduced in the heuristic function since
    it is related to pipe diameter, and sum of the head loss will add to the pump
    head and further the specific energy consumption E p. Fig. 2 Ant colony optimization
    for branched irrigation systems Full size image $$ Fi{t}_1={E}_p+{\\mu}_1\\left|{H}_0-H\\right|\\left.+{\\mu}_2\\right|
    \\min \\left(0,{h}_{\\min }-0.9{h}_p\\left|+{\\mu}_3\\left| \\max \\left(0,\\frac{h_{\\max
    }-{h}_{\\min }}{h_p}-0.2\\right)\\right|\\right.\\right. $$ (5) where, Fit 1 is
    the fitness for ACO algorithm; μ 1, μ 2, μ 3 are the penalty factors; h min is
    the minimum pressure head of sprinkler, m (H2O); h p is the design working pressure
    head of sprinkler, m(H2O); . ACO introduces a rule of transition depending on
    a parameter, which determines the relative importance of exploitation versus exploration
    (Zecchin et al. 2006). Every time an ant at node i selects pipe diameter d j i
    in Eq. (4) for section i according to the following transition probability (Chebouba
    et al. 2009; Mohan and Baskaran 2012) in Eq. (6). $$ {p}_{ij}^k(t)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{cc}\\hfill
    \\frac{{\\left({\\tau}_{ij}{(t)}^{\\alpha}\\left({\\eta}_{ij}\\right.(t)\\right)}^{\\beta
    }}{{\\displaystyle {\\sum}_{u\\in {J}_i^k}{\\left({\\tau}_{ij}{(t)}^{\\alpha}\\left({\\eta}_{ij}\\right.(t)\\right)}^{\\beta
    }}}\\hfill & \\hfill forJ\\in {J}_i^k\\hfill \\\\ {}\\hfill 0\\hfill & \\hfill
    forJ\\notin {J}_i^k\\hfill \\end{array}\\right. $$ (6) where the parameter α controls
    the relative importance of the pheromone intensity and β controls the function
    of heuristic value; η ij(t) is the heuristic function, or called visibility, guides
    the ants to move on section i through D i. In this work the heuristic function
    is given by: $$ {\\eta}_{ij}(t)=\\frac{1}{h_{ij}} $$ (7) where, h ij is the head
    loss on the pipe section i between two nodes, shown in Eq. (8): $$ {h}_{ij}=f\\frac{Q_{{}^i}^m}{D_i^b}{L}_i
    $$ (8) where, Q i is the flow rate at pipe section i, m3/h; L i is the length
    of section i, m; f, m, b are the calculation coefficients of head loss considering
    the pipe material. In the process of pheromone updating we use an Ant Cycle System
    (Dorigo 1992). In this system the pheromone trail associated with section i joining
    node i and j is updated by global updating after the traversal of all the sections,
    as in Eq. (9): $$ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}{\\tau}_{ij}\\left(t+1\\right)=\\left(1-\\rho
    \\right)\\cdot {\\tau}_{ij}(t)+\\rho \\cdot \\varDelta {\\tau}_{ij}(t)\\\\ {}\\varDelta
    {\\tau}_{ij}(t)={\\displaystyle \\sum_{k=1}^m\\varDelta {\\tau}_{{}_{ij}}^k}\\end{array}\\right.,\\varDelta
    {\\tau}_{ij}(t)=\\frac{Q_a}{Fi{t}_1} $$ (9) where, τ ij(t) is the pheromone intensity
    on section i at the moment t; ρ (0 < ρ < 1) is the evaporation coefficient; m
    is the number of ants; Δτ ij(t) is the total pheromone deposited by all the ants
    passing section i through D i included in the best route; Q a is an adjustable
    parameter; Fit 1 is expressed in Eq. (5) to represent the total length of the
    best route within the past total iterations (Moeini and Afshar 2012; Afshar 2006).
    3.2 Genetic algorithm The GA is a global search method that imitates the mechanism
    of “survival competitions where the superior survive while the inferior are eliminated.”
    The main steps in the design of the GA include initialization, selection, reproduction
    crossover and mutation to mimic the biological evolution, cross-breeding and trail
    solution (Whitley 1994). Only the best solutions will be chosen and propagate
    to successive generations. The coding and design of genetic operators are the
    major parts which decide the efficiency of procedure and to what kinds of problem
    it is applicable. In this work, a standard GA was employed where the 2-tournament
    selection was used in the selection operation, an arithmetic crossover considered
    in the crossover operation and a real-valued mutation operator in the mutation
    operation to meet the characteristics of the problem involved. The objective function
    and constraints were the same as those in ACO. The difference was that we used
    a new fitness Fit 2 shown in Eq. (10) to satisfy the maximization principle needed
    in the design of a Genetic Algorithm. $$ Fi{t}_2=\\frac{\\mathsf{1}}{Fi{t}_1}
    $$ (10) And the elitism was introduced to maintain the population diversity to
    avoid early maturity and local optima. The algorithm was written with Visual Basic
    6.0. In the previous studies by Wang et al. (2010) and Tu et al. (2012) GA was
    implemented under different objective functions for the optimization of irrigation
    systems. In this work GA was employed as a reference to check the feasibility
    and performance of ACO. 4 Case study 4.1 Sprinkler irrigation systems In order
    to test the ability of proposed ACO and outline the differences between it and
    GA in the optimization of sprinkler irrigation systems, four small-scale systems
    were considered. The pumps used are external-mixing self-priming pumps, originally
    designed by Jiangsu University in China. They are superior with shorter self-priming
    time and higher efficiencies compared to the traditional internal-mixing type,
    thus widely applied in agriculture in China. The parameters of pumps and sprinklers
    are described in Tables 1 and 2 (Li et al. 2011). The indoor test for the four
    systems suggest that in Eq. (1) the motor efficiency can be η d = 40 %. Based
    on the technical code (GB/T 50085-2007) and field condition the efficiency of
    water application η p = 90 % can be used. And the pump efficiency η b is decided
    through the hydraulic calculation when the pump-pipeline cooperation condition
    is considered. The available pipe diameters D i are 50 mm, 65 mm and 80 mm. The
    length of each pipe section L i in Fig. 2 is equal to the sprinkler spacing in
    Table 1. For the plastic-coated pipes, the calculation coefficients of head loss
    in Eq. (8) can be f = 94,800, m = 1.77, b = 4.77. Table 1 Parameters of small-scale
    irrigation systems (Tu et al. 2012, 2014) Full size table Table 2 Performances
    of sprinklers Full size table 4.2 Optimization parameters The parameters of ACO
    and GA used in the empirical executions are listed in Table 3. Penalty coefficients
    for objective function are μ 1 = 100, μ 2 = 1, μ 3 = 50. The penalty coefficients
    evolved were selected according to the average optimal results among the experimental
    iterations while the other parameters for the two algorithms were taken based
    on the empirical rules by other researchers. Table 3 Parameters used in the empirical
    executions Full size table 4.3 Test area The sprinkler irrigation experiments
    were done on the grassland in the west of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, China
    from August 11 to 17, 2010 (Fig. 3). The pressures at the inlets and outlets of
    pumps were recorded with a vacuum gauge YB-100 in precision grade 1.6 and a normal
    pressure gauge YB-150 in grade 0.4, respectively. The speed of pump was read by
    a tachometer typed DT-2234B (Tu 2011). In the system powered by the 50ZB-25D pump
    the pipeline was laid in two parallel lines, for the number of sprinkler was relatively
    large, while pipes in the other three systems were laid in one line. Fig. 3 Self-priming
    pumps and the test area (a) Pump 50ZB-35Q; (b) Pump 65ZB-40C; (c) Test area Full
    size image Apart from the specific energy consumption, the irrigation uniformity
    is another indicator to evaluate a sprinkler irrigation system, which may vary
    greatly if the working pressure of sprinkler is lower than 90 % of the design
    pressure. It is influenced by many factors besides the pressure head. Therefore
    it is hard to be included in the optimization model. Hence it was tested in the
    experiments to confirm the feasibility of the optimization results. According
    to the terrain conditions of the grassland, flat land between sprinklers No.2
    and No.3 was chosen as the test area, shown in Fig. 3c. The catch cans 200 mm
    in diameter were arranged in intervals of 2 m in squares. And temperature and
    humidity of the air were measured. 5 Results and discussion 5.1 Evolution of results
    Firstly, comparisons of specific energy consumptions E p over the numbers of sprinklers
    n from GA and ACO are shown in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Comparisons of specific energy consumption
    E p over number of sprinklers from GA and ACO (a) 50ZB-35Q; (b) 50ZB-25D; (c)
    65ZB-40C; (d) 50ZB-30C Full size image In the design of systems, too few or too
    many sprinklers used will lead to high energy consumptions, so optimization is
    necessary. In Fig. 4, ACO provides smoother curves of specific energy consumption
    E p over number of sprinklers n in similar shapes and generally lower values than
    GA in the same system. The deviation between the two approaches at the optimal
    number of sprinklers for all the systems except System (c) is in the lower range.
    The average difference of E p values obtained by two methods is less than 1 %
    in System (a) and System (d), 5 % in System (b), and the highest deiviation 10
    % is found at the number of sprinkler n = 8 in System (c). These may confirm the
    feasiblity of the new approach ACO. Slopes of the curves E p over n obtained in
    GA are sharper than those in ACO for Systems (b) and (c), exactly, the systems
    with higher pressures or larger number of sprinklers. Comparatively, in the other
    two systems slopes of the curves in ACO are slightly sharper than those in GA.
    It may indicate that GA is more suitable in problems of smaller scale and ACO
    performs better in those of larger scale. Under the optimal number of sprinklers,
    the evolutions of the minimal and average specific energy consumptions E p gotten
    by the artificial ants over different iterations are given in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Evolutions
    of minimal and average E p in different iterations under the optimal number of
    sprinklers with ACO procedure (a) 50ZB-35Q (n = 17); (b) 50ZB-25D (n = 30); (c)
    65ZB-40C (n = 12); (d) 50ZB-30C (n = 16) Full size image The runtime of GA written
    in Visual Basic with no codes for drawing pictures is 8–16 s in different systems,
    and that for ACO written in Matlab with functions for drawing all the curves discussed
    later is 13–30 s. Results including the optimal numbers of sprinklers and lowest
    E p in GA fluctuate slightly in different operations, whereas the results in ACO
    are almost stable with E p varying only less than 1 %. A larger searching space
    due to random selection and reproduction in GA and the heuristic function introduced
    in ACO to narrow the range of paths may explain the difference of efficiencies
    concerning runtime. The role of evaporated pheromone may lead the artificial ant
    to the right answer which may contribute to the stable results from ACO. Figure
    5 shows a good convergence in ACO for all the systems with only 50 iterations.
    The average and minimal values of E p become stable around 20 iterations. The
    difference between them is 8.5, 6.9, 6.8 and 7.7 % for the four systems respectively,
    showing the steady performance of ACO. 5.2 Pressure heads along the pipeline When
    different numbers of sprinklers or pipe diameters in the system are applied, not
    only the specific energy consumption will vary, but the pressures and flow rates
    at sprinklers and pipes along the pipelines may differ. Further, working condition
    and thus irrigation uniformity of the system will change. Therefore, the pressure
    heads along the pipelines need to be investigated in the optimization. Comparisons
    of pressure heads at sprinklers and pipes along the pipelines in the four systems
    under optimal configurations obtained from GA and ACO are illustrated in Fig.
    6. Fig. 6 Pressure heads at sprinklers and pipes along the pipelines with GA and
    ACO (a1) 50ZB-35Q (GA, n = 16, one pipeline), (a2) 50ZB-35Q (ACO, n = 17, one
    pipeline); (b1) 50ZB-25D (GA, n = 30, two pipelines), (b2) 50ZB-25D (ACO, n = 30,
    two pipelines); (c1) 65ZB-40C (GA, n = 12, one pipeline), (c2) 65ZB-40C (ACO,
    n = 12, one pipeline); (d1) 50ZB-30C (GA, n = 16, one pipeline), (d2) 50ZB-30C
    (ACO, n = 16, one pipeline) Full size image In Fig. 6, pressure heads at sprinklers
    and pipes along the pipeline gained from ACO are lower with smoother curves than
    those from GA, but the pressure differences between the sprinklers and the pipes
    at the same nodes for the two methods are generally the same. In Fig. 6(a1), 6(a2),
    6(d1), 6(d2), pressure differences between the first and the end sprinklers calculated
    with GA are smaller than those with ACO in Systems (a) and (d). However, in Fig.
    6(b1), 6(b2), 6(c1), 6(c2), they are smaller with ACO in Systems (b) and (c).
    This confirms that GA may be excellent for combinational optimization problems
    in smaller scales while ACO is more efficient for those in larger scales. All
    the pressure differences are lower than 20 % of the design pressure of sprinklers.
    The relationships between specific energy consumptions and numbers of sprinklers
    for the systems presented in Fig. 4 are hard to be carried out with actual experiments.
    The reasons are that: firstly, high pressure heads at sprinklers due to fewer
    sprinklers equipped may destroy structures of sprinklers; secondly, far low pressure
    heads at sprinklers may impair the irrigation uniformities greatly which leads
    to no necessity in field tests. Thirdly, the field tests on movable sprinkler
    systems are labor intensive and something unexpected may happen after frequent
    installation and disassembly, so that validation tests on the optimization results
    from algorithms cannot be assured. In this respect, only the optimal configurations
    for the four systems were taken into account in the field tests performed in Jiangsu
    University. To make ssure the pressure head at the end sprinkler higher than 90
    % of the design value, the optimum pipe diameters were used first and the number
    of sprinklers was tried and adjusted accordingly. The experimental optimal number
    of sprinklers and pressure heads along the pipelines are drawn in Fig. 7. Fig.
    7 Pressure heads at pipes along the pipelines of systems (a) 50ZB-35Q (Test, n = 16);
    (b) 50ZB-25D (Test, n = 28); (c) 65ZB-40C (Test, n = 12); (d) 50ZB-30C (Test,
    n = 16) Full size image During the experiment, every system ran for one hour after
    its operation was stable and the rotation speed of pump, pressure heads at pipes
    were tested every 10 min. In the sprinkler system powered by the pump 50ZB-25D,
    the number of sprinklers n = 28 was the maximum in which pressure head at the
    end sprinkler was already 90 % of the design pressure. In comparison of Fig. 6
    with Fig. 7, pressure heads at the pipelines in field tests for the sprinkler
    systems (a), (b) and (d) are closer to those with ACO method, with a deviation
    of 1.0, 1.0, 2.0 % respectively at the first node, and a deviation of 1.0, 3.7
    and 1.0 % respectively at the end. However, for pressure heads at the pipelines
    in System (c), the values in ACO at the first node and the end node are 5.1 and
    1.0 % respectively lower than those in field tests (Fig. 7c); in GA, the values
    are 2.4, 3.4 % higher, respectively. Slight fluctuations on the curves in Fig.
    7c and d may be caused by the small terrain differences on the land Since the
    experiments on the four systems could not be finished within 1 day, the position
    for the installation of each system might vary. System (c) and System (d) were
    placed almost in the same line with the elevation decreased a little at the distance
    150 to 180 m from the inlet of the system. Therefore, the pressure head at the
    end of the pipeline in System (c) and System (d) increased correspondingly caused
    by the Bernoulli equation. To exclude this effect, the pressure head at pipes
    deceased abruptly at the upper stream of the pipeline and then came to be stable
    at the downstream, just like the tendency in System (a) or Fig. 7 in the study
    by Trung et al. (2007). 5.3 Irrigation uniformities Catch can tests were performed
    in the area between sprinklers No. 2 and No. 3. The water amounts collected in
    catch cans were measured. The irrigation uniformity, represented by Christiansen
    Coefficient was calculated and then overlapped to get the overlapping irrigation
    uniformity C u considering the square arrangement when the system was moved to
    next location. The average water application rates ρ 0 and overlapping irrigation
    uniformities of systems are listed in Table 4. Table 4 Average water application
    rates and overlapping irrigation uniformities of systems Full size table In Table
    4, overlapping irrigation uniformities C u in the four systems with optimal configurations
    are all higher than 75 % required by the national standard (GB/T 50085-2007).
    5.4 Comparisons of GA, ACO and field tests Based on the established GA and ACO
    techniques, the optimal configurations and specific energy consumptions E p of
    the irrigation systems, together with the working conditions of pumps have been
    obtained. In the field tests, the working conditions of pumps were identified
    on the characteristic curves first and the E p was then calculated using Eq. (1).
    Comparisons of results from three methods above are provided in Table 5. Table
    5 Comparisons of results from GA, ACO and field tests Full size table In the table,
    “combination” mainly refers to the type and number of sprinklers equipped; η b
    is the pump efficiency, %; r is the reduction rate of specific energy consumption
    in the optimal configuration compared to that of initial design. The group of
    data “INITIAL” shows the results in the initial design, Group “TEST” gives the
    results from field tests. In Table 5, the optimal numbers of sprinklers and working
    conditions of the systems gained from GA and those from ACO are similar, seen
    also from Figs. 4 to 6. The specific energy consumption is reduced in average
    by 10.27 % through GA, 12.45 % through ACO. In the field tests, the reduction
    rate is 11.27 %, a value between that from these two approaches. With the same
    number of sprinklers and proper pipe diameters equipped, the specific energy consumption
    E p in ACO method is closer to that in field test compared to that in GA. In Fig.
    4b and c and Table 5, we are clear that the optimal number of sprinklers gained
    by ACO is more reliable. Comparing Table 2 with Table 5, we can see that, the
    pressure of sprinklers is for a large amount correlated to the energy consumption.
    E p in System (c) with sprinklers typed 20PY is the highest, E p in System (a)
    or (d) with sprinklers typed 10PXH the second, System (b) with sprinklers typed
    15PY comes the last. Optimal configurations for these systems are 12 sprinklers
    20 PY, 16 sprinklers 10PXH and 28 sprinklers 15PY, respectively. The minimal pressure
    heads h n are higher than 90 % of the design working pressure for all the three
    methods, and pressure deviations between any two sprinklers not listed in the
    table are lower than 20 % of the design pressure. Pump efficiencies are approximately
    60 %, a high value for self-priming pumps. These combine to confirm the feasibility
    of the mathematical model used and the correction of results from both GA and
    ACO techniques. 6 Conclusions An Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm for the
    optimization of sprinkler irrigation systems was built for the first time. The
    objective function was specific energy consumption. The pressure head loss between
    adjacent sprinklers was applied in the heuristic function to represent the distance
    between two cities. In the hydraulic calculation model the back step method was
    employed. Results from the ACO approach were compared to those from Genetic Algorithm
    (GA) previously used and experimental results on four sprinkler irrigation systems.
    In the field tests, pressure heads at pipes along the pipelines and the irrigation
    uniformities were measured. Results indicate that the ACO algorithm proposed can
    be applicable in the optimization of irrigation systems and shows quick convergence,
    robustness, with the runtime 13–30 s in different systems. Comparing ACO and GA,
    ACO provides smoother curves of specific energy consumption over number of sprinklers
    with lower values than GA, and the minimum E p in ACO is closer to that in field
    tests. The pressure heads at pipes along the pipelines obtained through ACO change
    gradually, more in accordance with those measured in field tests. The pressure
    differences at the first and the end pipe nodes obtained with ACO are higher than
    those with GA in the systems powered by pumps 50ZB-35Q and 50ZB-30C. The trends
    are contrary in the systems powered by 50ZB-25D and 65ZB-40C. And in the latter
    two systems the optimal numbers of sprinklers calculated through ACO are closer
    to the experimental results. These suggest GA may be excellent for smaller combinational
    optimization problems while ACO is more efficient in larger problems. The optimal
    configurations of four systems were selected. The specific energy consumption
    was reduced in average by 10.27 % through GA, 12.45 % through ACO and 11.27 %
    in field tests. In the test case, the overlapping irrigation uniformities are
    higher than 75 %, so the performances of systems are ensured and the optimization
    results are reliable. ACO developed in this paper may provide an efficient method
    for the optimization of irrigation systems. The results from ACO and GA in four
    systems reinforce the good performance of Ant Colony System in the water distribution
    network or pipelines by other authors. For further comparison of capabilities
    with GA and ACO for problems of different scales in irrigation, more samples are
    needed. References Afshar MH (2006) Improving the efficiency of ant algorithms

    Model of Irrigation Systems Article 07 December 2016 Introduction Due to rapid
    population growth and increasing industrialisation, the water demand in arid regions
    is continuously increasing. Projections e.g. for the Middle East & North Africa
    (MENA)-Region indicates that the per capita renewable water resources will drop
    by half from 1,100 m³/a in 2008 reaching 550 m³/a in 2050 (The World Bank 2007).
    This underlines the challenge and need for a more sustainable management of the
    scarce water resources in arid regions. One of the preconditions for reaching
    this goal is a substantial improvement of the mostly poor water use efficiency
    in the agricultural sector. Groundwater, which represents the predominant natural
    water resource in arid regions, is mostly overused. Continuously sinking groundwater
    levels are often associated with water quality problems. For example in the Al-Batinah
    region in the Sultanate of Oman excessive groundwater withdrawal from a coastal
    aquifer for irrigated agriculture yields to an intrusion of marine saltwater.
    Thus, the increasing salinity of the irrigation water seriously menaces the economical
    basis of the farmers and consequently leads to an increasing number of abandoned
    farms (Al-Shaqsi 2004; Kacimov et al. 2009; Al-Hattaly and Al-Kindy 2008). Considering
    the uncertainty of climate and global change development, a sustainable solution
    to the tight water situation can only be achieved by an integrated approach which
    reliably portrays the nonlinear phenomena of the hydrological system and their
    interdependency in a changing environment. However, this often is ignored in currently
    available water management models because on the one hand optimisation methods
    such as linear programing need a closed model formulation accompanied by crucial
    restrictions and on the other hand, unrealistic simulation times when straightforwardly
    modelling complex hydro-systems jeopardise the solution of multi objective optimisation
    problems (Gosavi 2003; Labadie 2004; Loucks and van Beek 2005). Till now, these
    problems are generally tackled by two ways—either using simplistic models to solve
    the management problems with common optimisation methods, or by replacing the
    optimisation by only a little number of alternative “what if-scenarios” and selecting
    the best alternative regarding a certain objective from this subjectively generated
    small sample (Harou et al. 2009). Along these lines, we subsequently employ an
    alternative approach which is based on two principles, namely a customised simulation-based
    optimisation and a decomposition of individual optimisation problems. The simulation-based
    optimisation aims on the development of optimisation strategies and search algorithms
    which are able to apply on complex simulation models without the limitations of
    the two above-mentioned way outs. This method is recently successfully applied
    for the management of coastal aquifer systems. Mostly artificial neural networks
    (ANNs) (Rao et al. 2004; Bhattacharjya and Datta 2009; Dhar and Datta 2009) or
    piecewise linear transformations (Rejani et al. 2009) are used in these studies
    to train the behaviour of groundwater flow models. Later on, these surrogate models
    are applied for uncertainty analysis (Feyen and Gorelick 2004) as well as to solve
    mono-criterial (Rao et al. 2004) and multi-criterial optimisation problems (Bhattacharjya
    and Datta 2009; Dhar and Datta 2009). In this paper, we present a new tool for
    integrated water resources management in arid regions. For ensuring a reliable
    basis with regard to both optimal sustainable water resources management and long-term
    planning in a changing environment, the proposed Assessment-, Prognoses-, Planning-
    and Management tool (APPM) aims at incorporating the relevant complex interactions
    of the strongly nonlinear meteorological, hydrological and agricultural phenomena,
    taking into account the socio-economic aspects. Thereby, we focus on some key
    issues of a new simulation-based integrated water management model which demonstrates
    how a coupled and highly dynamic agriculture-aquifer system—a land use-water interaction—can
    be integrated in an optimisation environment. The section “The study area” gives
    an overview on the study area of the Al-Batinah region in the Sultanate of Oman.
    Subsequently, the methodology of the APPM-System is described in section “Methodology”.
    An exemplary application of the management system for multi-criteria decision
    making of the Al-Batinah region in the Sultanate of Oman is presented in section
    “Exemplary application”. The section “Summary and outlook” finalises the paper
    by a summary and discussion of results as well as an outlook. The work is performed
    within the frame of the International Water Research alliance Saxony (IWAS), which
    is introduced by Kalbus et al. (2011) in more detail. The study area The study
    area is situated in the north of the Sultanate of Oman in the Al-Batinah region.
    Al-Batinah is a roughly 30 km broad coastal plain which extends over 250 km along
    the coast of the gulf of Oman north-westward of the capital Muscat. The area of
    interest contains three wadi catchments with an area of about 2,640 km2 (see Fig.
    1), whose southern border is formed by the Hadjar mountain range with peaks up
    to a height of 3,000 m. Together with the capital area of Muscat more than 65%
    of the Omani population lives in the region. Currently, it shows a growth rate
    of about 3% (Statistical Year book 2008). One-third of the economically active
    Omani population is working in the agriculture sector underlining its importance
    for the Omani society (FAO 2008). Thereby, the Al-Batinah region is the agricultural
    centre of the country—more than 75% of the nation-wide arable soils are located
    here (Agricultural Census 2005). Due to the climate conditions, the majority of
    Oman’s agricultural production requires irrigation; mostly from sprinkler systems,
    but there is a small but non-negligible amount under flood irrigation, a few farms
    with bubbler and even fewer with drip systems (Agricultural Census 2005). Most
    of the farms are located near the coastline and take their water from the coastal
    aquifer by numerous decentralized and often uncontrolled wells. A progressive
    intensification of the agriculture since the 80s together with currently applied
    inefficient irrigation practices leads to an increasing water demand and—as a
    result—to continuously declining groundwater levels. Ongoing overexploitation
    of the aquifer has enforced the intrusion of marine salt water from the sea. As
    a consequence, numerous farms near the coastline had to close down due to the
    increasing salinity of irrigation water and consequently of the soil. Fig. 1 The
    study area in the northern Sultanate of Oman Full size image The replenishment
    of the coastal aquifer system mainly occurs through rainfall in the upper mountainous
    part of the catchment. Long-term measurements show mean average precipitation
    values up to 350 mm/a in the upstream Hajar Mountains and about 50 mm/a along
    the coastline. The rainfall variability in time and space is extremely high—relatively
    wet periods during high rainfall years are followed by long dry periods. Moreover,
    flash floods caused by convective rainstorms lead to substantial freshwater losses
    to the sea. In order to minimise these losses and to promote artificial recharge
    of the coastal aquifer system, several dams have recently been built in the wadi
    channels. Nevertheless, the current water demand especially due to the high agricultural
    water consumption is still much higher than the recharge and thus, the groundwater
    situation still becomes more and more severe. Near the mountains in the upper
    part of the catchment, there is some irrigated agriculture which relies upon water
    from the traditional Omani aflaj-system. Methodology An integrated Assessment-,
    Prognosis-, Planning and Management-tool (APPM): the Pilot version (APPM-P) The
    pilot version of the APPM is principally designed as a first step towards an innovative
    water management and long-term planning tool for arid zone water management. It
    aims at the prediction, visualisation and evaluation of the consequences of planning
    options and management decisions including estimations as to the impact of climate
    change according to latest findings. The modular concept of the GIS-based APPM
    (see Fig. 2) shall allow for managing and operating the interactions between the
    water resources availability, the demands on water and the technical system of
    water distribution. Along these lines, the APPM provides optimal solutions for
    water allocation, groundwater storage and withdrawal including saline water management
    with alternative, most beneficial irrigation strategies. For a comprehensive solution
    of the complex optimisation problem—and for a simple, robust and easy operation—we
    use hybrids of process models and ANNs together with other customised artificial
    intelligence tools (Schmitz and Cullmann 2008; Schmitz et al. 2007b; Schütze et
    al. 2005). Basically, the APPM incorporates the: Fig. 2 General structure of the
    APPM-tool Full size image 1. Analysis and modelling of actual and future water
    resources availability and demands, 2. Evaluation of sustainable water management
    strategies considering agricultural production as well as the demands of other
    water consumption sectors, 3. Optimal design and control of the technical systems
    for water allocation and distribution depending on given objectives, actual hydrological
    conditions and future prognosis. Starting with the primary water resource—the
    groundwater—and the main consumer—the agriculture—the APPM-P will be extended
    by additional water sectors, e.g. wastewater reuse at further stages of the project.
    The Water Resources Availability (WRA)-module This module deals with the analysis
    and the assessment of the water resources availability (see Fig. 2, left side).
    It forms the basis for evaluating the renewable water resources and saltwater
    intrusion phenomena as well as for managing the groundwater reservoirs in an optimal
    sense. Including climate change scenarios according to the global climate development
    (IPCC 2007), results will yield a prognosis of the short and long term water availability.
    The modular concept allows for the use of several process models with different,
    problem-oriented complexity to analyse and simulate the most relevant hydrologic
    surface and subsurface flow processes in the study area (see Fig. 3). The problem-oriented
    model library consists of a new approach which considers the different types of
    the traditional Omani irrigation system (aflaj) within a catchment model as well
    as a new analytical approach for the modelling of flash floods including subsequent
    infiltration in the wadi channel (Philipp et al. 2010). Complex physically based
    modelling is required for a sound description of the groundwater flow phenomena
    characterised by different geological units (fissure, karst and phreatic aquifers)
    and water of varying salinity. We therefore use a 3D groundwater model with density
    dependent transient flow which is based upon the OpenGeoSys-software package (Kolditz
    et al. 2008; Walther et al. 2010; Kalbacher et al. 2011). Fig. 3 Two-dimensional
    slice of the most relevant hydrological processes in the study area Full size
    image Furthermore, the WRA-module also aims at evaluating the efficiency of the
    artificial recharge schemes as a basis for their optimal operation with respect
    to locations for underground water storage as well as for most suitable sites
    for groundwater abstraction. A fast and robust operation of the physically based
    groundwater model is mandatory for an efficient interaction with the agricultural
    water demand module within an optimisation environment. This is achieved by portraying
    the complex groundwater model of the study area by a multilayer perceptron ANN
    (Nabney 2002). Therefore, two steps are necessary: (i) the generation of a scenario
    database containing the responses of the numerical density depended groundwater
    flow model OpenGeoSys (OGS) for all realistically feasible abstraction scenarios
    and configurations, and (ii) the training of an ANN, more specifically a multilayer
    perceptron (MLP) net with a backpropagation learning algorithm (Yan and Minsker
    2006, see Fig. 4). Subsequently, the derived surrogate model, which is referred
    to ANN-OGS, is used in the simulation-based management model for optimising the
    groundwater abstraction rates according to a selected objective function. Fig.
    4 Procedure for deriving the ANN-OGS surrogate model Full size image The irrigation
    module The irrigation module is designed to promote higher economic revenue by
    saving water at the same time. Therefore, operational tools are developed which
    provide optimal control for both water and fertilizer applications. It also allows
    for evaluating the risk in yield loss when brackish water is used for irrigation.
    Besides the optimal operation for full irrigation systems, the module also provides
    solutions for optimal irrigation scheduling under limited seasonal water supply
    for maximizing the overall water use efficiency. These solutions found upon a
    highly efficient scheduling algorithm which takes into account the crop response
    to water stress at different stages throughout the growing season. On this basis,
    so-called crop water production functions (CWPF) are estimated which describe
    the relationship between the applied amount of water and the produced yield for
    a given combination of crop/soil/climate under the assumption of optimal water
    application. Another important component of the irrigation module consists of
    stochastic planning tools which are able to incorporate the impacts of field,
    farm and system level improvements in water use efficiency into water resources
    management. This allows for developing appropriate policies and supporting strategies
    to increase net water use efficiency at basin scale. Figure 5 shows a general
    stochastic framework for generating compact presentations of the relationship
    between irrigation practices and grain yield at field level using the so-called
    optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation methodology (OCCASION)
    by Schütze and Schmitz 2010). This consists of: Fig. 5 Construction of stochastic
    crop water production functions (SCWPF) and derivation of a two-dimensional crop
    water production function for 90% yield reliability (2D-CWPF0.9) Full size image
    1. A weather generator for incorporating typical local weather characteristics
    as well as updated estimations of the regional impacts of climate change (e.g.
    LARS-WG by Semenov et al. 1998), 2. A new custom-made evolutionary optimisation
    algorithm for optimal irrigation scheduling (GET-OPTIS by Schmitz et al. 2007a
    and Schütze et al. 2011a), 3. Adequate process models for simulating water transport
    and crop growth together with operational tools for optimal irrigation control
    (e.g. the soil-crop simulation model APSIM by Keating et al. 2003). The result—a
    database of the relevant stochastic crop-water production functions (SCWPF)—can
    be used on the one hand for evaluating the benefit of different irrigation strategies
    or cropping patterns by considering the local environmental conditions such as
    landscape, soil and typical local weather characteristics (rainfall pattern, radiation,
    wind, potential evaporation etc.). On the other hand, the SCWPF database also
    provides the basis for assessing the impact of climate variability on the probability
    to achieve a potential yield. Considering salinity stress, the OCCASION-framework
    is extended by a second dimension namely the salinity of the irrigation water
    using the salinity tolerance index (Steppuhn et al. 2005). Combining this index
    with a selected quantile of the SCWPF (e.g. the CWPF with 90% reliability) the
    resulting 2D-CWPF0.9 (see Fig. 5) additionally considers the water quality and
    allow for an appropriate choice of the crop patterns regarding their salinity
    tolerance. Water distribution and management Overview For best meeting, the requirements
    for a spatial and temporal compensation of the differences between the local water
    resources availability and the demands placed on the water a pipeline-system (water
    backbone) which connects different sources of water and aquifer systems to water
    consumers will care for realising the water allocation and distribution. This
    task needs a flow-network model for portraying the full hydrodynamic behaviour
    of the supply system with all elements [pumps, pips, valves, etc. (Rossman 2000)]
    for connecting the different sources of water with the users. It includes the
    traditional omani aflaj system as well as modern water supply techniques like
    wellfields and desalination plants. Together with the above-mentioned water resources
    and irrigation modules an optimisation and management tool (see Fig. 2) is designed
    to evaluate the possibilities and consequences of selected management options.
    The design criteria for the technical system will be elaborated on the basis of
    expected future water yield and demands. The necessary operational control of
    the technical system is also provided by the optimisation and management tool.
    Considering the long-term fluctuations of the natural water resources as well
    as economic, environmental and social aspects, a multi-year and multi-criteria
    optimisation is necessary for establishing a sustainable water management. The
    large amount of farms still increase the number of optimisation variables. In
    order to keep the model computationally feasible, we define demand zones which
    aggregate the crop water demand of different farms. This cluster concept is part
    of a hierarchical optimisation structure which provides tools for a further water
    distribution within the zones in accordance with the crop pattern and the crop
    water demand as well as the water exchange between catchments. A prototype of
    a simulation-based water management model Along these lines, we developed a prototype
    of a simulation-based water management model which aims at solving the essential
    optimisation problems namely: 1. The management of both, water quality and water
    quantity, 2. The inclusion of process models and their interactions within the
    optimisation procedure, 3. The use of objective functions which work on different
    time horizons, like sustainable aquifer management regarding salt water intrusion
    dynamics and short term agricultural profit. The proposed optimisation framework
    (see Fig. 6) connects the WRA-module, which is represented by the ANN-OGS as shown
    in “The water resources availability (WRA)-Module”, with the irrigation module
    described in “The irrigation module”. Both modules are extended by different cost
    models to allow for an economical evaluation of several management strategies.
    Fig. 6 Optimisation framework of the simulation based water management model Full
    size image The formulated multi-criteria optimisation problem aims on maximising
    the economic profit as well as the sustainability of the aquifer in terms of the
    stability of the hydro-system (Eqs. 1 and 2). This normally two-dimensional objective
    function is solved within the first prototype in a simplified manner by a weighted
    sum of both criteria with the mono-criteria optimisation algorithm CMA-ES (Hansen
    2006): $$ {\\text{max(OF) {=} max}}\\left( {w_{ 1} \\sum\\limits_{{i{ = 1}}}^{n}
    \\left[ {\\left( {\\sum\\limits_{{j{ = 1}}}^{m} P_{j} Y_{j} (t_{i} )L (t_{i} )\\,
    {-} \\,{\\text{CI}}_{j}^{{}} (t_{i} )} \\right)\\, {-} \\,{\\text{ CP(}}t_{i}
    )} \\right]{ - }\\,w_{ 2} {\\text{SI(}}t_{n} )} \\right) $$ (1) $$ (A_{ 1} (t_{
    1} )\\ldots A_{ 1} (t_{n} ) ,{\\kern 1pt} A_{m} (t_{ 1} )\\ldots A_{m} (t_{n}
    ) ,{\\kern 1pt} L (t_{ 1} )\\ldots L (t_{\\text{n}} ) ,{\\kern 1pt} Q (t_{ 1}
    )\\ldots Q (t_{n} ) )^{ *} {\\text{ = argmax(OF)}} $$ (2) Thereby w 1 and w 2
    describe the weights for the different terms of the objective function OF, CI
    j and CP are the fixed and variable costs, respectively, for the irrigated agriculture
    and the groundwater pumping, P j the current prices for the cultivated crops j
    = 1…m, and Y j the crop yield which are produced from the acreage L j for the
    cultivation period i = 1…n. A sustainability index SI is calculated (Eq. 3) to
    describe the stability of the hydrosystem. The index evaluates the change of the
    aquifer state between the end t n and the initial state t 1 of the simulation
    period using the average salinity concentration S and the water levels h on the
    x k observation points, where at a lower sustainability index value indicates
    a state of large stability. $$ {\\text{SI(}}t_{n} ) { = }\\sum\\limits_{\\text{k
    = 1}}^{\\text{end}} \\frac{{{\\text{abs}}\\left( {S (t_{ 1} ,x_{k} ) { - }S (t_{\\text{n}}

    \\frac{{{\\text{abs}}\\left( {h (t_{ 1} ,x_{k} ) { - }h (t_{n} ,x_{k} )} \\right)}}{{h_{
    \\max } }} $$ (3) According to Eq. 2, the decision variables are A j the percentage
    of the cultivated crops—the cropping pattern—on the acreage L and the groundwater
    pumping rates Q for every cultivation period i. In accordance with the visualised
    interplay between the modules in Fig. 6, at first the consequences of a given
    pumping rate Q i are evaluated by the groundwater flow model ANN-OGS within a
    cultivation period i (Eq. 4). Together with the estimated salinity value of the
    pumped water for irrigation, the pumping rate serve as input for the irrigation
    module 2D-CWPF, which calculates the yields for given values of crop pattern and
    acreage (Eq. 5). $$ (h (t_{i} ,x ),{\\kern 1pt} S (t_{i} ,x )= \\left[ {{\\text{ANN}}
    - {\\text{OGS}}} \\right] ( (h (t_{i - 1} ,x ),{\\kern 1pt} S (t_{i - 1} ,x ),Q
    (t_{i} ) ) $$ (4) $$ Y_{j} (t_{i} )= A_{j} (t_{i} )\\times \\left[ {2D - {\\text{CWPF}}^{
    0. 9} } \\right]\\left( {Q (t_{i} ),{\\kern 1pt} S (t_{i} ,x_{p} )} \\right) $$
    (5) By means of regional specific cost models for the irrigated agriculture and
    the groundwater abstraction (Malik and Al-Zubeidi 2006), the net profit as one
    part of the objective function is estimated for each cultivation period i. Together
    with the above-mentioned sustainability index (Eq. 3), they form the objective
    function (Eq. 1) which allow for considering varying weights w between the two
    contradicting objectives and for managing both—water quality and quantity. Restrictions
    in respect of the decision and state variables are: $$ \\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{m}
    A_{j} (t_{i} ) = 1 $$ (6) $$ 0 \\le L(t_{i} ) < l_{ \\max } $$ (7) $$ 0 \\le S(t_{i}
    ,x_{p} ) < s_{ \\max } $$ (8) $$ 0 \\ge h(t_{i} ,x_{p} ) > h_{ \\max } $$ (9)
    $$ q_{ \\min } \\le Q(t_{i} ) < q_{ \\max } $$ (10) Exemplary application An exemplary
    application of the proposed management system (see Fig. 6, “A prototype of a simulation-based
    water management model”) illustrates the performance of the optimisation framework.
    The example, dealing with a typical management problem in coastal arid regions
    shows the need for and the effectiveness of a integrated surface–subsurface water
    management for solving water quantity and quality problems. The subsequent application
    APPM-P system uses the characteristics of the study area, which is located on
    the northeast coast of the Sultanate of Oman (see Fig. 1). The optimisation framework
    is exemplarily applied to a 2D vertical slice of the coastal aquifer for including
    groundwater flow inclusive saline transport. The farmers use the pumped freshwater
    from the aquifer—which borders on the sea—to irrigate their land (see Fig. 7).
    Salt water begins at some stage to intrude into the aquifer, if the groundwater
    abstraction rates are higher than the natural replenishment of the aquifer. As
    a consequence, the water for irrigation becomes more and more brackish which jeopardises
    the crop yield. Fig. 7 Configuration of the OpenGeoSys 2D groundwater model with
    the salinity initial condition (aquifer depth 10 times increased) Full size image
    The objective of the management system aims at finding optimal management strategies
    by considering the contradicting objectives like high profitable agriculture versus
    sustainability which both are potentially affected by the water quality. A long
    term evaluation of the environmental and economical development of a hypothetical
    farm—located in vicinity of the sea—under different management strategies is subsequently
    investigated. For the sake of simplicity, we assume the cultivation of two different
    crops, maize—a salt sensitive cash crop—and sorghum—a lower priced but more salt
    resistant crop—growing in two seasons per year (Schütze et al. 2011b). The exemplary
    application consists of three elementary steps: 1. The assessment of the long
    term water resources development using an ANN as a surrogate instead of a density
    dependent groundwater water flow model, 2. The estimation of the crop yields for
    different levels of irrigation water amount and salinity by means of the 2D-CWPF’s
    for sorghum and maize and, 3. The application of the simulation-based water management
    model combining the water availability and demand to optimise the revenues of
    the farms as well as the sustainability of the hydrosystem. Development of a surrogate
    model for simulating the aquifer behaviour A density-dependent transient transport
    model for simulating of the aquifer response to different extraction scenarios
    is constructed using a groundwater flow model based on OpenGeoSys. For the exemplary
    application, a two-dimensional vertical cross section of the Al-Batinah Plain
    in northern Oman—6 km long with an aquifer thickness of 57 m at the sea boundary
    and 73 m at the upstream plain side, a hydraulic conductivity k = 1 × 10−3 m/s
    and a porosity of n = 0.3—is modelled (see Fig. 7). The following boundary conditions
    are used: 1. A constant flux boundary at the upstream plain side with an estimated
    inflow q 0. The inflow is equal to the replenishment of the aquifer which was
    calculated by considering the yearly water balance of the upper catchment. 2.
    A constant pressure head boundary condition at the coast (sea water level) together
    with a constant salt concentration at the coastline, 3. Two source terms representing
    the extraction behaviour of the farmers with constant extraction rates during
    a cultivation period by a pump located 2 km away from the coast with 1/12 of the
    extraction rates (one farm) and a polyline 3 km away from the coast which extracts
    11/12 of the extraction rates (other farmers) (see Fig. 7). Based on an initial
    condition representing the current aquifer state (see Fig. 7) long term simulations
    over 20 years are performed. Thereby, the significance of a density-dependent
    approach can be shown by examining the depth-dependence of the concentration profile,
    as the sea water front will reach the pumps first of all at the bottom of the
    aquifer. For performing one simulation run, the OpenGeoSys (OGS) model needs around
    10 min which would be require a computation time of several days if the model
    would be used for solving an optimisation problem directly. To overcome this problem,
    an ANN-OGS as a surrogate model is trained and afterwards used in the management
    model (see Fig. 4). The chosen structure of the ANN-OGS (MLP) comprise as input
    discrete values of water levels and average salinity on 13 given observation points
    x k at the beginning of a cultivation period as well as the abstraction rate over
    the period (all in all 13 + 12 + 1=26 input nodes, see Fig. 7). The ANN provides
    the values for the same state variables at the end of the cultivation period by
    25 output nodes. The advantage of this time step-wise ANN architecture is that
    calculations for simulation periods of different durations are possible. All in
    all 2,546 simulation runs over 20 years are performed on a PC-cluster with the
    OGS-model. Thereby the abstraction rates are varied per cultivation period within
    the range given by Eq. 10. 625 of these simulations are used for the validation
    of the ANN results using the root mean square error (RMSE). The very low RMSE
    values of the MLP nets (see Table 1) demonstrate the high ability of the ANN-OGS
    to simulate the aquifer behaviour instead of the physically based OGS-model. Table
    1 Validation results of the MLP-nets Full size table Estimation of stochastic
    crop production functions for modelling of impacts of water and salt stress on
    crop yield The functionality of the stochastic framework for estimating future
    water demand which is part of the agricultural module (see Fig. 5) is illustrated
    by the following example: sorghum and maize are grown and irrigated at a hypothetical
    plot in the Al-Batinah region (Sultanate of Oman). For simulating the agricultural
    system, we used observed daily weather data taken over the last 18 years (1991–2006)
    from Seeb weather station (International airport, Muscat) and the hydraulic properties
    of a sandy loam soil which is typical for the region (50, 36 and 14% sand, silt
    and clay) as described by Abdelrahman et al. (1993). 100 synthetic weather scenarios
    were produced by the LARS-WG and served as inputs for the simulations with the
    APSIM crop model together with the GET-OPTIS irrigation scheduling optimizer (for
    more details see Schütze et al. 2011b). The statistical analysis of the optimisation
    results (amount of water vs. achieved yields) by any user-defined percentile,
    i.e. 90% yield reliability, forms the resulting stochastic crop water production
    function (SCWPF). Figure 8 shows the SCWPF of sorghum (Fig. 8a) and for maize
    (Fig. 8b) by means of the 10, 50 and 90%-percentile for the specific plot. At
    the 150 mm value of the x coordinates (water volume used for irrigation, see Fig.
    8a) the impact of the variation of the natural climate on the yield of the crops
    under high water stress is displayed. At this stage, precipitation, radiation
    and temperature are mainly responsible for governing the yield level which is
    shown in the histograms in Fig. 8c and d. Fig. 8 Results for sorghum (upper row)
    and maize (lower row) grown at Al-Batinah site a, b quantiles (10, 50, 90%) of
    SCWPF; c, d empirical density function at 150 mm irrigation volume; e, f empirical
    density function at 450 mm resp. 400 mm irrigation volume Full size image With
    the increasing application of irrigation water, the yield rises up to a level
    were additional water supply fails to increase the crop yield any further (around
    450 mm for sorghum and 400 mm for maize). If optimal full irrigation conditions
    are met, the variation in the resulting crop yield can be explained by the variation
    of radiation and temperature between the different years (see Fig. 8e and f).
    It is interesting to note, that the properties of the distribution functions change
    from skewed distributions (at 150 mm irrigation amount) to normal distributions
    (at 450 mm irrigation amount) indicating decreasing risk levels and a reduced
    impact of rainfall variability due to an optimal supplemental irrigation. The
    almost normally distributed yield potential at full irrigation emphasises the
    dominating impact of radiation and temperature on the yield whilst the water supply
    for the crop no longer plays a critical role (for details see Schütze et al. 2011b).
    The SCWPF contains water demand functions for several levels of uncertainty (e.g.
    10, 50 and 90% quantiles) assuming an application efficiency of 100%. The differences
    in application efficiency of different irrigation methods (e.g. highly efficient
    drip irrigation or less efficient surface irrigation methods) can easily be accounted
    for by dividing the water demand by the application efficiency of the considered
    irrigation method which yields the required minimum water volume. Regarding the
    exemplary application of the optimisation framework, a 90% reliability of yield
    is assumed. This is equivalent to the 10% quantile of the SCWPF. Considering salinity
    stress, the selected quantile function is extended by a second dimension namely
    the salinity of the irrigation water using the salinity tolerance index (Steppuhn
    et al. 2005), which describes the impact of the salinity of the irrigation water
    on the crop yield. The resulting 2D-CWPF0,9 are shown in Fig. 9. Sorghum (Fig.
    9 left) achieves a higher yield for a given amount of water and has a higher salt
    tolerance than maize (Fig. 9 right). However, the price per ton for maize higher
    than for sorghum (see Table 2), which offers a higher profit, if the water quality
    is good. Fig. 9 2D-CWPF0,9 of 90% reliability of yield for sorghum (left) and
    maize (right) Full size image Table 2 : Parameters of the exemplary application
    of the management system for the Omani test site Full size table Setup of the
    simulation-based water management model The optimisation framework (Fig. 6) incorporates
    fixed and variable costs for installation and operation of pumping and irrigation
    equipment. Further constraints and parameters regarding Eqs. 1–10 (see “A prototype
    of a simulation-based water management model”) for the exemplary application of
    the management system are listed in Table 2. We perform three optimisation runs
    with different objectives over the next 20 years to maximise. 1. The short term
    profit (within the next 4 years) following the assumption that the farmers decisions
    are profit based, 2. The long term profit over the next 20 years, 3. The profit
    together with the aquifer sustainability as a multi-criteria analysis using an
    equal weighting of w1 and w2. The decision variables are the yearly cultivated
    acreage, the yearly cropping pattern and the yearly irrigation water demands which
    results in a number of 60 decision variables for the 20 years period. Results
    of the simulation-based water management model application As mentioned above,
    three optimisation runs with different weighted objectives are performed to demonstrate
    the functionality of the simulation-based water management model. Under the given
    restrictions/constraints (Table 2), the results shown in Fig. 10 are obtained.
    The lower row of Fig. 10 illustrates the profit with time. For the short term
    profit optimisation run (Fig. 10c), it rises up very quickly in the first 2 years.
    After then the profit is decreasing quite fast due to increasing salinity in the
    irrigation water, shown in Fig. 10b, which also leads to a change in the cropping
    pattern from maize to sorghum (Fig. 10a). The results for the long term profit
    optimisation run shows also a rising and falling profit with time (Fig. 10f).
    Nevertheless, the peak occurs later with a lower peak maximum in relation to the
    short term profit optimisation run. The crop pattern changes also later after
    13 years, which indicates, that the seawater intrusion develops slower than in
    the short term profit run (Fig. 10d). The salinity of irrigation water (Fig. 10e)
    increases in the last 5 years very quickly and achieves a level at the end of
    the 20-year period on which the farmer does not get a profit from the agricultural
    production any longer. The results of the multi-criteria optimisation run (run
    3) shows very smooth graphs (Fig. 10g–i). Maize is grown all the time but on a
    lower acreage than on the beginning stages of run 1 and 2 (Fig. 10g). Therefore,
    the salinity of irrigation water does not raise (Fig. 10h) and a profit is made
    over the whole time (Fig. 10i). Comparing the total return between the three runs
    estimated by the integral of the profit graphs, the best return is achieved in
    run 2. However, at the end of the 20 years, the farmer has to give up farming
    like the farmer in run 1 due to the high salinity levels of the irrigation water.
    In contrast, the farmer in run 3 can work additional 20 years under stationary
    conditions and get then a higher return than the farmer in run 2 because of a
    more sustainable aquifer management. Fig. 10 Results of the three optimisation
    runs illustrated by the percentage of acreage, the salinity and the profit for
    the short term (a–c) and the long term (d–f) profit based optimisation and the
    multi-objective optimisation run (g–i) Full size image The outlined example helps
    to understand the interplay and feedback mechanisms between a groundwater management
    and the agricultural production in terms of water quantity and quality. This can
    only be achieved by the use of predictive models for both the groundwater system
    and the agricultural system. Furthermore, a synthesis of these models by artificial
    intelligence is necessary to allow for an optimisation of an integrated, combined
    management of both compartments in a reasonable time. Exemplarily for run 2, the
    optimisation algorithm needs 1,200,000 evaluations of the objective function and
    a computing time of approx. 3 h on a standard PC for finding an optimal variable
    set. This relatively short computing time will be possible by the use of the ANN-OGS
    surrogate groundwater model which operates approximately 1,000 times faster than
    the physically based OpenGeoSys model. Additionally, a sustainable and integrated
    water management requires objective functions which contain economic, environmental
    and social criteria as well as sustainable measures and long-term management goals.
    Especially, social issues are hardly accessible by an economic evaluation. To
    tackle this problem, a multi-criteria optimisation approach along the lines of
    the principles of pareto optimality (Goldberg 1989) is necessary. Comprehensive
    extensions of the presented example such as sustainable water management for multiple
    demand zones, multiple crops and complex abstraction schemes are envisaged in
    our ongoing research by employing a 3D groundwater model together with a SCWPF-database
    containing all relevant crop/soil relationships for a considered region. Summary
    and outlook Focusing on tackling the challenges of today’s conditions and global
    change, a tailor made non-empirical approach—an integrated APPM—is presented which
    is designed for a most efficient and sustainable management of the scarce water
    resources in arid zones. The new tool relies upon innovative approaches like synthesising
    process models and artificial intelligence techniques as well as sound rigorous
    multi-criteria and multidimensional optimisation still considering the stochastic
    nature of climate development. The APPM aims at achieving optimal solutions for
    water allocation, groundwater storage and withdrawal including saline water management
    with alternative, most beneficial irrigation strategies. Some key issues of the
    methodology are demonstrated by an example application of several of the APPM
    components. A prototype of a simulation-based water management model is presented
    which allows for the management of both the water quality and quantity of a coupled,
    dynamic agriculture-groundwater system. Due to the complex natural behaviour of
    the considered system and the changing environment, process-based models are mandatory.
    This requirement is fulfilled by density driven groundwater flow models as well
    as soil vegetation atmosphere transfer (SVAT)-models for calculating crop yield
    damages due to aquifer over pumping and the resulting irrigation with salty water.
    The results of the exemplary application of the optimisation framework for three
    different optimisation runs show that farm operation focusing exclusively on profit
    maximisation leads—sooner or later—to progressive intrusion of the saltwater front.
    For this reason, a sustainability-criterion must be considered as a second optimisation
    objective. It is demonstrated that in this context a multi-objective optimisation
    can provide sustainable solutions both in an environmental and economical sense.
    To perform the APPM application in reasonable CPU times, a rigorous application
    of artificial intelligence methods is necessary in order to speed up the simulation
    of the hydrodynamic processes. We demonstrated this by the use of an ANN-based
    surrogated model for the density driven groundwater flow modelling as well as
    the use of preprocessed 2D-CWPF instead of a SVAT-model applications within the
    optimisation procedure. The presented prototype of a simulation-based water management
    model forms the basis for the development of a large-scale management and planning
    system focusing on a sustainable arid zone water resources management. Additionally,
    our ongoing research will yield to a more comprehensive assessment of the water
    resources availability and the agricultural water demand. On this basis, an integrated
    water management will be possible including scenario analysis together with local
    experts as well as the urban water systems in a further stage of the project.

    The potential regional impacts of global environmental change present extraordinary
    challenges for users and managers of water resources. This is particularly true
    in regions already subject to water stress, regions possessing weak or inadequate
    water management infrastructure, and regions anticipated to exhibit high local
    sensitivity to broad scale changes in climate. The Volta River Basin, occupying
    over 400,000 km2 within the sub-humid to semi-arid West African savanna zone,
    is characterized by these and other vulnerabilities, including low incomes and
    rapidly expanding population. Volta Basin inhabitants are overwhelmingly rural,
    and small-scale rainfed agriculture is the dominant economic activity, employing
    roughly two in three Basin residents. Agricultural productivity is low, however,
    at roughly 1 metric ton of cereal yield equivalent per hectare, reflecting erratic
    and unreliable precipitation and low levels of fertilizer use—less than 3 kg N
    per ha in Ghana or roughly 20% of the Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) average of 12.6
    kg ha−1, and far below the world average of nearly 100 kg ha−1. Both factors are
    exacerbated by the extremely low percentage of cropland within the basin and surrounding
    region for which supplemental irrigation is available. Less than 1% of agricultural
    lands in Ghana and Burkina Faso are irrigated, as compared to roughly 4% throughout
    SSA and 20% worldwide (World Bank, 2004). Given extreme unreliability of rainfall,
    irrigation development is seen as an obvious strategy to increase agricultural
    productivity and food security. With annual population growth rates around 2.5%,
    national planning studies predict that water demand for irrigation within the
    basin will increase considerably in the near future (MoWH, 1998, Andah and Gichuki,
    2003). Volta Basin rural residents also suffer from limited development of domestic
    water infrastructure, particularly in Burkina Faso, where only 37% of the population
    has access to improved water supply and 27% to improved sanitation (World Bank,
    2004). One response to the problems associated with inadequate irrigation and
    rural domestic water supplies has been the utilization of small reservoirs in
    Northern Ghana and throughout Burkina Faso. Several hundred have been constructed
    over the last 4 decades by government agencies and NGOs. These multipurpose structures
    impound the transient rainy season runoff from small catchments to provide rural
    communities with seasonal storage for small-scale irrigation and water for domestic
    purposes, livestock and aquaculture. The reservoirs begin filling with the onset
    of the rainy season, and provide supplemental irrigation during the rainfed cropping
    season (April to September) and primary water supply for a second, irrigated cropping
    season (October to February). In many locations, these reservoirs are completely
    dry prior to the onset of the following year''s rains. Small reservoirs appear
    to have many desirable features, including relatively low capital investment requirements
    and a scale of construction and operation consistent with local, decentralized
    management. They are often described as significant local sources of groundwater
    recharge, although there is little empirical research documenting small reservoir–groundwater
    interactions. Many questions arise concerning the relative benefits of an irrigation
    development strategy based on extensive construction of small reservoirs. Low-relief
    terrain settings dictate that these reservoirs typically have high surface area-to-volume
    ratios. Large open water areas are exposed to steep humidity gradients during
    several months of the year, leading to high evaporation rates. Numerical simulation
    suggests that evaporative losses (roughly 30% of annual water budgets) can easily
    exceed potential withdrawals for irrigation (around 10%). Additionally, reservoir
    siltation due to erosion within reservoir catchment areas can reduce storage capacity
    significantly during relatively short time spans, necessitating premature rehabilitation.
    Additional questions can be raised concerning the optimal density of small dam
    development, specifically the impacts of small dam ensembles on downstream flows,
    and the potential for negative health and environmental externalities (Van de
    Giesen et al., 2004, Amerasinghe et al., 2001). Groundwater can serve as a substitute
    for stored surface water, and potentially as a complementary source of irrigation
    water at suitable locations within the Volta Basin, and the conjunctive use of
    surface water and groundwater is an important area of irrigation research (O’Mara,
    1988). Annual groundwater extraction via boreholes, hand dug wells, and piped
    systems has increased substantially over past decades, although present levels
    of groundwater utilization are estimated to remain within sustainable limits throughout
    much of the basin, and specifically at between 5% and 10% of recharge in the Upper
    East Region, containing our research site (Martin and Van de Giesen, 2005). Groundwater
    is used preferentially for rural water supply, however, so that strategies promoting
    groundwater irrigation must be evaluated carefully to eliminate the possibility
    of conflict with critical domestic uses. We describe the development, calibration
    and preliminary application of a dynamically coupled economic–hydrologic simulation–optimization
    model ensemble designed to evaluate the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater
    in small reservoir-based irrigation systems characteristic of the Upper Volta
    Basin. We focus on a representative small reservoir-irrigation system located
    in the Antakwidi catchment within the Upper East Region of Ghana. The model ensemble
    consists of the physical hydrology model WaSiM-ETH and an economic optimization
    model written in GAMS. The dynamic linkage of hydrologic and economic models is
    appropriate because decisions concerning the quantity and timing of surface and
    groundwater abstractions, respectively, act in turn to modify the hydrologic boundary
    conditions constraining such decisions. Furthermore, the dynamics of hydrologic
    processes cannot be simulated accurately within the economic optimization model
    itself without a substantial increase in model complexity, increasing the burden
    on nonlinear optimization solvers. Of particular interest is the impact of groundwater
    extraction for irrigation on depth to water table, since village bore- and dug
    wells are of restricted depth, at least over the short term, and irrigation development
    strategies must not succeed at the expense of vital access to water for domestic
    purposes. This study was intended as a “proof of concept”, specifically, a means
    of testing and evaluating an approach to integrating hydrologic and economic optimization
    models with respect to feasibility, as distinct from producing a specific set
    of empirical research results that can be held up to examination in their own
    right. Therefore, we focus more on the methodology rather than specific results.
    We begin by presenting some general features of the study area, and discussing
    selected research literature. We then discuss the coupled hydrologic–economic
    model configurations followed by selected results of the conjunctive use optimization.
    In conclusion, we propose future extensions of the modeling work within the framework
    of the Glowa Volta Project. 2. Study area: the Volta Basin and Atankwidi catchment
    The Volta Basin is located in West Africa between 5°30N–14°30N and 2°00E–5°30W
    (Fig. 1). The basin encompasses the majority of Ghana (70% of land area) and Burkina
    Faso (63%) and lesser portions of Togo, Benin, Mali and Cote d’Ivoire. It is a
    low-relief basin with elevations ranging from sea level to 920 m (mean elevation
    257 m) and correspondingly low channel grades. The lower Volta Basin is fed by
    three major tributaries. To the west, the Black Volta (147,000 km2) drains western
    Burkina Faso and small areas within Mali and Cote d’Ivoire; the White Volta (106,000
    km2) drains much of northern and central Ghana and Burkina Faso, and to the east,
    the Oti (72,000 km2) drains the northwestern regions of Benin and Togo. Download

    with Atankwidi catchment (flows gradients detail map) and reservoirs indicated.
    The Atankwidi is a tributary to the White Volta, flowing south from Burkina Faso
    into the Upper East Region of Ghana between Navrongo and Bolgatanga. The Atankwidi
    Catchment (Fig. 2), 276 km2 in area, is typical of agricultural catchments found
    in the Upper East Region (UER), which is situated in the transitional area between
    the northern Guinea and the Sudan savanna zones. Within the transition zone, vegetation
    is characterized by open woodland savannas associated with perennial grasses in
    the south, and increasingly with annual tussock grasses in the northern zone (Iloege,
    1980, Windmeijer and Riesse, 1993). Annual precipitation is around 990 mm distributed
    over pronounced rainy (April to October) and dry (October to March) seasons, and
    annual average temperatures are above 18 °C (Martin, 2005). Monthly rainfall exceeds
    potential evaporation for 2–7 months per year. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 2. Atankwidi catchment detail, with reservoirs indicated. The UER contains
    the highest levels of groundwater use per km2 within the Volta River basin. Geology
    consists of Brimian rocks of Paleoproterozoic age, which are part of the West
    African Man Shield (Martin and Van de Giesen, 2005). Formations that are found
    within the catchment are Birimian metasediments, granitoids (granodiorites, granite
    and gneiss) associated with the Birimian and intrusive Bongo granite. Granitoids
    make up the largest part of the study area. Outcrops of the potassium-rich pink
    Bongo granite are found in the northern and eastern part of the catchment. Soils
    in the catchment typically consist of sandy loam to sandy clay loam with high
    clay contents in the upper part of the profile and an increasingly coarse texture
    with depth. Weathering on average reaches a depth of 30–40 m. The main groundwater
    bearing zone is the lower weathered zone, where the fresh rock is only moderately
    weathered. Groundwater potential in the region is estimated at good to moderate
    (Martin and Van de Giesen, 2005). The village of Kandiga (pop. 6000), which lies
    within Atankwidi catchment, consists of a central complex and peripheral settlements.
    Kandiga is the seat of the District Chief Executive. It has a large secondary
    school, health clinic, Women''s Development Association and a tree-planting club
    that promotes tree planting to improve soil fertility. Groundwater pumping was
    introduced with the help of the NGO Water Aid, which provided pumps and training.
    Management and maintenance are performed by the local community (Shao and Biglobosa,
    2002). Rural households are organized by compounds occupied by extended families
    engaged in mixed livestock and cultivation. The land is generally not privately
    owned; it is communally owned with the earth priests (Tindaana) exerting authority
    superimposed on government land tenure regulations. Some farmers are engaged in
    off-farm activities including trading, clothes-making and cash-crop cultivation,
    such as shea-butter, to supplement their farm income. Livestock is used as a store
    of value: farmers sell cattle during or following bad harvests to finance food
    purchases. Stocking rates of livestock are much higher than the national average
    in Kassena-Nankana district where Kandiga is located. This hedging strategy to
    insure against bad harvests contributes to land overgrazing. There were two small
    reservoirs in the catchment in 2004, the year the study was undertaken; one of
    which is used for irrigation (Kandiga Reservoir or Reservoir 1, see Fig. 2). The
    surface area of the Kandiga reservoir is 8 ha when full. Reservoir 2 has a surface
    area of 7 ha and is used mainly to provide drinking water for cattle. Kandiga
    Reservoir (Reservoir 1), built in the early 1990s with donor funds, is typical
    of the small reservoirs distributed throughout the mid- and upper regions of the
    Volta Basin (Fig. 3). These reservoirs consist of earth-fill dams roughly 2.5–10
    m in height and 100–750 m in length with passive spillways, capable of storing
    maximum volumes of 104–107 m3 and serving irrigation perimeters of between 5 and
    20 ha (LACOSREP, 2004). The irrigation perimeters are equipped with small networks
    of distribution channels, typically lined with concrete and controlled via manually
    operated gates. Water is diverted from the reservoir to the channel network via
    one or more submerged conduits running beneath the dam and controlled by valves
    located on the downstream toe of the dam (Fig. 4). Download : Download full-size

    for the economic model. 3. Modeling objectives and approach The task of achieving
    efficient, sustainable water management within Atankwidi catchment reflects, in
    microcosm, the broader challenges of integrated water resources management within
    the Volta Basin. While water is not absolutely scarce in a climatic sense (at
    least in most years), the spatial and temporal variability of rainfall and runoff
    result in a situation in which water supply represents the binding constraint
    to improved agricultural productivity, household income, health and well-being
    in many regions. During the dry season, irrigated agriculture competes with domestic,
    livestock, aquaculture and occasionally other sources of demand for available
    water resources. The water management challenge involves the strategic allocation
    of stored surface water and groundwater to meet these competing objectives in
    a manner that is sustainable, and which reflects the hierarchy of value of water
    in its respective uses. In this study, water for domestic purposes (drinking,
    food preparation, bathing, washing, sanitation) is assumed to hold the highest
    priority, intrinsically. The development of a coupled hydrologic–economic model
    ensemble is intended to support the following activities, among others: • Dynamic
    coupling of a distributed physical model and an economic optimization model. •
    Optimization of cropping strategies and associated irrigation schedules at existing
    small reservoir locations. • Cost-benefit analysis of small multipurpose reservoirs.
    • Evaluation of the optimal (maximum) density of small reservoir development.
    3.1. Approaches to the integration of economics and hydrology The integrated model
    complex described here is designed to possess both simulation and optimization
    capabilities. The simulation capabilities are required to predict the response
    of the subcatchment hydrologic system to a given pattern of water storage, allocation
    and transfer decisions with sufficient accuracy to allow quantification of likely
    costs, benefits and impacts on each competing user community and on the physical
    environment. The optimization capabilities are required to reduce the number of
    alternatives requiring detailed simulation by identifying configurations of cropping
    and irrigation scheduling, reservoir operation, groundwater abstraction and possibly
    other policy-related parameters that lead to desirable outcomes (McKinney and
    Savitsky, 2003). In recent years, a number of integrated water resources management
    studies have been conducted in which economic optimization models have been linked
    with models of surface water and groundwater hydrology. In one modeling format
    (“unified”), the technical, economic and hydrologic model components are integrated
    in a unitary body of code, such as GAMS (Brooke et al., 1998). Studies employing
    this modeling approach include Rosegrant et al.''s (2000) study of the Maipo Basin,
    Chile, Cai et al., 2003a, Cai et al., 2003b studies of the Syr Darya Basin in
    Central Asia, Ringler and Cai''s (2003) study of the Mekong Basin, and Rodgers
    and Zaafrano''s (2003) study of the Brantas Basin, Indonesia. In an alternative
    approach, economic optimization models are coupled with engineering hydrology
    and possibly other simulation models and run as ensembles. Recent examples of
    studies employing coupled model ensembles for integrated analysis at basin-scale
    include Draper et al. (2003) and Jenkins et al.''s (2004) California water management
    study, Quinn et al.''s (2004) study of climate change and water resources in the
    San Joaquin River Basin, California, Letcher et al.''s (2002) IWRAM project to
    evaluate the impacts of climate, commodity prices and government policies on agricultural
    output and water supply within the Mae Chaem catchment, Thailand, and Barth et
    al.''s (2004) DANUBIA project. Each approach has advantages and disadvantages.
    The unified approach reduces model integration and data management tasks by eliminating
    the need for model interfaces. As a consequence, however, the representation of
    many hydrologic (and possibly other) processes must be greatly simplified to avoid
    over-taxing optimization algorithms. Cases in which physical systems can be described
    realistically only by functions that are not continuously differentiable, or which
    contain abrupt thresholds, pose particular problems for nonlinear solvers. This
    can result in overly simplistic treatments of hydrologic processes such as groundwater
    flow and soil moisture storage. The unified modeling approach in any event requires
    an external source of hydrologic data to provide boundary conditions such as the
    time series of inflows to each river reach, because land surface hydrologic processes,
    including rainfall-runoff dynamics, cannot realistically be incorporated within
    the optimization framework itself. The use of coupled model ensembles greatly
    enhances the modelers’ ability to simulate hydrologic, terrestrial and socioeconomic
    processes at finer levels of detail, and likely with enhanced accuracy, but model
    coupling introduces the need for significant software engineering tasks required
    to enable inter-operability. Having selected the coupled approach, our primary
    research task is to develop the interface between the physical hydrology and economic
    optimization models in a manner that minimizes redundancy, allowing GAMS to take
    full advantage of WaSiM''s simulation capabilities. This challenge embodies both
    a research task, which is to determine an efficient allocation of computational
    effort between these models, and a software engineering task. 3.2. WaSiM-ETH—physical
    hydrology We chose WaSiM-ETH (Schulla and Jasper, 1999), developed at the Swiss
    Federal Institute of Technology (ETH), because the model has been successfully
    calibrated and applied within the framework of the GLOWA—Volta project in the
    Volta basin at full basin scale (400,000 km2), sub-catchment scale (100,000 km2)
    and at small watershed scale (300 km2) (Jung, 2006; Wagner et al., 2006; Martin,
    2005). It is a distributed, physically based combined hydrologic surface, subsurface
    and groundwater model. It is spatially differentiated and supports both continuous
    and event-based rainfall-runoff simulations. Temporal resolution can range from
    minutes to daily time intervals. Spatial dimensioning is represented via a grid
    system consisting of equal-sized orthogonal cells and spatial resolution can range
    from 1 m to many kilometers. The model domain can be subdivided into sub-basins,
    which can be extracted automatically from a digital elevation model (DEM) using
    a digital terrain analysis tool. It is also possible to subdivide the model domain
    into other zones of interest, e.g. into different land-use regions, or into upper
    and lower sub-watersheds, as in this study. In either approach, the basic subdivision
    is defined on a rectangular grid which may contain variably sized cells, similar
    to the spatial structure of climate models, i.e. grid cells show only small changes
    in width from row to row. WaSiM ETH permits the simulation of regulated reservoirs,
    river branching and artificial abstractions including irrigation. In simulating
    irrigation, the model allows users to specify whether water is taken from groundwater
    (from a lower layer within the same cell where irrigation is applied) or from
    surface water (the reservoir). The respective surface water and groundwater balances
    are then re-calculated to account for the impact of irrigation. The input data
    files are shown in Fig. 5. Spatial data requirements include a digital elevation
    map (DEM), land-use and soil types, formatted to conform to the model spatial

    required for the hydrology and economics models and the data exchange between
    them. The structure of WaSiM-ETH is modular, and alternative calculation methods
    are often available to model a given hydrologic process. In this study, the following
    specification options were used in calibrating and validating the model: • Meteorological
    data at hourly time intervals were used, and Inverse Distance Weighting was used
    for spatial interpolation. • Potential evapotranspiration was calculated using
    the Penman–Monteith approach (Monteith, 1975, Brutsaert, 1982). • Actual evapotranspiration
    was calculated via a simple reduction function of potential evaporation. Actual
    evaporation was estimated by reducing potential evaporation based on soil moisture
    storage below a specified threshold, set at 0.6 mm following Menzel (1997). •
    Infiltration was simulated using an approach following Peschke, 1977, Peschke,
    1987 based on the Green and Ampt (1911) model. • Richards’ equation was used to
    model soil water dynamics. • A two-dimensional groundwater model utilizing an
    implicit finite difference scheme was dynamically coupled to the unsaturated zone.
    The interface between the model and the user is the WaSiM-ETH control file, which
    contains all information required for the model run: (a) parameters controlling
    the model run, (b) file- and path names controlling input and output operations
    and (c) hydrologic model parameters, property tables and statistic model parameters.
    The control file is subdivided into separate sections, each responsible for a
    sub-model or for a separate theme such as interpolation of parameters or land
    use table. A more detailed description of WaSiM-ETH computational methods appears
    in the model handbook (Schulla, 1997). 3.3. GAMS—economic optimization The conjunctive
    use economic optimization model developed for this study is coded in GAMS (General
    Algebraic Modeling System; Brooke et al., 1998), which was developed in the 1980s
    to facilitate development of increasingly complex operations research models,
    and has been used widely in the water resources and agricultural economics research
    communities. GAMS is a file-oriented system, which simplifies interface and data
    exchange with other applications, and provides seamless access to a wide range
    of large-scale linear, nonlinear and mixed-integer optimization solvers. The conjunctive
    use—small reservoir prototype model, like all GAMS models, consists of sets (indices
    or model objects), data (scalars and exogenously determined parameters), variables
    (decision and state), variable bounds and constraints, equations, and other statements
    controlling the flow of calculations and passing instructions to the solver. Each
    member of a given set shares a common set of behavioral rules, equipping GAMS
    with object-like capabilities. For example, all members of a set of river reaches
    can be described in terms of the same generic water balance equation, although
    descriptive parameter values are reach-specific. This makes it relatively easy
    to add new model elements, or change the characteristics of existing elements
    without modifying the system of variables and equations comprising the model.
    Our prototype optimization model is a greatly simplified representation of the
    Atankwidi catchment. The model contains two small reservoirs and an irrigation
    system associated with one of them (Reservoir 1, Kandiga) overlying a shallow
    aquifer (Fig. 4). Water from the Western tributary is captured and stored in Reservoir
    1, which has a total (live + dead) capacity of roughly 40,000 m3. Inflow to the
    reservoir in excess of full capacity is spilled through a passive spillway, and
    flows downstream to the confluence of reaches. Water can be withdrawn for irrigation
    through a conduit located below the dam and controlled by a valve. The irrigation
    system consists of 10 ha of irrigable command area, and contains soils assumed
    suitable for the cultivation of the dominant crops grown in the region, including
    rice, maize, tomatoes and onions. Irrigation water can also be extracted from
    the underlying aquifer, although at a variable cost assumed equal to the cost
    of electric power needed to pump one cubic meter of water from groundwater depth
    to surface. Pumping costs are thus directly proportional to the vertical distance
    to water table. The aquifer is recharged locally, via percolation from the small
    reservoir, irrigation system conveyance losses, deep percolation from irrigated
    areas, and by diffuse recharge due to its position in the local groundwater flow
    field. The model includes an objective function, water balances for the reservoir,
    river network and irrigation system, and a crop-water production function. The
    model also includes physical and economic constraints, such as a limit on the
    maximum extent of irrigable area. Constraints on water allocation patterns are
    imposed to maintain seasonally determined minimum reservoir levels for stock watering,
    and by maximum depths to groundwater (corresponding to existing well depths) to
    ensure the reliability of domestic water supply. The constraint for livestock
    watering reflects the priority that the local population places on maintaining
    livestock, as revealed in household surveys. The maximum depth—domestic water
    supply constraint (wells cannot dry out) is motivated by the priority placed on
    domestic uses, consistent with the treatment of domestic water supply as a social,
    rather than an economic good. The objective function in the model describes the
    sum of net benefits of available stored water (Z), consisting of returns to irrigated
    crop production, a proxy measure of the value of water stored for in-reservoir
    uses, and costs associated with pumping groundwater: Net benefits from irrigation
    are calculated on a per hectare basis as physical yield in t ha−1 (Ycp) multiplied
    by the farm-gate price of the respective commodity in dollars per tonne (Pcp),
    less the average costs of production (ACcp), which consist largely of labor, low
    levels of fertilizer use, herbicide, and traction. Per-hectare net benefits are
    multiplied by the number of hectares harvested (Acp). Water stored in the reservoir
    is used also for other purposes, such as stock watering and brick making (consumptive
    uses) and informal fisheries and clothes washing (non-consumptive uses). Reliable
    economic data are not available to evaluate the explicit value of a unit of water
    used for these purposes. Hence, we assign a single unit benefit (SP) to the volume
    of water held in storage for each time period (RSpd). We use an initial value
    of SP of $5.00 per 10,000 m3 in storage, per week. We also examine the impacts
    on management decisions of SP values ranging between $3.00 and $100. Groundwater
    extraction costs (CGWpd) were evaluated using a proxy measure, which is the market
    cost of electricity required to lift one cubic meter of water the required distance,
    times the volume lifted. In the UER, most farmers lift water manually (by bucket)
    from open dug-wells. The use of electricity as a proxy measure allows us to make
    explicit the costs involved in lifting water over variable distances, and to impose
    practical limits on the volume of extraction from any well during a given period.
    Choices regarding crops and planting dates are two important decision variables.
    Economically important local crops include irrigated rice, tomatoes and onions
    grown in the dry season and wet rice in the rainy season, which typically requires
    supplemental irrigation. The model operates at weekly time steps, and the simulated
    cropping calendar begins with the onset of the rainy season, so that week 1 corresponds
    to April 1–7 and week 52 to March 24–30 of the following year. Crop choice determines
    the economic productivity of water, and total returns to irrigating households.
    Long-season crops generally have larger water requirements and place greater restrictions
    on subsequent planting decisions. The option to use staggered planting dates reflects
    the differing water requirements at each stage of crop development. Many crops
    have relatively low water requirements during the initial and final stages, but
    demand increases as the crop canopy develops. Optimal strategies may involve staggered
    plantings to ensure that the entire crop does not reach maximum water (and labor)
    demand at the same time. Crop yield as a function of water supply (direct precipitation
    + irrigation) is simulated using the standard FAO yield coefficient method (FAO
    56): YC is observed (simulated) yield, is yield potential, assuming water is not
    limiting, kc is the empirical FAO crop-water response coefficient, ETA is actual
    crop evapotranspiration and ETC is potential crop evapotranspiration. ETC is determined
    by environmental controls, including radiation, temperature, humidity, and wind
    speed; and by crop type and developmental stage. Decision variables include the
    allocation of land to each crop in each season, planting dates, and the amounts
    of surface water and groundwater diverted for irrigation in each period. The volume
    of water in the reservoir is described using a conventional control volume approach
    (Fig. 4): St is storage at the end of period t, Pt is direct precipitation during
    period t, Qt is inflow from the catchment, Et is surface evaporation, RPt is overflow
    spillage, Gt is percolation to groundwater and It is abstraction for irrigation.
    Among these, only It is a decision variable. Pt and Qt are exogenously determined
    (boundary conditions). The remaining terms (Et, RPt, Gt) are functions of reservoir
    storage and are dependent on decisions regarding It. Evaporation (Et), in particular,
    is strongly dependent on storage through the areal extent of reservoir surface
    area, which is related to storage via a surface area-to-volume curve based on
    Liebe (2002) and applicable to small reservoirs in this region. 3.4. Physically
    based approach to model integration Measured data on climate and hydrology within
    the Atankwidi catchment are scarce, and are limited in most cases to a small number
    of sites and a few recent years. We use meteorological and hydrologic data collected
    primarily through GLOWA Volta project activities during 2001 through 2005 (Martin,
    2005). The physical hydrology model (WaSiM-ETH) is calibrated and validated using
    existing data, and is then used to generate time series of surface discharge,
    groundwater levels and other required hydrologic data at locations and/or time
    periods for which measured data are absent or inadequate. Long-term meteorological
    data are available for Atankwidi in the form of MM5 mesoscale climate simulations
    covering the entire Volta Basin (Jung, 2006). This model-generated data provide
    the boundary conditions for the economic optimization model. Once the optimal
    solution is obtained, the values of decision variables are passed back to the
    hydrologic model, which is re-executed. The output is examined to determine whether
    the original boundary conditions are still valid, and in particular, if groundwater
    levels have fallen below acceptable bounds. If conditions have been violated,
    restrictions on groundwater extraction are tightened, and the optimization model
    re-executed. The process is illustrated in the dataflow diagram (Fig. 5). 4. Model
    results 4.1. Results of WaSiM-ETH model The model WaSiM-ETH was successful in
    simulating the catchment hydrology. Although comparison between the daily measured
    and simulated runoff at the catchment outlet (Fig. 6) shows that some of the peaks
    in the hydrograph do not match, the total volume of measured runoff (98 mm) was
    very close to the total volume of simulated runoff (114 mm) for the rainy season
    (Table 1). The coefficient of determination (R2) was 0.72 (see Fig. 7), indicating
    a reasonably good calibration. The Nash–Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient
    (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) of 0.2 was calculated after taking out one outlier
    point. Although data from five rain gauges were incorporated to calculate the
    spatial precipitation field over the 273 km2 catchment, rainfall variability within
    the catchment confounded efforts to improve the calibration. The model performance
    is likely to improve with a longer time series of data. Download : Download full-size

    daily outputs (mm/day). According to the water balance calculations, annual total
    runoff was 14% of the annual total Rainfall (Table 1). The average estimated potential
    ET is 2503 mm for the year and 1095 mm for the rainy season. The simulated actual
    ET values are 953 mm for the year and 630 mm for the rainy season. These high
    values (total 2004 rainfall was 973 mm) are typical for the semi-arid climate
    of the Volta Basin. A previous study of the annual water balance in the Upper
    East Region (Andreini et al., 2000) based on historical data showed that up to
    90% of total catchment rainfall is accounted for by ET. The mean annual daily
    temperature for 2004 was 27.6 °C and average relative humidity was 42%. During
    the rainy season, mean temperature was 28.2 °C and relative humidity was 66%.
    Water balance calculations indicate that there is positive groundwater recharge
    during the rainy season (32 mm) although there is a net negative recharge over
    the entire year (−10 mm). Therefore, a complete shift from using surface water
    to groundwater might not be sustainable, assuming that 2004 conditions are typical.
    However, 2004 was a drier than normal year, and the use of supplemental groundwater
    irrigation is a good strategy to reduce the risk and vulnerability associated
    with sole dependence on surface water for irrigation, particularly during intermittent
    periods of surface water scarcity. ET losses can also occur in the dry season
    due to transpiration from plants, particularly trees with deep root systems. These
    results suggest that to increase water retention and water use within the catchment,
    management strategies must focus on reducing losses through ET and increasing
    groundwater recharge. The errors (and variation in errors) in the hydrological
    model, presented in Table 1 are +18% during one rainy season and −11% during one
    calendar year. As the model was calibrated using runoff, the errors could be due
    to underestimates in groundwater recharge and the re-charge of soil moisture storage
    during the rainy season. However, during the dry season, capillary rise from groundwater
    resources to soil moisture, and hence to evapotranspiration, seems to be underestimated.
    At the same time, the model may be over-estimating evapotranspiration during the
    entire calendar year. The implications of these results for the optimization model
    are that there may be underestimation of available groundwater. The main goal
    of the study was to test the model integration concept. Therefore, it was decided
    that the simulated water balances were acceptable to run the optimization model.
    4.2. Results of the water optimization model Using WaSiM-ETH output as input data,
    the optimal cropping pattern was determined in GAMS using nonlinear optimization.
    The optimal strategy, defined as the decision set that maximizes the objective
    function, involves the use of direct precipitation, in conjunction with periodic
    reservoir diversions, to grow a wet season rice crop; followed by a dry season
    crop consisting of a mix of onions and tomatoes, planted at staggered intervals.
    The dry season crops utilize reservoir storage initially, but are primarily irrigated
    via groundwater. The staggered cropping calendar offsets the water-intensive periods
    of specific crops, improving overall water use efficiency. The optimal strategy
    involves planting the entire 10 ha command area with wet (paddy) rice in week
    7 (May 13–19) when precipitation is sufficient to ensure adequate soil moisture
    and begin filling the reservoir. This 140 day crop is harvested in week 26 (September
    23–29), near the end of the rainy season. In week 27, 3.7 ha of onions are planted
    (150 day crop), followed by 2.4 ha of tomatoes in week 32 (120 day crop), and
    an additional 3.9 ha of tomatoes in week 36, for a total of 10 ha of dry season
    crops. The optimal cropping and irrigation schedules are shown in Fig. 8. The
    profits from irrigated agriculture ($18,943) dominate the objective function value
    ($19,433), with in-reservoir storage uses contributing an additional $572 and
    implicit pumping costs reducing benefits by $82 (Table 2). Agricultural profits
    are equivalent to roughly $950 ha−1 per crop season, or $1895 ha−1 per year. The
    assumed value of water for in-reservoir uses (SP) has little impact on the optimal
    cropping strategy. As indicated in Table 2, varying SP between $3 and $100 per
    10,000 m3/week has only a minor impact on net revenue from irrigated cropping,
    groundwater extraction costs and mean storage levels. An important reason for
    this is the high level of evaporative losses from the reservoir as the dry season
    progresses. Irrigated agriculture effectively competes with the atmosphere for
    available reservoir resources, and little is gained by holding water in reserve,
    only to be lost subsequently to non-productive evaporation. Download : Download

    11,829.4 85.5 30536.5 2.3 The extent to which this strategy results in optimal
    use of reservoir water depends critically on the actual pattern of rainfall and
    reservoir inflow. Thus our results are to some degree contingent upon the 2004
    climate and reported input and output prices. Assuming that long-term climate
    and hydrology data are available, an exceedance probability-based approach is
    clearly preferable. The basic strategy identified, dictated broadly by the seasonality
    of rainfall, runoff and storage, is likely to be successful over a wide range
    of annual conditions, with modest adjustments in times of planting. The water
    budget in the small reservoir is summarized in Table 3. Irrigation diversions
    are small, relative to both reservoir spills and to water surface evaporation,
    highlighting the relative inefficiency of these structures as sources of irrigation
    water. It is typical in reservoir optimization schedules to enforce a constraint
    that ending storage equals or exceeds beginning storage, although in this year
    (2004), rainfall was abnormally low, and the reservoir nearly dried out by year''s
    end, independent of the pattern of irrigation withdrawal. Under these circumstances,
    the stock watering constraint must be relaxed during months of zero storage to
    allow for a feasible solution. In practice, when reservoirs dry out, livestock
    are watered from dug-outs, or are moved to areas of perennial storage. The study
    site was visited in 2005 and it was observed that farmers had decided to not plant
    any crops that year. We were told that the reason for this was because in 2004,
    the water in the reservoir ran out before harvest and as a result, the harvest
    was very low, confirming the accuracy of water balance simulations. Had farmers
    used supplemental irrigation from groundwater, as recommended in this modeling
    exercise, this harvest losses would have been minimized. Table 3. Water budget

    exercise described above involved a single recent year (2004), as the primary
    focus of the study was to develop a methodology for coupling the economic and
    hydrological models. To provide sound guidance for water management decision-making,
    however, a wider range of climatic conditions must be modeled. Extended simulations
    involving many years will allow us to address a wider range of issues, such as
    the return on investments in small reservoirs over their design lifetime (20–30
    years) and management protocols for drought years. Multi-year simulations would
    also enhance the performance of WaSiM-ETH, as initial conditions for each year
    would be linked to climate, and to decisions taken in previous years. WaSiM-ETH
    is a useful tool for simulating a wide range of hydrologic variables required
    for optimization studies in a data-scarce environment. However, several aspects
    of WaSiM''s specification restrict its suitability in particular applications.
    WaSiM currently does not possess the capacity cannot be used to model a storage
    reservoir as such—reservoirs are presently simulated by ponding water on a pixel
    or pixels, by introducing a clay layer in the soil model. The impact of reservoir
    retention is simulated by applying an abstraction rule (a volume-runoff-table
    for each reservoir) or by applying a single linear storage approach to uncontrolled
    reservoirs in the routing model. As a consequence, explicit stage-storage-area
    relationships, essential in predicting evaporative losses accurately, cannot be
    specified. In the context of this study, GAMS was used to simulate reservoir behavior
    in part to overcome this limitation. To identify optimal cropping strategies that
    are robust to climatic variation, the economic optimization model must also be
    expanded to optimize over many years and the treatment of non-water resource constraints
    must be improved. In its current form, the objective basis for optimization is
    limited primarily to market valuation of crop production, based largely on crop-water
    response. Current GAMS development work focuses on improving the framework of
    economic analysis by expanding the production function to include a more detailed
    representation of a farm economy, including additional resource constraints, such
    as family labor. One potentially important modification, currently under development,
    involves the addition of soil moisture accounting within the optimization model.
    Crop-water supply and use are mediated by the volume of water stored in the root
    zone. Explicit simulation of moisture storage will allow a wider and more realistic
    set of water management options to be explored, including deficit irrigation strategies.

    in the Upper Volta basin (Cecchi et al., 2008). They provide seasonal water storage
    for small-scale irrigation during the cropping season (Bharati et al., 2008),
    water for livestock and an opportunity for fish farming (Venot and Cecchi, 2011).
    They act as a buffer against extreme weather events (Boelee et al., 2013) and
    are considered instrumental for local food security and livelihoods (Palmieri
    et al., 2001; Wisser et al., 2010; Poussin et al., 2015). Show abstract View all

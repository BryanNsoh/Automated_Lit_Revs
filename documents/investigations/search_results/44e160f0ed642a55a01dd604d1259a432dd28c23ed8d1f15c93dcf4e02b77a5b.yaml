    Get rights and content Abstract In many studies, simulation crop models have been
    applied to test the effect of different crop management and cropping sequences
    on the agronomic performances or to develop criteria assessing the sustainability
    of cropping systems. However, the representation of farmer’s behaviour is still
    weak. MOUSTICS is a not crop-specific biodecisional model that links biophysical
    and decision approaches in a single operating model. The model includes a description
    of the farmers’ actions and of the impact of these actions on the biophysical
    system. It is based on the STICS crop model and on the MODERATO decision model.
    It has been used to test the impact of cropping system distribution on water demand
    over a large French territory. Highlights ► To propose new crop management, representing
    farmer’s decision is important. ► A decision model and a crop model were linked
    to create a biodecisional model. ► Re-use of models using computing engineering
    allows to create complex new models. Previous article in issue Next article in

    modellingManagement rules 1. Introduction Due to the rapid changes in the agricultural
    context (climate change, market globalisation, environmental concerns, etc.) new
    methods of production are required to guarantee sustainable production. To test
    them, on-field experiments are too slow and limited in scope. In silico approaches,
    based on the study of a wide range of possible systems through modelling and simulation,
    offer the possibility of quickly identifying new systems designed to tackle current
    social, political and environmental concerns (Malézieux et al., 2001, Loyce and
    Wéry, 2006, Bergez et al., 2010). These new systems can then be tested in real
    farms or modified through participatory research. Simulation models have been
    applied to test the effect of different crop management practices and cropping
    sequences on the agronomic performance. For example, many agricultural models
    have been developed to analyse irrigation requirements of maize crops: either
    empirical ones such as PLANGRO (Wenda and Hanks, 1981) or more mechanistic one
    like CERES-Maize (Howell et al., 1989, Epperson et al., 1993, Hook, 1994), EPIC
    (Bryant et al., 1992), EPIC-PHASE (Cabelguenne et al., 1997), CROPSYST (Stockle,
    1997) or STICS (Tayot et al., 1998, Brisson et al., 1998). Some of these models
    have been used to test irrigation schedules using a limited amount of water (Epperson
    et al., 1993, Cabelguenne et al., 1997). Although few biophysical models are designed
    for decision making, several have been used for this purpose. Models were first
    created by gathering the existing knowledge and then used to test irrigation schedules
    with different amounts of irrigation and estimating either yield or net return
    value from irrigation (Bogess and Ritchie, 1988, Stockle and James, 1989, Martin
    et al., 1996). Models have also been used to develop criteria to evaluate the
    sustainability of cropping systems and to select criteria before performing actual
    tests at the farm scale (Malézieux et al., 2001). Quite often, the representation
    of crop management practices in standard crop models is largely restricted to
    the technical operations used to manage a limited number of production factors
    (Bergez et al., 2006). Strategies of management practices are defined as sequences
    of goal-oriented, carefully thought out and interdependent actions (the goal often
    being yield-related). In designing these strategies, one must take into account
    a wide range of interdependent temporal and spatial scales. It is essential for
    the scales of the decisions and those of the biophysical system to be mutually
    consistent. In this context, a general modelling exercise should quite naturally
    be based on three components (Le Gal et al., 2010): (i) a model of the biophysical
    system (the weather, pests, soil, crop model), (ii) a model of human actions on
    the system (the decision model) and (iii) dynamic constraints which have to be
    taken into account such as, for example, water resources availability changing
    during the growing season. To reach such a modelling framework, a key feature
    is to link biophysical and decision approaches in a single operating model such
    as Carberry et al. (2002) in FARMSCAPE, Keating et al. (2003) in APSIM, Chatelin
    et al. (2005) in DECIBLE or Donatelli et al. (2010) in APES. These models use
    the general concept of decision-making modelling based on a set of decision rules
    (Aubry et al., 1998, Chatelin and Mousset, 1997). Such models include a description
    of the farmers’ actions and of the impact of these actions on the biophysical
    system. A decision model is an algorithm which executes a collection of rules
    (action, priority, preference, etc.), during a simulation period. Its purpose
    is to re-create for a given soil/weather context the sequence of management actions
    for the crop. So far, most biodecisional models have been developed for a specific
    crop (e.g. cotton – HydroLogic, Richards et al., 2008, wheat − DECIBLE, Chatelin
    et al. (2005), or maize − MODERATO, Bergez et al., 2001) or with a limited description
    of the decision system (e.g. APSIM, Keating et al., 2003). The aim of this paper
    is to present the non crop-specific biodecisional model MOUSTICS, and to show
    its application to a specific problem. The first section presents MOUSTICS, i.e.:
    its rationale, its structure, and how it was built from two existing models. The
    second section presents an example of the use of the model on multiple fields
    with different crops and crop management. The final section discusses the value
    and expected uses of this model. 2. Description of MOUSTICS 2.1. Model rationale
    In order to test, simulate and evaluate various crops, crop rotations or even
    crop management systems at a plot or larger scale, one may need to run different
    crop models. To simplify such work, it may be useful to have a single generic
    model that can simulate different crops and crop management systems. This was
    the objective of creating MOUSTICS. 2.2. Presentation of the two pre-existing
    models MOUSTICS, standing for MODERATO (Bergez et al., 2001) combined with (Union)
    STICS (Brisson et al., 1998), is a generic biodecisional model. It was developed
    by joining two existing models: the generic crop model STICS and the crop management
    decision model MODERATO. MOUSTICS is a dynamic model, running on a daily time
    step and operating at the plot level. Variables from the biophysical part may
    serve as indicators to the decision part. Daily transfer of information from one
    part to the other is required to simulate plant–soil-management behaviour. 2.2.1.
    STICS STICS (version 5) is a crop model developed by researchers from the French
    national research institute for agronomy (INRA) to synthesize knowledge from physiology,
    ecophysiology and agronomy at the field level (Brisson et al., 1998, Brisson et
    al., 2003, Brisson et al., 2009). It can be compared to other crop models such
    as EPIC (Kiniry et al., 1992), CROPSYST (Stockle, 1997), CERES (Ritchie, 1998)
    or AQUACROP (Steduto et al., 2009), the FAO-endorsed crop model. It simulates
    crop growth and soil water and nitrogen balances driven by daily weather data.
    Output variables allow both agricultural (yield, input consumption) and environmental
    (water and nitrogen losses) indicators to be calculated. An important feature
    is that it has been designed to be used with several types of crops. This was
    made possible by using generic parameters relevant for most crops and by introducing
    options to account for crop-specific features. STICS simulates the behaviour of
    the soil/crop system either over one crop cycle, or over several crop cycles to
    simulate rotations. The upper boundary of the system is the atmosphere characterised
    by standard weather variables (radiation, minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall,
    potential evapotranspiration and possibly wind speed and relative humidity) and
    the lower boundary corresponds to the soil/subsoil interface. Crops are generally
    perceived in terms of their above-ground biomass and nitrogen content, leaf area
    index, and the number and biomass (and nitrogen content) of harvested organs.
    Vegetative organs (leaves, branches or tillers) are not separated in terms of
    their biomass. Soil is described as a sequence of horizontal layers, each of which
    is characterised in terms of its water content, mineral nitrogen content and organic
    nitrogen content. Soil and crop interact via the roots, and these roots are defined
    with respect to root density distribution in the soil profile. The STICS model
    is organised into modules (Fig. 1), with each module composed of sub-modules dealing
    with specific mechanisms. STICS has been used in different situations showing
    its robustness and its generality regarding crop formalisms, e.g. maize (Bruckler
    et al., 2000), wheat (Chauki et al., 2003), soybean (Jégo et al., 2010), linseed
    (Flenet et al., 2004), banana (Brisson et al., 1997), pasture (Di Bella et al.,
    2004), sunflower and rape (Lebonvallet et al., 2003). STICS is written in Fortran
    77. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The various modules of the STICS
    model (from Brisson et al. (2009)). As in most crop models, agricultural operations
    considered in STICS include soil preparation (ploughing), choice of crop species
    and variety, the sowing date, sowing density, nitrogen fertilisation dates and
    amounts, irrigation dates and amounts, and harvest. These management actions are
    described in an input file usually referred to as “management options”, including
    dates and quantities (Swaney et al., 1983, Hearn, 1994, Ghaffari et al., 2001).
    Management in STICS is not based on decisions rules. Using decision rules would
    allow considering, among other effects, the adaptation of operation dates to weather
    variability. For example, in STICS the sowing date or a date for N application
    is fixed to a specific calendar day and simulated all over the range of meteorological
    data. This is not appropriate according to farmers’ behaviour (if it rains, farmers
    will generally delay sowing), and can lead to simulation errors (N leaching if
    applied during a rainy period). STICS has proven its robustness, sensitivity and
    precision, but the management submodel requires improvements in order to adequately
    simulate farmers’ behaviour. 2.2.2. MODERATO MODERATO is a management-oriented
    model initially aimed at developing irrigation strategies for irrigated maize
    crops (Bergez et al., 2001, Bergez et al., 2002, Bergez et al., 2006). It is based
    on decision rules, as proposed by Aubry et al. (1998). Sowing, fertilisation,
    irrigation and harvest decisions are accounted for, with a specific focus on irrigation.
    The decision-making process is based on: Using a decision model allows to integrate
    flexibility in the management due to some knowledge of the biophysical system.
    Management will not be reproduced identically every year, as the state of the
    biophysical system will be different. Regarding irrigation, MODERATO includes
    in the irrigation decision-making process the main constraints for irrigation
    (flow, volume and working days) and simulates the plant–soil system with a dynamic
    biophysical model (Wallach et al., 2001). A simple example of a rule that can
    be simulated with MODERATO is: “If, 15 days after sowing or 70 °C day after sowing,
    the cumulative rainfall has been less than 20 mm, then 20 mm of irrigation is
    applied. The irrigation round will stop if the cumulative rainfall since the beginning
    of the round is more than 10 mm. The applied amount of irrigation has to be subtracted
    from the total amount of water available for irrigation.” So far, MODERATO includes
    decision rules to manage sowing, irrigation, fertilisation and harvest. Indicators
    from the biophysical systems are either simple (e.g. number of days without rainfall,
    number of days since sowing) or more complex (e.g. cumulative thermal units, fraction
    of soil water deficit, leaf area index). Boolean algorithms to compose the decision
    rules, windows of action and resources constraints are taken into account in the
    different agricultural operations (Therond et al., 2010). The decision model is
    daily fed by indicators from the biophysical model, e.g. cumulative thermal units,
    fraction of soil water available (Fig. 2). On a daily basis, the decision model
    is first called. Depending on the rules, on the weather and on the state of the
    biophysical system, decisions are taken. These decisions are then sent to the
    biophysical model in a second step. The different parts of MODERATO are written
    in a modular programming language so as to enable the creation of re-usable code
    (Acock and Reddy, 1997). The main core of the model, i.e. the Timer-Dispatcher
    (that allows Multi-simulation and daily dynamic of the model), the biophysical
    model and the decision model are written in an object-oriented programming language,
    C++ (Stroustrup, 1993). These three parts are written as three independent modules
    allowing easy modification or even a complete change of the biophysical or the
    decision models if required, e.g. if we are interested in wheat fertilisation
    rather than maize irrigation. All the variables from the biophysical model and
    all the actions from the decision model are kept in memory for output purposes
    using a specific Recorder object. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.
    The general structure of the MODERATO model (from Bergez et al. (2001)). 2.3.
    The linkage process STICS is a generic crop model. It is largely used in the French
    community working on cropping systems. As previously discussed, STICS does not
    integrate decision rules. As a consequence, it is not very useful to analyse farmers’
    behaviour in response to long term phenomena such as climate change. Integrating
    crop management via decision rules may therefore widen its use. On the other hand,
    MODERATO provides a simple and generic decision model. Its built-in crop model
    is poor and maize-specific. These circumstances reduce its applicability. The
    purpose was then to replace the existing maize-specific biophysical model (2CV,
    Wallach et al., 2001) in MODERATO by the generic crop model STICS. Other choices,
    such as “extending” the capacity of Moderato to take into account other crops
    than maize could have been made. However this choice would have required a tremendous
    new programming effort and would not have valorised the existing crop model. 2.3.1.
    A specific F77 translator The object-oriented programming framework in which MODERATO
    was created allowed such a modification as soon as the biophysical model could
    be run independently on a daily time step. The daily routine of STICS is included
    in different loops of initialisation, outputs and other programming items. Therefore,
    the first task consisted in translating the Fortran 77 code into C code and extracting
    the daily loop process. To perform this task, a specific translator, CStics (Poupa
    and Ripoche, 2004), was built in order to translate the source code of STICS into
    C functions using the COMMON and fortran subroutines. The general architecture
    of the Fortran 77 model was kept unchanged, i.e. a first routine dealing with
    the initialization of the process and a sequence of routines calling the different
    modules of the plant–soil model to represent the daily crop behaviour. All STICS
    parameters and variables were declared as vectors that are passed as arguments
    to the C functions that are located within specific libraries. MODERATO queries
    the specific libraries to get crop parameters and initialization values before
    starting the simulation. The link between the decision model and the biophysical
    one is managed through the daily loop. This exchange is performed thanks to the
    Recorder object as previously explained. A specific function updates the values
    of the Recorder object. 2.3.2. Performing the linkage Two important points had
    to be kept in mind while linking the two codes. The first was to check if output
    variables of the new biophysical model were suitable to represent indicators for
    the decision model. The second was to modify the MODERATO code in order to integrate
    the STICS dynamic link library. The integration of the biophysical model code
    Stics was facilitated by the object-oriented implementation of the MODERATO model.
    The class containing the biophysical model code was virtualized and two derived
    classes containing the STICS and 2CV codes, respectively, were defined. This implementation
    based on dynamic polymorphism and cloning benefits from the strengths of inheritance:
    the ease of code reuse can enhance the development and maintenance of the model
    code. The linked codes run on a daily time step. The Recorder keeps track of all
    decision and biophysical data. All processes concerning soil and plant are simulated
    by STICS while the decision and the weather are managed by the decision part of
    the model. 2.3.3. Testing the linkage We tested MOUSTICS by running independently
    STICS and MOUSTICS on some soil/climate/management situations where management
    was described by fixed dates and quantities. We then analysed the output of both
    models to identify discrepancies resulting from the linkage. MOUSTICS was first
    tested on irrigated maize using irrigation schedules. Then MOUSTICS was tested
    for soybean, sunflower and sorghum using datasets from the original STICS software
    release. Finally model outputs were compared to already published strategy evaluations
    (Bergez et al., 2002). The connections made available within Moustics all the
    analytical companion tools developed for both pre-existing models, e.g. graphical
    representation of the irrigation schedule, optimisation processes, statistical
    analysis of soil and weather series, etc. 3. An application case study We report
    here a case of application of MOUSTICS illustrating its ability to provide useful
    field-scale indicators in a region where multiple crops are cultivated, possibly
    with different management rules. In a catchment area of 8000 km2 located in south-western
    France, MOUSTICS was used in a scenario study aiming at evaluating the impact
    of changes in the spatial distribution of cropping systems. The dominating issue
    in this study area was quantitative water management with debates about the possibility
    of building a dam to create an additional water resource as opposed to changing
    local agriculture to decrease irrigation and thus the pressure on water supplies
    (Mandement, 2004). The objective of using MOUSTICS was to provide impact indicators
    oriented to various stakeholders (water managers, farmers or their representatives,
    environmentalists, etc.). The study area is equidistant from the Atlantic Ocean
    and the Mediterranean Sea. The area contains three main soil groups: hydromorphic
    loamy soils in large valleys to the south; calcareous clay soils mainly in the
    northern, hillier part; and high-yielding old alluvial soils in the Garonne valley.
    The main annual crops are winter durum and soft wheat, winter rape, winter pea,
    maize, sunflower, and soybean. Almost 525,000 ha are cultivated. More than 80,000
    ha of arable land are currently irrigated by about 4000 farmers, among which 1740
    irrigate more than 20% of their arable land (Agreste, 2002). Farms are mainly
    either specialised in field crops (∼5000) or in mixed crops livestock (∼2400)
    and cover a large range of economical sizes (∼4250 from 8 to 40 ESU, ∼2670 from
    40 to 100 and ∼480 over 100 ESU). Irrigated maize represents 60,000 ha. Average
    water amount for irrigating maize is around 240 mm. Depending on the summer rainfall,
    sunflower may need one to three irrigation cycles of 30 mm. Most common irrigation
    equipment is gun-reel irrigation machine. In this application case, we ran MOUSTICS
    on multiple simulation units corresponding to homogeneous zones regarding its
    input data (mainly soil, weather, crop and technical operations). For each simulation
    unit, input data were inferred from soil maps, weather records and the agricultural
    census. We combined classical geographical information, local technical expertise
    and statistical Bayesian methods. The determination of the simulation units is
    fully documented by Clavel et al. (2011). The decision rules for the management
    of the various crops were parameterised on the basis of various sources: scientific
    literature, technical reports and experts of research and technical institutes
    or extension services (see Clavel et al., submitted for publication). MOUSTICS
    was run for several scenarios corresponding to different spatial distributions
    of cropping systems on the study area. The reference scenario (scenario 0) corresponds
    to a representation of the study area using available data (cropping distribution
    of year 2000). In Scenario 1, we replaced all irrigated maize grown by sunflower
    crops, irrigated only once, if needed, at the flowering stage, on steep slopes,
    because irrigation is not easy to practice there. In Scenario 2, the same substitution
    was operated but in farms of small economic size because we hypothesised that
    such farms less invested in irrigation equipment. Other scenarios, more realistic
    but also more complex were performed, but we do not report them here for the sake
    of clarity. We ran these two scenarios, as well as scenario 0, with weather data
    of different years. Table 1 summarises the characteristics of the two scenarios
    for 2000 and presents the outputs of MOUSTICS aggregated for the whole study area.
    The results of this scenario study can also be visualised spatially (Fig. 3A)
    or over time (Fig. 3B). Depending on the scenario, the overall saving of irrigation
    water, the dynamics of the irrigation water usage and the distribution over the
    study area are different. Table 1. Description and evaluation of scenarios 1 and

    and conclusion In order to account for contextual changes, it is important to
    integrate in a single tool the biophysical functioning and the decision process
    of farmers. MOUSTICS is such a coupled model. Due the modular structure of the
    MODERATO model, it was quite easy to integrate a new crop model, namely STICS.
    Due to the crop generic aspect of STICS, this improvement allows management strategies
    to be tested on different crops. The first tests, as shown in the application
    case, are very encouraging. The coupling of these two models could be useful not
    only for application cases regarding water management as presented in this paper.
    Other agricultural resources or decisions (e.g. sowing dates, fertilisation) could
    be analysed with this types of models coupling. Furthermore, as the modelling
    shell stays identical, one can use the analytical companion tools to analyse simulation
    results However, despite the successful technical linkage, some drawbacks remain.
    The first is MOUSTICS’s running speed. In a specific study (Bergez et al., unpublished),
    we compared the speed of MOUSTICS, STICS and MODERATO on similar maize-based cropping
    systems. The running times (5, 2 and 0.1 s, respectively) show that MOUSTICS could
    not be used to run millions of simulations in a reasonable time as has been done
    with MODERATO to optimise management strategies (Bergez et al., 2004, Crespo et
    al., 2009). To overcome this drawback, solutions should be found through the reduction
    of the buffer transfer size, parallel simulations or better optimisation algorithms.
    The second drawback is that STICS is an evolving model. In MOUSTICS, we incorporated
    the STICS version 5.0. STICS 6.9 (integration of new formalisms for perennial
    crops) is now available and STICS 7 (rewritten in different independent modules
    using an object-oriented language) is being developed. Even if these new models
    do not greatly change the soil-crop behaviour, it is desirable to keep up to date
    with the base model. The CStics translator may be used to perform the first step
    of updating MOUSTICS, but there is still some manual work needed to properly couple
    the updated dynamic linked libraries. In order to get over this problem, one possibility
    is to use some specific modelling framework, e.g. CAPSIS (de Coligny et al., 2003),
    ModCom (Hillyer et al., 2003), Diese (Martin-Clouaire and Rellier, 2009), Ptolemy
    II (Goderis et al., 2007) or RECORD (Bergez et al., 2009). The French platform
    RECORD has been used as it is specifically aimed at developing and simulating
    cropping systems. Researchers can assemble their own pieces of model and couple
    them to pre-existing ones, and then run the resulting models. It is based on the
    Virtual Laboratory Environment environment (Quesnel et al., 2009) and can be used
    to model, simulate, analysis or visualise dynamics of complex systems. VLE is
    based on the DEVS discrete event formalism of the Modelling and Simulation theory
    (Zeigler et al., 2000). These models can be either deterministic or stochastic,
    and described within different modelling formalisms like difference equations,
    differential equations, partial differential equations, cellular automata for
    biophysical models, discrete event models or agent-based models for decision models.
    MODERATO and STICS7, written in F90, are presently integrated in the RECORD platform
    and ready to be linked (Chabrier et al., 2010). Using models is far from being
    enough to develop innovative cropping systems. As mentioned by several authors
    (see for example Voinov and Bousquet, 2010), it is important to integrate end-users,
    i.e. farmers in the design process. MOUSTICS can be used to propose initial systems
    that can be in a second stage debated, modified and re-evaluated by agricultural
    advisors and farmers. Such use of the model allows also to integrate the larger
    complexity farmers have to deal with as they have to manage a whole farm rather
    than only individual plots. Despite these drawbacks, MOUSTICS has been used in
    different simulation studies as shown previously. In the near future it is intended
    to use it via the RECORD platform: (i) to simulate, analyse and optimise cropping
    plan decisions (Dury et al., 2010) and (ii) to optimise irrigation management
    strategy under different constraints and develop operational advice for irrigators.

    quality, not only in traditionally prone arid and semi-\narid zones, but also\
    \ in regions where rainfall is abun-\ndant. Agriculture represents the major user\
    \ world-\nwide, and a general perception that agricultural use is\noften wasteful\
    \ and has less value than other uses is\nwidespread [39]. Furthermore, energy\
    \ analysis of\nagricultural operations has shown that irrigation con-\nsumes a\
    \ significant amount of energy as compared to\nother operations [49]. For these\
    \ reasons, there is an\nurgent need to use water resources efficiently by en-\n\
    hancing crop water productivity.\nDeficit irrigation (DI), the application of\
    \ irrigation\nrates below the full crop evapotranspiration (ET), is\npotentially\
    \ able to improve efficiency and maximize\nprofits through a reduction in capital\
    \ and operating\ncosts. Although the DI concept dates back to the\n1970s [11,\
    \ 13, 25], and the theoretical basis and ana-\nlytical frameworks for DI are well\
    \ established [12,\n13], this technique is not usually adopted as a practi-\n\
    cal alternative to full irrigation by either academics or\npractitioners. An obstacle\
    \ is related to the need for\nprecision irrigation required by DI strategies,\
    \ the use\nof highly efficient irrigation systems, and prediction\nof the cost\
    \ function and crop price. Considering that\nthis knowledge spans a wide range\
    \ of disciplines,\nfrom eco-physiology and plant sciences to hydrology,\nengineering\
    \ and economics, the approach to DI may\noften be hard. Another reason for the\
    \ slow progress of\nDI is the risk associated with the uncertainty of the\nknowledge\
    \ required [12]. Uncertainty is associated\nwith optimal water use estimation,\
    \ e.g. lack of accura-\ncy in crop ET data; no a priori information about the\n\
    production function or data available only for specific\nlocations or seasons\
    \ or very few years. Generally, a\npriori crop production function data is missing\
    \ due to\na number of unpredictable factors such as climate\nchange, irrigation\
    \ system failure, germination rates, or\ndisease impact. \nFurthermore, the amount\
    \ of irrigation water for\ncertain crop yields depends on the irrigation schedul-\n\
    ing strategy. Published results of experimental re-\nsearch into crop response\
    \ to water and progress in hy-\ndrological and crop growth/yield models could\
    \ con-\ntribute towards the application of DI strategies. The\nuncertainty discussed\
    \ above implies risk. English et\nal. [12] suggest that simulation models could\
    \ be used\nnot only to predict optimal levels of irrigation water\nbut also to\
    \ quantify prediction uncertainties. \nFinally, in the literature there is a certain\
    \ amount of\nconfusion regarding the DI concept and, as described\nin the following\
    \ section, the term DI is used indiffer-\nently for different water management\
    \ strategies.\nThe aim of this paper is to synthesize the basic\nconcepts and\
    \ the main techniques of DI and to present\nthe main research results. The paper\
    \ includes, as an\nexample, a short description of a recent experimental\nresearch\
    \ project conducted by the authors, which inte-\ngrates agronomic, engineering\
    \ and economic aspects\nof DI at farm level.\n2. Concepts and techniques of deficit\
    \ irrigation\nThe concept of deficit irrigation was introduced as\nan economic\
    \ concept in the 1970s [25] and the first re-\nsearch appeared in the early ’80s\
    \ [11, 20]. English [12,\n13, 14] defines DI as the deliberate and systematic\
    \ un-\nder-irrigation of crops to achieve, under some circum-\nstances, the maximum\
    \ attainable income for an irrigat-\ned field. Lecler [28] made the definition\
    \ of English\nmore explicit: DI is an optimization strategy whereby\nnet returns\
    \ are maximized by reducing the amount of\nirrigation water applied to a crop\
    \ to a level that results\nin some yield reduction caused by water stress. Other\n\
    authors deal with DI as an irrigation strategy to maxi-\nmize yield with a minimum\
    \ rate of water application\nand only deal with the physiological and agronomical\n\

    \ response to different irrigation\nregimes) without any economic evaluation.\
    \ \nIn the latter case, it is more appropriate to use the\nterm Regulated Deficit\
    \ Irrigation (RDI or CDI - Con-\ntrolled Deficit Irrigation as introduced by [13])\
    \ for ir-\nrigation strategies based only on a reduction of irriga-\ntion amounts\
    \ during certain plant cycle phases [7].\nResearch into RDI could also concern\
    \ the crop coeffi-\ncient (Kc) in different phenological phases. This kind\nof\
    \ study is a fundamental step (but not the only one)\nto implement DI strategies.\
    \ In fact, the analyst must\nrely on a crop production function that links water\
    \ use\nto crop yield in order to plan, design or manage irriga-\ntion systems\
    \ under DI. Another strategy, initially used\nfor grapevines [9], is Partial Root\
    \ Drying (PRD), an\nirrigation technique by which half of the root zone is\nkept\
    \ under dry soil, alternating irrigation from one\nhalf to the other. \nA review\
    \ of about 100 papers recently published in\nmajor international journals (most\
    \ of which are cited in\nthe References) has shown that only a few [12, 23, 24,\n\
    32, 38, 43, 44] use the English definition in its com-\nplete sense (e.g. by analysing\
    \ the economics of DI).\n2.1 Economics of deficit irrigation\nRecognition of the\
    \ following key factors is ex-\ntremely important to understand the potential\
    \ benefits\nof DI [12, 13, 28]: the efficiency of irrigation water\ndecreases\
    \ as the application depth increases; irrigation\nwater application is expensive;\
    \ the water saved by re-\nducing irrigation depth may allow to extend the\namount\
    \ of irrigated land (opportunity cost of water);\nthe determination of an optimal\
    \ irrigation strategy de-\npends on whether a land or water shortage is the limit-\n\
    ing production factor.\nDI increases water use efficiency for several reasons\n\
    [22, 44]. Firstly, an increase in application efficiency\noccurs when the amount\
    \ of water applied is lower than\nfull ET, because (most or all of) the applied\
    \ water re-\nmains in the root zone (e.g. water losses due to run-off\nand deep\
    \ percolation are reduced). The consumption\nefficiency (i.e. the ratio between\
    \ the amount of evapo-\ntranspired water and the amount of water in the root\n\
    zone) may increase because crops are forced to extract\nhigher water levels from\
    \ the soil. Furthermore, the\nyield efficiency (i.e. the proportion of biomass\
    \ in the\nharvested product) may be enhanced due to an exces-\nsive vegetative\
    \ growth of some crop species (cotton\nand grapevines, for example) under full\
    \ irrigation.\nThe relationship between irrigation water (w) and\ncrop yield (y)\
    \ may be generally expressed by a quad-\nratic form equation (Figure 1),\n(1)\n\
    The estimated revenue from irrigation (R), ob-\ntained by multiplying the production\
    \ function by a\nconstant (crop price, Pc), has the same form as the\nproduction\
    \ function (curved line in Figure 2),\n(2)\nThe straight line in Figure 2 represents\
    \ a possible\nfunction relating total production costs (c) to applied\nwater:\n\
    (3)\nWhen different water depths modify both yield and\ncrop cycle length, the\
    \ cost function may be nonlinear\n[4, 6].\nThe vertical axis intercept, a2, is\
    \ associated with\nfixed costs: capital costs, taxes, insurance, fixed costs\n\
    of tillage, planting, chemical use and harvesting. The\nslope represents the marginal\
    \ variable costs of pro-\nduction that include variable costs of irrigation (water\n\
    costs, pumping costs, labour and maintenance) and\nother costs based on yield\
    \ variation with water use\n(costs associated with fertilizers, when farmers adjust\n\
    them for the expected crop production, harvest costs,\netc...). English et al.\
    \ [12] recommend to analyse both\nthe direct costs of irrigation and the other\
    \ production\ncosts. Incomplete cost analysis may lead to underesti-\nmation of\
    \ the optimal deficit magnitude and the relat-\ned potential gain in net income.\
    \ The upper limit repre-\nsents the maximum water delivering capacity of the\n\
    system. When saved water, obtained by reducing wa-\nter depths, can be used to\
    \ irrigate additional land,\nfarmers can increase their income. This potential\
    \ in-\ncrease represents the opportunity cost of the water.\nFor example, 50 mm\
    \ of water could be applied to 1\nha, or 25 mm could be applied to 2 ha, thus\
    \ producing\nan increase in total profit.\n28\nFig.\n1 - General form of crop\
    \ production function.\nFig.\n2 - Cost and gross revenue functions versus applied\
    \ water.\n004_Consoli(529)_27  18-02-2009  15:52  Pagina 28\nIf land is limited,\
    \ the main concern is what irriga-\ntion depth produces the maximum difference\
    \ between\ncosts and yield return. Since the optimal level of irri-\ngation (when\
    \ land or water are limited) requires less\nwater than the level maximizing yield,\
    \ the system\nmay have a lower capacity and lower capital costs. As\nshown in\
    \ Figure 3, a lower cost function corresponds\nto a higher difference between\
    \ costs and yield return\n(net return). Obviously, a lower system capacity rep-\n\
    resents a limitation in certain situations, for example\nwhen several crops are\
    \ irrigated in rotation and deficit\nirrigation strategies can only be applied\
    \ to some of\nthem. \nThe optimum water depth level will be the one that\nallows\
    \ maximum profit per water unit or per land\nunit, depending on whether water\
    \ or land is the limit-\ning factor.\nEnglish [13] identified the following five\
    \ optimum\nlevels of applied water, which provide maximum food\nproduction or\
    \ profit with a limited availability of re-\nsources (e.g., land or water): \n\
    a) level at which crop yield per unit of land is maxi-\nmized, Wm\nb) level at\
    \ which net income per unit of land is maxi-\nmized, Wl\nc) level at which net\
    \ income per unit of water is max-\nimized, Ww\nd) level at which net income equals\
    \ that at full irriga-\ntion when land is limited, Wel\ne) level at which net\
    \ income equals that at full irriga-\ntion when water is limited, Wew\nAt the\
    \ Wm level (see figure 2), the application of\nadditional water does not increase\
    \ yield, thus the mar-\nginal water use efficiency is zero. Marginal water use\n\
    efficiency increases as water depth decreases. \nProfit per unit of land reaches\
    \ its maximum when\nthe level of applied water is Wl; at this point the cost\n\
    line slope equals that of the revenue line and the net\nincome per unit of water\
    \ (difference between revenue\nand cost) is maximum. Within the range between\
    \ Wl\nand Wm growers may benefit from cost reductions. If\nadditional land can\
    \ be irrigated, the optimal water use\nstrategy to maximize profit could be to\
    \ irrigate below\nWl, indicated as the Wel level. At optimal levels Wel.\n(land-limiting\
    \ case) and Wew (water-limiting case) the\nvertical difference between the revenue\
    \ and cost lines\nequals that at level Wm. Within the range between Wel,\nfor\
    \ the land-limiting case, or Wew, for the water-limit-\ning case, and Wm (named\
    \ range of profitable deficits)\nthe net income associated with the level of deficit\
    \ is at\nleast as great as it is at full irrigation. \nEnglish [13] derived general\
    \ expressions to esti-\nmate the above-mentioned optimal application levels.\n\
    Assuming that the production function has a quadratic\npolynomial form (see eq.\
    \ 1) and the cost function has\na linear form (see eq. 3), the author proposed\
    \ the fol-\nlowing explicit expressions (eq. 4 to eq. 10) for Wm,\nWl, Ww, Wel\
    \ and Wew. \n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\nwith\n(8)\n(9)\nwith\n(10)\nFurthermore, equations\
    \ (12) to (17) can be used\nwhen both the production (see eq. 1) and cost (eq.\
    \ 11)\nfunctions have a quadratic form [4].\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n(14)\nwith\n(15)\n\

    \  18-02-2009  15:52  Pagina 29\nThe range of profitable deficits (e.g. the range\
    \ be-\ntween Wm, the yield maximizing level, and Wel or Wew,\nthe levels of DI\
    \ where net income will at least equal\nthat at full irrigation) is a qualitative\
    \ indication of po-\ntential risk. The narrower the range of profitable\ndeficits,\
    \ the higher the risk of error and reductions in\nincome. In the scientific works\
    \ on DI [among others:\n12, 13, 23, 30, 39, 41, 42, 44] the authors analysed the\n\
    potential benefits of DI and the range of profitable\ndeficits in different contexts:\
    \ wheat in North-Western\nUSA, cotton in California, maize in Zimbabwe, winter\n\
    broccoli, carrot, rape and cabbage in Botswana, barley\nand sorghum in Iran, almond\
    \ orchards in South-Eastern\nSpain. The main results (see Table 1) showed optimal\n\
    net return with a deficit of 15-59%.\n2.2 Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) and\
    \ Partial root\ndrying (PRD)\nRegulated Deficit Irrigation (RDI) uses water stress\n\
    to control vegetative and reproductive growth and it\ngenerally imposes water\
    \ deficits during crop growing\nphases that are not yield reducing [2, 7, 17,\
    \ 18, 27].\nPrecision irrigation strategies, e.g. microirrigation, are\nparamount\
    \ for a successful application of RDI, as well\nas timing control and soil water\
    \ level monitoring. This\npractice has been adopted successfully for tree crops\n\
    and mainly for grape [19, 33], peach [7], pear [36] and\nalmond [42] production.\
    \ Among herbaceous crops, RDI\nhas been applied to cotton [47], garlic [16] sugar\
    \ beet\n[15, 35] and tomatoes [21]. The reviewed literature (see\nTable 1) evidenced\
    \ some relevant factors (both positive\nand negative) affecting the choice of\
    \ RDI: it admits\nfurrow irrigation; it controls vegetative growth; fruit\nsize\
    \ and quality can be achieved; positive effects main-\nly on grape and wine quality\
    \ were achieved; it causes\npotential yield losses; it permits water savings;\
    \ soil wa-\nter monitoring is recommended.\nIn Partial Root Drying (PRD), a percentage\
    \ of crop\nevapotranspiration is applied to alternate plant sides,\nallowing part\
    \ of the root system to be in contact with\nwet soil. In the literature (see Table\
    \ 1) PRD allows an\nincrease in water use efficiency and a decrease in veg-\n\
    etative vigour without significant reductions in crop\nyield [9, 10, 29, 30, 34].\
    \ The beneficial effects of\nPRD are hypothesised to be due to a reduction in\n\
    stomatal conductance and growth by chemical sig-\nnals, possibly abscissic acid\
    \ (ABA) synthesized by\nroots and transported to the leaves in the transpiration\n\
    stream [31].\nThe main factors that may affect the choice of PRD\nare the following:\
    \ drip irrigation is preferred; alternate\nrow furrow irrigation is possible;\
    \ no effects on fruit\nsize; vegetative growth can be controlled; positive ef-\n\
    fects on crop quality; significant water savings; sig-\nnificant cost increase\
    \ due to doubling laterals in cases\nwhere it is not necessary for technical reasons;\
    \ soil\nwater monitoring is recommended.\n3. Application of an integrated agro-economic\
    \ ap-\nproach to DI on lettuce crops in Sicily (Italy)\n3.1 Methodology\nIn the\
    \ experiment, the effect of four different irri-\ngation levels on the marketable\
    \ yield and economic\nreturn of summer-growth lettuce was evaluated [5, 6].\n\
    The field trial was carried out in a randomized design\nexperiment using Lactuca\
    \ sativa L. (Batavia rossa va-\nriety Emini) during two consecutive summer crop\n\
    production cycles (2005 and 2006). The experimental\nsite is located in Biancavilla,\
    \ a small village in East-\nern Sicily (latitude 34°93’ N, longitude 15°80’ W\
    \ and\naltitude 500 m above sea level). The lettuce crop was\nplanted at a spacing\
    \ of 0.25 m x 0.25 m in an area of\nabout 400 m2; each experiment consisted of\
    \ four irri-\ngation levels (125%, 100%, 75% and 50% of actual\nevapotranspiration,\
    \ ETa) with four replications. The\ncrop was irrigated by a surface drip irrigation\
    \ system\nwith polyethylene pipes 16 mm in diameter with in-\n30\nTABLE\n1 - Review\

    \ carried out in order to reveal any reduction\nin soil water content. A spatial\
    \ description of plant\ngrowth was determined by in situ measurements of\nleaf\
    \ area index (LAI) using a LICOR ® LAI-2000\nportable canopy digital analyzer.\n\
    Economic factors concerning gross return (eq. 2)\nand total costs (eq. 3) were\
    \ assessed to test the viabili-\nty of deficit irrigation criteria. Net return\
    \ was calcu-\nlated by subtracting total cost from gross revenue.\nThe five levels\
    \ of optimal applied water described in\nSection 2.1 (Wm, Wl, Ww, Wel Wew) were\
    \ evaluated\n(see  eq. 4 to eq. 10 for linear cost function and eq. 12\nto eq.\
    \ 17 for quadratic cost function).\n3.2 Results and discussion\nThe total irrigation\
    \ water applied to the field was:\n76, 113, 146, 175 mm (in 2005) and 68, 96,\
    \ 120, 150\nmm (in 2006) for the 50%, 75%, 100% and 125%\ntreatments respectively.\
    \ \nLettuce crop water needs were underestimated using\nthe ETa-based approach.\
    \ In fact, the maximum yield\nvalues were for the 125% ETa treatment (correspon-\n\
    ding to almost 100% ET0-PM). The ratio between the to-\ntal water received by\
    \ the crop (IW 125%) and ET0-PM\nwas almost equal to 1 (as specified in FAO publica-\n\
    tions). Leaf area index (LAI) values and soil water con-\ntents at selected field\
    \ locations confirmed some water\nstress during the middle-end crop growth phases\
    \ [6].\nThe average lettuce weight MW (equal to about\n0.55 kg in 2005 and 0.53\
    \ kg in 2006) was influenced\nby the different rates of applied irrigation water\n\
    (Table 2). The maximum marketable yields were\nabout 55 t ha-1 in 2005 and 51\
    \ t ha-1 in 2006; these\nvalues, corresponding to about 180 mm, were record-\n\
    ed in the 125% treatment plots (100% ET0-PM). Com-\npared to the maximum, the\
    \ marketable yield de-\ncreased by about 6, 12 and 24% in 2005 and 7, 14 and\n\
    30% in 2006, for the 100%, 75% and 50% treatments\nrespectively. Mean plant weight\
    \ decreased by about 5,\n8 and 18% in 2005, and 7, 14 and 32% in 2006. Non-\n\
    marketable yield increased with an increase in water\ndeficit levels, but the\
    \ differences between the treat-\nments were not significant. \nThe regression\
    \ coefficient values (R2) show strong\npolynomial relationships between marketable\
    \ yield\n(TMY, t ha-1) and total water received (TW, mm,\nwhich includes rainfall)\
    \ for both 2005 (eq. 22) and\n2006 (eq. 23):\n(22)\n(22)\nFollowing the curves\
    \ of eqs. (22) and (23), maxi-\nmum lettuce yield would have been obtained up\
    \ to ap-\nproximately 250 mm and 200 mm (Wm) during 2005\nand 2006 respectively,\
    \ with corresponding production\nvalues of about 57.9 and 54.0 t ha-1. These yield\
    \ val-\nues would have been obtained by increasing irrigation\nrates by about\
    \ 40% in 2005 and 12% in 2006 with re-\nspect to 100% ET0-PM replenishment. The\
    \ correspon-\nding increases in crop yield would have been less than\n5%. \nThe\
    \ best sustained cost (C, Euro ha-1) curve form\nresulted in quadratic and linear\
    \ curves in 2005 and\n2006 respectively:\n(24)\n(25)\nTable 3 lists the optimal\
    \ levels of applied water as\nproposed by English (1990) and English and Raja\n\
    (1996). In the land-limiting case, the estimated opti-\nmal economic levels were\
    \ quite similar to optimal\nagronomic levels. \nIn the water deficit case (if\
    \ land is abundant), the\noptimal irrigation strategy was that of under-irrigation\n\
    by 49% ET0-PM and 90% ET0-PM, thus obtaining water\nsavings of about 51% in 2005\
    \ and 10% in 2006.\nDeficit irrigation ranges, at least as profitable as full\n\
    irrigation, were 17-49% ET0-PM and 71-90% ET0-PM in\n2005 and 2006 respectively;\
    \ within the described\n31\n004_Consoli(529)_27  18-02-2009  15:52  Pagina 31\n\
    ranges the grower must define the most appropriate ir-\nrigation strategy for\
    \ optimal water use. The differ-\nences between 2005 and 2006 were mainly related\
    \ to\nthe lower production yields in 2006 due to the sub-op-\ntimal climatic conditions\
    \ (lower air temperature). Ob-\nviously, the economic results obtained from the\
    \ study\nfor the optimal water irrigation levels are related to\nthe market trend\
    \ in the study area.\n4. Conclusion\nDeficit irrigation is an optimization strategy\
    \ where-\nby net returns are maximized by reducing the amount\nof irrigation water\
    \ and crops are deliberately allowed to\nsustain some degree of water deficit\
    \ and yield reduc-\ntion. This technique is not usually adopted as a practi-\n\
    cal alternative to full irrigation by either academics or\npractitioners due to\
    \ several obstacles. In particular, it\ninvolves the use of precision irrigation;\
    \ the required\nknowledge spans over a wide range of disciplines; the\nstrategy\
    \ involves risks associated with the uncertainty\nof the required knowledge; it\
    \ is necessary to persuade\nfarmers and irrigation practitioners not only of the\
    \ eco-\nnomic value of DI but also of its practicability. \nFurthermore, there\
    \ is a certain amount of confusion\nregarding the DI concept. A review of about\
    \ 100 pa-\npers dealing with DI recently published in major in-\nternational journals\
    \ has shown that only a few papers\nuse the concept of DI in its complete sense\
    \ (e.g.\nanalysing both the agronomic and economic aspects\nof DI). A number of\
    \ papers only deal with the physio-\nlogical and agronomical aspects of DI (crop\
    \ response\nto different irrigation regimes) without any economic\nevaluation.\
    \ Other publications concern Regulated\nDeficit Irrigation (RDI, or Controlled\
    \ Deficit Irriga-\ntion, CDI), a strategy based only on a reduction of ir-\nrigation\
    \ during certain plant cycle phases, and Partial\nRoot Drying (PRD), a technique\
    \ in which a percent-\nage of crop ET is applied to alternating plant sides. \n\
    The review of the experimental research shows quite\npositive effects from DI\
    \ applications. The positive ef-\nfects are mostly evidenced when the economics\
    \ of DI\nis included in the research approach. The applications\npresent a wide\
    \ survey of the agronomic effects of DI.\nGenerally, total fresh mass and total\
    \ production are re-\nduced under DI, whereas the effects on dry matter and\n\
    product quality are positive, mainly in crops for which\nexcessive soil water\
    \ availability significantly influ-\nences the size, colour or composition of\
    \ fruit (grape,\ntomato, mango, etc.). The economic convenience of DI\ntherefore\
    \ also depends on the type of crop. \nThe description of recent trials conducted\
    \ by the\nauthors in Sicily (Italy), is an example of experimen-\ntal research\
    \ integrating the agronomic, engineering\nand economic aspects of DI at a farm\
    \ level.\n5. References\n[1]\nALLEN R.G., PEREIRA L.S., RAES D. AND SMITH M.,\n\

    SUMMARY\nDeficit irrigation (DI) is an optimization strategy\nwhereby net returns\
    \ are maximized by reducing the\namount of irrigation water; crops are deliberated\
    \ al-\nlowed to sustain some degree of water deficit and yield\nreduction. Although\
    \ the DI strategy dates back to the\n1970s, this technique is not usually adopted\
    \ as a practi-\ncal alternative to full irrigation by either academics or\npractitioners.\
    \ Furthermore, there is a certain amount of\nconfusion regarding its concept.\
    \ In fact, a review of re-\ncent literature dealing with DI has shown that only\
    \ a\nfew papers use the concept of DI in its complete sense\n(e.g. both the agronomic\
    \ and economic aspects). A\nnumber of papers only deal with the physiological\
    \ and\nagronomical aspects of DI or concern techniques such\nas Regulated Deficit\
    \ Irrigation (RDI) and Partial Root\nDrying (PRD). The paper includes two main\
    \ parts: i) a\nreview of the principal water management strategies\nunder deficit\
    \ conditions (e.g. conventional DI, RDI and\nPRD); and ii) a description of a\
    \ recent experimental re-\nsearch conducted by the authors in Sicily (Italy) that\
    \ in-\ntegrates agronomic, engineering and economic aspects\nof DI at farm level.\
    \ Most of the literature reviewed here\nshowed, in general, quite positive effects\
    \ from DI ap-\nplication, mostly evidenced when the economics of DI\nis included\
    \ in the research approach. With regard to the\nagronomic effects, total fresh\
    \ mass and total production\nis generally reduced under DI, whereas the effects\
    \ on\ndry matter and product quality are positive, mainly in\ncrops for which\
    \ excessive soil water availability can\ncause significant reductions in fruit\
    \ size, colour or\ncomposition (grapes, tomatoes, mangos, etc.). The ex-\nperimental\
    \ trial on a lettuce crop in Sicily, during 2005\nand 2006, shows that the highest\
    \ mean marketable\nyield of lettuce (55.3 t ha-1 in 2005 and 51.9 t ha-1 in\n\
    2006) was recorded in plots which received 100% of\nET0-PM (reference evapotranspiration\
    \ by the Penman-\nMonteith method) applied water. In the land-limiting\ncase,\
    \ the estimated optimal economic levels were quite\nsimilar to the optimal agronomic\
    \ levels. In the water-\nlimiting case DI ranges, at least as profitable as full\
    \ irri-\ngation, were of 17-49% ET0-PM and of 71-90% ET0-PM\nin 2005 and 2006\
    \ respectively.\nKey words:\nDeficit irrigation, Economics of deficit irrigation,\n\

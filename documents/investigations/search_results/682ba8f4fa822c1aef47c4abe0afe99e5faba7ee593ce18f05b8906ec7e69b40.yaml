    programming (ITFSP) method is advanced. • Uncertainties of probability distribution
    and fuzzy-boundary interval can be handled. • Different policy scenarios for crop
    and irrigation targets are examined. • Optimal water-allocation schemes can be
    obtained for agricultural sustainability. • Results can help to identify desired
    crop planning and water allocation in profitable ways. Abstract In this study,
    an interactive two-stage fuzzy stochastic programming (ITFSP) method is developed
    for supporting crop planning and water resource allocation under uncertainty.
    ITFSP can effectively address uncertainties expressed as probability distributions
    and fuzzy-boundary intervals. It can also be utilized for in-depth analyzing different
    policy scenarios that are integrated with various economic implications since
    penalties are executed with recourse actions. ITFSP enables decision makers to
    identify a tradeoff between higher objective values and feasibility of constraints.
    The ITFSP method is applied to a real case of Hetao irrigation district, one of
    the largest irrigation districts for food production in China. Different scenarios
    for crop planning targets which reflect the attitudes of local authority to the
    available water resources are examined. Results discover that different scenarios
    lead to changed irrigation patterns, water shortages, penalties, as well as system
    benefits. Results also reveal that decision makers would be more positive to water
    allocation to crops of wheat and oil than maize; oil crop always possesses the
    priority of water allocation and would be partly satisfied even under the low
    flow. Solutions are useful for determining optimized cropland use and water allocation
    patterns in such an agricultural system in the arid region, which could hedge
    appropriately against future available water levels in more profitable and sustainable
    ways. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Aricultural developmentInteractive

    Nowadays, rapid population and economy growth have led to increasing reliance
    on agricultural production. Development of water resource for agricultural irrigation
    plays a vital role in guaranteeing food security to provision human life and improves
    socio-economic development (Sharma and Minhas, 2005, Singh, 2014). However, more
    and more irrigation districts where demands outstrip agricultural water resource
    availabilities have suffered from serious shortages, especially for many arid
    and semi-arid regions where are main features of low rainfall, high evaporation
    and uneven temporal distribution (Tran et al., 2011, Garg and Dadhich, 2014).
    The balance between increasing consumption and decreasing acquisition of water
    resource to realize optimal water allocation has become a major challenge for
    many authorities. Therefore, sound system planning for agricultural water resource
    allocation is desired to reduce such conflicts, as well as to obtain certain goals
    such as economic merits, conserve water, reduce pollution, and food security under
    the limitation of cropland and water resource (Zhou et al., 2010, Kang and Park,
    2014). In fact, agricultural water resource system is related to various uncertainty
    variables such as soil moisture, rainfall, temperature, resource availability,
    irrigation quota, economic benefit, and market demand, which are not easily quantified
    and not fully controllable (Regulwar and Gurav, 2011, Zhang et al., 2011a). In
    addition, interactions among these uncertain parameters and additional economy
    implications can further complicate the agricultural water resource system. In
    response to the above complexities and uncertainties, a number of stochastic mathematical
    programming (SMP) methods were proposed for planning water resource systems (Sethi
    et al., 2006, Li et al., 2011, Housh et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2014, Akbari
    et al., 2014, Mun et al., 2015). For example, Marques et al. (2010) developed
    a two-stage stochastic quadratic programming to optimize farmer''s expected revenue
    and cropping decisions through conjunctive use of groundwater and artificial recharge,
    in which hydrology, annual crops, and irrigation technology decisions were treated
    as a random event. Huang et al. (2012) presented a two-stage interval quadratic
    programming for supporting agriculture water management in the Tarim River Basin,
    China, where the available irrigation water was presented as a random variable
    and the other parameters were expressed as interval values. Two-stage stochastic
    programming (TSP) is useful for tackling problems where an analysis of policy
    scenarios is desired and related data are random; however, TSP is incapable of
    addressing uncertainties exist as vagueness interval due to the quality of information
    can not satisfactory enough to specify distributions than to define fluctuation
    ranges (Li et al., 2006). Fuzzy mathematical programming (FMP) is effective for
    reflecting ambiguity and vagueness in resource availabilities as well as dealing
    with decision problems under fuzzy goal and constraints (Zimmermann, 1995, Li
    et al., 2009, Zhang et al., 2009b). Biswas and Pal (2005) presented a fuzzy goal
    programming method for planning agricultural land use problems, where total cultivable
    land, productive resource, production aspiration levels and total expected benefit
    were fuzzily described and cropping plan of several seasonal crops were optimized.
    Sahoo et al. (2006) developed a fuzzy multiobjective optimization model for planning
    an agricultural land-water-crop system to explore the related cropping patterns
    in an uncertain environment where existed imprecision in fuzzy objectives and
    fuzzy constraints. Zhang et al., 2009a proposed a hybrid fuzzy possibilistic robust
    programming approach to help generate decision schemes for agricultural activities
    by allowing fuzzy information to be directly communicated into the optimization
    processes and resulting solutions. In fact, in real-world irrigation water management
    problems, parameters or variables appear in modeling formulation (e.g., water
    availability, irrigation target and crop/yield production) may be estimated as
    intervals; at the same time, the lower and upper bounds of these intervals are
    also fuzzy in nature, which derives dual uncertainties expressed as fuzzy-boundary
    intervals (Liu et al., 2014). Moreover, decision makers often face conflicting
    desires of greater objective values and higher constraint feasibility. These complexities
    have placed many agricultural water management problems beyond the conventional
    FMP methods. An interactive fuzzy resolution (IFR) approach, based on fuzzy sets
    theory, is proposed for solving such problems (Jiménez et al., 2007, Wang and
    Huang, 2013). The advantages of IFR methods include: (1) handling fuzzy-boundary
    interval parameters; (2) allowing the decision makers to consider in an interactive
    style and express their preferences in linguistic terms; (3) tackle relationship
    between the fuzzy left- and right-hand sides of constraints and search the optimal
    values of the fuzzy objective function. Nevertheless, how to efficiently tackle
    both multi-uncertainty of data and interactions between objective and constraints
    has become a major challenge for decision makers. Therefore, this study aims to
    develop an interactive two-stage fuzzy stochastic programming (ITFSP) approach
    through integrating interval-parameter programming (IPP), interactive fuzzy resolution
    (IFR), and two-stage stochastic programming (TSP) into a general framework. ITFSP
    method can handle multiple uncertainties expressed as probability distributions
    and fuzzy-boundary intervals. Then, the ITFSP method is applied to crop planning
    and water resource allocation of Hetao irrigation region in China. This area is
    one of the largest irrigation regions for food production in China and is a typical
    water-deficient region with the features of arid climate, low and uneven distribution
    rainfall. Results obtained will be used for generating decision alternatives,
    and thus help decision makers to identify cropland use and water allocation patterns
    with a maximized economic return and a sustainable development manner. 2. Methodology
    2.1. Interval two-stage stochastic programming Interval-parameter programming
    (IPP) is an effectively alternative for deal with uncertainties expressed as discrete
    intervals which not require probability distributions that are hardly describable
    in practical application. However, IPP encounter difficult for handing two layers
    uncertainties that interval coefficients with fuzzy sets information. Moreover,
    it is incapable of incorporate with the subjective information of the authorities
    into decision-making process (Li et al., 2006). In many realistic agricultural
    water management problems, since the available water expressed as random variable
    is uncertain, decision variable is divided into two types, which include decision
    target must be determined before the realization of random variable, and recourse
    variable that is determined after the disclosure of random variable. A two-stage
    stochastic programming (TSP) model for planning water resource systems can be
    formulated as follows: (1a) subject to: (Water availability constraint) (1b) (Water
    allocation goal constraint) (1c) (Non-negativity and technical constraint) (1d)
    where f = objective benefits (RMB¥);  = net benefit to crop i per m3 of water
    allocated (RMB¥/m3); = promised target of water allocation quantity for crop i
    (m3);  = expected value of a random variable;  = deficit to crop i per m3 of water
    not delivered, (RMB¥/m3); SiQ = water deficit to crop i when the stream flow is
    Q (m3); Q = the total amount of stream flow (m3); = water loss rate in transport
    process;  = the maximum allowable allocation for crop i (m3); m = the total number
    of crops; i = type of crop, i = 1, 2, …, m. The distribution of Q must be approximated
    by a set of discrete values which for deal with above issues through the linear
    programming method. Letting Q take values qj with probabilities (j = 1, 2... n),
    then have: . Meanwhile, parameters such as benefits ( ) and penalties ( ) are
    seldom expressed as deterministic values. Correspondingly, interval-parameters
    are introduced into the TSP framework which can allow uncertainties expressed
    as intervals to be directly communicated into the optimization process. Thus,
    an interval two-stage stochastic programming (ITSP) model can be formulated as
    follows: (2a) subject to: (2b) (2c) (2d) where , , , , , and are interval parameters
    and variables. The interval is defined as a number with known lower- and upper-
    bound but without known probability distribution (Huang and Loucks, 2000, Miao
    et al., 2014). 2.2. Interactive fuzzy resolution approach In practical agricultural
    water management problems, when the detailed probabilistic distributions generated
    based on unrealistic estimations, for example, uncertainties in stream flows may
    include not only randomness but also fuzziness in individual events with varied
    probability levels, this leads to dual uncertainties existing in the system. Jiménez
    et al. (2007) proposed an interactive fuzzy resolution (IFR) method could effectively
    tackle such issues. IFR could be formulated as follows: (3a) subject to: (3b)
    (3c) where represents the expected value of the fuzzy vector ( ). IFR method allows
    decision makers to consider two factors: feasibility degree of constraints and
    satisfaction degree of the goal. Then, there would adopt three steps for solved
    of IFR. More details about IFR solution are presented in the “Appendix A”. 2.3.
    Interactive two-stage fuzzy stochastic programming In order to address dual uncertainties
    presented as fuzzy bound intervals as well as probability distributions, IFR is
    introduced into the ITSP framework. Thus, an interactive two-stage fuzzy stochastic
    programming (ITFSP) model can be reformulated as follows: (4a) subject to: (4b)
    (4c) (4d) where , , , are fuzzy-boundary intervals; When are considered as uncertain
    inputs, the existing methods for solving inexact linear programming problems cannot
    be used directly. Accordingly, let , where and , and are decision variables utilized
    for identifying an optimized set of target values ( ) and thereby favor of agricultural
    policy analysis. Thus, model (4) can be converted into two submodels as follows:
    Upper submodel: (5a) subject to: (5b) (5c) (5d) Lower submodel: (6a) subject to:
    (6b) (6c) (6d) When solving the two submodels, the solutions of model (4) under
    the optimized water allocation targets are: (7a) (7b) where and are the solutions
    of submodel (5), and , are the solutions of submodel (6). Finally, the optimized
    water allocation scheme is: (8) 3. Case study 3.1. Problem statement Hetao irrigation
    district (40°13′–42°28′N, 105°12′–109°53′E) is located in western part of the
    Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. It is border on the Yellow River to
    the south and the Langshan Mountains to the north, with an agricultural irrigation
    area of 5.74 × 103 km2. According to the division of administrative, the basin
    are divided into five sub-areas, namely, Linhe, Wuyuan, Dengkou, Hangjinhou, and
    Urad front banner (as shown in Fig. 1). The elevation of the sub-areas is higher
    in the southwest and lower in the northwest with an elevation ranging from 1032
    to 1050 m above sea level. The district features arid and semi-arid climatic conditions
    with an average annual precipitation of 120–220 mm and mean evaporation is about
    reaching 2300 mm. Precipitation is occurring mainly between in July and August,
    reaching for 56.3% of the total rainfall. The annual mean temperature is 7.7 °C,
    with the highest temperature in July (23.9 °C) and the lowest temperature in January
    (−10.6 °C) (BCWSP, 2013, IMSY, 2013). Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Study system of the Hetao irrigation district. The district is one of the largest
    irrigation regions for food production in China, where canal irrigation systems
    are widespread to divert water from the Yellow River into the district for agricultural
    irrigation (Guo et al., 2011). Many crops are cultivated in the Hetao irrigation
    districts, such as cotton, wheat, sugar beets, maize, oil plant, millet, and vegetables.
    Among them, wheat, maize and oil plant are widely cultivated (BCMP, 2013). Agricultural
    irrigation depends mainly on water from the Yellow River. However, allowable water
    diversions from the Yellow River to the Hetao irrigation district have decreased
    in recent years from 5 billion to 4 billion m3/year (Ye et al., 2010). In addition,
    dispute and divergent of water allocation problems among plurality of competing
    interests (e.g., municipal, industrial and ecological) have been intensified.
    The competitiveness can further exacerbating the shortage of agricultural water.
    A series of serious problems (e.g., food security, social stability) can thus
    triggered by poorly planning of water resource management when merely limited
    water resource is available for plurality of competing users (BCWSP, 2013, IMSY,
    2013). Moreover, there are a mass of complexities exist in agricultural water
    resource optimal allocation system, in where, many uncertainty factors are involved,
    such as crop planting area, irrigation water use efficiency, irrigation quota,
    water availability as well as economic parameters. All these parameters and phenomena
    have feature of uncertainty and thus affect the comprehensive policy decision
    (Li et al., 2010, Zhang et al., 2011b). Fig. 2 presents schematic of the ITFSP
    methodology for agriculture irrigation system. Moreover, spatial and temporal
    variations exist in system components as stream flows and agricultural crop targets.
    Decision making process of water allocation for irrigation should take them into
    consideration. Therefore, under such complexities and uncertainties, effective
    optimization approach is needed for allocating and managing agricultural irrigation
    in more equitable and sustainable ways for obtaining a desired policy for irrigation
    water management with a maximized system benefits. Download : Download full-size

    3.2. Modeling formulation In this study, the problem under consideration is how
    to identify the optimal policy which could bring maximum agricultural system benefit
    through allocating the limited water to the three main crops (i.e., wheat, maize
    and oil plant) in five irrigation sub-areas based on the given objectives/restrictions.
    Meanwhile, net irrigation benefit, economic penalty, water available and irrigation
    quota are expressed as fuzzy-boundary intervals. The flow level presented as random
    variable and other parameters are given as interval coefficients. Therefore, the
    proposed ITFSP method is suitable for supporting agricultural water resource management
    in the study irrigation district under multiple uncertainties. The study problem
    can be formulated as follows: (9a) subject to: (1) The flow quantity constraint:
    the total amount of allocated water to all districts should be less than the available
    water amount of the source; (9b) (2) Infrastructural capacity constraint: the
    allocated water amount should be no more than the transfer capacity of canals;
    (9c) (3) Water demands constraints: the total acquired water quantity for each
    sub-area should be in the range of its minimum and maximum water demands; (9d)
    (9e) (4) Planting area constraint: crop area of each sub-area should be limited
    in an appropriately range; (9f) (9g) (5) Nonnegative constraint; (9h) where f
    is the expected system benefit (RMB¥); i is the crop, with i = 1 for wheat, i
    = 2 for maize, and i = 3 oil plant; j is sub-area, with j = 1 for DengKou, j =
    2 for HangJinHou banner, j = 3 for LinHe, j = 4 for WuYuan, and j = 5 for Urad
    front banner; k is flow level, with k = 1 representing low level, k = 2 representing
    low-medium level, k = 3 representing medium level, k = 4 representing medium-high
    level, and k = 5 representing high level; is the probability of flow k; is the
    net irrigation benefit for crop i in sub-area j per unit of planting area (RMB¥/ha),
    which was calculated by comprehensive consideration the food benefit, fertilizer
    cost, water cost and manual labor; is the fixed irrigation area target of crop
    i in sub-area j (ha); is the maximum allowable area for planting crop i in sub-area
    j (ha); is the reduction of net benefit (economic penalty) to sub-area j planting
    crop i when per unit target unirrigated (RMB¥/ha), and ( ); is the probabilistic
    deficit of farmland that unirrigated under scenario k (ha), which is the recourse
    decision variable; is the water available for irrigation diverted from the Yellow
    River under scenario k (m3); is the irrigation quota for crop i in sub-area j
    (m3/ha); , is the maximum and minimum water demand of crop i in sub-area j (m3);
    is the canal transfer capacity in sub-area j (m3); is the variation factor representing
    water losses in the transporting stage from the Yellow River to each sub-area
    j; 3.3. Scenario design In the agricultural irrigation system, decision maker
    is responsible for optimize water resources allocation policies for meeting the
    irrigation water demand of cropping pattern. It is desired that reflect the different
    alternatives of crop targets ( ) under different flow levels. Given a crop targets
    that is promised to each crop in each sub-area. It could bring target benefit
    when the demand amount is contented. On the other hand, if the amount of water
    cannot satisfy the farmland area target, farmers are either forced to accept other
    more expensive alternative water sources or crop yield would be curtailed. These
    would lead to reduction of agricultural system benefit and food security cannot
    be guaranteed. Therefore, different scenarios would be designed according to various
    flow levels for crop planning which could effective abating the economic penalties
    caused by improper crop target. In this study, four alternatives from the ITSP
    are selected to reflect attitude of the managers to water resources availability:
    • Scenario 1: crop targets are considered as uncertain input parameters, which
    defined according to Equation ( and ). Decision variable was considered in the
    ITFSP model for maximize the benefit. This scenario can reflect interactions among
    uncertainties of the system (e.g., crop targets and available water). • Scenario
    2: when decision makers take a conservative attitude for agricultural water availability
    (i.e., worst conditions), they will set crop targets as the lower bounds (i.e.,
    ). This policy would result in both a less expected benefit and a low risk of
    shortage. • Scenario 3: when decision makers are optimistic about the availability
    of agricultural water resource (i.e., best conditions), the crop targets will
    reach the upper bounds (i.e., ). This scenario will correspond to the highest
    expected system benefit given the uncertain water allocation targets. • Scenario
    4: crop targets approximate the mid-values of interval (i.e., ). It is applicable
    the situation when decision makers take a neutral attitude for agricultural water
    resource availability. 3.4. Data collection and analysis In this study, the uncertain
    input parameters are obtained based on policy surveys, historic statistic, related
    literature, and government reports. According to the agricultural statistic data
    generated from Inner Mongolia statistical yearbook 2013, the original agriculture
    irrigation targets for each crop in each sub-area were presented in Table 1. Crop
    water requirement can be obtained through irrigation quota multiplied by the planting
    area. The irrigation quota is defined as the total water demand (cubic meters)
    per unit area (e.g. ha) of a certain crop (IMSY, 2013). Table 1. Original agricultural

    in each sub-area, which are mainly obtained from government record files and local
    policy surveys. Their lower and upper bounds are presented as fuzzy sets with
    known triangular membership functions. Table 3 presents the available water resource
    for irrigation under various stream flows and associated probability. Since the
    stream flow of the Yellow River is varies significantly among different years,
    the total amount of water can be divided into different levels with probability
    distributions according to statistical analysis of historical data (i.e. annual
    stream flow of the Yellow River). Thus, five flow levels are generated, which
    are named as low (L), low-medium (L–M), medium (M), medium-high (M–H) and high
    (H), respectively. For each flow, available water for irrigation can be expressed
    as a fuzzy-boundary interval. Each flow level corresponds to a fixed probability
    level , and the sum of the probability of flow level is 1. Table 2. Net irrigation

    penalty, available water to agriculture irrigation and irrigation quota for crops
    in each sub-area ( , , and ) were expressed as a fuzzy-boundary interval. These
    could lead to multi-layers interactive relationships between various components
    of irrigation system. Seven semantic terms are chosen with the discrete values
    of α (i.e., 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1) for analyzing feasibilities of
    the constraints. Four scenarios were examined under the best choice solution based
    on different crop targets which could reflect the local decision makers'' attitudes
    to water resource availabilities. The results could facilitate efficient irrigation
    water allocation and management in applying to crop target settings at the beginning
    of irrigation, water allocations according to different flow levels, and cropping
    pattern optimization in each sub-area of the Hetao irrigation district. 4.1. System
    benefit Fig. 3 indicates the system benefits obtained from the ITFSP model under
    different degrees of α which presented as fuzzy-boundary interval. It is shown
    that the minimum and maximum agricultural irrigation system profits would be [(5.57,
    5.68, 5.79), (9.42, 9.63, 9.84)] × 109 RMB¥ under α = 1 and [(6.25, 6.38, 6.50),
    (9.63, 9.86, 10.08)] × 109 RMB¥ under α = 0.4. The results indicate that, higher
    feasibility degree would result in lower objective function value, while higher
    degree of objective satisfying guarantees lower feasibility degree of constraints.
    After obtaining the objective values with different α levels, decision makers
    can determine a goal with tolerance threshold by fuzzy set . The goals of lower
    and upper bounds system benefits can be expressed by the fuzzy set. In this study,
    the specified lower and upper bounds fuzzy goals would be 6.50 × 109 and 10.08
    × 109, with its tolerance levels being 0.93 × 109 and 0.66 × 109. The membership
    function of is shown as follow: (10a) (10b) Table 4 presents the membership grades
    of fuzzy decisions in the α-acceptable solutions. In an attempt to determine the
    balance between objective satisfying and constraints feasibility, fuzzy decision
    was utilized for aggregate the degrees of satisfaction and feasibility under α-level
    solutions. The final compromised decision would be the one that has the largest
    mean membership value of fuzzy decision considering lower- and upper-bound solutions.
    As shown in Table 4, best alternatives in this study is the solution under 0.6-feasibility

    if the crop target ( ) water reach the upper bound (i.e.,  = 1), at the same time,
    it would be suffered a high risk of economic penalty when water available is inadequate
    (e.g. flow level is low). Conversely, when approach to the lower-bound (i.e.,  =
    0), it would result in a lower penalty risk, meanwhile, a high surplus when the
    flow level is high. It is indicated that the optimized crop targets of wheat and
    oil plant in all sub-areas except Dengkou would correspond the upper-bound. Results
    reveal that the decision makers would be more positive to water available to wheat
    and oil plant than maize. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Optimized

    In fact, it would result deficits when the promised irrigation targets are more
    than actual irrigated croplands. The actual crop area (i.e., actual crop area
    = optimized target − unirrigated area) would be various under a given flow levels
    associated with different probability. For example, under low and low-medium flow
    levels, wheat and maize would not be irrigated in all sub-areas, while the irrigation
    proportions (i.e., actual crop area/optimized crop targets) of oil plant would
    be [22.2, 31.4] %, [15.1, 32.8] %, [15.0, 23.5] %, and [22.6, 30.6] % under low
    level and [70.7, 73.6] %, [67.9, 75.6] %, [64.8, 68.2] %, and [67.6, 70.9] % under
    low-medium level from scenarios 1 to 4, respectively. The results discovered that
    oil plant always owns the priority of water allocation and would be partly satisfied
    even under low flow level, due to its higher unit net irrigation benefit and lower
    water requirement compared with wheat and maize. Moreover, scenario 2 would be
    more favorable to wheat and maize since it associated with lower irrigation target
    compared with other scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Optimized

    depicts the optimized agricultural water allocation patterns for the three crops
    in different sub-areas under different flow levels and scenarios. It is depicts
    that the total water allocation amounts to oil plant would be [579.1, 641.4] ×
    106, [537.3, 594.9] × 106, [614.3, 652.7] × 106 and [558.4, 618.1] × 106 m3 when
    the promised targets for oil plant in all sub-areas would be satisfied under scenarios
    1 to 4. The total water allocation amounts for wheat would be [65.6, 87.7] × 106,
    [34.9, 62.2] × 106, [86.8, 110.1] × 106 and [37.9, 66.9] × 106 m3 lower than oil
    plant under scenarios 1 to 4. In general, oil plant would consume higher amounts
    of water than wheat and maize under relatively low flow levels, due to its higher
    net irrigation benefit, crop area and lower water requirement. Results indicate
    that abating extensive land uses for wheat might be suitable to local economic
    development and resource conservation. Download : Download full-size image Fig.

    sub-area. Fig. 7 shows the unirrigated area proportion of each subarea under a
    low flow level. It could give information for decision maker that which subarea
    was most influenced by water deficit. The proposed model can calculated not only
    unirrigated area but also optimized target of irrigation. It would lead to deficits
    when the promised irrigation targets are more than actual irrigated croplands.
    The results indicate that unirrigated area would be different in each sub-area
    under different scenarios. Generally, the unirrigated area proportion (i.e., unirrigated
    area/total unirrigated area) of Wuyuan would be the highest among the five sub-areas,
    with [27.5, 27.6] %, [28.5, 28.6] %, [27.4, 27.6] % and [27.7, 28.1] % under scenarios
    1–4, respectively. It can be explained that crops area are overplanted in this
    sub-area and more high water-intensive crops such as maize and wheat are planted.
    In summary, (i) Wuyuan would be the main economic loss sub-areas under four scenarios
    due to its highest unirrigated area proportion, abatement activities for land
    uses should be taken; (ii) the most conservative development policy (i.e. scenario
    2) would be more favorable to Linhe since it would reduce the adverse effect when
    water shortage occurs. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Unirrigated
    area proportion of each sub-area under low flow level. 4.4. Policy analysis Fig.
    8 shows the water shortage patterns under different scenarios and flow levels.
    It is indicated that different scenarios would result in various water shortage
    under different flow levels (except under high level), which can provide the information
    of shortage quantity for decision makers and thus minimizing the risk of penalty.
    For example, scenario 3 would result in the worst shortage situation compared
    with other scenarios under low flow level, and thus leading to the highest economic
    penalty (RMB¥ [1.9, 7.6] × 109). Aiming to mitigate the adverse effects of water
    shortage for agricultural irrigation, decision makers should try to select a crop
    planning which is more suitable and profitable for local agricultural water allocation.
    Fig. 9 shows system benefits and penalties under different scenarios and flow
    levels. For example, under medium and medium-high flow levels, decision makers
    would be suggested to choose the crop targets correspond to scenario 1, while
    leading to the highest net return of RMB¥ [6.1, 7.3] × 109 and [6.1, 9.2] × 109,
    respectively. Results reveal that different agricultural policies for crop planning
    and water allocation correspond to different water shortages and surpluses, which
    result in varied system benefits and penalties. Download : Download full-size

    and flow levels. 4.5. Comparison with the ITSP The ITSP method can also be utilized
    for solve the irrigation model through predigest parameters with interval fuzzy
    coefficient into deterministic boundary, and thus, resulting the interrelation
    of system parameters (e.g. benefit and supply, penalty and shortage) and the marginal
    utility of information are neglected (Huang and Loucks, 2000). Table 5 presents
    the solutions obtained from ITSP under basic scenario (corresponding to scenario
    1 of ITFSP). The system benefit from ITSP would be a single interval of RMB¥ [6.1,
    8.9] × 109, while the system benefit from ITFSP (under α = 0.6) would be RMB¥
    [(6.0, 6.2, 6.3), (9.6, 9.8, 10.0)] × 109, which has a wider interval with its
    boundaries depicted as triangular fuzzy sets. This indicates that ITFSP could
    provide plenty of information for decision makers and enhanced the reliable of
    decisions. In fact, in agricultural water resources management, the benefit/penalty
    coefficients as well as supply/shortage parameters may be estimated as intervals,
    while their lower- and upper- bounds are also fuzzy in nature, which derives dual
    uncertainties expressed as fuzzy-boundary intervals. Thus, the relationship between
    benefit and supply, as well as relationship between penalty and shortage will
    be too complicated to be handled by ITSP. In comparison, ITFSP can effectively
    deal with such issues through introducing interactive fuzzy resolution (IFR) approach
    into ITSP. It also allows decision makers to evaluate a balanced solution concerned
    the tradeoff between feasibility degree of constraints (i.e., limited water to
    satisfy the crops) and satisfaction degree of the goal (i.e., maximization of
    the net system benefit). Table 5. Solutions obtained from the ITSP model under

    of unified water resources management mechanism and supervisory measure, and has
    not formed a detailed allocation scheme and crop planning for agricultural management.
    Research works for regional agricultural water management have difficulties in
    considering various uncertainties. In this study, the ITFSP approach is proposed
    for crop planning and water allocation under multiple uncertainties, and the results
    are valuable in providing a basis for formulating a secure, reasonable and reliable
    agriculture management scheme in the future. Reverse modeling techniques are useful
    for the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the efficient, cost-effective
    flow of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods and related information
    from the point of origin to the point of consumption for the purpose of conforming
    to customer requirements (Bautista and Pereira, 2006, Zhang et al., 2011c). However,
    the reverse modeling techniques have difficulties in tackling various uncertain
    parameters that are important sources leading to planning and management complexities
    in water resource systems. Ignoring these uncertainties in real-world decision
    making may increase the system-failure risk and economic penalty due to the adding
    of extra burdens in the areas of information processing and infrastructure investment
    to meet increased water demand. Through selecting different flow conditions in
    the past and introducing these flows into the ITFSP model, Table 6 shows the system
    benefits obtained (denoted as ITFSP-II) under different α levels. The system benefits
    from ITFSP-IIwould slightly increase compared with those from IFBIP. This is due
    to the fact that the available water for irrigation in the past is higher than
    that in the future. According to the Yellow River water allocation plans approved
    by the local authority, the total amount of water diverted from the Yellow River
    in the future will gradually decline (BCWSP, 2013). For example, the system benefit
    under 0.6-feasibility by ITFSP is [(6.02, 6.14, 6.26), (9.58, 9.80, 10.02)] ×
    109 RMB¥, in contrast, the corresponding system benefit by ITFSP-IIis [(6.32,
    6.44, 6.66), (9.88, 10.10, 10.32)] × 109 RMB¥. Thus, a lower economic penalty
    would happen under demanding conditions (e.g., low or low-medium flow levels)
    when the cropland targets are not satisfied. Table 6. Total system benefit obtained
    from the IFBIP-II under different α levels. Feasibility degree System benefit
    (RMB¥ 109) 0.4 [(6.55, 6.68, 6.81), (9.93, 10.16, 10.38)] 0.5 [(6.43, 6.56, 6.68),
    (9.91, 10.13, 10.35)] 0.6 [(6.32, 6.44, 6.66), (9.88, 10.10, 10.32)] 0.7 [(6.19,
    6.32, 6.43), (9.84, 10.06, 10.28)] 0.8 [(6.10, 6.21, 6.32), (9.80, 10.02, 10.24)]
    0.9 [(5.98, 6.10, 6.21), (9.77, 9.98, 10.19)] 1 [(5.87, 5.98, 6.09), (9.72, 9.93,
    10.14)] Fig. 10 presents the optimized crop area patterns obtained from the ITFSP-II.
    For the crop area change, the optimal solutions under demanding conditions from
    ITFSP-IIis higher than crop patterns obtained from ITFSP. Under advantageous conditions
    (e.g., medium-high or high flow levels), the optimal patterns are identical for
    the two solutions which can both approach the upper bound of targets. However,
    under demanding conditions, degree of targets satisfying in ITFSP-IIsolutions
    is higher than that obtained from ITFSP. For instance, the irrigation area for
    maize obtained form ITFSP-II is [63.4,78.1] ha higher than ITFSP solutions. This
    is due to that past available water resources for irrigation as result of stream
    flow from the Yellow River basin is more than future planning available quantity.
    Results reveal that stream flow level is an important variable which can directly
    affect economic benefits. Generally, reverse modeling technique can be utilized
    for providing a comparison between the cropland use and water allocation patterns
    in the past and the optimal solutions from the ITFSP model. It will make the proposed
    agricultural water resources management model relatively practical in reflecting
    real-world situation. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. Optimized crop
    area patterns obtained from the ITFSP-II. Verification based reverse modeling
    strategies can be utilized for examining the accuracy of the ITSFP method by comparing
    optimal results with those existed crop patterns in the past. It is found that
    the cropland use and water allocation patterns in the past are also within the
    range of the interval solutions from ITSFP. For instance, under the medium flow
    level, the solution for maize planting area (from ITFSP-II) is [99.3, 105.5] ha,
    and this is conforming to the actual cultivation situation of the Hetao irrigation
    district. Generally, the results indicate that, through the proposed ITSFP approach,
    uncertainties in water resource systems can be effectively reflected. When the
    cropland and water-allocation patterns vary from their lower- and upper-bound
    solutions under each α level and each probability level, the system benefit value
    would change within the solution interval correspondingly. Decision alternatives
    can be generated by adjusting different cropland and water-flow combinations within
    the solution intervals according to projected planning conditions. Therefore,
    from the perspective of resource saving and reasonable configuration, the optimal
    solution can provide effectively suggestion for adjustment of currently cropping
    patterns and allocation schedules to achieve maximum economic benefit and agricultural
    sustainable development mode. On the other hand, more complicated spatial-temporal
    models could be used to more thoroughly describe the complexity of the processes
    of water flow and irrigation pattern. Thus, future studies could introduce digital
    elevation maps, topography driven flow, and subsurface flow to improve model performance.
    Results of crop planning optimization model that assigns the land use pattern
    at a sub-area scale could be incorporated into GIS platform to supply specific
    location suggestion on the basis of extant cropping schedule, slope, farmlands
    size and runoff of farm in the irrigation region. Besides, more specifies execution
    and interpretation of optimal development scenarios can be obtained. The utilization
    of GIS technology based on the solutions of ITFSP model, which could provide the
    information of where and what type of farmland use should be changed for decision
    makers. Therefore, in attempt to obtained comprehensive optimal farmland and agricultural
    water use of the irrigation district, the integrated GIS-based optimization modeling
    as a promising research method that incorporated various system components and
    uncertainties in decision-making process is conducive to providing holistic and
    synthetically analysis of related agricultural management and planning. 6. Conclusions
    In this study, an interactive two-stage fuzzy stochastic programming (ITFSP) method
    has been developed to aid the crop planning and water resource allocation under
    uncertainty. The developed method has three major advantages compared with the
    existing fuzzy and stochastic methods. Firstly, it can handle uncertainties expressed
    as fuzzy-boundary intervals and probability distributions. Secondly, it can also
    provide an effective linkage between conflicting economic benefits and the associated
    penalties due to the violation of the predefined policies. Thirdly, it can enable
    decision makers to quantify the relationship between objective satisfying and
    feasibility of constraints. The developed method has been applied to a real case
    of crop planning and water resource allocation of Hetao irrigation region in China.
    Four decision scenarios associated with different water resources management policies
    are examined; solutions under different feasibility degrees (α) have been generated.
    Results are significant for assisting decision makers with adjust existing agricultural
    development patterns under multiple uncertainties. Through the application of
    ITFSP approach, it is found that higher feasibility degree (α) would result in
    lower objective function value, while higher degree of objective satisfying would
    correspond to lower feasibility degree of constraints. The best alternative is
    the solution under α with the greatest mean and lowest deviation membership grade
    for fuzzy decision. Compared with scenarios with the negative, neutral, and optimistic
    attitudes for agricultural water resource availability (i.e., scenarios 2–4),
    results under scenario 1 could be easily interpreted for generating decision alternatives
    associated with interactions among uncertainties of the system. Moreover, results
    discover that abating extensive land uses for wheat might be suitable to local
    economic development and resource conservation due to its lower unit benefit and
    higher irrigation quote. Wuyuan would be the main economic loss sub-areas under
    four scenarios due to its highest unirrigated area proportion, abatement activities
    for land uses should be taken. Although this study is the first attempt for planning
    agricultural water resource management through development of ITFSP approach,
    there are still some extensive research to be done for further improvement. For
    instance, in real-world irrigation water management problems, more natural factors
    should be taken into account such as soil moisture, water run-off, and irrigation
    water leakage; and other objectives except economic ones should be attracted attention,
    such as ecosystem stability, food security and so on. Consequently, the integration
    of surface and groundwater as well as searching for optimal multi-objectives with
    more efficient solution methods would be interesting topics that deserve future
    research efforts. Acknowledgements This research was supported by the National

    an effective tool for incorporating subjective information. Firstly, a linear
    programming model with fuzzy parameters can be formulated as follows: (A.1a) subject
    to: (A.1b) (A.1c) where and represents a set of fuzzy parameters related in the
    objective function and constraints; , and represents a set of crisp decision variables.
    A fuzzy set ( ) in X is characterized by its membership function : , where is
    a set of elements (Zadeh, 1965). When is an uncertain parameter, the membership
    degree can be identified as the plausibility degree of taking value x. Zadeh (1978)
    defined the possibility distribution associated with as . The convex fuzzy set
    ( ) is a set defined on the real line (R) with a continuous membership function
    ( ) that can be expressed as follows (Heilpern, 1992, Jiménez et al., 2007): (A.2)
    where , , , and , is a continuous and monotonically increasing function on the
    left-hand side of , and is a continuous and monotonically decreasing function
    on the right-hand side of . A fuzzy number is trapezoidal if and are linear functions
    by denote = ( ). If , a fuzzy set becomes triangular. The α-level set of a fuzzy
    set ( ) can be defined by , where . Since is upper semi-continuous, the α-level
    set of forms a closed and bound interval  =  (Jiménez et al., 2007). The tradeoff
    between feasibility of decision vector and optimality of objective function need
    to concerned when comparing fuzzy sets with fuzzy modeling parameters and deterministic
    variables. According Jiménez et al. (2007), for any couple of fuzzy sets and ,
    the degree in which is smaller than is: (A.3) where and are the expected intervals
    of fuzzy sets and , respectively. When , where , it implies that is smaller than,
    or equal to, at least in a degree α, and can be represented by . Considering the
    feasibility of a decision vector when the constraints with fuzzy parameters, given
    a decision vector , it is feasible in degree (or α-feasible) if (A.4) where ;
    α is the feasibility degree of a decision vector, and thus can deduced that 1–α
    provides a measure risk of infeasibility. According to formula (A.3), this is
    can also expressed as: (A.5) The decision vectors set that are -feasible can be
    denoted by . Obviously, when , then . This can be inferring that an increased
    feasibility corresponds to a decreased optimal objective function value. For the
    optimality of the objective function with fuzzy coefficients, vector is an acceptable
    solution if it can be verified . According to Eq. (A.3), this can be written as:
    (A.6) The decision vector [ ] is an -acceptable solution of initial fuzzy model
    (A.1) if it is an optimal solution to the following α-parametric linear programming
    problem: (A.7a) subject to: (A.7b) (A.7c) where represents the expected value
    of the fuzzy vector ( ). The interactive method proposed by Jiménez et al. (2007)
    allows decision makers to consider two factors: feasibility degree of constraints
    and satisfaction degree of the goal. The decision makers have to evaluate a balanced
    solution between these two conflicting objectives. The best way to reflect the
    decision makers'' preferences is to use linguistic terms, establishing a semantic
    correspondence for different degrees of feasibility (Zadeh, 1975); Therefore,
    Jiménez et al. (2007) constructed a set of semantic include 11 scales, which allowed
    distinguish between different preference degrees of decision makers to the objective
    function value sufficiently. The 11 scales include: α = 0.0, unacceptable solution
    (US); α = 0.1, practically US; α = 0.2, almost US; α = 0.3, very US; α = 0.4,
    quite US; α = 0.5, neither acceptable solution (AS) nor US; α = 0.6, quite AS;
    α = 0.7, very AS; α = 0.8, almost AS; α = 0.9, practically AS; α = 1.0, completely
    AS. The discrete values of α can be calculated as follows: (A.8) where α0 is the
    minimum acceptable feasibility degree of decision makers. In the first step of
    the IFR method, the space of the αk-acceptable solutions and the corresponding
    objective-function values can be obtained through solving model (A.7). After obtaining
    the results given by the different , decision makers can determine a goal and
    the tolerance threshold by fuzzy set . In the second step, the degree of satisfaction
    of each to fuzzy goal can be obtained through an index proposed by Yager (1979).
    In the third step, in order to identify a balance between feasibility of the constraints
    and satisfaction degree of the goal in the space of α-acceptable solutions, a
    fuzzy decision ( ) can be defined as an intersection of fuzzy constraint and fuzzy
    goal (Bellman and Zadeh, 1970). The solution with the highest membership grade
    will be the final decision for the fuzzy linear programming problem [i.e., model
    (A.1)]. References Akbari et al., 2014 M. Akbari, A. Afshar, S.J. Mousavi Multi-objective

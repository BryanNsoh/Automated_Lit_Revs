  description: Lodging is a major problem in maize (Zea mays L.) production worldwide.
    An analytical lodging model has previously been established. However, some of
    the model inputs are time consuming to obtain and require destructive plant sampling.
    Efficient prediction of lodging risk early in the season would be beneficial for
    management decision-making to reduce lodging risks and ensure high yield potential.
    Remote sensing technology provides an alternative method for fast and nondestructive
    measurements with the potential for efficient prediction of lodging risks. The
    objective of this study was to explore the potential of using an active canopy
    sensor for the early prediction of maize stem lodging risk using simple regression
    and multiple linear regression (MLR) models. The results indicated that the MLR
    models using active canopy sensor data together with weather and management factors
    performed better than simple regression models using only sensor data for predicting
    maize stem lodging indicators. Similar results were achieved either using regression
    models to predict the maize stem lodging risk indicators directly or using the
    regression models to predict lodging related plant parameters as inputs to a process-based
    lodging model to predict lodging risk indicators indirectly, although the latter
    approach using MLR models performed slightly better. A medium planting density
    (7.0 plants m-2) and 240 kg ha-1 N rate would be suitable in the study region,
    and the recommendations may be adjusted according to different weather conditions.
    It is concluded that maize stem lodging risks can be predicted using active canopy
    sensor data together with weather and management information at V8 stage, which
    can be used to guide in-season management decisions. Additional research is needed
    to evaluate the potential of using unmanned aerial vehicles and satellite remote
    sensing technologies in conjunction with machine learning methods to improve the
    prediction of lodging risks for large scale applications.

    nitrogen managementData fusion 1. Introduction Challenged with the increasingly
    rigorous population and food demand problems, increasing planting density and
    nitrogen (N) application rates are methods widely used to improve grain yield
    and protein concentration for maize (Zea mays L.) production (Tokatlidis et al.,
    2011, Zhang et al., 2020). However, besides low N use efficiency and severe environmental
    contamination (Ma et al., 2010, Wu and Ma, 2015), high N application rates and
    planting density may also result in an increased lodging risk by changing plant
    tissue structure, morphogenesis and mechanical strength (Gou et al., 2007, Li
    et al., 2010, Rajkumara, 2008, Shah et al., 2017, Xue et al., 2017). Lodging is
    defined as the permanent displacement of the stems from vertical position (stem
    lodging) or failure of the root anchorage (root lodging) (Pinthus, 1974), and
    has become one of the major problems in maize production worldwide. In addition
    to the increase in harvest costs and degradation of grain quality, it has been
    reported that lodging in maize can result in 5–25 % yield losses (Zuber and Kang,
    1978, Norberg et al., 1988, Setter et al., 1997, Flint-Garcia et al., 2003). As
    a result, many studies have focused on the dynamic interactions between the plant
    and wind, the strength of the stem and the strength of the anchorage system and
    their assessment to understand and reduce lodging in cereal production. Several
    methods and models based on different indicators such as lodging index, lodging
    score or safety factor were developed (Caldicott and Nuttall, 1979, Crook and
    Ennos, 1994, Crook et al., 1994, Chauhan et al., 2019). Several mathematical models
    considering the effects of environmental conditions have been developed to simulate
    and evaluate lodging risk for different crops quantitatively (Sposaro et al.,
    2010, Baker et al., 2014, Kendall et al., 2017). Previous studies have mainly
    focused on wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rice (Oryza sativa L.) (Chauhan et
    al., 2019), which have distinct structural differences from maize. Recently, based
    on field experiments conducted in the UK and China, a comprehensive maize stem
    lodging model has been established and tested. This model accounts for key processes
    to quantify maize stem lodging risks as affected by agronomic lodging control
    practices and the dynamic interactions between maize plants and wind, without
    relying on the occurrence of natural lodging (Berry et al., 2021). However, many
    inputs are needed and their measurements are complex and time-consuming, requiring
    destructive plant sampling and detailed observations. Thus, efficient alternative
    methods are necessary, particularly for large–scale applications. Rapid development
    of remote sensing technology enables efficient and nondestructive estimation of
    crop nutritional status and yield, providing important information for making
    in-season management decisions to improve agricultural production (Samborski et
    al., 2009, Mulla and Miao, 2016, Franzen et al., 2021). In the past few decades,
    the applications of remote sensing for lodging monitoring and related yield loss
    assessment have also been developed (Chauhan et al., 2019). Some metrics that
    describe the changes in the plant structure of damaged crops, such as crop height
    and crop angle of inclination have been estimated as effective indicators using
    various sensors (Han et al., 2018, Shu et al., 2020, Chauhan et al., 2020). However,
    some management decisions need to be made at an early stage, and even before sowing,
    like planting density and N fertilizer application. The detection of lodging incidents
    after their occurrence cannot be used for making in-season management decisions
    aimed to reduce current year lodging risk and ensure optimal grain production.
    Therefore, quick and effective prediction of lodging risk in the early season
    is highly desirable. Remote sensing has been widely used for in-season prediction
    of crop yield potential to guide management decisions during the growing season
    (Samborski et al., 2009, Mulla, 2013, Wang et al., 2019). Similarly, early prediction
    of stem lodging risk using remote sensing should also be feasible. Wu et al. (2019b)
    reported a positive correlation between normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) and lodging susceptibility represented by an index called safety factor.
    They explained the potential of using NDVI to forecast lodging risk in spring
    wheat during the early growing season to support management decision making. A
    significant linear relationship (R2 = 0.69) between green area index (GAI) measured
    at the start of stem elongation and the stem strength measured at the mid-grain
    filling in wheat was reported by Berry et al. (2019). Similarly, significant correlations
    between leaf area index (LAI) measured at V4-V8 stages and multiple stem lodging-related
    parameters measured after flowering in maize have also been found (Berry et al.,
    2021). Due to the strong capability to estimate LAI or GAI (Guindin-Garcia et
    al., 2012, Kira et al., 2016), spectral methods might predict the risk of stem
    lodging well at an early growth stage. Among different proximal and remote sensing
    technologies, active canopy reflectance sensors have been increasingly used in
    precision agriculture (Mulla and Miao, 2016, Franzen et al., 2021). Such sensors
    have their own light and are not influenced by environmental light conditions,
    which is important for agricultural applications. The Crop Circle ACS-430 sensor
    (Holland Scientific Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) is a widely used active canopy sensor
    with three wavebands covering red (R, 670 nm), red-edge (RE, 730 nm) and near
    infrared (NIR, 780 nm) spectral regions. These three bands are important for plant
    growth status estimation including LAI and chlorophyll content in leaves. Besides,
    the NIR and RE bands have advantages in reducing the saturation effect of NDVI
    (Li et al., 2014). The Crop Circle sensor has been demonstrated to work well for
    the prediction of crop parameters including LAI and GAI, grain yield and precision
    N management (Baker et al., 2016; Padilla et al., 2017). In real world agriculture,
    external conditions like weather and management may strongly influence stem lodging
    (Shah et al., 2017, Chauhan et al., 2019). Thus, a simple regression model only
    considering a single spectral index is limited. By contrast, the application of
    multiple linear regression (MLR) models incorporating multiple factors for crop
    yield prediction may be applicable for stem lodging prediction across years (Maya
    Gopal and Bhargavi, 2019, Franz et al., 2020). Compared with root lodging, stem
    lodging typically leads to higher loss of grain yield and can reduce maize yield
    by 28 % at V12 stage and by 45–48 % at grain filling stage (Albrecht et al., 1986,
    Li et al., 2015). According to previous field surveys, stem lodging usually occurs
    during the grain filling stage. This is due to the stem quality reduction caused
    by the transportation of stalk carbohydrates to the ear and the increase in the
    height of the center of gravity caused by the increase of ear weight (Martin and
    Russell, 1984, Robertson et al., 2016). These studies also indicated that basal
    internodes played an important role for evaluating stem lodging resistance. Our
    hypothesis is that stem lodging risks at later growth stages can be predicted
    at an early growing season based on plant growth conditions estimated with commonly
    used active canopy sensors, management practices and weather conditions. Therefore,
    the objective of this study was to test the hypothesis and evaluate the potential
    of using the commonly used three-band Crop Circle ACS-430 active canopy sensor
    at V8 stage together with management and weather information to predict maize
    stem lodging risk at later growth stages. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental
    design Field experiments were conducted in Lishu County (43°02’–43°46’N, 123°45’–124°53’E),
    Jilin Province, Northeast China from 2017 to 2019. The mean annual average temperature
    is 6.6 °C and the annual average precipitation is 556 mm in the study region,
    and most precipitation occurs during the maize growing season. The daily mean
    temperature and rainfall during the growing season of the experimental years are
    shown in Fig. 1. The average, maximum and extreme wind velocities in August (the
    R3 growth stage is in this month) in the three experimental years were 2.0, 4.8

    the growing seasons of 2017, 2018 and 2019. The experiments were carried out in
    a field with black soil (classified as typic Haploboroll in USDA soil taxonomy)
    using a randomized split-block design. In 2017, three planting densities (5.5,
    7.0 and 8.5 plants m-2) were set up as the main plots, and six N fertilizer rates
    ranging from 0 to 300 kg N ha-1 with an increment of 60 kg N ha-1 were set up
    as the sub-plots. In 2018 and 2019, additional treatments including a planting
    density of 10.0 plants m-2 combined with three N rates of 60, 180 and 300 kg N
    ha-1 were added. There were three replications for each treatment combination
    for all three years. The N fertilizers were split into 1/3 and 2/3 applied before
    sowing as basal N using ammonium sulfate and at around V8-V9 stage as side-dress
    N using urea, respectively. Sufficient phosphorus and potassium nutrients (90 kg ha-1
    P2O5 and K2O fertilizers) were supplied before sowing together with N fertilizers
    in each plot. The plot size was 9 × 12 m and a wide-narrow planting pattern was
    adopted, with the wide row spacing of 0.80 m and narrow row spacing of 0.40 m.
    A common mid-late maturing variety Liangyu 66 was used in this study. It was released
    in 2004 and classified as a medium yield level variety (Liu et al., 2022). The
    crops were planted on May 3rd in 2017 and on April 28th in 2018 and 2019. The
    field was irrigated to ensure seedling emergence in 2018 and 2019 for the lack
    of rainfall after sowing. 2.2. Spectral reflectance measurements at an early growth
    stage An active canopy reflectance sensor, Crop Circle ACS-430 (Holland Scientific
    Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA), with three fixed wavebands covering red (R, 670 nm),
    red-edge (RE, 730 nm) and near infrared (NIR, 780 nm) spectral regions, was used
    to collect canopy reflectance data in each plot at V8 growth stage before side-dressing.
    This sensor has its own light source and is independent of environmental light
    conditions. The reflectance data collected are not affected by the measurement
    height above the canopy in the range of 0.25–2 m (Cao et al., 2018). Plants from
    four inner rows of 4 m in length in each plot were selected for sensor data collection.
    The sensor was kept approximately 70 cm distance above the canopy and moved with
    a constant velocity in the field. Sensor reflectance readings were stored in a
    portable GeoScout GLS-400 datalogger and were further exported as text files.
    The values of each spectral band were averaged in each plot for further analysis.
    Selected vegetation indices based on the three spectral bands were calculated
    and listed in Table A1. 2.3. Measurement of the plant parameters associated with
    lodging at grain filling stage To calculate the lodging risk at grain filling
    stage (R3), seven plant parameters associated with lodging (natural frequency,
    plant height, height at the center of gravity, internode length, internode diameter,
    stem breaking strength, and wall width or thickness of stem wall) were measured
    in maize plants sampled from the four inner rows of each plot that have been previously
    measured by Crop Circle ACS-430 sensor. Natural frequency (Hz) was calculated
    according to Berry et al. (2000) as the number of oscillations observed during
    the timed period / timed period (s). Natural frequency was measured on six typical
    plants isolated from any neighboring plants (by pushing the neighboring plants
    aside manually) within each plot on a still day (no wind or the wind did not induce
    the movement of plant canopy). The shoot of each plant was pulled 20 cm from the
    vertical position and released. The time for three complete oscillations to occur
    in the line of displacement was recorded using a stopwatch timer. No natural frequency
    data was collected in 2017 due to the windy weather during that period. The plant
    samples were dissected at the ground level. Plant height (cm) and height at the
    center of gravity (distance between the balance point and the stem base (cm))
    were measured with a tapeline. The bottom three internodes together were considered
    as the tested internode in this study and the internode length (cm) was measured
    using a ruler and the internode diameter (mm) was measured at two different directions
    (along the long axis and short axis) of the middle of the second internode using
    a digital caliper, and calculated by averaging the two values. A stalk strength
    tester (Zhejiang Top Instrument Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, China, Fig. 2) was used to
    measure the stem breaking strength (Newton) by slowly pressing the “U”-shaped
    probe of the tester vertically aligned to the middle of the internode down. Then
    the internode was cut at the mid-point of the second internode and two measurements
    of the wall width (mm) were taken at right angles, and the average value was computed.

    Fig. 2. An illustration of using stalk strength tester for stem breaking strength
    determination. 2.4. Calculations The lodging risk was calculated using a lodging
    model developed by Berry et al. (2021) and indicated as failure wind speed (m
    s-1). The plant parameters associated with lodging, described in Section 2.3,
    were inserted into the maize lodging model for the calculation. In the lodging
    model, the stem breaking strength (FS, Newton) was converted to stem failure moment
    (BS, Nm) using the following formula as described by Berry et al. (2000): BS =
    FSL / 4 Where Bs is the stem failure moment (Nm), FS is the stem breaking strength
    (Newton), and L is the internode length (m). Considering the maize-specific calibrations
    performed by Joseph et al. (2020), which demonstrated that the maize shoot behaves
    as a damped harmonic oscillator after being subjected to wind loading, the maize
    lodging model was developed based on a generalized model used to describe the
    lodging process in cereals (Baker et al., 2014). Assuming the unit of lodging
    is a single plant and stem lodging is expected if the wind-induced bending moment
    exceeds the stem failure moment (stem strength at the point of failure), the lodging
    risk was quantitatively expressed in this model using failure wind speed (m s-1)
    by incorporating multiple parameters. The bending moment (B) at any point along
    the shoot is obtained using the following function: ̅ where density of air ( is
    1.2 kg m-3, the drag area of the shoot (ACF) is 0.153 m2, ̅ is mean wind speed,
    is the shoot’s natural frequency, is the shoot’s height at center of gravity,
    the acceleration due to gravity ( is 9.81 m s2, is the height above the ground
    at which the bending moment is considered, is the total height of the shoot, the
    turbulence intensity and the shoot’s damping ratio is 0.13. is a constant determined
    from the following relationship: More detailed information about the lodging model
    was explained in the study of Berry et al. (2021). 2.5. Grain yield investigation
    At physiological maturity, the plants located in the inner eight rows three meters
    in length in each plot were selected for manual harvest. The grain yield was determined
    by standardizing the moisture content of the grain to 14 %. 2.6. Statistical analysis
    and modeling Analyses of variance (ANOVA) were carried out using SPSS statistics
    21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA). Multiple comparisons were tested by
    the least significant difference (LSD) test at 95 % level of significance. Pearson
    correlation analyses were conducted to explore the relationships among the plant
    parameters associated with lodging and the two calculated indicators (stem failure
    moment and failure wind speed). All the data obtained from the sampled plots were
    pooled and divided into two groups, with 2/3 (data size = 120) used for calibration
    and 1/3 (data size = 60) for validation of lodging risk prediction. To predict
    the lodging risk of maize during the early growing season, simple regression analyses
    were performed and the empirical models with the highest coefficient of determination
    (R2) were selected by evaluating linear, quadratic, logarithmic, power and exponential
    relationships between all the tested spectral indices and plant parameters and
    two calculated indicators (stem failure moment and failure wind speed). For each
    parameter, the top five performing spectral indices with the highest R2 were listed
    along with the types of the best suitable models. In addition, MLR analyses were
    implemented to compare their predictive performance with the best-performing simple
    regression models. In addition to three spectral bands (R, RE and NIR) obtained
    with Crop Circle ACS-430 sensor, two management factors (planting density and
    N rate) and two weather variables (growing degree-days (GDD, °C) and accumulated
    precipitation (APP, mm)) were used for the MLR analyses. The APP was calculated
    as the sum of daily precipitation and the GDD was calculated as follows: GDD =
    ∑ [(Tmax + Tmin) / 2 – Tbase] where Tmax and Tmin represent the daily maximum
    and minimum temperature, respectively, while Tbase represents base temperature
    and was set to 10 °C. The APP and GDD were both calculated from the emergence
    date up to the sensing date for each year. Detailed information on all these variables
    is shown in Table 1. Table 1. The variables used for multiple linear regression
    analyses. Values of spectral bands are mean value of each year ± standard errors.

    methods (direct prediction using the developed regression models, and indirect
    prediction by inserting all the other predicted lodging parameters into the process-based
    lodging model) were used to predict the failure wind speed. The performance of
    the methods was assessed using R2, root mean square error (RMSE) and relative
    error (REr, %). Besides, schematic representations with color steps for the observed
    and best predicted failure wind speed and stem failure moment were plotted for
    the validation experimental plots in the field. Due to the lack of natural frequency
    data in 2017, the failure wind speed value was calculated and analyzed in the
    other two years. 3. Results 3.1. Changes in parameters associated with lodging,
    stem failure moment and failure wind speed with year, planting density and N rate
    All the parameters were affected by year, planting density and N rate at different
    levels (Table 2). The influence of year was evident, as most of the parameters
    measured in a given year were significantly different from measurements in other
    years. Taller and more stable plants accompanied with stronger stems were found
    in 2018, indicated by lower values of natural frequency and higher values of most
    of the remaining parameters compared with those in the other two years. More easily
    broken internodes with lower stem failure moment and thinner wall width were found
    in 2019. The values of natural frequency, height at the center of gravity and
    internode length of plants grown at the highest planting density of 10.0 plants
    m-2 were significantly different from those at other planting densities. The length
    of the internode increased, while the diameter, wall width, stem failure moment
    and failure wind speed decreased with the increase of planting density. All the
    parameters were influenced by N rate. The natural frequency decreased while the
    other parameters associated with lodging increased with N rates. Stem failure
    moment significantly increased with N rate up to 240 kg ha-1 while failure wind
    speed was relatively less affected by N rate. None of the parameters were significantly
    different between the two high N rate treatments (240 and 300 kg ha-1). Table

    most parameters, but the interaction of year x planting density x N rate was not
    significant, except for stem failure moment (Table 2). 3.2. Relationships among

    significant at different P levels. The correlation coefficient (r) values for
    the relations between natural frequency and the other parameters were all negative
    and represented by red colors. The three length-related parameters (plant height,
    height at center of gravity and internode length) were highly interrelated. Overall,
    the stem failure moment was most related to failure wind speed and was indicated
    by the darkest color, and strongly correlated with all the other parameters (r > 0.6).

    3). The relationships were relatively stronger for the whole plant-based parameters
    (natural frequency, plant height, and height at center of gravity), internode
    length, and a calculated lodging indicator (stem failure moment), with the R2
    values ranging from 0.67 to 0.84, while failure wind speed was less related to
    the spectral data (R2 = 0.34–0.46). Table 3. Simple regression model types and

    calculated by NIR and RE or NIR, RE and R bands except for an index related to
    failure wind speed (medium resolution imaging spectrometer, MERIS). Three-band
    indices appeared most frequently in all the relations, and played an important
    role in lodging risk indicator prediction (Table 3). Among these, the height at
    center of gravity was most related to spectral indices (R2 = 0.81–0.84). The best
    performing spectral indices varied with different lodging-related plant parameters
    or indicators. Among the tested indices, the ratio of the modified chlorophyll
    absorption in reflectance index 2 over the red edge optimal soil adjusted vegetation
    index (MCARI2/REOSAVI) had the most significant correlations with other parameters,
    followed by the modified transformed chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index
    (MTCARI), normalized difference index (NDI) and modified enhanced vegetation index
    (MEVI) (Table 3). 3.3.2. Performance of the MLR models The management factors
    (planting density and N rate) and weather variables (GDD and APP) as well as reflectance
    of the three spectral bands (R, RE and NIR) were integrated into MLR models. Within
    the four non-spectral factors, planting density had the highest impact on the
    MLR models, while the RE band data influenced the models the most among the three
    spectral variables (Table 4). Table 4. R2 values and the coefficients of all the

    models explained more variability of the lodging-related plant parameters and
    the two calculated indicators for the calibration dataset (R2 = 0.72–0.91) and
    achieved a better predictive power (R2 = 0.69–0.88), particularly for the parameters
    (internode diameter, wall width and stem failure moment) that were less successfully
    estimated using simple regression models (Table 4, Table 5). Only minor improvements
    were found for natural frequency, plant height, height at center of gravity and
    internode length, which could be well estimated using a single spectral index
    based on a simple regression function. However, great improvement in the prediction
    of failure wind speed was achieved. With the indirect method of inserting the
    estimated input parameters into the lodging model to predict lodging risk indicators,
    some insignificant improvement was achieved over the direct estimation method
    (Table 5). Table 5. Validation results for predicting lodging-related plant parameters,
    stem failure moment and failure wind speed using simple regression models based
    on the best performing spectral index from Table 3 and the MLR models based on
    raw spectral data, weather and crop management parameters. Failure wind speed
    – direct was predicted directly; Failure wind speed – indirect was indirectly
    predicted by inserting all the other predicted lodging-related input parameters
    into the lodging model. All R2 values were significant at P < 0.001 level. Parameters

    failure wind speed using indirect method than the direct method based on the MLR
    model, the predicted values were more deviated from the true values. However,
    the slope value was closer to 1 and the intercept value of the linear fitting
    equation was smaller using the direct method (Fig. 4B and C). The stem failure
    moment was better predicted using the MLR model than the failure wind speed. Besides
    the higher R2, the slope of the linear fitting equation was much closer to 1 and
    the linear trend line was very close to the 1:1 line (Fig. 4A). Download : Download

    early stage based on remote sensing technology, the maps of the calculated failure
    wind speed values in 2018 and 2019 and their MLR model-based predictions were
    drawn. Similar maps of the stem failure moment in 2017, 2018 and 2019 were also
    plotted. The values of the two indicators were both increased while the lodging
    risk was decreased as identified from red to green color. The variations of both
    failure wind speed and stem failure moment over the years were successfully predicted.
    Generally lower values of these indicators were observed in 2019 indicating higher
    lodging risks (predominantly red and yellow color on the maps), and evidently
    higher values were recorded in 2018 indicating lower lodging risks (predominantly
    green color on the maps) (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). Download : Download high-res image

    direct and indirect methods for the prediction of failure wind speed performed
    very similarly in 2018 with higher failure wind speed values, while more distinct
    differences using the two methods was found in 2019 with lower failure wind speed
    values. Although more values of failure wind speed were overestimated in 2018
    and underestimated in 2019 using MLR models, most of the predicted values were
    relatively close to the calculated values with very small differences (approximately
    62 % and 55 % were less than 0.5 m s-1 using direct and indirect method, and approximately
    83 % and 90 % were less than 1 m s-1 using direct and indirect method, respectively),
    which was confirmed by the approximate color gradations distributed in the maps
    (Fig. 5). Both failure wind speed and stem failure moment had similar risk rank
    distributions (similar color graduation on the maps), but some deviations appeared
    in high-risk plots (panels T1 and T2 in Fig. 5, and panels T2 and T3 in Fig. 6).
    Although more distinct variations in the color distributions displayed in experimental
    and predicted maps of stem failure moment compared with failure wind speed, the
    MLR model showed great predictive power in stem failure moment with small differences
    between most of the observed and predicted values (approximately 75 % values were
    less than 3 Nm and 93 % less than 5 Nm) (Fig. 6). 3.4. Variations of stem failure
    moment, failure wind speed and grain yield with the change of crop management
    factors Grain yield and stem failure moment all significantly increased with N
    rate, but failure wind speed was not affected significantly by N rate. The optimal
    grain yield and stem failure moment were obtained between 180 and 300 kg N ha-1,
    and the maximum values of stem failure moment were reached at 240 kg N ha-1 each
    year (Fig. 7A and B). Download : Download high-res image (319KB) Download : Download

    Different from the relationship with N rates, failure wind speed was significantly
    affected by planting densities. Negative relationships were found for the two
    lodging-related indicators with the increase of planting density in each year.
    The change in grain yield with the increase in planting density from 5.5 to 8.5
    plants m-2 was not evident as the two other displayed indicators, but notably
    more grains were harvested in the plots with the highest planting density (10.0
    plants m-2). For the three experimental years, distinctively stronger stalks resulted
    in a relatively lower lodging risk indicated by the higher failure wind speed
    and stem failure moment, which was most apparent in 2018, a year with the highest
    grain yield (Fig. 7). 4. Discussion 4.1. Early prediction of maize lodging risk
    using remote sensing The plant parameters associated with lodging and the calculated
    indicators to assess lodging risk (stem failure moment and failure wind speed)
    discussed in this study were all influenced by N rate to varying degrees (Table
    2), just like the typical N status indicators commonly evaluated using remote
    sensing. Previous studies indicated that lodging-related parameters were significantly
    correlated with LAI (or GAI) measured during the early growing season (Berry et
    al., 2019, Berry et al., 2021), which would be affected by N supplies and could
    be efficiently quantified using spectral indices (Heege et al., 2008, Samborski
    et al., 2009, Corti et al., 2018). The results of this study also indicated that
    multiple lodging related parameters and indicators were closely related to special
    indices at different significant levels (Fig. 3). Although the spectral data were
    collected at an early stage (V8) and was not synchronized with lodging measurements
    (R3), lodging indicators were still significantly related to sensing indices under
    different N supply conditions, indicating the potential of using crop canopy sensing
    data to predict lodging risk before side-dress N applications, so the predicted
    risk information can be used to make in-season N application decisions. Based
    on the close relationship between maize LAI at early growth stages and the lodging
    risk at later growth stage according to our previous study (Berry et al., 2021)
    and the potential of canopy reflectance sensing for crop growth status estimation
    including LAI, the current study thus explored and evaluated the possibility of
    using canopy reflectance sensing for lodging risk prediction. The performances
    of the spectral indices for predicting different parameters varied. Light in the
    NIR region is barely absorbed by plant pigments, as a result, reflectance in this
    region is high and significantly affected by LAI, and therefore, by plant biomass.
    While the other two wavebands showed stronger relationships with N rate, especially
    the RE band (Heege et al., 2008), with stronger influence on the prediction of
    lodging parameters (indicated by larger coefficients) than NIR and R wavebands
    (Table 4). Plant parameters more related to plant biomass, such as natural frequency,
    height at center of gravity and plant height, would be easier to be estimated
    by sensing indices and more accurately predicted (Table 3, Table 5). Besides,
    good validation results were also observed for internode length, partly because
    of its close relationship with the three parameters mentioned above, especially
    with height at center of gravity (Fig. 3 and Table 5). However, larger dependency
    on the change of external factors was mainly observed in the remaining internode
    parameters (internode diameter, wall width and stem failure moment) (Table 2).
    Additionally, due to the weaker sensitivity of reflectance signals to the plant
    internode characteristics, the prediction accuracies for these parameters were
    unsatisfactory. The failure wind speed was not sensitive to N rates and was not
    well predicted by the spectral index-based models (Table 2, Table 5 and Fig. 7A).
    More complex modeling methods should be tested to improve the predictions of the
    failure wind speed. It has been widely documented that multiple external factors
    such as weather and management practices would affect crop production in a complex
    way (Dobor et al., 2016, Parkes et al., 2017). Thus, eliminating or accounting
    for the impact of external disturbances on spectral signals is essential for the
    implementation of the sensors (Pinter et al., 2003, Samborski et al., 2009). The
    MLR approach is a promising and simple alternative with the advantage of data
    fusion and it has been widely used to predict crop yield responses to weather
    conditions (Lobell and Burke, 2010, Shi et al., 2013, Kern et al., 2018). The
    MLR models developed here performed better, and significantly improved the prediction
    of lodging related parameters and indicators (internode diameter, wall width,
    stem failure moment and failure wind speed) than the simple regression models
    (Table 5). The spectral indices based on three spectral bands generally outperformed
    two-band indices. However, the best performing indices varied with different lodging
    parameters (Table 3), which may complicate practical applications. Performances
    of the different vegetation indices for N status assessment have been discussed
    previously, but no consensus was reached (Li et al., 2014, Huang et al., 2017).
    It is worth mentioning that the five listed indices for each lodging indicator
    revealed very similar R2 values, and the indices like MCARI2/REOSAVI, MTCARI,
    NDI and MEVI appeared most frequently in the established simple regression models
    (Table 3). The MCARI2/REOSAVI ratio index was among the top performing VIs for
    6 lodging related parameters. The MCARI index was designed to minimize the influence
    of non-photosynthetic vegetation (e.g., bare soil) on the index and maximize its
    sensitivity to chlorophyll content changes (Daughtry et al., 2000). The MCARI2
    index was designed to improve the sensitivity of MCARI to vegetation changes in
    chlorophyll content, especially in areas with low to moderate levels of vegetation
    cover or with high levels of soil or non-vegetation background (Haboudane et al.,
    2004). The optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) was designed to further
    reduce the influence of soil background of the soil adjusted vegetation index
    (SAVI) (Huete, 1988, Rondeaux et al., 1996). The REOSAVI was modified from OSAVI
    by replacing the red band reflectance with red edge band. The combination of MCARI2/REOSAVI
    was expected to be more sensitive to vegetation chlorophyll content at low to
    moderate vegetation cover and further reduce the influence of soil background.
    Since at V8 the maize plants are still quite small with low canopy coverage, the
    soil background can have strong influence of canopy reflectance, so MCARI2/REOSAVI
    improved the estimation of plant lodging related parameters as compared with using
    MCARI2 or REOSAVI alone. Compared with lodging-related plant parameters, the prediction
    of failure wind speed at an early stage was more challenging with relatively low
    modeling accuracy (R2 = 0.42–0.74, RMSE = 0.54–0.80, REr = 5.29–7.88 %) (Table
    5). Lodging is the consequence of complex interactions among plant parameters
    (Baker et al., 1998) and multiple characteristics were necessary to calculate
    the lodging risk using a process-based lodging model (Berry et al., 2021). In
    this study, both direct and indirect methods were evaluated to predict the failure
    wind speed, but no marked difference was observed using the two methods. Although,
    compared with simple regression models, the accuracy of the estimates was increased
    using MLR models, the indirect method did not show a clear advantage over the
    direct method. It was challenging to explain the complex process of lodging using
    linear models. However, most of the predicted failure wind speed values were relatively
    close to the observed (calculated) values with very small differences (generally
    within 1 m s-1). Therefore, most of the predicted failure wind speed values were
    considered acceptable and can be used for early warning in the high-risk regions
    (Fig. 5). Compared with failure wind speed, the prediction of stem failure moment
    is easier. Even though the difference between the observed and predicted values
    of this indicator was higher than that of failure wind speed, it is worth noting
    that the stem failure moment values had a larger range of distribution, which
    led to larger deviations displayed in the schematic maps (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). 4.2.
    Lodging risk assessment and strategic decision-making Failure wind speed is a
    new indicator derived from the maize lodging model developed using the field experiments
    performed in UK and China including multiple crop management treatments. The accuracy
    of the estimated failure wind speed has been verified showing the potential of
    this indicator in agronomic decision making (Berry et al., 2021). Stem bending
    strength is an important variable related to stem lodging (Xu et al., 2018, Wang
    et al., 2020a, Sekhon et al., 2020). In this study, stem failure moment is another
    calculated indicator derived from stem breaking strength. It was well predicted
    even using the simple regression models. Stem failure moment and failure wind
    speed had similar performance in reflecting lodging risk and similar trends with
    planting density and year (Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). According to Berry et al.
    (2021), based on the sensitivity analysis, the failure wind speed was influenced
    more by the stem strength. And stem failure moment was more strongly correlated
    with all of the input characteristics of the maize lodging model (Fig. 3). Besides,
    due to the increase in stem failure moment being counteracted by a greater wind
    induced leverage (primarily caused by higher plant height due to increased N rate),
    it was found that N rate had a smaller effect on failure wind speed (Berry et
    al., 2021) and this was verified in this study (Fig. 7A). However, apparent changes
    of stem failure moment with N rate were observed for all the three years (Fig.
    7A). In these cases, the stem failure moment might be a good complementary indicator
    to assess maize stem lodging with failure wind speed, especially for N recommendation.
    Considering the influence of management practices (planting density and N rate)
    on failure wind speed and stem failure moment, it is necessary to take lodging
    risk into account when making tactical agronomic decisions. Although the difference
    in failure wind speed among the six N rates was small, the lowest lodging risk
    expressed by the highest failure wind speed was found for the plants receiving
    240 kg ha-1 in both experimental years. A reduction of stem failure moment was
    observed when N fertilizer amount increased to 300 kg ha-1 (Fig. 7A), confirming
    the previous finding that high N could result in decreased stalk strength and
    increased lodging rate (Xue et al., 2017). Considering the optimal grain yield
    and stem failure moment between 180 and 300 kg N ha-1 and the maximum values of
    stem failure moment at 240 kg N ha-1 each year, 240 kg ha-1 can be recommended
    as a rough estimate of total N rate in the study region. A moderate N rate (about
    1/3）can be applied before planting and the rest can be applied as side-dress N
    at V8–10 growth stages. The prediction of lodging risk based on the sensing information
    of maize plant at V8 growth stage would be significant for the side-dress N rate
    decision making. Future studies will be needed to develop a precision N fertilizer
    recommendation algorithm based on the predicted lodging risk as well as the consideration
    of crop yield and prices of N fertilizers and grain yield. High density maize
    plants tend to have longer but weaker internodes, and can easily collapse under
    low wind speed. Studies discussing planting density widely recognized that dense
    planting would have a negative impact on lodging resistance (Sangoi et al., 2002,
    Van Roekel and Coulter, 2011). Competing for resources like light, space and nutrients
    results in accelerating internode elongation and decreasing the duration of internode
    thickening, thus, the basal internodes are susceptible to bending by wind (Xue
    et al., 2016, Novacek et al., 2013). Different from the large changes affected
    by N rate, relatively smaller changes were found for stem failure moment under
    different planting densities (Fig. 7A and C). This is because stem failure moment
    was the product of stem breaking strength and internode length, which had an inverse
    trend with the change of planting density (Table 2). Nonetheless, stem failure
    moment values declined as the planting density increased, which was similar to
    the trend of failure wind speed. Considering the similar grain yield among different
    planting densities (except for the planting density of 10.0 plants m-2 in 2018
    and 2019) (Fig. 7D), the lowest planting density would be preferred to reduce
    the cost of seeds. However, a study focused on economic optimal N rate recommendation
    for maize grown in this area noted that the optimal N use efficiency was obtained
    at the planting density of 7.0 plants m-2, which is more beneficial to the environment
    (Wang et al., 2020b). Adjusting management practices in different years may be
    necessary according to the changing weather conditions. The stronger plants led
    to a noticeably lower lodging risk in 2018. The higher total precipitation and
    GDD from June to mid-July might be important reasons. Qiu et al. (2014) pointed
    out that sufficient precipitation increased potassium assimilation by roots, which
    led to enhanced resistance to lodging. Moreover, essential macronutrients (especially
    potassium) are mainly taken up during this period in the study area (Wu et al.,
    2019a). To achieve high yield potential a denser planting density (larger than
    7.0 plants m-2) might be considered under favorable weather conditions. The humid
    environment with frequent rainfall in the key growth period from flowering to
    grain filling (about 90–130 days after sowing on April 28th) contributed to the
    higher lodging risks in 2019, revealing the particular need to improve the stem
    strength by adopting more effective management practices. 4.3. Challenges and
    future research needs This study investigated the potential of using an active
    canopy reflectance sensor for early season maize stem lodging risk prediction.
    Basal internodes were particularly important for maize lodging according to previous
    field surveys. The occurrence of lodging at other internodes was also common,
    and lodging risks at the 5th and 8th internodes have been simulated by the lodging
    model (Berry et al., 2021). This research aimed to demonstrate the feasibility
    of using remote sensing technology for lodging risk assessment and provide a reference
    for further studies on stem lodging. Moreover, due to the need for increased planting
    density to meet the increasing food demand and the advances in breeding of maize
    varieties with shorter stems, root lodging is becoming increasingly important
    and should be further studied. Although failure wind speed is less sensitive to
    N rate, it is always the most useful indicator of lodging risk because it takes
    account of multiple leverage forces acting on the stem base, and can be valuable
    for making decisions about some management practices, such as variety selection
    and seeding rate. These decisions can be based on the lodging risk assessment
    in previous years with similar weather conditions (Remison and Akinleye, 1978;
    Sekhon et al., 2020). It is also known that potassium fertilizers and plant growth
    regulators can be used to reduce lodging risks during the growing season (Xu et
    al., 2017, 2018). Accurate maps that indicate variations of lodging risk in the
    field will be very valuable for guiding in-season site-specific management decisions,
    particularly for large fields. One limitation of the proximal sensing technology
    such as the active canopy sensor adopted in the current study is that it may not
    be efficient for large-area applications. The airborne and spaceborne platforms
    featuring optical sensors with multiple spectral bands, synthetic-aperture radar
    or microwave-based detectors with fine spatial resolution will lead to innovations
    in this domain. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing is also a promising
    technology for applications in small scale farming systems, like those in China.
    In addition, the sensor used in this current study only has three bands (R, RE
    and NIR), which may limit its capability for maize lodging risk prediction. More
    studies are needed to use hyperspectral sensing to identify sensitive spectral
    bands and VIs or develop new VIs specific for crop lodging risk prediction. Another
    limitation of this study is that it only focused on the V8 growth stage, although
    it is a key stage for in-season N management decisions. It will be interesting
    to explore and compare the predicting models only using the sensing data collected
    at one growth stage and those combining sensing data collected from more growth
    stages. The third limitation of this study is that only linear simple or multiple
    regression models were used. Machine learning models that can account for both
    linear and non—linear relationships with the advantage of multi-source data fusion
    should be adopted to further improve lodging risk prediction. The necessity of
    combining geographic and climate information with lodging risk maps for recommendations
    and management decisions has been pointed out by Chauhan et al. (2019). A decision
    support system to manage lodging risk, Crop Failure Assessment due to Lodging
    Losses (CROPFALL) framework, has been developed to produce a map of spatial lodging
    risk for wheat (Berry et al., 2019). A similar tool should also be developed for
    maize. 5. Conclusions In this study, an active canopy reflectance sensor was used
    to acquire maize canopy spectral reflectance data at the V8 stage to predict lodging
    risk based on a process-based lodging model at mid-filling stage for in-season
    decision making. It was found that the selected spectral indices were significantly
    related to different lodging-related plant characteristics and indicators. The
    predictions of lodging indicators were significantly improved using MLR models,
    with higher R2 (0.69–0.88) and lower RMSE (0.05–10.30) and REr (4.18–13.87 %)
    compared with simple regression models. Similar results were achieved either using
    regression models to predict the maize stem lodging indicators directly or indirectly
    using the regression models to predict lodging related plant parameters as inputs
    to a process-based lodging model to calculate lodging risk indicators, although
    the later approach using MLR models performed slightly better. A planting density
    of 7.0 plants m-2 and N rate of around 240 kg ha-1 would be suitable for the study
    region, but adjustments are needed for different weather conditions. It is concluded
    that maize stem lodging risks can be predicted using an active canopy sensor data
    together with weather and management information at V8 stage to guide in-season
    management decisions. More studies are needed to evaluate UAV and satellite remote
    sensing technologies as well as machine learning methods to improve the prediction
    of crop lodging risks for large scale applications. CRediT authorship contribution

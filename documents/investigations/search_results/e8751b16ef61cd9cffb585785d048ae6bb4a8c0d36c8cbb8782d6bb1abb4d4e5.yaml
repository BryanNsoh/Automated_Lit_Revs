    Abstract To sustain productive irrigated agriculture with limited water resources
    requires a high water use efficiency. This can be achieved by the precise scheduling
    of deficit irrigation systems taking into account the crops’ response to water
    stress at different stages of plant growth. Particularly in the light of climate
    change with rising population numbers and increasing water scarcity, an optimal
    solution for this task is of paramount importance. We solve the corresponding
    complex multidimensional and nonlinear optimization problem, i.e., finding the
    ideal schedule for maximum crop yield with a given water volume by a well tailored
    approach which offers straightforward application facilities. A global optimization
    technique allows, together with physically based modeling, for the risk assessment
    in yield reduction considering different sources of uncertainty (e.g., climate,
    soil conditions, and management). A new stochastic framework for decision support
    is developed which aims at optimal climate change adaption strategies in irrigation.
    It consists of: (1) a weather generator for simulating regional impacts of climate
    change; (2) a tailor-made evolutionary optimization algorithm for optimal irrigation
    scheduling with limited water supply; and (3) mechanistic models for rigorously
    simulating water transport and crop growth. The result, namely, stochastic crop-water
    production functions, allows to assess the impact of climate variability on potential
    yield and thus provides a valuable tool for estimating minimum water demands for
    irrigation in water resources planning and management, assisting furthermore in
    generating maps of yield uncertainty for specific crops and specific agricultural
    areas. The tool is successfully applied at an experimental site in southern France.
    The impacts of predicted climate variability on maize are discussed. Introduction
    Water scarcity, rapid population growth, and climate change adaption strategies
    imperatively require a more efficient and sustainable exploitation of water resources.
    In arid, and to some extent in semiarid climates, agriculture depends almost entirely
    on irrigation and, as populations grows, political and economic pressures are
    being exerted on agricultural water users to increase irrigation efficiency. Thus,
    a high crop-water use efficiency (WUE) is the prerequisite for a sustainable agricultural
    production with limited water resources. Automated soil and plant-based sensing
    scheduling methods are one option for reducing watering volumes for full irrigation
    systems and, at the same time, increase WUE. However, much greater sophistication
    is required if the objective is to improve the overall irrigation water use efficiency
    by applying a deficit irrigation strategy (DI) (Jones 2004). DI is an optimization
    strategy for adjusting irrigation to suit the drought-sensitive growth stages
    of a crop. Total irrigation application is therefore not proportional to crop-water
    requirements throughout the growing season. If DI results in plant water stress
    while crop yield is not significantly effected then water use efficiency is thus
    being maximized. Thus, in areas where water is the most limiting factor, maximizing
    WUE may be economically more profitable for the farmer than maximizing yields
    (English 1990). However, for maximizing overall irrigation water use efficiency,
    while at the same time meeting yield and harvest quality goals, multitudinous
    scenarios in which cropping systems, amounts, and the timing of irrigation applications
    must be run through and assessed. Experimentation alone cannot address all these
    scenarios, yet sound simulation models together with adequate optimization procedures
    will help to overcome the lack of data (Evett and Tolk 2009). On a larger scale,
    the objective of improved water use efficiency can only be achieved by tailor
    made integrated water resources management which increases food production for
    a growing population while simultaneously meeting the water quality and quantity
    requirements of other economic and environmental sectors. Therefore, planning
    tools for integrated water resources management need to incorporate the impacts
    of field, farm and system level improvements in water use efficiency by using
    DI at the basin scale. The information thus gained is essential for developing
    appropriate policies and supporting strategies to increase net basin level water
    use efficiency. For the planning tools in question, compact presentations of the
    relationship between irrigation practices and grain yield—like crop-water production
    functions (CWPF)—play an important role in policy analysis. This is because planning
    tools for decision making are able to employ the production functions as building
    blocks for the assessment of irrigation water management policies (Scheierling
    et al. 1997). CWPF’s for irrigated agricultural crops can also directly be derived
    from experiments and/or by simulation models whose parameters are normally obtained
    from direct observations and calibrations. However, experiments, such as with
    the operation for deficit irrigation systems are expensive and time consuming,
    and may not be readily generalizable beyond the local experimental conditions.
    Thus, as more precise crop growth models are available numerical simulation studies
    become a more feasible approach because numerical models can be readily adapted
    for specific soil and climatic conditions, and so provide a flexible and relatively
    inexpensive method of generating CWPF’s for varying local conditions (Letey 1993).
    For decades, the linear FAO-33 crop-water production model (Doorenbos and Kassam
    1979) or similar empirical models together with linear or dynamic programming
    techniques have been used to estimate seasonal CWPF’s for optimal irrigation planning
    under limited water supply (Bras and Cordova 1981; Rao et al. 1988; Sunantara
    and Ramirez 1997; Prasad et al. 2006). However, empirical models only provide
    reliable predictions within the boundaries of the experiments from which they
    are derived. This restricts their value for climate change impact assessment (Carter
    et al. 1994). In addition, during most of these studies decisions were made on
    a weekly basis, and this may be too coarse a resolution for deficit irrigation
    management. These shortcomings motivated FAO, among others, to develop a new,
    more mechanistic crop growth model (Steduto et al. 2009) which emphasizes the
    fundamental physiological processes involved in crop productivity. Notwithstanding
    the fact that the model developers achieved a better balance between accuracy,
    simplicity and robustness than most of the mechanistic crop growth models, [e.g.,
    DSSAT (Jones et al. 2003), DAISY (Abrahamsen and Hansen 2000), and APSIM (Keating
    et al. 2003)] the developed model can no longer comply with linear programming
    methods due to its nonlinearity, which in theory could be handled by dynamic programming
    (Bertsekas 2000) or nonlinear programming. However, dynamic programming methods
    for optimal irrigation scheduling in a daily time step together with more sophisticated
    crop growth models like DAISY are practically difficult to implement and computational
    requirements may become overwhelming because the number of state variables increases
    significantly in comparison to the classical approaches. When applying nonlinear
    programming using a simulation optimization strategy, a simulation model can be
    thought of as a function or it may be a binary executable (whose explicit form
    is a black box for the optimizer) that turns input parameters, (e.g., the irrigation
    schedule on a daily basis) into output performance measures, (e.g., WUE and/or
    yield) (Gosavi 2003). Thus, the simulation optimization approach combines any
    arbitrary simulation model with an optimization algorithm, breaking the restriction
    to the usage of simplified crop growth models. Optimal irrigation scheduling problems
    lead in general to either a high-dimensional nonlinear or a mixed integer optimization
    problem which are both difficult to solve, since the number of decision variables,
    (i.e., the number of irrigations) is a priori unknown. For this reason, recent
    studies employing more mechanistic crop growth models tend to simplify the optimization
    problem either by fixing the irrigation dates (Loganathan and Elango 2004; Shang
    and Mao 2006) or the irrigation intervals (Gorantiwar and Smout 2003; Brown et
    al. 2006). In addition, heuristic optimization algorithms such as the Nelder-Mead
    simplex method (Shang and Mao 2006) or simulated annealing (Brown et al. 2006)
    are employed which unfortunately tend to fail in practice when either: (1) local
    optimal solutions exist; or (2) when the number of decision variables becomes
    too large; or (3) unreasonable computation power and time using brute-force approaches
    are involved: (Raghuwanshi and Wallender 1997; Singh and Singh 1997; Scheierling
    et al. 1997; Shang et al. 2004). Furthermore, in a recent study, de Paly and Zell
    (2009) found that no general global evolutionary algorithm was able to find the
    global optimal schedule in reasonable computation time. For this reason, we proposed
    the new tailor-made evolutionary algorithm GET-OPTIS (Schmitz et al. 2007) which
    has been proven to be more reliable compared to heuristic and general evolutionary
    algorithms. While the simulation optimization study of Schmitz et al. (2007) focused
    on the optimal irrigation operation of deficit irrigation systems based on the
    FAO-33 crop-water production model, it disregards the influence of the stochastic
    properties of the relevant climatic factors, (e.g., precipitation and temperature)
    and of the soil properties; all of which limit its applicability as a planning
    tool for integrated water resources management. Many recent studies (Semenov 2007;
    Brumbelow and Georgakakos 2007a; Soltani and Hoogenboom 2007; Gonzalez-Camacho
    et al. 2008; Garcia y Garcia et al. 2008; Tao et al. 2008, among others) try to
    analyze the possible impacts of climate variability and climate change on agriculture
    via mechanistic crop growth models and weather generators. Most of the published
    work deals with rain fed or nonirrigated sites or assume a full irrigation management.
    Only Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007a) focus on deficit irrigation systems and
    the impact of climate variability on CWPF. Unfortunately, they derived probability
    distributions of crop-water production functions (CWPF-PDs) based on very small
    samples (sample sizes of CWPF between 10 and 20) using simulation data from climate
    change scenarios of Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) adapted by
    temporal and spatial downscaling methods. The small sample size is critical regarding
    the stochastic stability of the estimated 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 quantiles. Moreover,
    the quantiles of interest when dealing, e.g., with integrated water resource management
    and food security are quantiles above 0.75 which require a much larger sample
    size. Furthermore, Brumbelow and Georgakakos (2007b) employed their yield-irrigation
    gradient algorithm for generating the CWPF-PD which, however, was seen to be unreliable
    for determining global optimal schedules in deficit irrigation. For all the above
    reasons, it is the first objective of this study to demonstrate how state-of-the-art
    crop growth models can be combined with complementary and most efficient optimal
    scheduling algorithms for generating reliable CWPFs which, then, represent the
    considered deficit irrigation systems. The second objective of this study is to
    set up and apply a general framework for evaluating both potential yield and water
    demand under full consideration of the corresponding probabilities as a consequence
    of climate variabilities. The derived stochastic crop-water production functions
    (SCWPF), which are based on a statistically appropriate sample size will be able
    to serve as a building block for integrated water resources planning and climate
    change adaption. For evaluating the new approach, a case study using an irrigation
    experiment under real climate conditions in a Mediterranean region in France (Montpellier)
    is presented and SCWPF for maize are generated and discussed. Construction of
    Stochastic Crop-Water Production Functions In the following, we present a methodology
    which allows to quantify the impact of climatic variability on CWPF by a two-dimensional
    probability distribution which is referred to as stochastic CWPF (SCWPF). Stochastic
    Framework Generally, two components are necessary to generate reliable simulation-based
    CWPFs (see Fig. 1, Loop 1): an irrigation scheduling optimizer and a simulator
    of plant growth and water transport. The objective of the innermost iteration
    loop is to maximize the yield for a specific climate scenario and a given amount
    of water V 0 for irrigation during the growing season. With the second loop, which
    iterates over a range of V 0 , a complete CWPF can be constructed. The generated
    CWPF represents the maximum yields which can be achieved with a given amount of
    water and is referred to as the potential CWPF. Fig. 1. OCCASION framework for
    generation of stochastic crop-water production functions (SCWPF) In the third
    loop, a sufficient amount of CWPFs is generated in order to accurately compute
    the statistical characteristics of the random sample of CWPFs in a nonparametrical
    way, i.e., the resulting SCWPF is an empirical probability function. The weather
    generator can be interpreted as a Monte Carlo sampler for providing site specific
    weather series with a desired number of scenarios. This, however, requires a rapid
    computation of the simulation model and an irrigation scheduling optimizer which
    is extremely efficient and effective in finding the global maximal yield for generating
    a SCWPF within acceptable computation time. Optimal Irrigation Scheduling with
    a New Evolutionary Technique For the optimal operation of both irrigation control
    and irrigation scheduling over a whole growing season we employ the robust and
    efficient simultaneous optimization strategy GAIN-P which combines genetic algorithms,
    artificial intelligence techniques and rigorous process modeling (Schmitz et al.
    2007). Formulation of the Scheduling Optimization Problem The objective of optimal
    irrigation scheduling is to achieve maximum crop yield Y with a given, but limited,
    water volume V 0 , which is to be distributed throughout the growing season, where
    the quantity of each irrigation is to be determined. The impact of an irrigation
    schedule on the crop yield is calculated by DAISY SVAT-model (Abrahamsen and Hansen
    2000). The global optimization problem is ∊∊ Y ∗ = max Y ( S ) : S = { s i } i
    = 1 … n = { ( d 1 , v 1 ) , … , ( d i , v i ) , … , ( d n , v n ) } n , d i ∊
    N ; v i ∊ R (1) with the optimal solution for maximizing the yield Y S ∗ = arg
    max Y ( S ) = arg max Y ( { ( d i , v i ) } ) i = 1 ⋯ n (2) where S = schedule
    for the whole growing season, consisting of i = 1 ⋯ n irrigations each defined
    by the date d i and the irrigation depth v i . The scheduling optimization problem
    solver [Eq. (1)] maximizes the yield Y of the plant with respect to n irrigations,
    with control parameters optimized for each of the irrigation events. Eq. (1) has
    the specific feature that the number of optimization variables, i.e., the number
    n of irrigation events s -is a priori unknown. Solving the Optimization Problem
    with GET-OPTIS The Global Evolutionary Technique for OPTimal Irrigation Scheduling
    (GET-OPTIS) computation starts with a set of solutions called population, which
    is, in our case, a random set of schedules. Every member of the set has a fitness
    value assigned to it which is directly related to the objective function—its crop
    yield. In sequential steps, the population of schedules is modified by applying
    four steps: selection, crossover, mutation and reconstruction. The structure of
    the evolutionary algorithm is shown in Fig.2, but details of the algorithm are
    presented in Schmitz et al. (2007). The main features are as follows: Fig. 2.
    Main Loop of GET-OPTIS [for details see Schmitz et al. 2007]. A population X n
    gen is a set of n gen individuals, i.e., irrigation schedules S . Each irrigation
    schedule consists of a group of two-tuples s i = ( d i , V i ) , where each tuple
    contains the parameters of an individual irrigation event. The entire group X
    , i.e., all those individuals which are created during the optimization can be
    formed by bringing together all the individuals of every generation X = { X n
    } n = 1 ⋯ n max = { { S j } j = 1 ⋯ n gen n } n = 1 ⋯ n max = { { { ( d i , V
    i ) } i = 1 ⋯ n j j } j = 1 ⋯ n gen n } n 1 n (3) The convergence and outcome
    of GET-OPTIS are determined by the following parameters: The maximum number of
    evolution loops n max , the stopping criteria, the mutation rate for irrigation
    dates and volumes, the take over probability and the crossover probability. A
    set of best schedules will be included in the next generation in their unchanged
    form, employing an elitism-procedure to tournament selection. In tournament selection
    each individual has one “go” at participating in the tournament, iterating through
    the whole set of individuals. The other competitor is chosen randomly. If the
    set individual wins then it is retained in the set of best schedules and proceeds
    unchanged to the next generation. GET-OPTIS is set up as a problem specific optimization
    tool. Thus, its structure deviates in some relevant aspects from the standard
    operators of evolutionary algorithms—selection, crossover, and mutation • The
    deviations include a change of the order in which the individual operators are
    activated. During each generation step, the selection is the first operation to
    be carried out instead of being carried out at the end. • An additional reconstruction
    step rebuilds the created children in order to guarantee feasible solutions which
    are in compliance with the constraints. For this step, we exploit the available
    knowledge on irrigation scheduling, e.g., that irrigation just before the plant
    needs the water that is more profitable for the crop development than later. •
    GET-OPTIS iterates until a certain desired degree of convergence is attained.
    Evolutionary algorithms usually require many function evaluations for convergence
    (high CPU time) because they do not use the derivative information from the objective
    function. In contrast to the common evolutionary algorithms, the presented GET-OPTIS
    reduces the computational effort by restricting the selection of the individuals
    which would have to be evaluated by simulations to feasible solutions. In addition,
    the overall elapsed time of one optimization run can be reduced because the algorithm
    is set up for extensive parallel processing. Stochastic Weather Generator LARS-WG
    LARS-WG is a stochastic weather generator based on the series approach with a
    detailed description given in Semenov et al. (1998). LARS-WG produces synthetic
    daily time series of maximum and minimum temperature, precipitation and solar
    radiation. The weather generator uses observed daily weather data for a given
    site to determine a set of parameters for probability distributions of weather
    variables as well as correlations between them. On this basis, this set of parameters
    is used to generate synthetic weather time series of arbitrary length by randomly
    selecting values from the appropriate distributions. The use of semiempirical
    distributions provides the generator with the flexibility to construct climate
    change scenarios on the basis of global climate model (GCM) projections in two
    steps (Semenov 2007). In a first step, parameters representing the baseline climate
    will be computed with the historical data available for a specific site for LARS-WG.
    Subsequently, the GCM predicted changes in the mean and variability of climate
    variables are taken into account by adjusting the LARS-WG parameter sets for generating
    daily site-specific weather which is consistent with the GCM predictions. Mechanistic
    Irrigation Model DAISY DAISY is a one-dimensional (1D) Soil-Vegetation-Atmosphere
    Transfer (SVAT) model which simulates crop production and crop yield as well as
    water and nitrogen dynamics in agricultural soils. For this information on management
    practices and weather data (daily values) are used: for details see Abrahamsen
    and Hansen (2000). The water balance model comprises a surface water balance and
    a soil water balance. The soil water balance includes water flow in the soil matrix
    as well as in macropores. Furthermore, it includes water uptake by plants and
    drainage to pipe drain. The heat balance model simulates soil temperature along
    with freezing and thawing in the soil. The solute balance model simulates transport,
    sorption and transformation processes. Special emphasis is placed on nitrogen
    dynamics in agroecosystems. Mineralization-immobilization, nitrification and denitrification,
    sorption of ammonium, uptake of nitrate and ammonium, and leaching of nitrate
    and ammonium are simulated. Degradation, sorption, uptake and transport of agrochemicals
    like pesticides are likewise simulated. The crop production model simulates plant
    growth and development, including the accumulation of dry matter and nitrogen
    in different plant parts. Furthermore, the development of leaf area index and
    the distribution of root density are simulated and the agricultural management
    model allows for building complex management scenarios. The DAISY crop library
    contains the parameterizations of a number of different crops (maize, wheat, etc.)
    whose parameters may be calibrated on experimental data sets. Application of OCCASION
    for Evaluating SCWPF To illustrate the potential use of the proposed stochastic
    framework, we analyzed the impacts of predicted climate variability on maize grown
    and irrigated at the experimental field site in France: Lavalette, Montpellier.
    To achieve this task we used historical data and a selected high emission global
    climate change scenario for 2080 published by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) (2001) (labeled as 2080HI). Description of the Experimental Site
    This study is based on a field experiments with maize (Pioneer variety) which
    were carried out at the CEMAGREF institute of Montpellier, France ( 43 ° 4 0 ′
    N , 3 ° 5 0 ′ E , and altitude 30 m) with a Mediterranean climate of 750-mm average
    annual rainfall on a loamy soil (18% clay, 47% silt, and 35% sand). The maize
    was grown on a plot of 1.7 ha. Field experiments have been conducted here throughout
    the past 10 years (1997, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2005, and 2007). For a given
    year, the crop was generally subjected to different irrigation treatments, generally
    including always at least one full irrigated and one rainfed treatment (for details
    see Khaledian et al. 2009). Construction of the Climate Scenarios Using LARS-WG
    Observed daily weather data recorded over 17 years (1991–2007) by the Lavalette
    climate station were used to set up the weather generator. The synthetic weather
    data need to conform to the distributions estimated from the observed data. For
    this reason, synthetic data have to undergo a variety of statistical tests, such
    as the t -test and F -test for means and variances of weather variables, i.e.,
    minimum and maximum temperature, rainfall as well as solar radiation. The used
    climate change scenario 2080HI is based on a climate modeling experiment completed
    by the Hadley Centre, using HadCM3. The scenario is based on the SRES A2 global
    emission scenario for the time period 2080 published by Intergovernmental Panel
    on Climate Change (IPCC) (2001). The trends for monthly mean variables, such as
    monthly precipitation, monthly mean minimum and maximum temperature and monthly
    mean radiation are taken directly from the LARS-WG scenario database (see Table
    1). Data from the regional climate model HadRM3 were used in this study for deriving
    monthly mean values of dry/wet spells. HadRM3 is driven indirectly from the HadCM3
    simulations and has been developed to provide spatially detailed scenarios over
    Europe. The daily precipitation output series for the grid-cell where Montpellier
    is located were taken from the PRUDENCE project site (data downloaded from the
    PRUDENCE OpenDAP server, http://prudence.dmi.dk) and monthly mean variables, such
    as the relative change in a mean duration of dry and wet spells (see Table 1)
    were calculated. The resulting LARS-WG scenario file is internally used to adjust
    baseline parameters of LARS-WG for the Montpellier site and the 2080HI climate
    change scenario. Altogether, 500 realizations of daily weather over a year were
    generated for both the baseline parameters and the adjusted parameters for the
    2080HI scenario. Subsets of both synthetic weather data which cover the growing
    period from May 1 to October 13 were then selected for simulation optimization
    runs of the DAISY crop model. Table 1. LARS-WG Scenario File for Montpellier,

    Model The setup of the DAISY model is based on soil data taken from the CEMAGREF
    experimental site Lavalette in Montpellier, France. The soil-profile of the plot
    is subdivided into three layers. Soil hydraulic characteristics were determined
    by inverse methods applied to measurements of capillary tension and moisture content
    of the soil (Wöhling and Mailhol 2007). For this study, we used maize (variety
    Pioneer) from the DAISY library of crops which were validated and tested in many
    environments (Abrahamsen and Hansen 2000) as an initial parametrization. In addition,
    we conducted a site-specific calibration of the crop growth parameters based on
    full and deficit irrigation experiments with Pioneer maize in 2007. The calibration
    involved an estimation of the model parameters from measured field data (yield,
    LAI, and water balance) using an automatic calibration procedure. Optimal fertilization
    was assumed because the investigation focused solely on the water stress related
    problems. The data for our exemplary application involved a sowing on May 26 with
    a zero initial water deficit which was the case in the field experiments in 1999
    (Khaledian et al. 2009). The irrigation schedule was provided by the optimization
    algorithm GET-OPTIS. According to the data of the field experiment, a constant
    flow rate of 5 mm/h was employed during the irrigation events which implies a
    mean application efficiency of over 90%. Monte Carlo Simulation-Optimization for
    Computing SCWPF The synthetic weather data, in combination with the configured
    DAISY model and the GET-OPTIS algorithm, can be used to generate distributions
    of potential crop yields resulting from climate variability and optimal irrigation
    scheduling. The optimization runs were distributed among the nodes of a PC-Cluster
    featuring 764 nodes. The computations were completed within 12 h. Subsequently,
    we analyzed the resulting SCWPF with descriptive statistical methods, i.e., we
    calculated (0.5, 1, 10, 50, 90, 99, and 99.5) percentiles, the median and statistical
    moments of a sample of 500 and thus achieved comprehensive information about the
    potential yield for each amount of water V 0 . Results: Risk Analysis on the Basis
    of the Generated SCWPF Basic Scenario without Rainfall The CWPFs, which were generated
    by the simulation optimization runs with GET-OPTIS, are presented in Fig. 3(a).
    Generally, it can be concluded from both scenarios that the GET-OPTIS algorithm
    is able to maximize expected yield and to reduce the variability of potential
    yield if considerably less water is available than the plant would normally fully
    require. The variation in maize yield spreads over an amount up to 3 t/ha and
    even augments dramatically with an increasing amount of water particularly if
    more than 300 mm is applied. This upper range of the SCWPF appears to be the most
    interesting section mainly because 1. The impact of the climate variability on
    potential yield is significant; indicating that the variability of global radiation
    is mainly responsible for yield variations under no-rain conditions. This can
    also be explained by the fact that the distribution of yield is almost normally
    distributed at full irrigation [see Fig. 3(d)]. 2. The results of the DAISY irrigation
    model are reasonable for “light” deficit conditions. In contrast, the maize crop
    simulated by the DAISY model shows an unreasonable behavior (performs poorly)
    when no or too little water is applied by irrigation. In this case, the crop reduces
    its photosynthesis yet shows no irreversible damage caused by drought stress and
    it immediately reverts back to full transpiration under normal no-stress conditions.
    3. For optimal deficit irrigation management, only the upper section of the SCWPF-function
    is of interest because the water use efficiency, i.e., the slope of the function,
    starts to decrease in this range. Thus, the greatest water saving potential can
    be found in this domain. Fig. 3. Results for maize grown at Lavalette site (Montpellier,
    France): (a) generated CWPF’s (500 samples); (b) SCWPF based on 500 samples; (c)
    stability analysis for V 0 = 500 mm ; and (d) histogram for V 0 = 500 mm From
    Fig. 3(c), it can be seen that the percentiles of yield converge with a sample
    size of 300. This suggests that samples containing 500 synthetic weather scenarios
    are sufficient for estimating empirical percentiles of the yield distribution
    with the required precision. This is also supported by the results of Lawless
    and Semenov (2006), who investigated the impact of climate variability on wheat
    for different sites in Europe and New Zealand. Fig. 3(a) also reveals that GET-OPTIS
    is able to find global solutions for the scheduling optimization problem due to
    the fact that all the generated CWPFs have a consistent shape, i.e., a monotonous
    increase in yield which implies the convergence behavior shown in Fig. 3(c). This
    demonstrates that OCCASION is capable of generating reliable SCWPFs and can unconditionally
    be used to forecast the impact of climate variability on potential yield for both
    historical and future climate scenarios. Adding the Variability of Rainfall The
    impact of rainfall variability changes the picture rapidly, as displayed in Fig.
    4 Without irrigation, the variability of rainfall dominates the variability in
    yield. Under this condition, the span of yield ranges from 0.5 to 7 t/ha. When
    irrigation is augmented, global radiation becomes more and more important up to
    the point where it almost entirely dominates the variability of yield. A comparison
    of the resulting quantiles of potential yield for the rain and the no-rain scenarios
    shown in Figs. 3(b) and 4, respectively, reveals a slight decrease in the percentile
    values. This is due to a small remaining impact of rainfall variability which
    cannot be compensated by the supplemental irrigation by the GET-OPTIS algorithm.
    Fig. 4. CWPF samples and quantiles of the empirical probability distributions
    under rainy conditions Impact of a Current High-Emission Climate Change Scenario
    For the 2080HI scenario, a significant reduction in potential yield for both rain
    and no-rain conditions can be observed (see Fig. 5). Compared to Fig. 4 the span
    of yield under rain, but no irrigation, conditions remains between 0 and 5.5 t/ha.
    On the other hand, under mixed rainfed-optimal irrigation conditions, the achieved
    average yield is around 2t/ha lower than in the baseline climate (see Fig. 4).
    The main reason is the greater impact of an increased mean temperature on plant
    growth. In the case of temperature increase, maize can harvested up to two weeks
    earlier for the 2080HI scenario compared with the baseline climate. Thus, the
    duration of the grain filling stage is shortened, resulting in a reduced lower
    amount of radiation received by the maize plant which, however, cannot be compensated
    by a higher CO 2 concentration (as predicted under the 2080HI scenario). As a
    general result, maize yield decreases with global warming in the considered scenario
    which is representative for a Mediterranean region, (i.e., the lowland around
    Montpellier, France). Fig. 5. CWPF samples and quantiles of the empirical probability
    distributions under rainy conditions in the 2080HI scenario More detailed results
    of the impact of climate variability under water-limited and full irrigated conditions
    can be seen in Figs. 6 and 7 as well as in Tables 2 and 3. Comparing the statistical
    moments of potential yield of both the baseline and the 2080HI data set, Table
    2 reveals three significant ranges of parameter behavior: (1) with no or low irrigation
    amounts the empirical distribution of potential yield is pronounced right-skewed
    which shows the significant impact of rainfall variability. This becomes even
    clearer with the results of the 2080HI scenario, where the skewness coefficient
    of potential yield is much higher compared to the baseline scenario due to a higher
    probability of dry conditions. (2) Between irrigation amounts of 60–210 mm the
    highest variance in potential yield can be observed because of the superposition
    of the impact of rainfall and radiation variability. There is also a remarkable
    change in the type of distribution from a skewed to a symmetric, normally distributed
    one. (3) In the upper section of the SCWPF, the statistical parameters are relatively
    stable, showing a small trend to a left skewed distribution. This supports the
    assumption that crop-water use efficiency is at a maximum with about 310 mm of
    water and that it decreases subsequently. Fig. 6. Histograms of distributions
    of current potential yield (light gray) and 2080HI (black). Bars of the baseline
    scenarios are transparent. Thus, dark gray bars feature in both histograms. Fig.

    interpolation of the water demands for specific yields (horizontal sections).
    In contrast to the statistical analysis of potential yield, variances in the water
    demands of maize increase with the potential yield. In addition, for low and high
    yields some of the scenarios are not in the considered range of values of water
    demand because (1) water demand is zero [rainfall is sufficient for obtaining
    the fixed (low) yields] or (2) fixed (high) yields could not be achieved because
    relative low temperatures and radiation limit crop development for the considered
    climate scenario. Comparing the quantities n Base and n 2080 HI together with
    average water application for a potential yield of 10t, it becomes clear that
    for the 2080HI a disproportional increase in water demand is necessary for ensuring
    the same level of today’s crop production. Discussion The successful application
    of OCCASION for the estimation of the impacts from climate variability on potential
    yield has to consider the following preconditions: (1) potential yield is the
    highest possible yield obtainable with ideal management (provided by the scheduling
    algorithm GET-OPTIS); (2) satisfactory information on weather and soil is available;
    (3) the assumption of stationarity is valid for the two climate scenarios; and
    (4) the used DAISY model is well adapted to the considered SVAT-system. Although
    these assumptions are relatively strict, the derived SCWPF’s—which are shown to
    be a precise estimation of maximum possible yields, water demands, and corresponding
    risks under climate variability—are of great value for estimating the maximum
    possible productivity and minimum vulnerability of a considered agroecological
    region. The generation of a SCWPF requires considerable computational effort.
    However, the proposed strategy for an application in water resources planning
    is to perform by far the majority of the computational effort during a first preparatory
    phase. During this phase a comprehensive database is established which contains
    the full range of SCWPF’s, representing all the relevant combinations of crops,
    soils and climate scenarios (growing seasons and/or climate change scenarios)
    for a considered region or basin. On this basis, it becomes possible to quickly
    access to potential yield or water demand data including the corresponding probabilities.
    Optimization techniques such as stochastic dynamic programming which are frequently
    employed for irrigation planning would benefit enormously from fast responses
    to questions of the SCWPF type, e.g., “What is the irrigation water demand necessary
    to meet or exceed a certain production level with a certain probability?” or “What
    crop production can be exceeded with a given probability providing a fixed water
    volume for irrigation?” Thus, an optimization strategy based on a SCWPF database
    can work in real-time and has many fields of application for decision making with
    respect to climate uncertainty at different planning levels and different spatial
    scales. The use of SCWPF on field scale within a risk-based economic analysis
    to aid farm input investment and seasonal management decisions can therefore be
    undertaken on the basis of a once-only generation of relevant SCWPF’s and the
    regular incorporation of input and output prices. When comprehensive cropping
    systems simulators like DAISY and APSIM are used for an extended farm management
    it is relatively easy to incorporate additional dimensions of the inputs, such
    as fertilizer demand and water quality into the SCWPF. The increased number of
    dimensions of the SCWPF may require a more efficient sampling technique for the
    Monte Carlo simulations such as importance sampling (Botev and Kroese 2008) and
    a nonlinear mapping of SCWPF with machine learning techniques, e.g., a self-organizing
    map architecture with multiple input/output option (Schütze et al. 2005). Nevertheless,
    the method remains valid and operational. The same questions relevant at farm
    level are equally relevant at policy level. Moreover, an appropriate database
    of SCWPF’s can help to evaluate and assess management, mitigation and adaption
    measures for ensuring food security through an analysis of multiple irrigation
    sites in a considered basin (shown by Brumbelow and Georgakakos 2007a). Another
    potential application of SCWPF as a building block for estimating water demand
    is with the process of the design and operation of large multiquality irrigation
    water supply systems. In arid countries, for example, these often have to consider
    interrelations between irrigation water salinity, leaching requirements, and yield
    levels (Sinai et al. 2009). As the used crop model includes water and matter transport,
    a second type of SCWPF building block can simultaneously be used to estimate e.g.,
    the contamination risk (nutrients and salt) of surface and subsurface water reservoirs
    in the vicinity of specific irrigation sites. The latter building block is a kind
    of stochastic damage function, and is it suitable for multicriteria decision making
    for long-term, sustainable water resources management at a larger scale. Last
    but not least, in a socioeconomic context, a database of SCWPF’s can be employed
    to evaluate water pricing policies if input and output prices are incorporated
    and shadow prices are derived from the individual CWPF’s (Bontemps and Couture
    2002). Summary and Conclusions In this paper, OCCASION is presented: a new planning
    tool for Optimal Climate Change Adaption Strategies consisting of an innovative
    stochastic framework for predicting site-specific SCWPF. OCCASION allows for the
    assessment of the impacts of climate variability on potential yield using process-based
    models, a weather generator on the basis of IPCC scenarios and novel, problem
    specific, global optimization techniques. The SCWPF for maize grown in France
    (Montpellier) was calculated and statistically analyzed. We demonstrated that
    there is a large variation in crop yield for maize which can be explained by the
    variation of global radiation as no further uncertainties due to suboptimal scheduling
    are relevant. We could also show that GET-OPTIS provides consistent CWPFs using
    any reliable irrigation model suitable for the task on hand. The introduced tailor-made
    scheduling optimization algorithm GET-OPTIS is the key tool of OCCASION: it possesses
    some unique features which, in a reliable and computationally efficient manner,
    allow the generation of optimal schedules for given irrigation amounts of water.
    The statistical analysis of a generated CWPF shows that for a reliable estimation
    of higher quantiles (above 0.9) a considerable number of scenario calculations
    are required ( > 300 in this study) and, therefore, an efficient calculation of
    CWPF’s is a precondition for the derivation of SCWPF’s in practice. Thus, as attested
    by the above results of an application in irrigation practice, the GET-OPTIS algorithm
    provides the basis for OCCASION as an efficient planning tool. The resulting SCWPF
    offers a relatively simple and straightforward application and is of great benefit
    for long-term irrigation planning. It is capable of evaluating of the efficiency
    of water resources management strategies in irrigated agriculture under future
    climate conditions. At present, interfaces to APSIM and DAISY crop growth models
    as well as the FAO-33 yield response model are implemented. Within the OCCASION
    framework, further investigations aim to focus on optimal fertilizer application
    and the consideration of water quality and soil variability. Notation The following

    The growing scarcity of freshwater is one of the main challenges to food security
    and sustainability, where agriculture annually consumes the most water [1]. For
    this purpose, precision agriculture (PA) has achieved significant progress in
    water management and crop production using technological advances in software
    and hardware [2]. Precision irrigation (PI) is the sustainable management of water
    resources, which involves the application of water to the crop to meet specific
    plant water demands in space and time, while avoiding excessive or insufficient
    irrigation and minimizing adverse environmental impacts [3]. In PA, the Variable
    Rate Application (VRA) is the assignment of agricultural inputs in a site-specific
    manner. The correct application of the variable rate needs the specific plant
    requirements, the precise position and the characteristics of the environment
    where the input will be applied. There are two strategies for VRA: Map-based and
    sensor-based. In Map-Based VRA, the prescription map is generated and loaded into
    a computer inside the machinery before it performs its activities on the field
    [4]. Sensor-Based VRA is the technology that integrates sensors for automatically
    detecting the value of specific parameters in the plants or the soil in real-time
    and for deciding which kind and quantity of agricultural input should be applied
    [5]. VRA technologies apply water, fertilizer, herbicide and other chemicals for
    weeds and disease control and seed selection in sowing [6]. The purpose of those
    technologies is to save water, fertilizers and chemicals, increase potential yields
    and the protection of the environment [7]. The variable rate irrigation (VRI)
    technology provides the ability to site-specifically apply water in the field
    to achieve potential water savings [8]; this enables the incorporation of water
    in the soil according to the temporal and spatial soil characteristics and plant
    demand at different growth stages [9]. The VRI technology aims to apply the right
    amount of water at the right time, in the right place of the field, reducing water
    waste and improving water use efficiency (WUE), which is the ratio between biomass
    produced to the rate of transpiration [10], [6]. The effectiveness of VRI depends
    on the delineation of management zones, irrigation infrastructure, crop type,
    weather conditions and field properties such as topography, soil texture and soil
    water retention curves; that influence soil water content and crop irrigation
    prescriptions [11]. Therefore, understanding these factors can provide a basis
    to achieve improvements in crop water productivity and the environment [12]. In
    VRI, water requirements are applied at different rates to appropriately match
    field variability using individual management zones and their real needs instead
    of a homogeneous input application on the field [13]. A management zone is a field
    area with similar attributes in soil and topography. According to the definition
    of management zones, several parameters are considered as crop and soil properties,
    sensor-based information, field attributes, management practices and yield maps
    [14]. The information about irrigation prescriptions in the management zones is
    linked with automatic site-specific irrigation systems using dynamic prescription
    maps [15]. However, these maps can be challenging because the spatiotemporal variations
    on a field are affected by biotic factors such as plant diseases and pest infestation,
    and abiotic factors such as water stress, cold, drought, soil and water salinity
    [16]. The development process for an irrigation prescription map aims to fill
    the spatially variable soil–water profile and use software available with VRI
    hardware, yield, elevation or electrical conductivity maps through precision agriculture
    software or soil–water balance approaches from satellite imagery or wireless sensor
    networks [17]. Additionally, these maps use soil water measurements, soil water
    balance calculations or plant stress-based methods for defining irrigation amounts
    and timing. Volumetric water content (VWC) sensors, soil water profile measurements
    by a neutron probe and soil matric potential (SMP) sensors are the most used technologies
    for irrigation scheduling based on soil water measurements [18]. The magnitude
    of soil water content (SWC) varies with time and location, but the pattern of
    spatial variability usually remains similar [19]. Scheduling using soil water
    balance allows estimating soil–water depletion with good performance through the
    reference evapotranspiration multiplied by the corresponding crop coefficient
    [20]. In addition, process-based and statistical/machine-learning models can determine
    irrigation amounts using soil water balance [21]. These models consider factors
    like data availability, scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model
    uncertainties and constraints, and participation and motivation of producers [22].
    Some plant-based irrigation scheduling strategies use dendrometers [23], sap flow
    sensors [24] or canopy temperature measurements [25], among others. Canopy temperature
    is used for irrigation management because it indirectly indicates plant water
    stress through canopy energy balance. Water stress arises when the quantity of
    water in plant leaves restricts photosynthesis and respiration. In water-stressed
    conditions, transpiration decreases, causing more energy to be converted to sensible
    heat at the canopy surface compared to non-water-stressed conditions. It causes
    plant canopy temperatures to rise above what would occur without water shortages
    [22]. Remote and proximal sensing technologies such as infrared sensors (IRT)
    and near-infrared and thermal imaging measure canopy temperatures. With canopy
    temperature and weather data, it is possible to provide information about environmental,
    soil and crop conditions for VRI and the development of dynamic irrigation prescription
    maps [26]. Canopy temperature can be measured using radiometers filtered to the
    thermal infrared wavelengths , making them non-contact infrared thermometers.
    These devices can measure an area ranging from a few to several according to the
    platform, typically categorized as ground-based, aircraft, or satellite. Ground-based
    platforms can be stationary or moving, with sensors handheld, portable, or on
    moving machinery like center pivots. Moving platforms offer more spatial coverage
    with fewer sensors but trade-off frequency, usually measuring at a single time
    of day at many locations, while stationary devices provide continuous measurements
    at one field location [27]. Satellite remote sensing includes constraints associated
    with the spatial and temporal resolution and the cost and durability of sensors
    and associated components required for wireless data transmission. The Unmanned
    Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) offer several advantages for canopy temperature measurements,
    including a spatial resolution of several meters, a repeat frequency of no more
    than a few days, and a short interval from field measurement to data availability,
    typically just a few minutes. These advantages complement the essential requirements
    of reasonable instrument cost, precision, accuracy, and the ability to cover a
    significant field area. However, regulatory barriers exist for flying UAVs in
    certain regions [28]. Questions have arisen regarding the economic viability of
    utilizing UAV platforms for thermal imaging due to the cost and the extensive
    post-processing needed to generate reliably accurate thermometric images of a
    field [29]. Ground-based sensors, such as canopy temperature measured by stationary
    IRTs offer advantages over satellite and aircraft thermal imagers for agricultural
    use, including simplicity, lower cost, lower power consumption, and, most importantly,
    higher accuracy [30]. Achieving adequate field coverage needs a relatively large
    number of sensors, which would depend on factors such as field slope, soil variability,
    crop profitability, and sensor cost. The main types of algorithms used in irrigation
    management with IRTs are water stress indices and time–temperature thresholds
    (TTT) [27]. The crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI) provide
    irrigation trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air [22]. The biologically identified optimal temperature
    interactive console (BIOTIC, [31]) is the fundamental principle for the definition
    of the TTT. The crop canopy temperature is measured using IRT sensors and compared
    with a crop-specific temperature threshold value [32]. The daily total amount
    is increased by one minute for each minute that the canopy temperature is higher
    than the temperature threshold. If this total daily value exceeds the time threshold
    at the end of the day, an irrigation amount is scheduled for the next day, corresponding
    to the daily crop evapotranspiration [36]. Other constraints are established for
    the addition of minutes to the daily total value in the TTT calculations, the
    net radiation must be greater than [33] and minutes are not added if the wet-bulb
    temperature is greater than the threshold temperature minus , because relative
    humidity can limit cooling by evaporation. [34] found equation (1), to determine
    the wet-bulb temperature using relative humidity and air temperature values. (1)
    The TTT plant stress-based method is easily automated in the field, installing
    IRT sensors in fixed locations. When sensors are not stationary, canopy temperatures
    are modelled according to sensors in a reference location using equation (2) [35].
    (2) where is the calculated canopy temperature at the remote location (°C)and
    is the predawn canopy temperature (°C). is the canopy temperature at the remote
    location on the center pivot, at any daylight time measured by the IRT sensor
    (°C) and is the reference canopy temperature at the same interval as (°C), is
    the measured reference temperature at the same time as when the remote temperature
    measurement was taken (°C). For adjusting canopy temperature values, [36] advise
    to use an adjusted equation for temperatures detected by the IRT sensor ( ) using
    the sensor body temperature ( ) as in equation (3). (3) The CWSI uses the variation
    in canopy temperature as a function of water deficits and meteorological conditions
    [18]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    IRT sensors to the air temperature as a function of relative humidity [37]. The
    water stress index uses this temperature difference according to an upper and
    lower temperature baseline. Under the same prevailing environmental conditions,
    the upper and lower baseline temperatures determine the non-transpiring and fully
    transpiring crop temperatures [38]. The CWSI is a dimensionless value in a range
    between 0 and 1. A well-watered crop corresponds to 0, and a severely water-stressed
    cultivation corresponds to 1 [37]. The concept was extended to moving IRTs aboard
    center pivots, resulting in crop yield and water use efficiency comparable to
    or greater than manual irrigation scheduling using soil water profile measurements
    with a neutron probe [39]. Several studies have focused on developing ground-based
    remote sensing systems for center pivots, including algorithms [40], wireless
    sensor networks [27], low-cost wireless IRT networks [41], and software to generate
    site-specific prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil water information,
    with a graphical user interface (GUI) and geographic information system (GIS)
    tools, enabling site-specific irrigation scheduling for variable-rate irrigation
    (VRI) center pivot systems [42], [43]. Irrigation scheduling methods based on
    IRT sensors have been applied to corn [44], grain sorghum [45], soybean [25],
    hibiscus potted plants [46], apple trees [47], [48], Indian mustard [49] and cotton
    [50] crops. In [28], IRT sensors were implemented in a center-pivot irrigation
    system to calculate crop evapotranspiration (ETc). These sensors use a two-source
    energy balance (TSEB) model and provide a reduction of errors in ETc and crop
    water stress calculations by partitioning surface temperature into soil and canopy
    components. [51] applied the TTT method to a center-pivot irrigation system with
    infrared thermocouples and a global positioning system mounted on the center pivot
    for a soybean crop. Irrigation prescriptions were defined with the data analysis
    after midnight to determine the next-day strategy. Irrigation was applied in only
    one direction using special nozzles. The sensors corrected the canopy temperatures
    on the center pivot using soil IRT sensors obtaining the correction equation (4).
    (4) [50] used canopy temperature sensors on the center pivot for obtaining the
    Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) by equation (5). (5) where is the crop temperature,
    is the average temperature of a wet reference and is obtained adding to the maximum
    dry bulb temperature recorded for the specific field day. [15] demonstrated the
    advantage of IRT sensors mounted on a center pivot with a global positioning system
    to provide spatial and temporal crop water status at the field scale. While most
    precision irrigation technology is too expensive and complex for average farmers,
    methods involving IRTs may become more appealing due to their lower costs and
    simplicity. This technology has the potential to simplify management while increasing
    yields and reducing water-related waste, making it an attractive option for producers
    [35]. IRTs on center pivots and irrigation scheduling algorithms have resulted
    in crop yields and water productivity equal to or greater than those achieved
    with soil water measurements and a field-calibrated neutron probe. Combining stationary
    IRT measurements with moving IRT arrays enhances the effectiveness of irrigation
    scheduling algorithms. Stationary measurements offer time series data while moving
    arrays provide spatially distributed data [52], [30]. Wireless data transmission
    is now accessible for IRTs, eliminating the need for cumbersome wiring and enhancing
    the ease of deploying IRTs in various settings [53], [54]. Furthermore, researchers
    use extensive datasets with canopy temperature and corresponding weather information.
    These datasets, in conjunction with machine learning, artificial neural networks
    and deep learning techniques, are being employed alongside energy balance models
    to estimate thermal stress indices and facilitate irrigation scheduling [55],
    [56]. Employing infrared thermocouples (IRTCs) on self-propelled irrigation systems
    such as center pivots present several challenges: - Estimating daily canopy temperature
    dynamics from a single measurement at each field location is challenging due to
    the uncertainty associated with the timing of these measurements [35]. - It requires
    automatic data collection and analysis to control the irrigation system based
    on the canopy temperature data [35]. - If a self-propelled irrigation system is
    in motion, it has made an irrigation decision based on prescription maps unless
    it acquires data moving without irrigating [35]. - The misalignment of the IRTCs
    over the rows occurs as the pivot moves around the field [35]. - The time–temperature
    threshold (TTT) and crop water stress indexes are canopy temperature-based algorithms
    that do not distinguish between soil and canopy temperature. This lack of distinction,
    even though differences can exceed 30 °C, can affect the apparent surface temperature,
    particularly during partial canopy cover. Consequently, instances of unnecessary
    irrigation events occurring early in the season, before full canopy cover, have
    been reported [45], [28]. - Concerns have arisen that the deflection of moving
    irrigation systems and other factors may degrade moving IRT measurements relative
    to stationary IRT measurements [30]. - Specialized hardware and software systems
    exist for defining irrigation prescription maps based on weather, plant, and soil
    water information. This software incorporates site-specific irrigation scheduling
    methods and automates the data collection and processing obtained from sensing
    systems. However, it only defines static irrigation prescription maps and does
    not facilitate real-time water application in the field [43]. - Calculation methods
    typically employ the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature difference
    between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized temperature
    difference. This approach introduces irreducible uncertainty and error [22]. -
    Existing precision irrigation tools often have inadequate user interfaces, making
    them difficult to use and resulting in a poor user experience [57]. Additionally,
    low accuracy characterizes these tools, leading to the reluctance of producers
    to adopt them [58]. - Most current precision irrigation decision-support systems
    assume that producers strictly adhere to the recommended irrigation decisions
    for each event without allowing any flexibility in the irrigation timing [22].
    - The increasing adoption of infrared thermometers (IRT) for crop irrigation management
    has contributed to the growth of surface temperature datasets. This trend emphasizes
    the need to develop data quality assurance and control (QA/QC) procedures like
    those used for agricultural weather station data [53]. - In-situ sensors currently
    available in markets are typically expensive or not cost-effective enough for
    widespread adoption. Furthermore, they often require installation and removal
    before and after the growing season for row crops, resulting in additional labor
    costs [59], [22]. According to the references consulted, there is a wide range
    of research opportunities and challenges in the commercial implementation of this
    technology. Further studies are needed to determine how to integrate the information
    acquired from IRT sensors and automatic irrigation application systems to prescribe
    and apply the site-specific irrigation needs in real-time during the growing season,
    using soil and crop characteristics under different environments [15], [6]. Currently,
    systems acquire data from the field and generate irrigation prescription maps
    before the irrigation procedure (static maps). This study aims to develop an innovative
    system for mapping real-time canopy temperature and defining prescriptions using
    IRT sensors on a center pivot and GPS data while the center pivot moves on the
    field. The proposed system consists of hardware and software developments whose
    final goal is to provide farm managers with accurate and frequently updated information
    about crop irrigation requirements. This paper shows only the real-time canopy
    temperature system. The prescription mechanism and the proposed system comparison
    with others will be reported in other publications. 2. Materials and methods The
    study was conducted from the Farm Services Unit of E.V. Smith Research Center
    in Shorter, Auburn University, Alabama, USA (32° 26′ 15″ N, 85° 54′ 57″ W, and
    32 masl), during the 2018 and 2019 growing seasons. The field experiences a subtropical
    humid (Cfa) climate, with average low and high temperatures of and , respectively,
    and an annual rainfall of (https://awis.aumesonet.com/). The same corn hybrid
    (Dekalb DKC62-08, Bayer Corp., Whippany, N.J.) was planted in both years. In 2018,
    the corn was planted in concentric rows, while in 2019, it was planted in straight
    rows at a row spacing of and a population density of [60]. Soil texture, bulk
    density, and soil water retention curves (SWRC) were determined at five points
    within the experimental area. These properties were measured at soil depths of
    , , and at each location. The percentage by mass of sand, clay, and silt was determined
    by a commercial soil laboratory (Water Agricultural Laboratories, Camilla, Ga.).
    Saturated undisturbed soil cores were analyzed using a hydraulic property analyzer
    (HYPROP 2, Meter Group, Pullman, Wash.) to establish the relationship between
    soil matric potential and volumetric soil water content (VWC) [61]. The soil matric
    potential of saturated undisturbed cores, measured with the hydraulic property
    analyzer, ranged from 0 to 0.08 MPa. Additionally, a dew point hygrometer (WP4C
    PotentiaMeter, Meter Group) was employed to determine the VWC versus soil matric
    potential relationship at 0.63, 1.5, and 3.3 MPa using disturbed soil samples.
    The data from both instruments were processed using HYPROP-FIT software (ver.
    4.1.0.0, Meter Group, https://library.metergroup.com/Manuals/UMS/HYPROP-FIT_Manual.pdf)
    to generate soil water retention curves (SWRCs) based on the traditional unconstrained
    van Genuchten model [62]. The volumetric soil water content (VWC) at field capacity
    (FC) was determined for all locations, while the permanent wilting point (PWP)
    was established at a soil matric potential of 1.5 MPa. Soil bulk density was calculated
    by dividing the weight of dry soil (oven-dried at 105 °C until reaching a constant
    weight) by its volume, using undisturbed soil cores. The experiment took place
    in a field irrigated by a seven-span, half-circle center pivot irrigation system
    covering 30 ha. The system (model 7000, Valmont Industries, Valley, Neb.) had
    a lateral length of 434 m and operated with a flow rate of 181.7 cubic meters
    per hour, with a line pressure at the pivot point of 0.241 MPa. Equipped with
    a middle-elevation spray application (MESA) sprinkler package, the system included
    pressure regulators rated at 0.103 MPa. It was retrofitted with a variable-rate
    irrigation (VRI) system featuring solenoid valves to control water application
    over each half span. Each half span, approximately 31 m in length, represented
    a grid of 2° arc, allowing for the prescription of a single irrigation rate for
    the group of sprinklers within each half span. The experiment utilized full and
    limited irrigation treatments, designated as T100 (100 % soil water replenishment
    to field capacity), T66 (66 % replenishment of T100), and T33 (33 % replenishment
    of T100). A randomized complete block design was implemented with three treatments
    and four replications in 2018 (12 plots) and six replications in 2019 (18 plots).
    Soil water content (VWC) in the root zone was measured using a time domain reflectometer
    (TDR-315L, Acclima, Meridian, Ida.) and a capacitance-type soil water sensor (ECH2O
    EC-5, Meter Group) at three depths. In 2018, sensors were installed from 21 May
    to 30 August, while in 2019, they were installed from 23 April to 5 August. For
    the T100 treatments, VWC changes (except for replication 1 in 2018) were monitored
    using TDR-315L and EC-5 sensors at 0.15, 0.3, and 0.6 m soil depths. The T66 and
    T33 treatments were assessed using only EC-5 sensors at the same soil depths as
    the T100 treatments. Dataloggers (Aquatrac, AgSense, Valmont Industries, Inc.,
    Huron, S.D., and model Em50, Meter Group) recorded VWC values at 30-minute intervals.
    Aquatrac dataloggers were used for TDR-315L sensors, while Em50 dataloggers were
    used for EC-5 sensors. Data collection began on 21 May 2018 and 28 April 2019.
    Irrigation rates were determined using VWC data from TDR-315L sensors in the T100
    treatment to replenish soil water to field capacity (FC) at a depth of 0.6 m.
    When soil water depletion from any T100 treatment reached 50 % of plant-available
    water (PAW), irrigation was applied to all treatments. The irrigation rate for
    each block was calculated based on the T100 treatment. For T66 and T33 treatments,
    irrigation rates were 66 % and 33 % of the T100 rate, respectively. Soil water
    depletion (SWD) was calculated by summing the depletion at each soil layer using
    data from four TDR-315L sensors in 2018 and three TDR-315L sensors in 2019. The
    irrigation prescription map was generated using Valley VRI (model 8.55, Valmont
    Industries, Valley, Neb.) and uploaded remotely to the Valley Pro2 panel located
    at the pivot point. Canopy temperature data were recorded using wireless IRT sensors
    (SapIP-IRT, Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) installed on a stationary mast in each experimental
    plot. IRT data collection began on May 13, 2018, and May 7, 2019, corresponding
    to the V7 vegetative growth stage. IRTs were installed 1 m above the canopy in
    the same crop row and 1.5 m from soil water sensors. Each IRT sensor targets the
    crop row throughout the growing season. Additionally, twelve IRT sensors (SapIP-IRT,
    Dynamax, Houston, Tex.) were installed on span 2 in 2018 and on span 7 in 2019,
    collecting data while the center pivot was moving. Dynamax IRT sensors were calibrated
    by the company before the experiments. IRT location accuracy was determined using
    a real-time kinematic (RTK) 297 Trimble GPS (Trimble Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA).
    The design principle follows the concept of a wireless sensor network (WSN) [63].
    The system has a set of IRT sensors installed on a center pivot, a global positioning
    system node (GPS), which communicates with a central or main station using a Zigbee
    protocol (IEEE 802.15.4). The central station uses an embedded computer (EC).
    The CE is responsible for data acquisition from the IRT sensors and performing
    water stress indices, storing the information in a database, configuring the capture
    modules, and interacting with the user through a graphic user interface (GUI).
    Irrigation prescriptions with IRT sensors measurements on the center pivot were
    modeled using the machine learning models NARX (Nonlinear Autoregressive Network
    with Exogenous Inputs) and LSTM (Long short-term memory), adjusting the best hyperparameters
    and using as inputs the air temperature and relative humidity, canopy temperature
    of sensors on stationary masts, canopy temperature of sensors installed aboard
    the central pivot and as output the corresponding irrigation prescription. This
    procedure is not the scope of this article, and details will be explained in forthcoming
    publications. The proposed system design for canopy temperature monitoring and
    water balance estimation in a center pivot involves hardware and software integration
    and communication components. This section describes the electronic devices required
    to satisfy the requirements defined in the research. First, the hardware for the
    IRT system, the GPS system and the embedded computer are presented, with a justification

    the methodological aspects of the software development process. Finally, are introduced
    the underlying mapping algorithms of canopy temperature. 2.1. Hardware components
    description Wireless sensor node architecture includes twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared
    Leaf Temperature (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX), equipped with an XBee RF module
    (Digi International, Minnetonka, Minn.). The SapIP-IRT has a highly accurate reading
    of , is very stable over time, and has a signal window and field of view (FOV).
    For a one-meter-wide target, the IRT must place three meters above the item or
    surface to measure (20 degrees FOV). Zigbee specifications are and a range of
    with a omnidirectional antenna - (high gain), rechargeable batteries, typical

    sensors, GPS receiver and server in the center pivot. The wireless GPS node in
    the center pivot end-tower uses a raspberry pi zero board, a solar panel, a 12
    V battery and a Garmin GLO GPS. GLO can receive position information from the
    GPS and the GLONASS satellite constellations, allowing it to connect to up to
    24 more satellites than devices that rely on GPS alone. The GLO GPS locks on satellites
    approximately 20 percent faster and remain connected even at high speed. GLO updates
    its position information ten times per second with WAAS, an accuracy of 3 m and
    12 h of battery life. The 12 IRT sensors mounted onto the center pivot acquire
    crop canopy temperature. Sensors and GPS node transmit temperature and geolocation
    data to the central station, that is, a small computer Raspberry Pi3 (Raspberry-Pi®
    Foundation North America, Inc) at the pivot point with Zigbee 2.4 GHz protocol
    and an algorithm developed in the Python programming platform (Python Software
    Foundation, version 3, Netherlands) for managing and visualizing data, and defining
    irrigation prescription. 2.2. Software development process According to [50],
    for an IRT sensor located on the pivot, the cover surface can be approximated
    as an elliptical footprint with the vertical axis (Fig. 2). The equation used
    to calculate the area and characteristics of that elliptical footprint was defined
    using Fig. 3. This figure shows the geometrical dimensions of the cover surface
    pattern. The parameters defined are : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral
    to the ellipse starting point, : horizontal distance from the pivot lateral to
    the point with the highest temperature value acquired by the IRT sensor, horizontal
    distance from the pivot lateral to the ellipse center and : the horizontal distance
    from the pivot lateral to the ellipse endpoint. , and represent the optical path
    length from the IRT sensor to , and , respectively. is the angle between the vertical
    IRT projection to the soil and , is de IRT Field of Vision (FOV), μ and τ are
    half of the major and minor axis of the ellipse and is the height of the IRT sensor
    with respect to the soil. Download : Download high-res image (373KB) Download

    equation (10). (10) where is the IRT inclination, is FOV/2 and is the half of
    the ellipse-major axis from Fig. 3b. (11) (12) (13) (14) Using the ellipse equation

    (16) is obtained. (15) (16) where is the half of the minor axis of the ellipse.
    Consequently, from equation (11) is obtained equation (17). (17) Finally, the
    ellipse area calculation is determined using equation (18). (18) Using equation
    (18), for example, an IRT looking slightly forward of the drop hoses at an oblique
    angle to the of FOV, mounted on a pivot lateral ( above the ground), (in the horizontal
    plane) from the edge of a treatment plot, will have a resolution of approximately
    of crop surface and with FOV approximately of crop surface. Fig. 4 specifies the

    and GPS location on the center pivot. A Geo7X GPS (Trimble®, Sunnyvale, CA, USA)
    allowed the definition of , (Span1 distance) and (Span2 distance) coordinates,
    with an accuracy of 1–100 cm using Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) in
    the World Geodetic System 1984 (WGS84). These coordinates where stored in three
    variables: , and These locations were converted to Universal Transverse Mercator
    (UTM) coordinates: , and Distances (from to ) and (from to ) were defined using
    the UTM coordinates, equations (19), (20). (19) (20) To calculate the distance
    between IRT sensors ( ), is divided by the number of sensors plus one. In this
    experiment, there were 12 sensors on the pivot, then . A list of sensor locations
    on the pivot , is generated by with . This list contains 12 values, equation (21).
    (21) Each Dynamax IRT sensor sends a frame with a time tick, sensor serial number,
    battery voltage, target IR temperature degrees Celsius resolution), and sensor
    body temperature. For example, the frame: corresponds to sensor 305, reading of
    canopy temperature. The algorithm uses a list of IRT serial numbers with codes
    of the 12 sensors installed on the pivot. This list contains 12 strings, equation
    (22). (22) Additionally, the code uses a dictionary with 12 key-value pairs. The
    keys correspond to the 12 serial numbers and a list of values acquired by 12 IRT
    sensors. The dictionary uses the notation tuples of Key (String): Values (List
    of float numbers), equation (23). S (23). The GPS distance concerning the pivot
    lateral is a constant defined by equation (24). (24) The angle between the pivot
    lateral and the GPS location is a constant defined by equation (25). (25) The
    algorithm to define the location of each sensor on the field in real-time uses
    the following steps: • Acquire data from and convert it to . • Define in Fig.
    3 using the equation (26). (26) • Adding with to define the pivot lateral angle
    . For determining the geographical position of each sensor, the algorithm uses
    a new dynamic center point . This location changes during the pivot movement,
    adding −90 degrees to the center pivot angle according to Fig. 4. 3. Results and
    discussion Fig. 5a shows the GPS node located at the center pivot final tower.

    cell panel connected to a voltage regulator from 12 V to 5 V. The Raspberry Pi3

    Mapping Tool supports the system configuration (sensors, GPS node data acquisition
    and other parameters), data processing and map visualization. The design principles
    for the Infrared Mapping Tool in real-time were that it should provide the most
    accurate and site-specific information we could offer the irrigation manager with
    the selected technology. In addition, the Infrared Mapping Tool requires minimum
    user input, is very easy to manage and provides ready-to-use data output to irrigation
    prescriptions in real-time. The Infrared Mapping Tool can operate with Raspbian
    or Windows operative systems. This tool records data in plain text format (.txt)
    inside its memory block and in an external pen drive and generates a shape file
    with the information in real-time from the sensors and their locations. The system
    uses a VNC (Virtual Network Computing) connection for monitoring remotely using
    WIFI communication protocols, and data is sent to a server for processing after
    the acquisition if there is an internet connection. The central station uses a
    Raspberry Pi with a 3.2 in. touch screen. After the initial setup, the user interacts
    with the Main Screen (Fig. 7). If the system configuration does not need modifications,

    significant because they are stored and used to locate the IRT sensors on the
    center pivot and to ensure the dynamic location precision of each sensor when
    it is in movement. The Center Pivot Span Configuration tab allows the user to

    role in achieving the sustainability of food production and ensuring regional
    water security [64]. Producers rely on personal experience and weather data to
    determine when and how much to irrigate using center pivot systems. A survey found
    that over 75 % of U.S. irrigation scheduling methods rely on rules of thumb like
    crop calendars and neighbor practices, while less than 25 % use science or technology-based
    approaches [65]. According to the recent advances, challenges and opportunities
    of precision irrigation described by [22], the most important topics are data
    availability and scalability, quantification of plant water stress, model uncertainties
    and constraints, and the participation of producers and motivation. Table 2 shows
    the challenges and contributions of the proposed system in this research. Table

    The developed system significantly enhances precision irrigation practices by
    enabling real-time water application according to crop water demand. This information
    allows for optimal irrigation precise determination timing and amounts across
    the field. Unlike conventional infrared thermography (IRT) sensor systems on center
    pivots, which generate static water need maps [42], [43], our system offers dynamic,
    real-time irrigation prescriptions with application in dynamic variable-rate technologies
    that adjust irrigation rates based on the changing conditions within the field.
    These prescriptions are vital because they consider the spatial and temporal variations
    in crop growth, crop water status, and soil water availability throughout the
    growing season. This capability represents a significant advancement in precision
    irrigation technology. The adoption of precision irrigation tools depends on their
    accuracy and user-friendly interfaces [57]. Our system provides an intuitive interface
    and dynamic decision-making, empowering farmers with the capability to make informed
    decisions about when to start or stop irrigation. Swift updates based on soil
    and plant conditions are crucial if irrigation is postponed [22], and real-time
    mapping eliminates the need for acquiring new data for the entire field and generating
    new prescription maps. Additional calibrations beyond the manufacturer''s factory
    settings were not applied to Dynamax IRT sensors (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX).
    A study conducted in a controlled temperature chamber showed that root mean squared
    errors between factory-calibrated IRT brightness and black-body temperatures (ranging
    from 15 °C to 55 °C) were mostly within 0.75 °C, while ambient temperatures in
    the chamber were varied from 15 °C to 45 °C. However, the temperature differences
    between the target and ambient temperatures in the controlled chamber (up to 40
    °C) were much larger than those typically encountered in field conditions (10)°C).
    Field testing using a lysimeter indicated that post-factory calibration versus
    factory calibration had minimal impact on calculated crop evapotranspiration [66].
    This suggests that an additional post-factory, sensor-specific calibration would
    have little justification over using only factory-calibrated temperatures in the
    field. Moreover, conducting a post-factory calibration over a range of ambient
    and target temperatures would necessitate a blackbody surface and chamber with
    variable temperature control, equipment that is rarely available [53]. Therefore,
    IRT data that solely rely on factory calibration are more likely to be suitable
    for practical applications in this project. The ZigBee Remote Control protocol
    offers several significant advantages over other systems. It provides low-power
    transmission, robustness, high security, and high scalability, with the ability
    to support high node density. Additionally, it leverages wireless control and
    sensor networks in IoT applications [67]. In wireless communication systems deployed
    in agricultural fields, security and privacy are crucial to ensure data confidentiality.
    Zigbee addresses these concerns by employing the 128-bit advanced encryption standard
    (AES) [68]. The AES algorithm encrypts the data and verifies data integrity using
    a message authentication code generated by encrypting the IEEE MAC frame. Xbee
    modules use the AES-CTR mode for encrypting the payload. Compared to IEEE 802.15.4,
    Zigbee adds two extra security layers to the network and application layers, utilizing
    AES 128-bit encryption. The distributed security model is limited to routers and
    end devices. If a router detects a powered-up existing network, it can join the
    secured network; otherwise, it can form a distributed secured network and assign
    network keys to newly joined routers and end devices. While this model is simple,
    it does not offer the highest level of security. We use the centralized security
    model, which is more complex and secure than the distributed model. The network
    coordinator is responsible for authenticating and validating each device attempting
    to join the network [69]. While these encryptions enhance security, they limit
    the delay in network communications (latency), the speed at which data is transmitted
    (throughput), link quality, power consumption and longevity of the network. However,
    the increased energy consumption for encryption is recommended in agricultural
    IoT applications [70]. Security measures implementation can significantly enhance
    the security of Zigbee networks. Nevertheless, like any technology, the effectiveness
    of security measures depends on how they are implemented and maintained [71].
    Without adequate security configurations, Xbee devices are vulnerable. These devices
    are built with a preconfigured global link key, making them susceptible to man-in-the-middle
    attacks. The equipment in IRT sensors and central station should be placed in
    protective enclosures to prevent damage from insects, rodents, and weather conditions.
    These enclosures must be both weatherproof and tamper-resistant. Environmental
    sealing can protect against moisture and dust, which can negatively impact the
    performance of electronic components. Adequate ventilation may also be necessary
    to prevent overheating. It is recommended to use reliable power sources, such
    as solar panels or batteries, to ensure the continuous operation of the electronic
    system. Backup power sources may be required in the event of power outages. Dynamax
    IRT sensors offer remote monitoring capabilities, enabling the tracking of the
    electronic system''s performance and the detection of any issues related to the
    power system. Regular inspection and maintenance of the electronic system are
    crucial to ensure optimal performance. This includes checking for signs of damage,
    cleaning components, and replacing worn-out parts. Preventive maintenance was
    conducted monthly, while general corrective maintenance and functional tests were
    performed whenever the sensors were installed on the central pivot, and the routers
    and central station were placed in the field. To prevent damage from rodents,
    all exposed cables near the soil were covered with flexible metal tubes. The scalability
    in the developed systems depends on the transceiver devices used in the wireless
    sensor network. ZigBee networks offer several benefits, particularly in large-scale
    deployments, due to their energy efficiency and flexibility. [72] refers to Zigbee
    networks as personal area networks (PANs) and states that each network has a unique
    PAN identifier (PAN ID) shared among all devices in the network. Zigbee devices
    can join a network by either being preconfigured with a PAN ID or by discovering
    nearby networks and selecting a PAN ID to join. Zigbee defines three device types:
    coordinator, router, and end-device [73]. In Zigbee networks, there should be
    only one Coordinator node per network, serving as the controller responsible for
    selecting the network channel, organizing the network, and synchronizing the wireless
    sensor network. The coordinator selects the channel, PAN ID, security policy,
    and stack profile for the network. It initiates the network, selects the channel
    and PAN ID (64-bit and 16-bit), and manages other functions that define, secure,
    and maintain the network. Routers are responsible for maintaining the infrastructure
    of the ZigBee network. These nodes do not gather data or start the message transmission
    but only transmit data from router to router or from the end devices to the coordinator.
    These devices cannot sleep and must always remain powered on. Finally, end-devices
    do not route. They are responsible for gathering data and delivering it to the
    nearby router or coordinator. The scalability of the proposed system in this paper
    does not have restrictions by communication infrastructure because designers have
    made all ZigBee nodes small, lightweight, and energy-efficient, allowing the connection
    of up to 65,535 nodes [74]. Dynamax utilizes the IRT SALH data logger system,
    housed in a weatherproof enclosure, which can link to repeaters to collect data
    from up to 25 wireless IRT sensors and three routers [75]. In this research, we
    designed and implemented a datalogger that allows the connection of more IRT sensors,
    integrating one coordinator, multiple end-devices and routers, leveraging the
    capabilities of ZigBee technology and improving system scalability. Table 3 lists
    the required hardware for implementing the wireless sensor, GPS, and central station
    nodes, along with their current costs. The number of wireless sensor nodes used
    depends on the central pivot size, and a span can accommodate several IRT sensors.
    Based on the current design and the study field characteristics, the cost of implementing
    the entire hardware in the center pivot with twelve SapIP-IRT Infrared Leaf Temperature
    (Dynamax, Inc., Houston, TX) nodes is US$8,964.32. We implemented this hardware
    to ensure the system performs correctly. One key focus of future work is reducing
    implementation costs and optimizing modules'' energy consumption. Table 3. Costs

    373.36 313.22 195.05 Reviewing the current procedure for canopy sensors on central
    pivot systems reveals the need to move the pivot across the field, acquire data
    along its path, generate irrigation prescription maps, and adjust pivot movement
    for irrigation based on these prescriptions [42], [43]. Additionally, any incidental
    rain or operational problems with the central pivot that render the system inoperable
    for hours or days render the initial prescription obsolete, necessitating new
    routes for new prescriptions. The system proposed in this research addresses these
    challenges. Moreover, by eliminating field steps required for generating irrigation
    maps, the operating costs of the center pivot are reduced respect to Table 4.
    It is important to note that the values presented in Table 4 do not include these
    data acquisition processes, which contribute to higher implementation and operation
    costs when using the conventional mapping method with IRT sensors on the center
    pivot. 4. Conclusions The proposed technology contributes to agricultural irrigation
    management through its cost-effective implementation and capabilities of mapping
    crop canopy temperatures using a wireless network of infrared thermometers on
    a center pivot. It incorporates Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) with scalability
    options, IoT capabilities, and web data availability. The technology enables precise
    plant water stress quantification based on canopy temperature and soil water content,
    facilitating real-time irrigation prescriptions while the center pivot is in motion
    on the field. Canopy temperature sensors do not require additional calibration,
    guaranteeing highly accurate readings of +/- 0.5 °C. Enhancing the GPS receiver
    accuracy is imperative because it guarantees the determination of the sensor''s
    position on the center pivot. GLO2 GPS can receive position information from GPS
    and GLONASS satellite constellations, can use 24 extra satellites to lock approximately
    20 % faster and remain connected even at high speed but with an accuracy of 3
    m. To enhance the GPS module, we can use receivers with Differential Global Positioning
    System (DGPS) as Real-time kinematic positioning (RTK) or augmentation systems
    such as Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) in U.S.A. or European Geostationary
    Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) in Europe. NARX and LSTM neural network models
    were trained to predict irrigation prescriptions using ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and plant cover temperature as input data. These temperatures were measured
    by the sensors installed on the ground and aboard the central pivot. The irrigation
    prescription was used as output data. They achieved RMSE values ranging from 0.56
    mm to 4.18 mm in RMSE. Additionally, the correlation coefficient values exceeded
    0.8, indicating that the models effectively tracked the irrigation prescription
    behavior using canopy temperature sensors. Several research activities are proposed
    as future work. Exploring LoRaWAN technologies can enhance transmission distances,
    thus improving the efficiency and reach of sensor networks. Additionally, efforts
    to reduce the costs of sensors and data acquisition systems can continue, making
    these technologies more accessible to farmers. Another promising area is the development
    of algorithms for fusing data from ground, drone, and satellite sources, which
    could significantly enhance spatial resolution in irrigation management. Furthermore,
    research focusing on refining irrigation prescription models in diverse environments
    and improving irrigation amount calculations based on soil water demand and plant
    physiological regulations is essential. Finally, researchers must develop models
    that consider the effects of measurements in soil rows and crop plants. This research

    water movementSoil water consumptionPlanting system 1. Introduction Freshwater
    is widely regarded as an important natural resource and has become a globally
    scarce and overexploited resource (Bartram, 2008, Falkenmark, 2008). Agricultural
    activities are important methods for consuming freshwater resources worldwide.
    With climate change becoming increasingly serious, the frequent occurrence of
    high temperatures and drought seriously affects agricultural water security, thus
    impacting regional agricultural production (IPCC, 2014). The climate sensitivity
    of agriculture is affected by technological changes (Ortiz-Bobea et al., 2018).
    While narrowing the gap in crop yield (Mueller et al., 2012), sustainable agricultural
    water management technology has become increasingly important for reducing water
    waste, promoting agricultural adaptation and ensuring food security (Zhang et
    al., 2021b, Howden et al., 2007). In recent years, with the addition of precision
    agriculture sensor technology, the variability and characteristics of soil moisture
    have been monitored. On this basis, combined with a decision support system, sustainable
    precision irrigation technology has been implemented (Zhang et al., 2021a). In
    precision irrigation technology, monitoring the spatiotemporal changes in soil
    moisture in the field is highly important (Mertzanides et al., 2020). Previous
    studies have been conducted from the landscape to the plot scale (Booker et al.,
    2015, Wu et al., 2023), proving the relationship between soil moisture change
    and agricultural productivity (Hu et al., 2020, Pabuayon et al., 2019). Soil water
    movement (SWM) is the cause of spatiotemporal changes in soil water (Liu et al.,
    2020). In farmland ecosystems, atmosphere–plant–soil interactions form a unity
    that plays a key role in the field water cycle; water moves within and among the
    three (Schulze et al., 2019, Jones and Tardieu, 1998). Several studies have shown
    that diversified crop planting systems and crop residues reduce the runoff of
    field water (Zougmore et al., 2000, Sissoko et al., 2013). Different crop planting
    systems adjust the spatiotemporal changes in soil moisture; however, the dynamics
    of topsoil moisture are strongly affected by meteorological factors, especially
    rainfall (Wu et al., 2022b). A study on the movement of soil water vapor on the
    land surface showed that the convective (advective) transport of water vapor may
    be caused by diurnal warming leading to the expansion and contraction of soil
    air (Parlange et al., 1998). Soil water runoff characteristics at relatively high
    depths are comprehensively affected by rainfall, soil texture, crop absorption
    and shallow soil (Jalota et al., 2006, Hess et al., 2018; Tsakmakisa et al., 2019).
    Many previous studies on SWM have focused on theoretical models or laboratory
    studies on soil physics and hydrology, mainly concentrating on the effects of
    soil physical properties or meteorological conditions (Parlange et al., 1998,
    Li et al., 2015). Modeling methods are used in some studies to consider the impacts
    of cultivated crops or agricultural measures on SWM, simulating the evapotranspiration
    of SWM in small areas of vegetation (Paraskevas et al., 2013), the impact of rainfall
    on water runoff in farming systems (Myers, 1996), and SWM under root water absorption
    (Wu et al., 1999). Several studies have explored SWM characteristics in different
    soil layers at the field scale using the spatial grid method combined with the
    geological grid mathematical operation method with semivariance analysis as the
    core, revealing that the trapezoidal rule accurately quantifies the movement volume
    of soil water (Liu et al., 2020). These geostatistical methods have been used
    for monitoring soil nutrients in the field (Song et al., 2016). Semivariance analysis
    may calculate structural parameters of semivariogram, such as the nugget (C0),
    sill (C0+C) and their proportion (C0/C0+C), corresponding to the heterogeneity,
    maximum variation degree and autocorrelation of changes (Hu and Xu, 2018; Mcbratney
    and Webster, 1986). The grid calculus method is a geostatistical method that is
    usually used to calculate slope-related problems. The slope or slope change rate
    information in the specified direction are obtained through directional derivatives
    (Tuma et al., 1979). The first-order directional derivative shows the contour
    with a constant slope along a fixed directional line (Schwartz et al., 1974).
    At a specific grid node location, if the slope is uphill, the slope is positive;
    if the slope is downhill, the slope is negative. This geostatistical grid calculus
    method is used to calculate the SWM and its direction after obtaining the volume
    or spatial distribution of soil water consumption (SWC) (Pabuayon et al., 2019).
    Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) is one of the most important industrial crops in
    the world. Since cotton plants exhibit good drought and temperature resistance
    (Abdelraheem et al., 2019), they are suitable for use in arid climates and regions
    (Mao et al., 2019). The Yellow River Basin is one of the three major cotton cultivation
    regions in China (Huang et al., 2023), where a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)–cotton
    double cropping system has been developed to alleviate the contradiction between
    grain and cotton competing for land (Feng et al., 2017). Previous studies have
    shown that monoculture cotton and cotton intercropped with wheat are considered
    to have higher yields and resource utilization efficiencies than cotton direct
    seeding after wheat; this method is a better choice for local people (Wang et
    al., 2020). The adoption of different cotton planting systems affects the spatiotemporal
    changes and consumption characteristics of soil water, which may be closely related
    to the development of roots and reproductive organs (Wu et al., 2022a, Wu et al.,
    2022b). In addition, the competition for soil water during wheat growth (Mahmood-ul-Hassan
    et al., 2013) in the wheat–cotton symbiosis period (generally in the period from
    cotton sowing to seedling emergence) and the influence of crop residues after
    wheat harvest on water evaporation (Lascano et al., 1994) are important factors
    that affect the use of water resources by cotton plants. If we extend the understanding
    of the relationships between SWM and SWC and crop growth and yield under cotton
    monocropping and wheat–cotton intercropping, this approach could aid in precision
    irrigation, further improve the water utilization efficiency of crop production
    in the wheat–cotton double cropping system and ensure crop yield while reducing
    water waste (Zhang et al., 2017, Tang et al., 2010). This study is based on the
    hypothesis that the distribution of spatiotemporal changes in SWM and SWC might
    be affected by different cotton planting systems; and that cotton lint yield may
    respond to the SWM and SWC characteristics at different spatial positions in the
    soil. The objectives of this study are (i) to develop a geostatistical grid calculus
    method based on a sensor network constructed by the spatial grid method for quantifying
    the SWM at different soil positions in the field at different cotton growth stages;
    (ii) to determine the spatial distributions of SWM and SWC in different cotton
    planting systems and the correlations between SWM, SWC, meteorological conditions
    and crop growth; and (iii) to explore the factors influencing the SWM and the
    driving roles of SWM in SWC and the growth and yield formation of cotton crops
    in different planting systems. In this study, a novel method that combines sensor
    network and geostatistical grid calculus for quantifying SWM was developed; this
    method may provide theoretical support for precision agriculture and climate-smart
    agriculture; additionally, it may have important reference value for clean production
    and sustainable agricultural development under global climate change conditions.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental site A 2-year (2016–2017) field experiment
    was conducted at an experimental station (N 36°07´, E 116°22´ with an elevation
    of 76 m) of the Institute of Cotton Research, Chinese Academy of Agricultural
    Sciences, Anyang, Henan, China; this station has a semihumid and subtropical monsoon
    climate with a mean annual precipitation (MAP) of 544 mm. The experimental site
    had medium loam soil. Weather data were acquired from a weather station near the
    experimental field (Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA). The weather conditions
    regarding rainfall and temperature differed substantially between the two cotton
    growing seasons (Fig. 1A). During the two-year study, a greater level of precipitation
    (549 mm) and a lower mean temperature (23.1°C) were recorded in 2016. The precipitation
    in 2017 was 351 mm, and the mean temperature was 23.5°C. The precipitation in
    these two years was mainly concentrated in July. The precipitation in July 2016
    was 310 mm and that in July 2017 was 106 mm. On July 19, 2016, there was heavy
    rainfall; the precipitation was 107.5 mm. In 2017, the maximum daily precipitation
    of 46.8 mm occurred on July 16. During the cotton growing period, the temperature
    conditions in 2016 were similar to those in 2017. Download : Download high-res

    design The field experiment included three cotton planting systems (monocultured
    cotton (MC), wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)/intercropped cotton (WIC), and wheat/direct-seeded
    cotton (WDC)) and use a randomized complete block design with 3 repetitions (Fig.
    1B). The trial cotton cultivar was the early-maturing cultivar Yuzaomian 9110,
    and the wheat cultivar was Zhongyu 1123. In 2016 and 2017, cotton was sown on
    May 15 for both MC and WIC; cotton was sown on June 15 for WDC. Wheat was sown
    on October 26 in 2015 and 2016 and harvested on June 10 in the following year;
    cotton had an intergrowth period of approximately 30 days in WIC. The layout of
    the cropping systems is shown in Fig. 1B. The cotton plants were sown at an intrarow
    spacing of approximately 0.14–0.15 m at a density of 80,000 plants/ha. The row
    spacing was 0.7 m between two cotton rows, 0.2 m between cotton and wheat rows,
    and 0.15 m between two wheat rows. For each of the three wheat rows, one row of
    cotton was planted. The planting system was an integrated factor (including plant,
    soil, and environment); the three cotton planting systems were considered three
    treatments (Ma, 1990). Each experimental individual plot had an area of 31.5 m2,
    a length of 9 m and a width of 3.5 m. Field management was consistent across the
    treatments. According to local practices, all fertilizers were broadcasted evenly
    across the soil and incorporated into the top 20 cm of the soil before sowing.
    During the wheat growth period, N:P:K (13:17:15) compound fertilizer was applied
    as a starter fertilizer to supply 78 kg ha−1 N, 102 kg ha−1 P2O5 and 90 kg ha−1
    K2O before wheat sowing; 260 kg ha−1 urea and 150 kg ha−1 compound fertilizer
    composed of N-P2O5-K2O [17−17−17] were applied during the cotton growing period.
    Trench irrigation (600 m3 ha−1) was applied on March 16, 2016, and 2017. According
    to the suggestions of local agronomists, a total of approximately 40 m3 irrigation
    was applied to flood trenches after the cotton plants were planted. Weeds were
    manually controlled, and pesticides were used to control insects and disease.
    2.3. Crop data collection The cotton growth stages were investigated by 20 tagged
    cotton plants in each plot every three days after cotton emergence. The times
    when the cotton population entered the squaring (50% of cotton plants exhibited
    squares approximately 3 mm in diameter), flowering and boll development (50% of
    cotton plants produced the first white flower), and boll opening (50% of cotton
    plants began to show opened bolls) stages were recorded in 2016 and 2017. The
    results of the survey are shown in Fig. 2. Table 1 shows the environmental conditions
    at different growth stages of cotton plants under the different planting systems.
    Cotton biomass was measured every 15 days beginning at 20 days after sowing (DAS)
    and continuing throughout the cotton growing season until harvest. Ten random
    cotton plants in the middle row of each plot were used to construct the plant
    map to avoid any boundary effects; for each replicate, two plants from each plot
    were randomly uprooted for biomass determination. Depending on the cotton developmental
    stage, the samples were separated into aboveground organs (stems, leaves, flowers,
    and bolls) and belowground organs (roots); afterward, the organs were oven dried
    at 80°C to a constant weight to determine their biomass. At the beginning of October,
    the number of cotton bolls within an area of 6.3 m2 (0.7 × 9 m) in the center
    two rows of the plots was investigated. Because the cotton bolls in each treatment
    did not mature at the same time, the bolls were manually harvested three times.
    The seed cotton was weighed after drying, and the seed cotton yield and boll weight
    were calculated; after ginning, the lint yield and boll cracking were determined.
    The effective temperature for cotton was equal to the average temperature minus
    the lower limit temperature for crop and root growth (15°C for cotton); the growth
    degree day (GDD) was equal to the accumulated daily effective temperature (Li
    et al., 2021). Download : Download high-res image (106KB) Download : Download

    water monitoring and SWC calculation In this study, the volumetric soil moisture
    contents (θ) were monitored by 5TE sensors (METER, USA). Thirty sensors were set
    as a group in the soil profile of the middle of each trial plot according to a
    spatial grid method (Liu et al., 2020); there was 20 cm of spacing in both the
    vertical and horizontal directions (Fig. 1C). The sensors were installed before
    the cotton was sown. When the sensor was set up in the soil, the excavated soil
    was placed in a fixed location, and after the sensors were installed, all the
    excavated soil was backfilled quantitatively, and the soil surface was leveled.
    In the profile grid, the horizontal position was divided into cotton rows (0–20 cm
    and 60–80 cm) and between rows (20–60 cm); the vertical positions were divided
    into shallow (10–40 cm), middle (40–70 cm), and deep (70–110 cm) layers (Fig.
    1D). The soil dielectric apparent permittivity (εb) was collected by 5TE sensors
    and uploaded to the cloud with a 1-hour time interval of data collection. θ was
    estimated based on εb using the Topp equation (Visconti et al., 2014, Topp et
    al., 1980): (1) where a = 4.3×10−6, b= −5.5×10−6, c = 2.92×10−2, and d = 5.3×10−2.
    For each planting system, a grid (i,j) file was created for the 30 sensor data;
    i and j represent the abscissa and ordinate, respectively. The total θ of each
    grid was calculated using Simpson’s 3/8 rule (Wu et al., 2023): (2) (3) (4) where
    [1, 3, 3, 2, …] is the coefficient vector, is the depth of the grid points of
    row i and row j, and are the column spacing and row spacing of the grid data file,
    respectively, is the ith cross-sectional area, is the total volume of water on
    the specific measured cross section, is the definite average value of the integral
    of the soil water content for each grid data file, and is the area of the soil
    profile. Then, the cumulative SWC in the soil profile and water productivity were
    calculated using the following formulas (Wu et al., 2022a): (5) (6) 2.5. Grid
    calculus for SWM calculation The x and y coordinates are interpolated more finely.
    After the soil profile of each time point was interpolated, a group of water data
    of 80 × 100 points formed. In this study, the kriging method was selected for
    interpolation; the value of the interpolation point was calculated by the following
    formula: (7) (8) (9) where Z∗(x0) is the kriging interpolation result of point
    x0, λi is the unknown weight coefficient, and C(xi, xj) is the covariance function
    of Z(xi) and Z(xj). After the grid data was interpolated, grid calculus is used
    to define and quantify the characteristics in the grid file that are not obvious
    from looking at a contour map or 3D wireframe of the grid. When a numerical derivative
    is needed, central difference formulas are used for the calculus computations.
    Because a central difference approach is used, values on both sides of the location
    for which the derivative is computed are needed. A compass-based grid notation
    is used to indicate the neighboring grid nodes for many of the grid calculus operations,
    as illustrated in Fig. 1E. Using this grid notation, we write the difference equation
    approximations for the necessary derivatives at location Z as follows: (10) (11)
    (12) (13) (14) where Z is a function of X and Y in a domain that includes point
    P. In the X-axis direction, the rate of change for Z is ∂z/∂x; the rate of change
    in the Y-axis direction for Z is ∂z/∂y. According to the definition of the directional
    derivative (Schwartz, 1974), the SWM, which is the slope of the SWC surface in
    a given direction, is calculated by the first derivative: (15) where α is the
    specified angle (Tuma, 1979). The α used for calculating the vertical soil water
    movement is −90°. For vertical SWM, a positive value indicates moving upward toward
    the y-axis origin, and a negative value indicates moving from the origin downward
    along the y-axis. The horizontal SWM calculation uses an α value equal to 0°.
    For the horizontal SWM, a positive value indicates moving away from the x-axis
    origin, and a negative value indicates moving toward the x-axis origin. Using
    compass-based grid notation, the equation takes the following form: (16) When
    calculating the horizontal SWM in cotton rows at a horizontal position of 60–80 cm
    and that in between rows at a horizontal position of 40–60 cm, the value of the
    horizontal SWM is multiplied by −1 because the real horizontal SWM direction at
    40–80 cm is contrary to that at 0–40 cm. That is, the movement toward the middle
    of the rows at 40–80 cm is represented by negative horizontal SWM, unlike that
    at 0–40 cm, which is represented by positive values. In a later correlation analysis,
    only the size of the horizontal SWM was considered, not the direction; thus, the
    absolute values of the horizontal SWM in cotton rows and horizontal SWM between
    rows were used. 2.6. Statistics and software The least significant difference
    (LSD) method was used for significance analysis at the 0.05 level. Pearson correlation
    analysis was used for pairwise correlation, and path analysis was conducted using
    planting system, meteorological factors, soil water movement and consumption,
    crop biomass and the lint yield of cotton. Structural equation modeling (SEM)
    or path analysis allows researchers to model complex relational networks by evaluating
    the direct and indirect effects between variables (Bollen and Pearl, 2013). With
    SEM, researchers can clearly specify causal relationships between variables and
    validate these relationships by observing data. Path analysis mainly focuses on
    the direct paths between variables in the model. This enables researchers to identify
    which variables have a direct impact on other variables, thereby revealing potential
    causal relationships (Wu et al., 2023). In agriculture, ecology, and other fields,
    these methods have helped researchers better understand and explain the interactions
    between various factors (Guo et al., 2023). A logistic growth model was used to
    model belowground biomass dynamics with days after emergence (DAE). Stata 16 and
    Microsoft Office Excel 2019 were used for data collation; statistical analyses
    were performed via SPSS 25.0, GraphPad Prism 8 and Origin 2021; and Microsoft
    Office PowerPoint 2019, Golden Software Surfer 18.0, GraphPad Prism 8, Origin
    2021 and Adobe Illustrator CC 2019 were used for graphing. 3. Results 3.1. Cotton
    growth and yield There were significant differences in cotton dry matter accumulation
    at different growth stages under the different cropping systems (Fig. 3). The
    biomasses of the different organs in the MC treatment group were the highest at
    the cotton seedling stage in both 2016 and 2017. There was no significant difference
    between WIC and WDC (except for the maximum belowground biomass in 2017). The
    dry matter variation trend of the different cropping systems at the cotton squaring
    stage was MC>WIC>WDC. During the cotton flowering and boll development stage,
    the maximum aboveground biomass and maximum belowground biomass were the greatest
    in the MC treatment and the smallest in the WIC treatment; the maximum leaf biomass
    was also the greatest in MC, but the smallest in WDC. By comparing the dynamics
    of cotton plant height under different cropping systems, it was found that the
    change trend was consistent over the past two years, with MC>WIC>WDC in each period
    (Supplementary Fig. 1). The lint yield and boll density in 2016 and 2017 and the
    boll weight, lint percentage and water productivity in 2017 were highest in MC,
    followed by WIC (Fig. 4). Compared with that of MC, the lint yields of WIC and
    WDC decreased by 18.0% and 46.7%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image

    cotton planting systems in 2016 were basically greater than those in 2017; additionally,
    MC and WIC had higher SWC values mainly at the seedling and squaring stages in
    2016 than in 2017, and WDC had higher SWC values mainly at the squaring stage
    in 2016 than in 2017 (Fig. 5A). In 2017, the deep SWC values of the three planting
    modes at depths of 70–110 cm in the flowering and boll development stage were
    greater than those in 2016. For MC, the SWC in 2016 was mainly concentrated in
    the shallow (10–40 cm) and middle (40–70 cm) layers; in 2017, the SWC was mainly
    concentrated at the shallow layer, and the SWC values at different horizontal
    positions of the same depth exhibited small variations. The SWC distributions
    of WIC and WDC at different horizontal positions at the same depth were largely
    different. The SWC distribution in WIC at the seedling stage was similar to that
    in MC, which was greater than that in WDC; however, the SWC distribution at the
    squaring stage exhibited an obvious inverted V shape, while that in WDC presented
    an irregular distribution. The SWC of the soil profile in WDC at 10–110 cm was
    obviously lower than that in MC and WIC. Fig. 5B shows that the SWCs in the cotton
    rows and between rows under the three planting systems at the cotton squaring
    stage in 2016 were obviously greater than those in 2017. However, the SWC in between
    rows at the flowering and boll development stage in 2016 was lower than that in
    2017. The use of different cotton planting systems and growth stages significantly
    affected the SWC in between rows. MC had the largest SWC values in the three stages
    of 2016 and in the seedling and flowering and boll development stages of 2017;
    however, the lowest SWC occurred in the squaring stage of 2017. There were no
    significant differences between SWCs in cotton rows in MC and WIC at the seedling
    or squaring stage in 2016. In 2017, the SWC between rows and the SWC in cotton
    rows was significantly greater in WIC at the squaring stage than in MC. In 2017,
    the SWC of the WIC at the squaring stage was the largest; in other cases, the
    WIC was significantly lower than that of the MC. The SWC in WDC was significantly
    greater than that in WIC at the flowering and boll development stage. The SWC
    in WDC was greatest between rows at the squaring stage in 2017 and lowest at other
    times. Download : Download high-res image (811KB) Download : Download full-size

    p<0.01. 3.3. Vertical SWM In Fig. 6A, positive values represent upward SWM, negative
    values represent downward SWM, and the color depth represents the value. The vertical
    SWM of the soil profile in 2017 had obvious stratification, and the different
    soil layers exhibited great variation; the upward movement of water was mainly
    concentrated in the shallow soil. Relative to 2017, there was a significantly
    greater increase in the SWM in the middle depth range of the soil profile in 2016
    at the seedling stage and squaring stage; moreover, the SWM was lower in 2016
    at the flowering and boll development stage. In 2016, the upward SWM in MC in
    the shallow soil layer exhibited few differences among the three growth stages,
    and there was a large SWM in the middle layer at the squaring stage. In 2017,
    the water movement in the MC soil profile clearly followed the order of seedling
    stage<squaring stage<flower and boll development stage. In 2016, the SWM of WIC
    at the seedling stage was similar to that of MC; however, there was a greater
    downward SWM in the middle and deep soil layers (70–110 cm) at the squaring and
    flowering and boll development stages. In 2017, WIC had a greater SWM in the shallow
    layer at the seedling stage; its middle layer SWM mainly moved downward. The SWM
    of the shallow layer in the WDC varied greatly with the horizontal position. In
    2016, the middle- and deep-layer SWMs were mainly downward. In 2017, the middle-
    and deep-layer, the SWM was upward. Fig. 6B shows that the vertical SWM under
    the three planting systems in 2016 generally increased. The SWM values at the
    seedling and squaring stages were basically greater than those in 2017; moreover,
    the difference in the vertical SWM caused by the different planting systems in
    2017 was more significant. In 2016, the vertical SWM variations in cotton rows
    and between rows of WIC at the squaring stage were obvious; in other cases, the
    vertical SWM trend between cotton rows and between rows were basically similar.
    In 2017, WIC had a significant maximum vertical SWM value at different horizontal
    positions at the seedling stage; at the squaring stage, WIC had a significant
    minimum vertical SWM value. There were no significant differences in the vertical
    SWM between MC and WDC at the seedling stage during the two years. However, in
    other cases, the vertical SWM of WDC was significantly lower than that of MC.

    negative values represent directions, negative values represent leftward movement
    along the abscissa, positive values represent rightward movement along the abscissa,
    and the color depth represents SWM size. The horizontal SWM in 2016 was more obvious
    than in 2017, and the WIC horizontal SWM values at the squaring and flower and
    boll development stages were more obvious than at seedling stage. At the squaring
    and flowering and boll development stages, the horizontal SWM of WIC mainly changed
    direction at the midpoint of the cotton row along the horizontal direction; the
    total trend was to move from the midpoint of the row to the position of the cotton
    rows. In MC and WDC, the horizontal SWM in cotton rows and horizontal SWM between
    rows exhibited greater variation with respect to the horizontal positions at different
    stages. The horizontal SWM values of the three planting systems were the largest
    in the squaring stage, followed by the flowering and boll development stage; the
    values were the smallest in the seedling stage. As shown in Fig. 7B, the absolute
    values of the horizontal SWM levels between rows of WIC in 2016 were the largest
    in the three growth stages. In 2017, the absolute values of the horizontal SWM
    in cotton rows were the greatest at the seedling stage in MC; there were no significant
    differences between WIC and WDC, and the absolute value of the horizontal SWM
    was the greatest between cotton rows of WIC. In 2017, the absolute value of horizontal
    SWM in cotton rows of MC at the squaring stage was the largest, the between-row
    value in WIC was the largest, and the between-row value in WIC at the flowering
    and boll development stage was significantly the largest. In 2017, the horizontal
    SWM between rows in MC at the seedling stage moved toward the midpoint of the
    cotton rows with a horizontal coordinate of 40 cm. In addition, the soil water
    under the three planting systems at the seedling stage moved toward the position
    of cotton rows with a horizontal coordinate of 0 cm. In the two observed years
    of the squaring stage, the soil water at the cotton rows of MC and WIC moved toward
    the cotton position. In 2016, the horizontal SWM between rows in the shallow and
    middle layers of MC at the squaring stage was basically offset, and the horizontal
    SWM between rows of MC at the squaring stage and that of WIC in the two years
    moved toward the cotton positions. At the flowering and boll development stage
    in 2016, the water between rows of MC plants moved toward the midpoint of the
    rows; at the flowering and boll development stage in 2017, the soil water in MC
    moved slightly in the horizontal direction. The soil water of WIC obviously moved
    toward the cotton positions at the squaring and flowering and boll development
    stages in the two years; the horizontal SWM direction of WDC at the squaring and
    flowering and boll development stages in 2017 moved toward the midpoint of the
    cotton rows. Download : Download high-res image (910KB) Download : Download full-size

    according to the LSD test (0.05). **: p<0.01. 3.5. Meteorological and crop influences
    on SWC and SWM At the seedling stage, the SWC between cotton rows was positively
    correlated with the number of hours of accumulated sunlight during the growth
    period and with the maximum aboveground biomass, the maximum belowground biomass,
    the maximum leaf biomass, the accumulation of aboveground biomass and the accumulation
    of belowground biomass at this growth stage (Fig. 8). The vertical SWM between
    rows was negatively correlated with the average sunshine duration and positively
    correlated with rainfall. The absolute value of the horizontal SWM in cotton rows
    was negatively correlated with the mean temperature (Tmean) and minimum temperature
    (Tmin); the absolute value of the horizontal SWM between rows was significantly
    positively correlated with the growth degree day (GDD). The SWC between rows was
    positively correlated with Tmean and maximum temperature (Tmax) and negatively
    correlated with rainfall during the squaring stage. The SWC in cotton rows was
    positively correlated with the SH, and the vertical SWM between rows was negatively
    correlated with Tmean and Tmax. At the cotton flowering and boll development stage,
    the SWC in cotton rows was significantly correlated with the cotton row vertical
    SWM, Tmean, Tmax and the accumulation of aboveground biomass at that stage; the
    SWC between rows was significantly correlated with the SWC in cotton rows. The
    vertical SWM in cotton rows at the flowering and boll development stage was more
    strongly affected by other factors and was significantly correlated with temperature,
    rainfall, the accumulation of aboveground biomass and plant height. The vertical
    SWM between rows was significantly positively correlated with aboveground biomass
    accumulation, belowground biomass accumulation, maximum aboveground biomass, maximum
    belowground biomass, and GDD during this period. There were no significant correlations
    between the absolute values of HSWM in or between cotton rows and other indicators
    in this period. Download : Download high-res image (482KB) Download : Download

    of SWC and SWM on cotton lint yield Fig. 9 shows the significant results obtained
    by linear regression between the lint yield and SWC, vertical SWM and horizontal
    SWM in and between cotton rows during three cotton growth stages. There was a
    significant positive linear relationship between SWM between rows and lint yield
    in the three periods; only at the flowering and boll development stage did the
    vertical SWM between rows and lint yield have a significant positive linear relationship.
    There was no significant correlation between lint yield and the vertical SWM at
    the seedling or squaring stages and the horizontal SWM at any of the three stages.
    Path analysis between these indicators at the flowering and boll development stage
    and lint yield is shown in Fig. 10. The model explanation rate for lint yield
    was R2 = 0.807, where p < 0.001, χ2/df = 1.903, GFI = 0.918, and RMSEA = 0.425.
    The cotton planting system significantly changed the meteorological conditions.
    Tmax, Tmin and rainfall significantly affected the vertical SWM in cotton rows.
    Among these parameters, the impact of Tmin was negative, and the impacts of Tmax
    and rainfall were positive. During this period, the accumulation of aboveground
    biomass and the accumulation of belowground biomass were significantly and positively
    affected by GDD. The accumulation of aboveground biomass positively affected the
    vertical SWM in cotton rows, while the accumulation of belowground biomass positively
    affected the vertical SWM between rows. The vertical SWM in and between cotton
    rows positively impacted each other. The vertical SWM between rows slightly positively
    affected the accumulation of aboveground biomass. The accumulation of aboveground
    biomass and belowground biomass characteristics positively impacted the maximum
    aboveground biomass and maximum belowground biomass, respectively; the maximum
    belowground biomass significantly increased the maximum aboveground biomass. The
    vertical SWM in cotton rows and the maximum aboveground biomass had significant
    positive and negative effects on the SWC in cotton rows, respectively; the SWC
    between rows was mainly affected by the direct negative effects of the different
    cotton planting systems. The maximum aboveground biomass, SWC in cotton rows and
    SWC between cotton rows had significant positive, positive and negative effects
    on cotton lint yield, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    Discussion 4.1. SWC and SWM under the different cotton planting systems The spatiotemporal
    distributions and characteristics of SWC and SWM for the three cotton planting
    systems at different growth stages were obviously different and strongly affected
    by interannual effects. In 2016, with sufficient rainfall, the SWC values of the
    three planting systems at the squaring stage were significantly higher; moreover,
    the depth range of vertical SWM was greater, indicating that crop planting systems
    used more of water in deep soil layers. In the drought year 2017, which had insufficient
    rainfall, the soil water consumption was mainly concentrated at shallow soil depths;
    however, the SWC and SWM values at the flowering and boll development stage were
    near or even greater than those in 2016 (Fig. 5 & 6). In the years with sufficient
    rainfall, the rainfall occurred mainly during the squaring stage; the suitable
    and sufficient soil water environment could limit the growth of cotton roots (Hulugalle
    et al., 2015), allowing the plants to reach their maximum belowground biomass
    earlier (Wu et al., 2022b). In contrast, cotton roots became more developed in
    arid environments, extending to a wider range at the cotton flowering and boll
    development stage (Tsakmakisa et al., 2019; Taylor and Klepper, 1974). The cotton
    production demand in different climates or regions was realized through the improvement
    of planting systems and soil water management during different periods. This discovery
    was extended to the results of a previous study (Han et al., 2022). The horizontal
    SWM of WIC was more obvious than that of MC and WDC at the squaring and flowering
    and boll development stages. The water movement from the row midpoints to the
    cotton row positions was greater (Fig. 7), which could have been caused by the
    strong water absorption capacities of the root systems in the cotton rows and
    the greater absolute values of horizontal SWM in cotton rows (Fig. 8). Previous
    studies have shown that the volumetric soil water content in the position between
    rows under WIC was greater than that in cotton rows, potentially leading to the
    formation of a water stress zone (Wu et al., 2022b). This phenomenon could be
    caused by the SWM modes under WIC. The vertical SWM and SWC between rows of MC
    at the seedling stage were larger than those in cotton rows; however, the water
    in this part might not be absorbed by early cotton and instead might be affected
    more by environmental factors, such as the evaporation of shallow soil layers
    (Paraskevas et al., 2013). These results showed that for the MC planting system,
    more attention should be given to water resource management at the seedling stage
    of cotton. In comparison to the local irrigation methods used in monoculture cotton
    planting systems (Chen et al., 2022a, Zhi et al., 2019), more detailed drip irrigation
    methods (Hu et al., 2020) or partial root zone irrigation methods (Tang et al.,
    2010) could be used to reduce the water input between rows; this phenomenon could
    reduce the waste of a large amount of water resources. However, it was necessary
    to consider sustainability and the costs of labor and materials (Huang et al.,
    2022). 4.2. Cotton yield formation and water management in diverse planting systems
    Previous studies have shown that environmental changes caused by adjusting sowing
    dates have a greater impact on lint yield, while the overall Q-score impact on
    various fiber qualities is relatively small, and soil moisture may be the main
    environmental influencing factor. In this study, the lint yield formation mechanism
    of cotton was explained from the atmosphere-plant-soil integrated system under
    different planting systems. Cotton yield was related mainly to SWM and SWC at
    the flowering and boll development stage (Fig. 9). Different cotton planting systems
    led to differences in the environmental climate conditions during the flowering
    and boll development stage. Climate factors affected both SWM and crop growth.
    The SWC was affected by SWM, crops and planting systems, while driving crop yield
    formation with aboveground biomass (Fig. 10). The effective accumulated temperature
    was related to cotton biomass, which has been described in many previous studies
    (Li et al., 2021). The results of this study showed that GDD affected the increase
    in the maximum aboveground and belowground biomass by directly affecting aboveground
    and belowground biomass accumulation. Temperature and rainfall significantly impacted
    the SWM in cotton rows, which was not mentioned in previous studies. The positive
    impacts of Tmax and rainfall were due to their respective promotion of crop evaporation
    and plant water absorption (Paraskevas et al., 2013, Pabuayon et al., 2019); the
    negative impact of Tmin could occur due to the lower temperature and slowed biophysical
    processes (Parlange et al., 1998). The vertical SWM in between rows was mainly
    affected by the accumulation of belowground biomass and vertical SWM in cotton
    rows, and further progress was made in the study of Sissoko et al., (2013). The
    SWC between rows was affected by the planting systems, which was potentially due
    to the influences of wheat crops and their postharvest residues in different planting
    systems (Jalota et al., 2006, Lascano et al., 1994). The increase in the aboveground
    and the belowground biomass of cotton plants could promote vertical SWM in and
    between cotton rows, respectively; this phenomenon indicated that the aboveground
    growth of cotton plants could depend on water movement and consumption at different
    spatial locations in the soil, and underground morphology could influence this
    phenomenon (Chen et al., 2022b, Chen et al., 2019). In addition, the maximum aboveground
    biomass limited the SWC in cotton rows, indicating that it was necessary to control
    the aboveground biomass at the flowering and boll development stage; this phenomenon
    could be related to the top growth and the vegetative growth of cotton (Taylor
    and Klepper, 1974, Tang et al., 2010). These results provide theoretical support
    for the inhibition of apical growth by topping and the regulation of biomass allocation
    via chemical control (Zhang et al., 2021c, Mao et al., 2014). According to the
    results of this study, methods for effectively and reasonably distributing the
    SWC in and between cotton rows and promoting the consumption and utilization of
    water in cotton rows are new possible techniques for further improving the lint
    yield of cotton in the diversified planting systems. 4.3. Perspectives and potential
    limitations With respect to agriculture in the 4.0 era, sensor technology has
    been widely used in farmlands, providing better opportunities to mine and interpret
    data. In this article, we mainly wanted to discuss the relationship between soil
    moisture movement and crops. Through this relationship, we can better understand
    the water use characteristics of field crops, which will benefit precision irrigation.
    Based on the combination of soil water sensor networks and the geostatistical
    grid calculus method, we developed a novel method for quantifying soil water movement
    at different spatial positions in soil profiles under various cotton planting
    systems; we further analyzed the mechanism of cotton yield formation at the flowering
    and boll development stage in combination with climate and crop effects. In this
    study, the cotton biomass was divided into two parts: aboveground and belowground.
    The results of the analysis suggested that the distributions of reproductive and
    vegetative organ biomass at the flowering and boll development stage could be
    a possible reason for the difference in SWC in cotton rows; this phenomenon should
    to be further analyzed. In addition, the results of this paper showed that different
    planting systems affected the SWC between rows; however, specific explanations
    for this impact were not found, which requires further study. Nonetheless, we
    found many phenomena that were not mentioned in previous studies and explained
    many of the results of previous studies from the spatial distributions of SWM
    and SWC. The methods and results of this study have important reference value
    for exploring the laws of soil water utilization under diversified crop planting
    systems; these findings are conducive to improving water use efficiency and crop
    yield (Mueller et al., 2012, Zhang et al., 2017) and promoting the development
    of precision irrigation technology (Mertzanides et al., 2020). This study provides
    theoretical support for improvements in cotton planting systems in different climates
    or regions, which is conducive to improving the climate adaptation of agricultural
    production and promoting the sustainable development of agriculture (Howden et
    al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2021b). Additionally, the soil database has great value
    in its own right. In the future, we will dig deeper into the soil database and
    may use digital soil mapping and machine learning methods combined with physical
    characteristics of the soil to study the patterns of movement independent of plant
    control (Wang et al., 2022). These methods may be able to predict variations in
    soil properties, and simultaneously be able to better correlate crops and soil
    to implement management options. 5. Conclusion In this study, sensor networks
    based on the spatial grid method were used to monitor soil moisture at high spatiotemporal
    resolutions under three cotton planting systems. The vertical soil water movement,
    horizontal soil water movement and soil water consumption at different spatial
    locations in the soil profile were calculated using geostatistical grid calculus;
    the mechanism underlying the formation of cotton lint yield was comprehensively
    analyzed within the atmosphereplant–soil system. The results showed that in 2016,
    when there was a large amount of rainfall, the SWC values of the three systems
    at the cotton squaring stage were obviously greater; the depth range of the vertical
    SWM was generally wider. The depth range of SWC was wider at the flowering and
    boll development stage in the relatively dry year 2017. The results showed that
    cotton made full use of deep water under these conditions. The SWC and vertical
    SWM values between rows in MC at the seedling stage were greater than those in
    cotton rows. WIC had a large horizontal SWM at the squaring and flowering and
    boll development stages, and the soil water mainly moved from the cotton row midpoints
    to the cotton locations. The SWM at the seedling stage was mainly related to rainfall
    and accumulated sunshine hours; the SWC was mainly affected by accumulated sunshine
    hours and crop biomass. SWM and SWC at the squaring stage were mainly affected
    by the light, temperature and water conditions of the growing environment. The
    SWC and vertical SWM at the flowering and boll development stage were mainly affected
    by both the environment and crops. The SWC and vertical SWM at the flowering and
    boll development stage had significant positive correlations with lint yield.
    The highest temperature and rainfall at the flowering and boll development stage
    promoted vertical SWM in cotton rows; GDD promoted the accumulation of crop biomass,
    and the accumulation of aboveground and underground biomass promoted vertical
    SWM in and between cotton rows, respectively. The SWC in cotton rows was mainly
    positively affected by the vertical SWM in cotton rows; the SWC between rows was
    mainly directly affected by planting systems. The SWC in cotton rows and the maximum
    aboveground biomass positively impacted lint yield formation, and the SWC between
    cotton rows negatively impacted lint yield formation. For MC, more accurate irrigation
    at the seedling stage was an efficient method for reducing water resource waste.
    With respect to the WIC, a better distribution of SWC in and between cotton rows
    promoted the consumption and utilization of soil water in cotton rows, which was
    a possible method for improving the lint yield of cotton in the diversified planting
    system. The methods and results of this study are conducive to optimizing precision
    irrigation management at different crop growth stages and providing theoretical
    support for improving cotton planting systems under different climatic conditions
    or in different regions; additionally, these methods are highly important for
    improving climate adaptation and agricultural production sustainability. CRediT

    Abstract Water resources are, therefore, a limiting factor for the country’s agricultural
    production, and saving water becomes clearly a necessary prerequisite. In this
    logic, irrigation technologies appear to play a major role in supporting Egypt''s
    agro-economy. However, using such modern means of irrigation control can help
    in scheduling both irrigation and fertigation processes very accurately, providing
    different cultivated crops with their exact requirements of water and fertilizers
    at the correct time for the plant. Moreover, it will consume the minimum water,
    fertilizers energy, and labor as well. Also, it will render the plant avoid any

  description: Climate warming has led to the expansion of arable land at high altitudes,
    but it has also increased the demand for water use efficiency (WUE). To address
    this issue, the development of water-saving irrigation technology has become crucial
    in improving water productivity and economic returns. This study aimed to assess
    the impacts of three irrigation methods on water productivity and economic returns
    in wolfberry (Lycium barbarum L.) cultivation on the Tibetan Plateau, China during
    a two-year field trial. Results showed that subsurface irrigation with ceramic
    emitters (SICE) outperformed surface drip irrigation (DI) and subsurface drip
    irrigation (SDI) in terms of wolfberry yield. Over the two-year period, the average
    yield with SICE increased by 8.0% and 2.3% compared with DI and SDI, respectively.
    This improvement can be attributed to the stable soil moisture and higher temperature
    accumulation achieved with SICE. Furthermore, SICE exhibited higher WUE, with
    14.6% and 4.5% increases compared with DI and SDI, respectively. In addition to
    the agronomic benefits, SICE also proved advantageous in terms of economic returns.
    Total average annual input costs of SICE were lower than the other two methods
    starting from the 8th year. Moreover, the benefit-cost ratio of SICE surpassed
    the other methods in the 4th year and continued to widen the gap with subsequent
    year. These findings highlight SICE as an economically viable water-saving irrigation
    strategy for wolfberry cultivation on the Tibetan Plateau. Thus, this research
    not only provides an effective water-saving irrigation strategy for wolfberry
    cultivation but also offers insights into addressing irrigation-related energy
    challenges in other crop production systems.

    Precision irrigation is a water-saving technique that minimizes wastage and maximizes
    water requirements based on the actual needs of the plant, both in terms of water
    and nutrients, following site-specific soil texture and characteristics [1]. To
    date, precision irrigation aims to fulfill the growing food demand of an increasingly
    expanding population while minimizing environmental impact such as e.g., greenhouse
    gasses and fuel consumption [2]. In this regard, the Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) has predicted that by 2050 there will be an increase
    of more than 50 percent in irrigated food production. This will lead to a 10 percent
    increase in water withdrawn in agriculture due to the raising productivity needs
    [3]. At the same time, climate change will affect the availability of water, generating
    conflicts between human activity depending on water, including crop productions
    and therefore also threatening food security [4]. The efficient use of water resources
    is essential to pursue sustainable development and to achieving the Sustainable
    Development Goals of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially in developing
    world. The water related European policies, the Water Framework Directive [5]
    first, promote water use efficiency to pursue the quantitative and qualitative
    protection of water. The Farm to Fork strategy [5], (declining the Green Deal
    initiative in the agri-food sector) and its application within the Common Agricultural
    Policy also go in the direction of guiding the transition towards a fair, healthy
    and environmentally-friendly food system. Together with the Biodiversity strategy,
    it proposes ambitious actions and commitments to achieve specific objectives by
    2030, requiring the agri-food system to review its production models, also to
    tackle climate change and protect the environment and biodiversity. One of the
    advantages of precision irrigation is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
    thanks to the improvement of the carbon reserve function of the soil. New precision
    irrigation technologies can be applied to greenhouse gas mitigation measures by
    significantly reducing the amount of inputs that are responsible for the contribution
    of greenhouse gasses and could contribute to the goal of minimizing the impact
    agriculture on climate change [6]. This is the rationale that has raised many
    concerns, not only among agronomists who see water use efficiency for crop purposes
    only, but also among researchers because, besides inferior productions, low water
    quantity can cause adverse effects and lead to really significant climate change.
    These pressing concerns have prompted several sectors to reevaluate agricultural
    water use strategies the way water is used in agriculture, embracing innovative
    monitoring strategies for optimal irrigation use that take into account site-specific
    soil texture, moisture conditions, weather changes, and plant physiological conditions
    [7]. Smart, precision agriculture and DSS (Decision Support Systems) represent
    innovative approaches to monitor and increase the irrigation performances in comparison
    to traditional methods [8] and to reduce use of nutrient [9], contributing to
    reduce agricultural pressure on water quality and quantity. Lower water use due
    to precision irrigation could mitigate water scarcity caused by climate change
    [10]. In fact, considering water scarcity as the condition in which the availability
    of water resource is insufficient compared to its demand, reducing the demand
    for water helps prevent scarcity [11]. Over the past 100 years, global water demand
    has grown twice as fast as the world''s population increase. And with climate
    change in between, the situation is set to get worse in the coming decades. By
    2050, in fact, water scarcity will grow for 80% of agricultural land worldwide.
    This is revealed by a study of the Chinese Academy of Sciences that has developed
    a more complete index of water availability measurement than those used so far.
    The researchers have integrated in a single index is the so-called blue water,
    that is, the water supply that derives from irrigation from rivers, lakes and
    aquifers, both the green water, that is, the water that remains in the soil, available
    to plants, and rainfall drift. Until now, measurements were made without taking
    into account green water [11]. Water deficiency can be identified via the Water
    stress index (WSI). Initially this index was born to prevent food self-sufficiency
    in the light of the future expected droughts and a growing population in Africa.
    For this reason, the WSI has become the most widely applied measure for testing
    water scarcity. The WSI originally defined water scarcity in terms of the number
    of people competing to be supported by a single unit of water flow [12]. In 1981
    a stress index for crop water (CWSI) was formulated, based on the temperature
    difference between crown and air (T c T a) [13]: where (Tc - Ta) is measured foliage–air
    temperature differential, (Tc - Ta)LL expected lower limit of (Tc - Ta) in the
    case of a canopy which is transpiring at the potential rate, and (Tc - Ta)UL expected
    differential in the case of a non-transpiring canopy. Along with water availability
    to the plant, also its quality plays a crucial role. The Irrigation Water Quality
    Index (IWQI) [14]. Although the Index has been developed for potability assessment,
    it is used for agricultural purposes as well. El Behairy et al. [14] carried out
    a study assessing and classifying the IWQI using GIS for sustainable agricultural
    purposes. Indeed, the index include a series of parameters that are weighted such
    as i.e. salinity hazard, specific ion toxicity, trace element toxicity (Arsenic,
    Chloride, Cobalt, copper etc.) and others. The main function of precision irrigation
    is to safeguard water management because it allows to provide plants with the
    appropriate amount of irrigation water responding to the needs of crops in different
    periods of time without stress. Therefore, crop productivity is maximized with
    a minimum amount of water [15]. Among DSS, Irrigation advice systems are a useful
    tool for quantifying the water savings guaranteed by an irrigation investment,
    required by the regulations of the European investment funds (ESI) and by cohesion
    policy funds as a precondition for funding; this through the quantification of
    water amount used “ex ante” and “ex post”. At national level, the DSS as Irrigation
    advice systems have also been identified as potential tools for estimating the
    volumes withdrawn and used at regional and local level, where it was not technically
    and economically possible to install the meter. This as part of the regulatory
    actions aimed at applying water price policies based on quantification of water
    volume, implemented to comply with the ex-ante conditionalities for water resources
    applicable to the EAFRD (European agricultural fund for rural development) [16].
    Smart irrigation requires sensors to monitor soil, plant, and weather conditions.
    Through data acquisition and modeling, sensors allow the definition of precise
    differential inputs on the base of crops specific needs and thus to provide the
    necessary amount of water, avoiding over-irrigation and under-irrigation [17].
    Modern technologies not only optimize water requirements and decrease pollution,
    but also reduce costs and manual labor. In fact, farmers can easily monitor various
    parameters on smartphones or other computing devices to guide their decisions
    manually or intelligently [12]. As reported by Abioye et al. [18], 90 percent
    of farmers agree that better irrigation management through the use of mobile and
    web applications can help improve the yield and productivity of their farms. Moreover,
    historical database can help planning appropriate farming management activities.
    In general, as reported by Plaščak et al. [19], the first strategy to be evaluated
    in precision irrigation is the combination of crop and soil monitoring and crop
    growth simulation. Once this strategy is identified, the four actions underlying
    precision irrigation, namely data collection, data analysis, and system monitoring
    and evaluation, must be undertaken. In fact, precision irrigation systems require
    spatially accurate and up-to-date data through measurements taken in the field
    and collected with an array of sensors. Then, the data obtained are interpreted
    and analyzed by software to aid decision making. Finally, all the previous steps
    are implemented to avoid waste focusing on real agricultural needs allowing water
    conservation over time [20]. In light of the panorama outlined above, this review
    work expanded the scope of the literature in this research area. In detail, bibliometric
    analysis was performed as a research method to explore the structure and characteristics
    of scientific articles published on the topic of precision irrigation. Specifically,
    publications from 2001 to 2023 on Scopus were extracted to perform a bibliometric
    mapping and analysis. Then, the publications retrieved were analyzed through CiteSpace
    software (6.2.R2 −64-bit- Basic); [21] from which 10 clusters were identified
    based on the keywords used by the authors in the publications. This software allows
    you to analyze quotes in each article based on quotes from all other articles.
    Next, the software automatically creates identified clusters, based on the amount
    of cross-referencing by naming each cluster [21]. The identified clusters are
    discussed with reference to publications after 2020. A time scan of the publications
    on precision irrigation was also carried out, obtaining the list of the 20 strongest
    keywords used in the years included in the search. 2. Advanced bibliometric review
    on precision irrigation 2.1. Database search The Scopus database was accessed
    on February 27, 2023, and used to retrieve bibliographic records related to precision
    irrigation research for the period 2001–2023; 1688 publications were identified
    in the initial stages. The SCOPUS database was chosen because it contains one
    of the largest selections of scientific literature in the natural sciences [22].
    To identify relevant publications on precision irrigation, the following keywords
    were used in the combined title, abstract, and keyword fields (for each publication):
    “precision irrigation” AND “smart irrigation”. Because the Scopus search was conducted
    in February 2023, publications from 2022 to 2023 had not yet been fully entered
    into the Scopus database by Scopus staff and may be underestimated. Only terms
    that recurred in the combined title, abstract, or keyword fields at least in ten
    publication were extracted [23]. A RIS file for this search is included in Supplementary
    Information S1. 2.2. CiteSpace software CiteSpace software is designed to answer
    questions about a knowledge domain, which is a broadly defined concept covering
    a scientific field, research area, or scientific discipline. A knowledge domain
    is typically represented by a set of bibliographic records of relevant publications.
    The goal of CiteSpace is the analysis and visualization of networks. Through network
    modeling and visualization, the intellectual landscape of a knowledge domain can
    be explored [21]. Clusters are created using the tf-idf algorithm. This algorithm
    converts the different forms of the word and that of the same root into a single
    form by selecting word suffixes from the same root [24,25]. In this work, CiteSpace
    was used to examine documents related to precision irrigation between 2001 and
    2023. Keyword clustering analysis was performed which is then performed on the
    keyword co-occurrence network to obtain a knowledge map of keyword clustering
    analysis with 10 main clustering keywords. Subsequently, the analysis was performed
    to obtain the 20 keywords in strength over the period 2001–2023, thanks to which
    it was possible to estimate the year in which they began and ended their burst
    strength. In detail, the table with 20 keywords in strength was obtained through
    the Citation Burst function, which represents the detection of a burst event,
    which can last for several years and for a single year. A series of quotations
    indicates that a particular publication is associated with a wave of quotations.
    The explosion of citations in the CiteSpace occurs through the Kleinberg algorithm
    [26]. Through Citation Burst History is able to generate a summary list of articles
    associated with citations. This view shows which references have the strongest
    citation outbursts and the time periods when the strongest outbursts occurred
    [21]. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Number of publications Fig. 1 shows the trend
    in the number of publications on precision irrigation over time. From the graph,
    we can see that in 2001, publications appeared in almost no quantity until 2006.

    Fig. 1. The numbers of publications per year. In 2007, publications started to
    increase significantly, and by 2018 a total of 125 publications were detected
    in Precision Irrigation. By 2022, publications totalled 320. A first Increase
    in Publications occurred in 2007. In this period, we begin to talk about precision
    irrigation associated to wireless sensor network (Moisture Sensors of the Soil),
    control automatic system, drip irrigation and mathematical models to measure water
    management. Also, in 2019 there is a Second Increase in Publications. In these
    we begin to talk about near infrared, hyperspectral index linked to water content,
    Internet of Things (IoT), UAV, Agricultural Robot, Machine learning and Lora-Technologies.
    This shows a significant increase in the interest regarding this topic in recent
    years. The low number of publications in 2023 is due to the research including
    only the first two months of the year were considered. Therefore, the number is
    underestimated and will grow over time probably following the same pattern. Also,
    the number of publications in 2022 is underestimated because the articles are
    inserted until June of the same year because of the impact factor. Considering
    the authors’ countries affiliation, Table 2 reported the top 10 countries. In
    Table 2 it is possible to observe how the top countries are India, followed by
    the USA and China. As for the EU countries, there are Italy and Spain. Then Brazil,
    Australia, Saudi Arabia, Canada and Malaysia. In the work of Pallottino et al.
    [27] which has a range of publications between 2000 and 2016 the three top countries
    are USA, China and Germany. In contrast, in this work focused on precision irrigation
    the top country is India which probably for climate problems gives a huge contribution
    due to 400 occurences of publications by Indian authors. Regarding EU countries
    in this work there is no Germany but there is Italy and Spain which are important
    countries from an agricultural point of view. In the work of Pallottino et al.
    [27] they are at point 5 and 8 while in this work they are above Germany which
    does not appear among the top 10 top countries. Probably, Italy and Spain appear
    in the top 10 top countries for climate reasons. Other countries that invest in
    research for climate reasons and appear among the top 10 countries are Brazil,
    Australia, Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Malaysia [27]. 3.2. Cluster of research The
    visual analytics of the corresponding clusters, node by clusters on the authors’
    keywords reported by CiteSpace software was reported in Fig. 2. In this Figure
    keywords were connected by forming groups, each one corresponding to a specific
    homogeneous theme. Connecting the themes is the basis for linking the keywords
    together. The process of keyword synthesis and theme identification represents
    cluster analysis [28]. Download : Download high-res image (290KB) Download : Download

    of each group are assigned based on the quantity of keywords to selected papers.
    As shown in Fig. 2, 10 clusters were extracted numbered #0 to #10; the smaller
    the number, the more literature was included. Based on the clustering themes,
    the research on precision irrigation (2001–2023) was divided into two phases of
    the time series. The clusters were presented in the following form: cluster label
    and size of the cluster. The highest-ranking clusters (i.e., #0, i.e., the most
    numerous) are represented in the middle part compared with the lowest ranking
    clusters (i.e., #10). As observed in Fig. 3, starting with the highest cluster,

    cluster#8 WSN These two clusters will be discussed together because as can be
    seen in Fig. 3, they are also almost overlapping graphically and have strictly
    common themes, because sensors networking is strictly correlated to the Internet
    in precision irrigation. This hypothesis prompted us to discuss together these
    two clusters. One of the way farmers use the Internet for precision irrigation
    is by accessing data from weather stations and other sensors (such as WSNs, which
    are small, low-power sensors that can be placed in a field to collect data on
    soil moisture, temperature, and other environmental factors). Figorilli et al.
    [29] performed a study using an IoT open-source LoRa (long-range) soil moisture
    device and data analysis in a cultivated area in the municipality of Tenna (Trentino,
    South Tyrol, Italy) The experiment was conducted on two different apple varieties
    during summer 2019. In the study by Farooq et al. [30], a smart gateway equipped
    with WSN sensors was developed to measure water level and flow for open-channel
    precision irrigation. The smart gateway allowed water content to be delivered
    according to crop needs by calculating the amount of water based on fuzzy decisions.
    The mobile dashboard provided real-time information and control to the farmer.
    The system has been tested on a pilot scale and with a MATLAB simulation. The
    rate of moisture decline at different temperatures was tested to predict irrigation
    days. In conclusion, the Internet is a powerful tool for precision irrigation
    because it provides access to real-time data and modeling tools that can help
    farmers optimize water use and improve crop yields. In detail, WSNs enable real-time
    data collection on soil moisture and other environmental factors, can help farmers
    make more informed decisions about when and how much water to apply to crops,
    improving water use efficiency and crop yields. In addition to that a connected
    system can alert the farmer with error messages evidencing in real-time a field
    problem such as a flood, the breakage of a sensor, through the installation of
    flow meters, part of the irrigation system with consequent waste of water and
    potential damage to crops or even problem with the energy supply which means pumps
    not working or an interrupted line. 3.2.2. Cluster #1 unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) Over the past decade, the use of UAVs has enabled many practical applications
    in precision agriculture (PA). The importance of this cluster is demonstrated
    by how these vehicles enable increased agricultural productivity while reducing
    operational costs. UAVs facilitate a range of agricultural activities, including
    scanning soil health, planning irrigation schedules, planting, fertilizer application,
    and analysing weather conditions [31]. As reported by Cheng et al. [32], UAVs
    are inexpensive means to perform accurate estimation of soil moisture content
    (SMC) in the field. UAVs had similar performance to machine learning algorithms
    and were stable for SMC estimates at various depths and even produced a lower
    relative error for deeper (20 cm) estimates. Therefore, this method can be used
    to monitor SMC and support precision irrigation systems with a contained budget.
    The work of Meyan et al. [33] also showed an important help of UAVs equipped with
    sensor technologies for estimating the water status of crops and corn in particular.
    This study aimed to estimate the leaf and canopy water status of inbred corn lines
    using digital and hyperspectral UAV data. The results obtained show that the leaf
    cover extracted directly from digital images acquired by UAV is suitable to replace
    the leaf area index, improving the data availability for canopy water status estimation;
    therefore, the UAV hyperspectral camera, through the application of appropriate
    image analysis techniques, can accurately estimate the water status of inbred
    maize lines. In conclusion, UAVs are a powerful tool for precision irrigation,
    providing farmers with valuable data on crop health, soil moisture and other variables
    that can be used to optimize irrigation practices. As technology advances, it
    is likely that the role of UAVs in precision agriculture will continue to grow.
    Moreover, drone can provide additional benefit to the farm management since normally
    sensors embedded generate info also related to the crop health within the same
    flight economically maximizing the output obtained i.e., for the increasing adoption
    of fertigation and chemigation strategies. Must be added as drone flight can aid,
    not only in discriminating differences and providing watering bulletin, but also
    in detecting potential pooling and leaks in the system giving the ability to intervene
    quickly. 3.2.3. Cluster #2 crop coefficient The culture coefficient (Kc) is a
    key factor in precision irrigation, as it plays a key role in determining the
    amount of water that crops need to grow and thrive. The culture coefficient is
    a dimensionless factor that links the actual water use of a crop to its potential
    water use under ideal growing conditions. By accurately estimating the crop coefficient
    for a particular crop and growing environment, farmers can optimize their irrigation
    practices and achieve maximum crop yield. The way farmers employ the crop coefficient
    in precision irrigation is by using weather station data and other sensors to
    calculate the water needs of their crops site-specifically. Using this data in
    combination with the crop coefficient, farmers can determine the amount of water
    that their crops need to grow and adjust their irrigation programs accordingly.
    Zheng et al. [34] determined the culture coefficient (Kc) of two tea cultivars
    (Camellia sinensis), clone varieties Baiye1 (BY1) and Longjing43 (LJ43), based
    on lysimetric data, through the water balance equation. In addition, the effect
    of tea cultivars and tea pruning practices on tea Kc has been verified. The results
    showed the reliability of Kc in the tea plantation showing differences in plant
    growth on the base of Kc. This provided a solid foundation for precise irrigation
    in tea plantations in the specific subtropical climate. Kc can also be a good
    method in soil salinity. In the study conducted by Ma et al. [35], experiments
    were conducted to study cotton Kc (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under different degrees
    of soil salinization. Three grades of irrigation water were used to irrigate the
    mulched cotton. In addition, the Ks model was used to estimate saline stress under
    real conditions. This could be useful for efficient water management in cotton
    cultivation systems under mulched drip irrigation in arid regions. In conclusion,
    the specific research area represented by Cluster #2 show great potential of Kc
    being this is a critical factor in precision irrigation. The information can be
    acquired both proximally or remotely with the ais of drones for the creation of
    Kc map with temporal and spatial variability, allowing farmers to accurately estimate
    the water needs of their crops and optimize their irrigation practices to achieve
    maximum yield. 3.2.4. Cluster #4 lawn turf Precision irrigation is a valuable
    method of managing the use of water in turf production and maintenance. Indeed
    turf is a popular landscape choice in many regions, but it can be difficult to
    maintain due to its high-water requirements. Precisely to reduce the use of water
    while maintaining from the turf, you can resort to precision irrigation, such
    as drip irrigation and micro-sprinklers. A study conducted by Gu et al. [36] highlighted
    the importance of water conservation in California especially during drought seasons,
    creating an automatic irrigation system in order to minimize water use, but keeping
    the turf green. The study exploited an artificial intelligence algorithm based
    on weather data and induced irrigation models. An application was then created
    to notify the user of the irrigation rate automatically calculated by the algorithm.
    This saves money and minimizes water pollution by preserving water resources in
    dry seasons. One advantage of precision irrigation systems for lawn turf is their
    ability to deliver water directly to the roots of the grass. This can help to
    reduce water waste and improve water-use efficiency. In addition, precision irrigation
    can be customized to match the specific water requirements of different types
    of turfgrass, ensuring that each area among several, receives the appropriate
    amount of water. 3.2.5. Cluster #5 irrigation systems Also in this case, the cluster
    will be described together with cluster #9 because the latter is also a precision
    irrigation hardware and technique included in cluster#5. A key component of precision
    irrigation is the use of advanced irrigation systems that can provide water exactly
    where and when it is needed. There are several types of irrigation systems that
    are commonly used for precision irrigation, including drip irrigation, sprinkler
    irrigation, and central pivot irrigation. Drip irrigation systems are one of the
    most common types of irrigation systems used primarily for automatic irrigation
    in the beginning and now for precision irrigation purposes due to the flexibility
    they present in terms of automation. These systems use a network of small tubes
    and emitters to provide water directly to the plant roots. Drip irrigation systems
    are highly efficient, as they can provide water exactly where it is needed, minimizing
    waste, and maximizing crop yields. As for drip irrigation, AL-agele et al. [37]
    has designed and built a variable speed drip sprinkler that monitors individual
    drops of water. Unlike ordinary drip sprinklers, this sprinkler adjusts the water
    application directly by monitoring the applied volume in contrast to the uniform
    drip irrigation systems that control the water application indirectly by pressure
    compensation and operating time. This can also be used to change the distance
    reached. In this way, this tool is valid energetically going to reduce water consumption
    and related costs. Another type of irrigation that is gradually expanding is sprinkler
    irrigation. This allows the water saving and the increase of the yield showing
    further positive effects also in the precision control of water and fertilizers.
    Sprinkler irrigation systems are another irrigation system commonly used for precision
    agriculture. These systems use a series of sprinklers to provide water over a
    large area. Sprinkler irrigation systems can be highly efficient, when used in
    combination with weather sensors and other advanced technologies that allow farmers
    to adjust their irrigation programs and application rates according to the needs
    of their crops [38]. Satriyo et al. [39] conducted a study on an optimized control
    system developed via the Internet of Things to control the rain irrigation systems
    used for growing shallots. The results showed that controlled rain irrigation
    can optimize all important parameters for the plant, allowing irrigation to be
    carried out according to the desired level of soil moisture. The third type of
    precision irrigation is central pivot irrigation. These systems use a self-propelled
    long arm that rotates around a central point, providing water to crops in a circular
    pattern. Central pivot irrigation system is very popular in United States and
    other countries where big field with flat surface are presents. This system is
    under continuous developments and nowadays can be completely controlled remotely
    via specific app. Is interesting how despite in the past End Gun cam be mounted
    at the end of the pipe which is a large sprinkler used to deliver water directly
    to the corners of the field that cannot be covered by the circular pattern of
    the pivot. Central pin irrigation systems can be highly efficient, especially
    when used in combination with soil moisture sensors and other advanced technologies
    that allow farmers to optimize their irrigation practices. On this topic, Saraiva
    et al. [40] proposed a method to automatically detect and map central pin irrigation
    systems using U-Net, a convolutional neural network architecture of image segmentation,
    applied to a constellation of PlanetScope images from the Cerrado biome of Brazil.
    Through the application of the neural network, 99% accuracy and an 88% recall
    were achieved to detect and map central pin irrigation systems in the study area.
    This method was proposed to detect and map central pin irrigation systems but
    has the potential to be scaled to larger areas also to improve and monitor the
    freshwater use by agricultural activities. 3.2.6. Cluster #6 cost-effective design
    This cluster shows, like always happens with technology under development, a step
    in the TRL (Technology Readiness Level). The implementation and use of a technology
    is strictly correlated with its cost in relation to the benefits it directly produces.
    Indeed, precision irrigation is an effective way to optimize the use of water
    in agriculture, but it can also be expensive to implement. However, recent research
    have focused on developing economic projects for precision irrigation systems
    that can provide the same benefits at a lower cost. One of these is the use of
    low-cost sensors and controllers to monitor and adjust irrigation programs based
    on real-time data. A study by Plaščak et al. [19] used pivot systems for data
    collection of soil temperature and surface temperature of the plant for the development
    of automatic irrigation. These systems have been found to be very convenient thanks
    to the low cost and ease of use even for small farmers. As reported by Iqbal et
    al. [41] ground moisture sensors were built using brass, copper and steel, in
    order to improve water productivity through a precision irrigation application.
    The cost of manufacturing these sensors was 10 times lower than that of imported
    sensors. Therefore, the results of the study showed that moisture sensors made
    of steel are accurate and allow monitoring of soil moisture in real time to promote
    precision irrigation and are low-cost tools which represent a big plus since often
    sensors need to be replaced. Zhang et al. [42] ‘s work was also conducted on the
    Internet of Things (IoT) system to monitor real-time data from sensors and automate
    irrigation systems. In detail, a low-cost and easily implementable IoT system
    was used that can be used for precision crop irrigation (LoRaWAN). The system
    has had advantages related to energy consumption, communication, sensor reading
    and valve control and is implemented for precision and automatic irrigation operations
    for horticultural crops improving crop water efficiency and being cost-effective
    due to the low-cost technology in use. In conclusion, precision irrigation technologies
    are following a trend towards a reduction of the costs of the hardware and therefore
    in line with the needs of companies and farmers who need effective tools available
    at an appropriate price. In addition, there are also open-source software that
    can be used to avoid the payment of services subscriptions. 3.2.7. Cluster #7
    using machine vision This cluster focuses on data analysis. Machine vision technology
    has the potential to revolutionize precision irrigation by providing data elaborated,
    also in real-time, on plant water stress and enabling precise water delivery.
    In recent years, there has been a growing focus on the use of artificial vision
    for precision irrigation, showing very promising results [2]. In the work of Gumiere
    et al. [2] the matrix potential of a soil cultivated with cranberries has been
    monitored through a model based on machine learning comparing it with a deterministic
    model based on physics. The results showed that although both models can accurately
    predict the potential of the soil matrix in the root zone, the machine learning
    model certainly has better performance. Blasi et al. [43] has conducted work to
    provide water irrigation scheduling using artificial intelligence (machine learning)
    to detect soil humidity and temperature by means of sensors that inhibit automatic
    irrigation following the humidity level. The intelligent automatic irrigation
    system model was built using the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm, which is a machine
    learning algorithm. The model showed a predictive accuracy of 97.86%, showing
    a good potential for irrigation scheduling in agriculture. Another Machine Learning
    approach was applied by Tschand [44]. In this work was built an IoT irrigation
    network for African territories. Then, was applied a semi-supervised model used
    to train a two-way recurring neural network. Model tests had a precision percentage
    of 89.1% and a binary classification success of 96.0%. The neural network reduced
    the negative impact of water scarcity on agricultural yields. In conclusion, machine
    vision technology has the potential to greatly improve precision irrigation by
    providing real-time data on plant water stress, health and growth, but can also
    be used for other scope i.e., pests detection. Using machine vision, farmers can
    optimize water use and increase harvests, improving profitability and sustainability.
    3.2.8. Cluster #10 energy saving Probably in line with the emerging problems worldwide,
    energy increasing demand and war just to cite some of them, this Cluster acquired
    importance over the last years. Indeed, the last cluster deals with the main topic
    of precision irrigation, namely Energy saving. This is important because pumping
    and water distribution can be energy intensive processes. There are several ways
    to reduce energy consumption in precision irrigation, such as optimizing system
    design, using efficient irrigation technologies, and using renewable energy sources
    [28]. As reported by Liu et al. [28], optimizing system design can help reduce
    energy consumption in precision irrigation. The work reported that by using smaller
    tubes, friction losses are reduced, and elevation changes minimized. This can
    help reduce pumping requirement and energy consumption. In addition, the use of
    efficient irrigation technologies such as drip irrigation and micro-sprinklers
    can also help reduce energy consumption by reducing water losses and improving
    water use efficiency. Another way to reduce energy consumption in precision irrigation
    is to use renewable energy sources such as solar energy. Overall, energy saving
    is a fundamental consideration in precision irrigation, and there are several
    ways to reduce energy usage while still maintaining effective irrigation practices.
    By optimizing system design, using efficient irrigation technologies, and incorporating
    renewable energy sources, it is possible to achieve both water and energy savings
    in precision irrigation systems. 3.3. Analysis of top 20 keywords in strength
    To better represent the central keywords, we have extracted the top 20 key words
    by diffusion force (Fig. 4). In terms of burst strength, the emergence of the
    frontier of research is likely to lead to an explosion of its keywords in a short
    time, with the result that the frontier evolves into the next hot topic or disappears
    and then we can get an idea of the evolution of research topics in the field from
    burst analysis [28]. Download : Download high-res image (647KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. CiteSpace analysis of keywords within items mentioned
    in search articles retrieved from the query. The color bars on the right represent
    the following period bands. Red: burst in the use of the term; dark blue-green:
    the term was used below the threshold of burst; pale blue-green: the term was
    not used. \" Begins\" and \"Ends\" represent the time interval (i.e., \"Year\")
    in which each term has been used. The bursting period of the term is between 2001
    and 2023. There are terms that in some periods have never been used. The red bar
    is the most indicative of the use of the term and its exploding period. It can
    be observed that in the last years and therefore starting from 2021 there has
    been an explosion of some terms that are absent in the first years of research.
    These keywords are “smart agriculture”, “internet of things”, “learning algorithm”
    and “deep learning”. These words exploded in 2021 and are still in use. Probably,
    this indicates that the theme of precision irrigation via IoT sensors and deep
    learning is expanding compared to traditional methods that are no longer mentioned
    in publications in recent years. In fact, some words such as “central pivot”,
    “control system” and “artificial vision” have ended their explosion already for
    some years, leaving room for technological innovation. As shown in Fig. 1, the
    number of publications remains quite constant between 2001 and 2016 with slight
    increases, while since 2017 a drastic increase could be observed. This trend is
    closely related to that shown in Fig. 3. In fact, in Fig. 3 in recent years the
    most popular words are those related to the implementation of robotics and AI
    technologies. In fact, recently, the traditional precision irrigation techniques
    popular until 2014 are giving way to modern IoT and Machine learning techniques.
    For example, one study that highlights the importance of irrigation systems in
    precision agriculture using sensors is the research conducted by El Chami et al.
    [45]. In their study, was to evaluate the effectiveness of a low-cost wireless
    soil moisture sensor in order to determine the level of irrigation to optimize
    marketable yield, fruit quality and economic profit for tomatoes. 3.3.1. Artificial
    intelligence - AI In precision irrigation, AI is an approach that relies on machine
    learning algorithms to analyze large sets of environmental and plant growth data
    to identify models and relationships that can be used to predict irrigation strategies
    optimal [46]. The raising of AI is due to both, the development of new algorithm,
    and the strong increase of computational power achieved by computers. For example,
    Zhang et al. [46] used machine learning to develop a model for providing optimal
    irrigation programs for tomato crops in greenhouses based on environmental variables
    such as temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. The model was found to significantly
    improve crop yield and reduce water consumption compared to traditional irrigation
    methods. Another approach to precision irrigation via AI is based on decision
    support systems (DSS), which provide real-time recommendations for irrigation
    management based on data from sensors and other sources [47]. For example, Katz
    et al. [47] has developed a DSS for precision irrigation of peach orchards, using
    data from soil moisture sensors, weather stations and satellite images to provide
    recommendations for programming and watering amount. The system was found to significantly
    improve water usage efficiency and crop yield compared to traditional irrigation
    methods. The results showed that the IP was within the operating water status
    range of 15 MC, so excess irrigation was applied to the orchard. AI models, in
    addition to machine learning and DSS approaches, have also been used to predict
    demand for crop water based on plant growth phase and other factors. Among the
    different machine learning techniques that can be used in precision irrigation
    are regression analysis, decision trees, and neural networks. These techniques
    can be used to predict crop water needs, to optimize irrigation planning and to
    predict crop yields. Thus, AI in precision irrigation offers several advantages,
    including [38]: • Improved crop yield: machine learning models can optimize the
    amount and timing of irrigation, which can lead to better crop yield. • Efficient
    water use: Machine learning models can help reduce water waste by optimizing the
    amount of water used for irrigation. • Reduced costs: Efficient use of water can
    reduce irrigation costs. • Environmental benefits: Efficient use of water can
    help reduce the environmental impact of agriculture by reducing water waste and
    preserving water resources. Because of all these advantages, it can be argued
    that machine learning is a powerful technology that can be used to improve precision
    irrigation systems that will lead to more sustainable farming practices for the
    benefit of both farmers and the environment [38]. As reported by Figorilli et
    al. [29] supervised adaptive predictive models can be used for optimization and
    management of precision irrigation agricultural practices, based on data obtained
    through sensors. They are called adaptive because they are self-learning as new
    data are acquired, updating the model over time. The main model employed is based
    on the TimeLag/TimeSeries concept, which accounts for the time interval between
    water supply and soil moisture data by employing cross-correlation analysis. Through
    these models, decisions are made, which in the context of precision irrigation
    is to suggest proper water supply to keep the crop always in the optimal range
    without wasting water-soluble fertilizer and/or energy. In the consortium over
    the course of the 78 days during the dry season, a total saving of 255 mm of irrigated
    water and 44,000 kW of electricity was produced, equal to 10.82%. 3.3.2. Internet
    of things (IoT) In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) is a widely used
    approach in precision irrigation, especially for observing various information
    related to soil humidity and temperature and weather conditions. The IoT uses
    low-power wireless technologies, inexpensive devices, and cloud data centers for
    storage [48]. The advantage of IoT irrigation systems lies in the fact that they
    can be used even when farmers do not have much economic resources. In fact, these
    are mostly low-cost sensors and controllers that can be used by anyone [49]. The
    type of sensors used when there is a shortage of water are those designed to be
    operated remotely exploiting IoT ecosystems. They take precise measures for planning
    irrigation, considering parameters such as water quantity, temperature, and humidity
    [29]. Currently, technologies defined as IoT are radio frequency identification
    devices (RFID), lorawan, Zigbee, Bluetooth, Long-Term Evolution (LTE), and other
    wireless communication technologies [50]. There are several works in the literature
    on the use of IoT technologies in precision irrigation. In the work of King et
    al. [51] an IoT system was developed, consisting of several sensors in order to
    monitor the real-time weather conditions, the temperature of the crown of the
    vine, the soil moisture and the amount of irrigation. Roy et al. [52] has developed
    an IoT irrigation planning system for efficient water management in farmland.
    This low-cost sensor is easy to use and results in a 10.21% increase in crop productivity
    compared to traditional manual irrigation methods. In the study of Abioye et al.
    [50] an IoT system was created to monitor irrigation for the cultivation of the
    Mustard Leaff plant showing an excellent method to monitor the volumetric content
    of water in the soil. Thanks to the controller you will have an optimal control
    action for better water saving, reduced energy consumption and higher yields.
    In general, the IoT defines itself as an extension of the Internet to all devices
    that can communicate with electronic equipment and are connected to the Internet
    and for this it is easy to use and manage. The use of IoT sensors is a valuable
    aid for farmers who can better understand crops, reducing environmental impact
    and conserving resources, using fewer resources, such as fertilizers, water and
    seeds [53]. 4. Conclusions In conclusion, the present work showed a panorama that
    underline the potential of precision irrigation to tell farmers where and how
    much to water underlining the deriving benefits. Precision irrigation has emerged
    as a promising solution for sustainable agriculture by improving water use efficiency
    and crop productivity. With the help of advanced technologies, such as sensors,
    machine learning, and data analytics, precision irrigation systems can provide
    accurate information about soil moisture levels, plant water requirements, and
    weather conditions. By using this information to deliver water precisely where
    and when it is needed, farmers can reduce water wastage, save energy costs, and
    increase yields. Souza and Rodrigues (2022) found that through the use of precision
    irrigation it is possible to reach energy savings potentials of up to 4,8% while
    the average potential for raised profitability using precision irrigation equal
    to 16.4%. Precision irrigation not only benefits farmers but also contributes
    to the conservation of water resources and the protection of the environment.
    As precision irrigation technologies continue to advance, it is expected that
    they will play an increasingly critical role in ensuring food security and addressing
    water scarcity challenges in many regions of the world. In this regard, it was
    surprising to see that no specific clusters regarding water consumption, water
    resources depletion and irrigation efficiency were identified by the bibliometric
    analysis. Precision irrigation has already gained significant traction in regions
    with limited water resources, advanced technology and knowledge availability or
    facing frequent droughts, such as the Middle East, America, Australia, and parts
    of Africa. However, there is still a long way to go before precision irrigation
    becomes a mainstream solution for agriculture globally. The high initial investment
    cost and technical complexity of precision irrigation systems pose a barrier for
    many small-scale farmers. Thus, governments and other stakeholders must work towards
    creating incentives and programs that support the adoption of precision irrigation.
    Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in compliance with Water framework Directive
    (WFD) and Farm to Fork Strategy, promote agriculture and precision irrigation
    as sustainable agronomic practices able for contributing to society''s needs in
    terms of nutrition and health. Furthermore, when providing investment support,
    Member States are required to pay particular attention to the cross-cutting objective
    of modernizing agriculture, promoting innovation and digitalisation in agriculture
    and rural areas. Support for the modernization and development of irrigation infrastructure
    is permitted only where it does not compromise the good quality status of the
    water. Italian CAP Strategic Plan identifies adaptation to climate change and
    rationalization of the use of water for irrigation purposes as one of the priority
    objectives to be pursued, in compliance with the territorial needs and the environmental
    objectives defined at River Basin District level. Therefore, it provides both
    support to investments in more efficient irrigation systems (through investment
    measures) and the adoption (through agro-environmental-climate measures) of agricultural
    practices and Decision Support Systems (DSS), to rationalize the use of fertilizers,
    plant protection products and water, allowing an efficient use of resources and
    the reduction of pollution. Even in the context of Italian Recovery and Resilience
    Plan, under the Next Generation EU, investments for innovation and the digitization
    of irrigation are envisaged. In particular, the investment program for Innovation
    and mechanization in the agricultural and food sector, in charge of Italian Ministry
    of Agriculture, finances the implementation of smart technologies for irrigation
    and water management on farms. Additionally, continuous research and development
    are crucial for improving the efficiency and affordability of precision irrigation
    systems. By addressing these challenges, we can unlock the full potential of precision
    irrigation in sustainable agriculture and ensure a more resilient and food-secure
    future for all. Ethics statement Not applicable: This manuscript does not include

  description: Global drylands, covering about 41% of Earth’s surface and inhabited
    by 38% of the world’s population, are facing the stark challenges of water scarcity,
    low water productivity, and food insecurity. This paper highlights the major constraints
    to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods, and associated
    challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use efficiency (WUE), conserve
    water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different smart irrigation approaches.
    Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods (based on weather, plant,
    and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important information needed for precise
    irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation of fields. On the other hand,
    by using several factors, including soil and climate variation, soil properties,
    plant responses to water deficits, and changes in weather factors, smart irrigation
    can drive better irrigation decisions that can help save water and increase yields.
    Various smart irrigation approaches, such as artificial intelligence and deep
    learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent
    system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, variable rate
    irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) could ensure
    high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions. These smart irrigation technologies
    can improve water management and accelerate the progress in achieving multiple
    Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where no one gets left behind.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Global drylands, covering about 41% of Earth’s
    surface and inhabited by 38% of the world’s population, are facing the stark challenges
    of water scarcity, low water productivity, and food insecurity. This paper highlights
    the major constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling
    methods, and associated challenges, efforts, and progress to enhance water use
    efficiency (WUE), conserve water, and guarantee food security by overviewing different
    smart irrigation approaches. Widely used traditional irrigation scheduling methods
    (based on weather, plant, and soil moisture conditions) usually lack important
    information needed for precise irrigation, which leads to over- or under-irrigation
    of fields. On the other hand, by using several factors, including soil and climate
    variation, soil properties, plant responses to water deficits, and changes in
    weather factors, smart irrigation can drive better irrigation decisions that can
    help save water and increase yields. Various smart irrigation approaches, such
    as artificial intelligence and deep learning (artificial neural network, fuzzy
    logic, expert system, hybrid intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive
    irrigation systems, variable rate irrigation (VRI) technology, and unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) could ensure high water use efficiency in water-scarce regions.
    These smart irrigation technologies can improve water management and accelerate
    the progress in achieving multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where
    no one gets left behind. Keywords: drylands; food insecurity; irrigation management;
    smart irrigation; sustainable development goals; water scarcity 1. Introduction
    Drylands (hyper-arid, arid, semiarid, and dry sub-humid parts) occupy 41% of Earth’s
    surface, supporting 38% of global population [1,2]. Agriculture and pastoralism
    are the major livelihood sources for most of the population, largely dependent
    upon natural resources [3]. About 70% of the world’s drylands exist in developing
    countries where people are confronting the stark challenge of poverty, food insecurity,
    malnourishment, poor economic conditions, and marginalization [4,5]. Water availability
    and agricultural productivity are the most pressing issues associated with drylands
    and land degradation [6]. Globally, water scarcity is already affecting 1–2 billion
    people, and a majority of them are concentrated in drylands, where the supply
    of water is insufficient to meet the user demands [7]. Future climate projections
    also suggest that in coming decades more people will be facing huge shortages
    of water. Consequently, climate change and water management decisions will adversely
    affect drylands and their inhabitants [8]. As global population is increasing
    rapidly, agricultural productivity in drylands needs improvement to meet food
    security demands. Therefore, adopting smart irrigation approaches is a viable
    option to better utilize the available water resources and improve water productivity
    in drylands. Water scarcity has become one of the critical issues and threatens
    the sustainable development in drylands [9]. Water scarcity occurs when water
    demand becomes equal or even exceeds the total available fresh water resources
    [10]. Water scarcity should be considered from both physical and economic perspectives
    [11]. Physical water scarcity has two aspects: green water scarcity (soil moisture
    in root zone is insufficient to meet crop water demands), and blue water scarcity
    (both surface and ground water availability is unable to meet human water needs)
    [12]. The economic water scarcity occurs when water resources are physically available,
    but lack of institutional capacity and socioeconomic conditions limit the use
    of that water [13]. Water scarcity negatively impacts social integrity and sustainable
    economic development, especially in drylands. The primary sector, which is seriously
    affected, is agriculture, utilizing more than 80% of total fresh water [14]. Intensification
    of agricultural water scarcity could affect food production and threaten food
    security in drylands in the future [15]. Further, it may seriously impact the
    associated Sustainable Development Goals of SDG-2 (Zero hunger), SDG-6 (Clean
    water), SDG-7 (Clean and affordable energy), SDG 15.3 (Desertification control)
    and SDG-14 (Life below water), which are directly or indirectly dependent on water
    availability [16,17]. Since the available water resources are limited and to obtain
    more yields with less water use, efficient management of available water with
    improved water productivity is direly needed to meet future food demands [18].
    Managing irrigation efficiently is challenging in drylands because there are so
    many factors to take into account, such as crop type, climate, soil type, and
    irrigation methods [19]. Drylands are characterized by high potential evapotranspiration,
    low and erratic rainfall and high temperature [20]. Additionally, predicted extreme
    weather events due to climate change will further worsen the situation. Besides
    hostile environmental conditions, increasing water scarcity in these regions is
    posing serious threats to irrigated agriculture and sustained food production
    [16]. Although agriculture consumes about 80% of the total water utilized in the
    agriculture sector globally [14], this irrigation generates a lower return per
    unit of water used than other economic sectors [21]. The use of traditional irrigation
    methods and low water use efficiency (35–40%) caused by poor management are major
    constraints to sustainable crop production in drylands [22,23]. Moreover, farmers
    in these regions still rely on traditional irrigation systems that manifest the
    lowest WUE. This situation puts enormous pressure on the agriculture sector to
    become more efficient in irrigation water use and evoked the call for a “Blue
    Revolution” in water-limited agricultural regions “to produce more crop per drop
    of water.” Efficient water-saving irrigation approaches, especially the application
    of smart irrigation systems, have the potential to meet this critical challenge
    in dryland productivity. A smart irrigation system applies water in the right
    amount, at the right time and place, in a field [24]. Smart irrigation offers
    better irrigation decision-making by using several factors, including soil and
    climate variation, soil hydraulic properties, plant responses to water deficits,
    and changes in weather factors, that can help save water and increase yields [25].
    By using smart irrigation systems, farmers can save precious resources without
    exposing plants to moisture deficiencies [26]. Smart irrigation has been argued
    as a way to manage soil variability and gain economic benefits by fulfilling the
    specific irrigation demands of individual crops [27]. It is also implied that
    the smart irrigation system will be managed in such a way that will enable nutrients
    and water to be delivered directly to the plant roots [28]. To the best of our
    knowledge, studies addressing the issue of low water productivity in dryland agriculture
    and its improvement through adoption of smart irrigation approaches is limited.
    Therefore, the specific objectives of this article were (i) to present an overview
    of the constraints of low water use efficiency in dryland agriculture, (ii) to
    assess the conventional irrigation scheduling methods, and (iii) to examine the
    feasibility and benefits of smart irrigation systems for better irrigation management
    to enhance water productivity in water-scarce regions. 2. Major Constraints of
    Agricultural Productivity in Drylands 2.1. Land Degradation Natural processes
    such as vegetation loss, wildfires, overgrazing, climate change, wind and water
    erosion and other adverse/destructive anthropogenic activities cause land degradation
    (Figure 1) [3,29]. This causes a substantial decline in the functional capabilities
    of those specific areas, negatively influences agricultural activities and productivity
    and natural resources management, creates economic loss, and loss in biological
    activity [30]. Generally, land degradation is more critical or serious in dryland,
    semiarid and arid areas [31]. These include some parts of central Asia, China,
    Africa and the Mediterranean basin [32]. Land degradation in Africa highly impacts
    Somalia, Eritrea, and Ethiopia (horn of Africa) [33]. A prominent sign of land
    degradation is the occurrence of unexpected climatic conditions and vegetative
    stress [34]. Moreover, low levels of soil nitrogen and organic carbon (C) show
    a state of land degradation that leads to very low soil fertility [35]. Stavi
    and Lal [36] reported that land degradation increases by 5–10 million hectares
    every year globally. Ibrahim et al. [37] found that the increase in land degradation
    observed in the Africa Saharan region was mainly due to the increase in drought
    frequency from 1968–1990. Figure 1. Global distribution of land degradation based
    on severity of human-induced pressure [29]. To gain insight into land degradation
    intensity, statistical methods and models have been utilized using data collected
    over the years. These models allow precise predictions about land degradation
    intensity [38]. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is one of the methods
    used to measure the vegetation mass over a specific area [39]. NDVI represents
    the vegetation state of an area in terms of numerical values. If numerical values
    are negative, it means there is a reduction in vegetation. A study carried out
    by Ibrahim et al. [37] using residual trend analysis of NDVI showed substantial
    evidence of soil degradation in sub-Saharan West Africa. The study also highlighted
    the drought occurrence caused by vegetation decline in Africa. Pravalie et al.
    [40] reported that the impending increase in land degradation is posing serious
    threats to the people of developing countries. Disease proliferation, decrease
    in crop yields and increasing armed conflicts are the major outcomes of land deterioration.
    A possible solution to land degradation is to achieve a state of land degradation
    neutrality (LDN) [41]. LDN is a state where land is retained in a stable condition
    capable of enduring biological functions including facilitating appropriate food
    security [42]. Sustainable land management practices such as soil amendments (addition
    of biochar, manuring, composting) to restore degraded lands could be used to decrease
    the effects of land degradation [43]. 2.2. Water Scarcity Issues and Sustainable
    Development Goals Water availability is one of the main indicators of land degradation,
    and upsurge in land degradation is potentially aggravating water scarcity [44,45].
    Availability of water is jeopardized by lessening of ground and surface water
    due to reduction in biomass [46]. This results in less water available for agricultural
    (Figure 2) [16] and domestic use. Scarcity of water is an indicator of safe water;
    hence, water scarcity is a deficiency in fresh water resources to meet the standard
    water demand [11]. Successful achievement of SDGs is dependent upon the water
    security of both human and environmental systems (Figure 3) because water is directly
    linked to all SDGs [7]. The leading reasons for water scarcity are droughts, climate
    change, and inaccessibility and inadequate management of resources [47]. Rosa
    et al. [16] reported that in 2012, almost 2.3 billion people did not have access
    to safe water. Access to safe water is an important factor as it decreases disease
    frequency and social problems, including unemployment, malnutrition, and poverty
    [48]. Agriculture and industrial sectors use the largest proportion of water,
    and this water is usually drawn from below ground, lakes and rivers [49]. Falkenmark
    [50] reported that water scarcity poses substantial threats to the agriculture
    sector, which requires sufficient quantity of water for irrigation. Crop production
    and food security are directly dependent on sufficient water availability [51].
    Water scarcity leads to plant stress, resulting in various environmental problems,
    such as intensified soil erosion and salt concentration [52]. Increasing climate
    change, land degradation, and population necessitate the development of effective
    management systems to wisely mitigate water scarcity [53,54,55]. Figure 2. The
    global distribution of agricultural blue water scarcity (BWS), green water scarcity
    (GWS), and economic water scarcity (EWS) [16]. Figure 3. Interlinkage of SDGs
    and water highlighting the importance of water security for humans and environment.
    Liu et al. [12] described the common indicators employed to evaluate water scarcity,
    such as IWMI, (a system that evaluates the economic and physical changes influencing
    the availability of water within a country), the criticality ratio (a ratio of
    water consumption to the available water resources) and Falkenmark indicator (which
    compares the quantity of available water against the number of people who consume
    that water). Water stress and crowding indices may also be employed to measure
    water scarcity in a country. These indices also estimate the decrease or increase
    in water scarcity. Efforts are required to curtail the water scarcity issues.
    In this regard, implementing efficient water use practices and managing water
    in high-risk regions are important aspects to address [45]. These efforts could
    decrease water scarcity and increase access to adequate agricultural and drinking
    water. Moreover, by taking care of structural and social customs, governments
    can effectively resolve major conflicts. Hence, joint efforts are needed from
    governments and research institutes to resolve the water scarcity problem successfully
    [56]. 2.3. Climate Variability Variations/changes in climatic conditions often
    impact human, biological and agricultural systems through decreasing water resources,
    rising global temperatures, heavy precipitation, elevation in permafrost thawing,
    worsening water and air quality, rise in sea level, health risk, food supply and
    availability, intense drought, disturbing rainfall periods, and devastating effects
    on coastal infrastructure [57,58]. East Africa is an example of climatic anomalies,
    and the progression of increased rainy seasons, droughts and temperatures is detrimental
    to the development of this area [59]. In Tanzania, crop data techniques predicted
    a yield reduction of 7.6%, 8.8%, and 13% in rice, sorghum and maize by 2050, respectively
    [3]. The impacts of variation in climatic events are significantly negative [60],
    for example, the Mediterranean Basin has shown a prominent rise in average temperatures
    beyond global changes, with significant impacts on plant processes and water resources
    [61]. Climatic variation may induce a significant reduction in crop growth and
    productivity and increase vector-borne diseases, thus threatening food security
    [62]. Heavy rain and early frost may have negative effects on flowering periods
    and induce frost damage, while dry seasons or droughts largely decrease the decomposition
    of soil organic matter [63]. Such alterations induce negative impacts on biological
    systems. Fitness of the population is one of the main factors negatively affecting
    community structures and population dynamics [64]. Thus, it becomes vital to develop
    mitigation practices to decrease climate change impacts on agriculture. Several
    mitigation protocols for climate change impacts suggested by Haussmann et al.
    [65] and Gomez-Zavaglia et al. [66] are: (i) developing skills for water management,
    (ii) improving methods of breeding selection, (iii) capacity building of farmers,
    (iv) genetically improved seeds with better adaptation to increased temperatures,
    (v) reducing livestock and crop emissions, (vi) changes in net irrigation, and
    (vii) sequestering carbon in soils. 2.4. Overexploitation of Groundwater Increasing
    economic growth has resulted in continuous demand for water, leading to groundwater
    overexploitation, especially in big cities [67]. Both humans and the environment
    rely heavily upon groundwater; therefore, understanding its environmental implications
    is vital [68]. Over-pumping of water is a global issue, primarily caused via agricultural
    water use. Among its effects are the drying of wetlands and streams, phreatophytic
    vegetation elimination, soil subsidence, storage loss, decline in groundwater
    level, increased pumping cost, and soil salinization [69,70]. Recently, the exploitation
    of groundwater resources has become increasingly critical, especially in semiarid
    and arid coastal areas. In these regions, the coastal aquifers are at risk due
    to the intrusion of salty marine water. For example, Tripoli in northwestern Libya
    has been experiencing progressive seawater intrusion into its coastal aquifers
    since the 1930s due to its ever-growing demand for water [71]. Groundwater overexploitation
    not only causes water-quality degradation and aquifer depletion but also influences
    the ecological stability of wetlands and streams, resulting in substantial losses
    of biodiversity and habitat. Therefore, societies should realize that water resources
    are vulnerable and finite and discover methods to resolve the stresses of human
    development on nature’s tolerance. Educating the public about human influences
    on the environment is the first step toward sustainable water use. 2.5. Socioeconomic
    Drivers The adverse impacts on water availability, agricultural productivity,
    and economic feasibility have been correlated with the displacement of residents
    [49]. Countries dependent on other countries’ agricultural productive capabilities
    are also seriously affected. Food insecurity and hunger are common outcomes of
    poor agricultural production phases for millions who are dependent on agriculture
    [72]. The 1980s famine in Africa resulted from a decline in agricultural productivity
    [73,74]. Generally, droughts indicate decreased food security [75]. Between 1992
    and 1995, drought periods aggravated already problematic conditions in Africa.
    There was income loss for farmers, a rise in unemployment, and a decline in maize
    export to neighboring states. Moreover, there was an emergence in incurred service
    debts through farmers [76]. Gebremskel et al. [33] stated that drought periods
    in East Africa have caused more than 0.5 million deaths and financial losses up
    to US $1,500,000. Several rural residents heavily rely on land productivity. Thus,
    rising water scarcity, land degradation and drought frequency cause adverse effects
    on people’s lives [77]. Couttenier et al. [78] reported that social conflict could
    erupt as a result of decreased availability of farmland and water (e.g., civil
    war in Darfur). Rifts for agricultural resources and farmland often generate deadly
    circumstances. Ongoing conflicts among Fulani herdsmen farmers in Nigeria are
    another example of such conflicts. These conflicts resulted in 68% of total deaths
    in north-central Nigeria [79]. 2.6. Droughts Drought is a condition of abnormally
    dry weather sufficiently prolonged, lacking water to induce hydrologic imbalance
    and constraining agricultural activities in the affected region [80]. Drought
    types such as inter-annual droughts stay longer and decrease crop productivity,
    whereas inter-seasonal drought may be short and controlled via efficient water
    management [81]. Hermans and McLeman [82] reported that repeated occurrence of
    drought contributed towards degradation of land. Henchiri [83] reported that sub-Saharan
    Africa has faced long periods of drought with greater intensity. Nijbroek et al.
    [84] demonstrated that Namibia is an arid country and faced drought for many years,
    as well as neighboring counties of South Africa being liable to droughts repeatedly
    triggered by El Niño—Southern Oscillation (ENSO), a system of warm seawater that
    passes over the Pacific about every 10 years. Climate change could trigger desertification,
    induce natural calamities and environmental susceptibility. An increase in drought
    frequency is also expected because of climate change [85]. Droughts cause extreme
    distress to food security, agricultural productivity, and the economy [81]. Losses
    of up to US $120,000,000,000 were noted over a period of 30 years in Europe. In
    southern Africa, more than 10,000,000 tons of food was needed in terms of aid
    to drought-affected areas [3]. Africa has an unpleasant history of droughts with
    devastating effects on food security [86]. The most disturbing drought was during
    1991–1992. It caused a huge loss in agricultural productivity, massive unemployment,
    and economic despair. Given the detrimental effects of drought, it is important
    to improve agricultural practices in response to droughts. One such practice is
    environmental restoration. Land restoration helps to reduce land degradation impacts
    [87]. Rigorous land restoration can be attained through tree plantations in degraded
    lands. Alternatively, in situ planting of seeds that could lead to natural regeneration
    may also be used [87]. Predicting droughts is also useful for proper mitigation.
    Recently, scientists in Kenya introduced a technology by satellite analysis, which
    can forecast droughts with 90% accuracy [88]. Moreover, better water management
    techniques and planting drought-resistant trees and crops may remove the distressing
    damage droughts have on the agriculture. Thus, most African nations should focus
    on irrigation as a method to reduce drought impacts (Figure 4) [89]. Figure 4.
    Countries affected by drought in 2020–2022 [89]. 2.7. Conventional Technology
    In dryland regions, most farmers employ old farming techniques that result in
    failure to manage food for increasing populations [90]. The traditional farming
    techniques generate little food [3]. Agriculture conservation (crop rotation,
    soil cover and minimum tillage) could help to enhance crop yields with increasing
    profitability and decreasing soil degradation [91]. Some techniques are not used
    by subsistence farmers mainly because of unfamiliarity [92]. The implication of
    microbial-resistant varieties or seeds is less common in Africa [93]. These advancements
    have the capability to improve yield and increase stress tolerance. Nonetheless,
    most farmers in rural areas are lacking access to services and information to
    be effectively used in their favor [94]. Sarkar et al. [95] reported that the
    use of modern techniques is helpful and provides opportunities to farmers for
    increasing the crop yields. Digitizing farming methods permits farmers to guess
    the yield and weather forecast, select suitable crops according to the area, and
    improve irrigation systems. Nuclear technology is also used as a tool to increase
    yield via radioactive isotope utilization. These are used as early detectors and
    tracers of the existence of diseases. Moreover, applying nuclear technology in
    agricultural practices can increase crop productivity by 40%, improve soil structure
    and texture, and decrease labor and input costs [96]. Nonetheless, the main hindrance
    is that modern farming techniques and technologies are not available to the majority
    of farmers in dryland areas. 3. Traditional Approaches Used for Irrigation Scheduling
    The amount of water and its application timing is crucial in irrigation scheduling
    (IS), either in agriculture or landscapes [97,98]. Irrigation water requirement
    is measured following a criterion that determines irrigation needs and methods
    to apply a calculated amount of water [18]. In order to use irrigation water efficiently,
    we have to understand the dynamics of plant water use, together with weather,
    plant physiology, and soil properties. Among the various irrigation scheduling
    approaches developed and suggested, three types are most important: weather-based,
    soil moisture-based, and plant water status-based [28,99]. 3.1. Weather-Based
    Irrigation Scheduling In weather-based irrigation planning, reference evapotranspiration
    (ET0) is calculated by measuring the weather elements that reflect the amount
    of water lost via plants and soil [28]. Solar radiation, humidity, air temperature
    and wind speed influence the quantity of water lost through evapotranspiration.
    In the absence of soil and plant measurements, weather attributes are used to
    determine irrigation schedules based on evapotranspiration [100]. Reference evapotranspiration
    can be calculated following the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by measuring the
    solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature and humidity [100,101]. Daily crop
    water use can be calculated by: ETc = Kc × ET0 where ETc = crop evapotranspiration
    (mm day−1), Kc = crop coefficient, and ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm
    day−1). The method is strongly dependent on (1) the accurate calculation of ET0,
    (2) better Kc curve development over the entire crop-growing season, (3) determination
    of soil water-holding capacity by analyzing soil properties, and (4) quantifying
    site-specific rainfall [102]. Mostly, real-time weather monitoring systems are
    equipped with an automatic weather station containing sensors for temperature,
    rainfall, wind speed, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and solar radiation [103].
    These data loggers are designed to obtain data automatically at periodic intervals,
    and these data are transferred to an online data access portal. Data loggers communicate
    with remote servers using a wireless sensor network (WSN) or Internet of Things
    (IoT) framework [18]. WSN is one of the most popular technological methods that
    is used to precisely monitor the weather and environmental parameters [104,105,106,107,108].
    These data finally reach smart irrigation controllers, which in combination with
    site-specific variables (e.g., soil type), set up the irrigation schedule. The
    selection and performance of a weather monitoring system depends upon different
    accuracy, installation, robustness, data acquisition, maintenance, and power requirements.
    An IoT-based weather monitoring system demonstrated by Wasson et al. [109] monitors
    and analyzes the crop environment in terms of wind speed, temperature, solar radiation,
    soil moisture, and humidity using various weather-based sensors connected through
    a wireless network for data transfer and web-based services. Likewise, Khoa et
    al. [110] implemented an IoT platform for smart irrigation management. They suggested
    an innovative topology of sensor nodes with low cost. The authors were satisfied
    with the performance of the LoRa LPWAN (long-range low-power wide area network)
    technology transmission module system. A multiagent-based monitoring approach
    consisting of an open-source platform (PANGEA) was used to collect data on weather
    elements and soil moisture via different sensors. This platform is equipped with
    several master and slave nodes connected through sensors for data transfer [111].
    Many researchers [112,113,114] have also employed WSN and IoT based platforms
    for weather-based monitoring and reported satisfactory performance of the systems.
    Although weather-based irrigation scheduling is widely practiced, the heterogeneity
    of soil properties used to estimate soil water volume affects the amount of available
    soil water. In addition to that, spatiotemporal, variability in large-scale evapotranspiration
    is another challenge confronted by this approach. 3.2. Plant-Based Irrigation
    Scheduling Plant-based irrigation scheduling mainly relies on several indices
    indicating plant water status [115]. The relationship between soil moisture deficit
    and crop water stress helps to determine irrigation scheduling. Plant-based irrigation
    scheduling is sensitive to measurements conducted at a specific crop stage to
    determine water deficit in plants [18]. Since varying plant species, plant tissues,
    and crop growth stages have variable sensitivity to moisture deficit, several
    plant-based stress measurements have been suggested for irrigation scheduling
    [99]. There are two principal categories based on plant variable measurements
    used for irrigation scheduling: firstly, plant water status-based direct measurements
    including leaf, stem, and xylem water potential status and indirect measurements
    pertinent to leaf thickness, turgor pressure, and trunk diameter [116,117]; and
    secondly, plant physiology-based estimates including sap flow, stomatal conductance,
    xylem cavitation, and thermal sensing [118]. A leaf turgor pressure sensor estimates
    the relative change in leaf turgor pressure to determine leaf water stress [119].
    In addition to transpiration water loss, root water uptake and cellular osmotic
    pressure determine the magnitude of turgor pressure. For example, a ZIM probe
    (leaf turgor pressure sensor) is a noninvasive leaf patch clamp pressure probe
    that can detect leaf turgor pressure. ZIM probes are capable of measuring even
    minute shifts of turgor pressure within leaves in real time [119,120]. Due to
    advanced electronic technologies, researchers have developed small leaf sensors
    and tested them against cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum
    L.) plants. Leaf thickness-based irrigation timing improved WUE by 25–45% compared
    to preset irrigation plans [121]. In another study, Afzal et al. [122] reported
    that leaf thickness and leaf electrical capacitance (CAP) could be employed for
    leaf water status monitoring. Based on energy balance and heat pulse, thermal
    sensors have been developed to determine sap flow from plant stems, assisting
    irrigation scheduling. Sap-flow methods are able to provide in situ measurements
    of plant water use and transpiration dynamics. The Dynagage sap-flow sensors are
    the latest ones used to estimate sap flow and thus the water consumption by plant.
    The amount of heat utilized by the sap is measured by the energy balance sensors
    and gives the real-time sap flow in grams or kilograms per hour. These sensors
    require no calibration and offer an efficient and affordable method to determine
    the water use of plants [28]. During transpiration, the water in the xylem subjected
    to tension is directly proportional to the deficit in water to the point where
    the water columns can rupture or cavitate [123]. This cavitation leads to the
    eruptive formation of a bubble that contains water vapor [124]. Audio or ultrasonic
    frequency signals can detect these cavitation events, and the associated embolisms
    can hinder water flow [116]. Detection of such ultrasonic acoustic emissions (AEs)
    indicates plant stress and cavitation events. Thus, the AE rate can be used as
    a sensor to detect plant stress. Stem Diameter Fluctuations Stem and fruit diameter
    experience diurnal fluctuations due to changing water content [125]. Various water
    stress indicators can be determined by analyzing the daily patterns of stem diameter
    variation (SDV) [126]. The maximum daily shrinkage (MDS) and stem growth rate
    (SGR) are commonly used indicators for scheduling irrigation [115]. Currently,
    different optical sensors are used to detect plant water status, nutrient level
    and health condition. Two types of optical sensors (contact and noncontact) are
    primarily used [18]. Contact sensors are physically connected to plants, whereas
    noncontact sensors are vehicle-mounted, fixed, handled, or remotely controlled
    (aerial vehicles or satellite data) [28]. In many studies, monitoring through
    unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with high-resolution cameras helped to generate
    irrigation maps over large cropped areas [127,128]. In another study, Lozoya et
    al. [129] used a sensor network to control green pepper growth under four different
    irrigation designs. Bauer and Aschenbruck [130] employed IoT and sensor network
    integration to monitor leaf area for optimizing irrigation. Several factors other
    than water content can affect the SDV-derived index, such as plant age, crop load,
    and field management practices. Furthermore, SDV estimates are usually affected
    by small raindrops and animals [131]. Canopy temperature measurement is another
    key method commonly employed for irrigation scheduling. Major canopy temperature-based
    methods include the crop water stress index (CWSI), temperature–time threshold
    (TTT), and temperature stress day (TSD) [132,133,134]. Infrared thermometers and
    thermal cameras are used to detect temperature. However, diurnal dynamics of temperature
    remain a major challenge for all the canopy temperature-based methods [99]. A
    major drawback of using plant-based sensors for irrigation management is that
    they lack direct estimates of irrigation water amount to be applied. Soil textural
    variability is another challenge affecting the accurate estimation of irrigation
    amounts needed. 3.3. Irrigation Scheduling Based on Soil Moisture Soil moisture
    monitoring is one of the fundamental approaches used for irrigation scheduling,
    and it is conducted by determining the soil water content or the soil water potential
    [135]. Monitoring soil moisture at high spatial and temporal resolution is critical
    for optimal irrigation scheduling [28]. Different types of sensors, such as time-domain
    transmission, neutron probes, granular matrix, and capacitance, are commonly implemented
    for soil moisture determination [136]. Gravimetric sampling to estimate soil moisture
    fluxes and a tensiometer is also used to measure soil matric potential, reflecting
    the amount of soil water available for plant use [99]. With the advancement of
    technology, satellite and groundwater sensors are becoming popular as irrigation
    tools. Soil moisture sensors can be installed at multiple depths in the field
    and capture soil moisture dynamics. They enhance accuracy and improve understanding
    of changes appearing in soil water content pertinent to crop water use and irrigation
    [137]. Soil sensors also provide information about soil chemical, physical and
    mechanical properties obtained in the form of optical, electrical, mechanical,
    electromagnetic, acoustic, radiometric, and pneumatic measurements [138]. Measurement
    of these attributes assists in the estimation of maximum allowable depletion [139].
    Soil moisture sensors estimate the volumetric moisture content (VMC) by detecting
    changes in soil electrical and thermal properties [140]. Frequency-domain reflectometry
    sensors (FDR) can estimate field soil moisture content [129]. The sensors are
    put near the crop roots and show a moisture content range of 0–50% with 0.1% resolution,
    thus optimizing water use for vegetables. Shigeta et al. [141] found that real-time
    soil moisture sensing can be used in practical measurements of soil moisture fluxes
    by correlating the VWC of the soil with the capacitance of sensors inserted in
    the soil. In TDR sensors, two parallel rods are inserted at the desired depth
    to measure the soil moisture content. The rate of the electromagnetic pulse, which
    radiates from the sensor into the soil and returns to the soil surface, is directly
    proportional to soil water content. However, this is an expensive method for farmers.
    Other studies [142,143,144] interconnected IoT-based field monitoring with cloud-based
    monitoring and data analysis using an Ardunio controller. They found that the
    collected data were used to make predictions that helped reduce water consumption
    and improve crop yields. In another study, six capacitance-based sensors were
    used at three locations with a data logger [145]. This method improved the WUE
    compared to traditional approaches. Soil moisture-based irrigation scheduling
    has the disadvantage that plant water uptake and stress are affected by soil moisture
    content and also influenced by environmental conditions, pests and diseases, root
    zone salinity, and nutrient availability. Variation in soil properties also affects
    irrigation scheduling, which necessitates soil testing at multiple points for
    accurate estimation of soil moisture content. 4. Innovative Smart Irrigation Approaches
    A smart irrigation system consists of firmware, software, and hardware interconnected
    via various computational techniques, including artificial intelligence (AI) and
    deep learning (DL) etc., which ensures the right amount of water at the appropriate
    time in crops to improve WUE, increase yield, reduce fertilizer use, reduce labor
    cost, and save energy [146]. Various control methods are employed to improve irrigation
    system efficiency by monitoring variables such as canopy and air temperature,
    evapotranspiration, rainfall, and solar radiation. By integrating information
    from multiple sources, smart irrigation systems can significantly improve crop
    production and resource management [147]. The following section presents various
    recent techniques associated with smart irrigation systems in agriculture. 4.1.
    State-of-the-Art Smart Irrigation Technologies 4.1.1. Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) and Deep Learning AI is a machine’s ability to learn and implement tasks
    similar to those of a human brain, and it is powered by computers [148]. When
    applied to a certain problem domain, AI algorithms can mimic human decision-making.
    Irrigation systems have been integrated with AI for adaptive decision-making through
    fuzzy logic, expert systems, and ANNs [149]. An artificial neural network (ANN)
    is an algorithm for processing information that is inspired by the working of
    the human brain [150]. Like human brain neurons, an ANN also contains a neural
    network, but synapses are substituted with biased connections and weights [151].
    This facilitates the mapping of input and output relationships [152]. ANN-based
    control systems can learn and adapt to the variable dynamics, making them ideal
    for irrigation systems. Additionally, ANNs have been used as smart strategies
    in dealing with the issue of formulating mathematical models based on first principles.
    Recently, many researchers have employed ANN methods for irrigation scheduling.
    Using the AQUACROP model integrated with a dynamic neural network, Adeyemi et
    al. (2018) [149] simulated soil moisture for a potato crop. Karasekreter et al.
    [153] demonstrated energy and water savings up to 23.9% and 20.5%, respectively,
    by implementing an ANN integrated with soil physical properties and moisture content
    in a strawberry orchard. Umair and Muhammad [154] designed an ANN-based controller
    model in MATLAB using climate variables as input. A fuzzy logic system is an extension
    of Boolean logic that expresses logical values in the form of true or false and
    demonstrates the nonlinearity and uncertainty in real-world problems [155]. The
    fuzzy system uses different sets of input data to categorize data in membership
    classes, and then applies a decision rule to every set to produce human-like decision
    outputs [103]. Many researchers have recommended the use of fuzzy logic in irrigation
    control systems. Mendes et al. [156] designed a fuzzy inference system that can
    control the speed of the central pivot according to the spatial field variability.
    A fuzzy irrigation system developed by Mousa et al. [157] was used to compute
    evapotranspiration (ETo) via a fuzzy inference system using weather variables
    as input. They found that the fuzzy model was accurate and quick in obtaining
    the required evapotranspiration and net irrigation to recover the water loss.
    An expert system is another type of intelligent system used for irrigation control.
    Basically, an expert system is a computer program that simulates the verdict and
    behavior of an individual or organization with expertise in a certain area through
    the use of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies [158]. Expert systems can
    be used for problem-solving activities such as monitoring, control, planning,
    forecasting, prescribing, fusion, and decision-making [159]. An expert-controlled
    irrigation system enables farmers to quantify the water amount needed by crops
    at the appropriate time by considering the weather and soil conditions. Many researchers
    [160,161] have implemented expert systems for irrigation management. The expert
    system uses various knowledge-based inputs for accurate decision-making about
    irrigation scheduling. However, errors in knowledge-based input can seriously
    affect the performance and reliability of expert systems [162]. A hybrid intelligence
    system is another type of intelligent control system in which at least two artificial
    intelligence algorithms such as fuzzy logic and neural network are combined, known
    as “neuro-fuzzy” [149]. Other examples of such hybrid intelligence systems include
    fuzzy PID and GAPSO. Tsang et al. [152] employed seven different machine-learning
    algorithms to assess soil moisture conditions using aerial images of agricultural
    fields to control irrigation. The results demonstrated a 52% reduction in water
    consumption by reducing timing, irrigation level, and location errors. Similarly,
    a combination of ANN, genetic algorithm (GA) and the Bayesian framework was implemented
    to forecast daily irrigation demand under limited data conditions [163]. The results
    exhibited an improvement in forecast precision by 3% and 11%. Many other studies
    also demonstrated the use of intelligent hybrid systems and reported precise forecasting
    and improved control of irrigation systems [164,165]. The deep learning method
    is now applied to deal with millions of weights among neurons for a better understanding
    of behaviors owing to recent developments in computing technology in parallel
    processing, software and hardware. Deep learning has developed a revolutionary
    epoch, since it can solve the problems confronted by artificial intelligence for
    a long period [166]. Deep learning has been applied in the agriculture and hydrology
    fields due to difficulty in software data availability, budget, and complexity,
    such as crop evapotranspiration modeling and approximation [167]. Wang and Ma
    [168] reported that the traditional machine learning and deep learning models
    work similarly as a data-driven artificial intelligence technique and could be
    applied to model the convoluted correlation between input and output (Table 1).
    Nonetheless, deep learning has an advantage over traditional machine learning
    techniques because of its great hierarchical structure model [169]. Table 1. Application
    of various artificial intelligence technologies for irrigation management. 4.1.2.
    Model Predictive Irrigation Systems Development in smart agriculture through internet
    usage and increasing computational power facilitated large data collection from
    agricultural systems [180]. The model predictive system has been employed in irrigation
    scheduling, irrigation canal control, soil moisture, and stem water potential
    regulation [55]. Model predictive control (MPC) has manifested applicability to
    gate operation and control the canal flow. The management goal of model predictive
    control for canals is to maintain the level of water as close to the set-points
    as possible [181]. Thus, an appropriate model regulating the dynamics of canal-water
    levels is required. A model predictive control system has been employed to model
    water movement in the canals, keeping a specific level of water at different locations
    and the flow of water that affects these water levels [182,183,184]. The controlling
    instruments maintain the flow of water, by which the regulator can attain the
    management goals [180]. Nonetheless, attaining this goal is not straightforward,
    as variations in inflows and outflows interrupt the whole water system. To estimate
    future water flows and levels in response to control actions and disturbances,
    the water system (controller, canal reaches, disturbances and structures) needs
    to be modeled. Several authors have applied MPC in driving irrigation flows of
    canals. For instance, Puig et al. [185] applied MPC to create flow control approaches
    from the source of water to the user and Guadiana River’s irrigation territory.
    The results exhibited the usefulness of the MPC application. Zhang et al. [186]
    developed a non-cooperative distributed MPC algorithm based on Nash optimality
    for the regulation of water levels in canals. The simulation of system results
    indicated the efficacy of the advocated algorithm. To efficiently deliver the
    flow of a canal without oscillations, MPC was combined with online water storage
    to allow for a delay and evade wave distraction. The results indicated the significant
    development of canal setups using automation [180]. 4.1.3. Variable-Rate Irrigation
    (VRI) VRI is a method of applying irrigation at variable rates in different irrigation
    management zones over the entire field in an optimized way [187]. Normally, the
    application of irrigation water is uniform in the entire field. However, owing
    to soil spatial variability in soil topography, hydraulic properties and vegetation
    condition, the soil moisture content remains nonuniform [188]. When such soil
    spatial variability becomes significant, the field is split into different management
    zones consisting of those field areas with the same soil properties and crop conditions
    [150]. Then, irrigation is applied at differential rates in different management
    zones [189]. Such variable irrigation management may enhance the economic value
    of irrigation by improving WUE, increasing productivity and reduction in nutrient
    leaching [190]. This enables an accurate and timely water application based on
    soil spatiotemporal properties and plant demand [191]. In other words, VRI technology
    ensures the application of the right amount of water at the right time in the
    right field zone, resulting in significant water savings. The main components
    of VRI technology include sensors, prescription maps, spatial information, and
    a unit system to apply VRI prescription (lateral irrigation) in the crop field
    [192]. Optimization of VRI prescriptions is usually determined by using remote
    sensing, yield maps, topography, soil apparent electrical conductivity and soil
    maps [193,194]. There are different types of irrigation systems used for VRI applications.
    The variable-rate lateral irrigation system contains a global navigation satellite
    system (GNSS) or global positioning system (GPS) receiver, custom software-operated
    relays, and valves, thus supplying water at variable rates using the nozzle-pulsing
    method with a speed controller [26]. This system has high accuracy in controlling
    the irrigation rate and forward speed [195]. Likewise, the center pivot VRI system
    consists of a VRI and pivot control panels, control nodes, solenoid valves, a
    GNSS, a remote sensing control system, and a variable-frequency drive (VFD) [191].
    The speed and operation of the pivot are regulated by pivot control. The VRI controller
    panel governs the irrigation application based on pivot location and the prescription
    map. The flow of sprinkler heads is controlled by solenoid valves [26]. The pivot
    positioning is regulated by the GNSS system, and the control nodes attached to
    the pivot govern the valve opening and closing. VFD regulates the pressure by
    altering the irrigation rate at different points in the field [196]. The rotation
    speed of the pump impeller is also controlled by the VFD in response to the input
    communicated by the pressure switch mounted on the pump. It helps to maintain
    the pressure within the predefined threshold limits [197]. The use of VRI technology
    offers several advantages over conventional irrigation methods. VRI can substantially
    improve overall yields by avoiding under-irrigation and/or over-irrigation. The
    growers usually set up soil moisture sensors in those field areas with low soil
    water-holding capacity (WHC) to prevent under-irrigation in the field [198]. This
    practice may increase irrigation frequency, leading to over- irrigation with high
    soil WHC. Over-irrigation may result in yield loss due to nutrient leaching and
    depletion of oxygen in the root zone [39]. The prevention of under-irrigation
    in those field areas with higher yield potential could help optimize water input.
    Another advantage of using VRI is that irrigation can be withheld over those field
    areas that are not arable [199]. VRI also supports fertilizer application at variable
    rates that would benefit in matching the variability in crop nutrient requirements
    [200]. A two-year study led by Sui and Yan [192] demonstrated that crop water
    productivity for corn and soybean was much better under VRI than uniform rate
    irrigation (URI) in Mississippi. In another investigation, application of VRI
    with delineated management zones based on the difference in WHC showed better
    crop water productivity for maize and winter wheat, which was higher than the
    overall average of the field [201]. Besides its several advantages, VRI also has
    some disadvantages, including higher cost, complexity in developing soil maps,
    and maintenance of the system [202]. Overall, VRI technology is a good option
    to precisely utilize precious water resources, but considerable efforts are needed
    to make this technology affordable and more user-friendly. 4.1.4. Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for Irrigation Management UAVs, also called drones [203], are
    frequently linked with military operations, as they are used as weapons for targeting
    aircraft and involved in intelligence services. Recently, drones have been used
    in a wide range of applications, including delivery services, weather monitoring,
    traffic monitoring, surveillance, and rescue [204]. Several studies emphasized
    UAV utilization for forecasting and monitoring in agriculture to maintain crop
    health [205]. Drones are also useful for irrigation monitoring, as they use infrared
    or thermal imaging cameras in the IOT network [206]. Manual spraying of pesticides
    induces lethal diseases to workers globally, as described by the World Health
    Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization [207]. Thus, UAVs could be
    a potential alternative to manual pesticide spraying, reducing the potential ecological/environmental
    risks and health problems [205]. Recently, UAVs with IoT-based sensor networks
    have been used for smart irrigation purposes, thus significantly improving crop
    productivity [208]. Chebrolu et al. [209] suggested a technique of UAV images
    to rebuild a three-dimensional crop model that mediates crop growth monitoring
    based on a plant level. Likewise, the plant height of sorghum and maize plants
    was measured based on UAV images and a three-dimensional model [210]. Roth et
    al. [211] reported that the RMSE (root-mean-square error) was 0.33 m for a single
    sorghum’s height. The soybean leaf area index was extracted using 3D and UAV plant
    models. In another study, carried out by Deng et al. [212], different cameras
    were fixed on UAVs for smart farming. The results indicated that the UAV-based
    multiband images are useful and showed substantial ability for precise irrigation
    and agriculture management. RGB (red, green and blue) cameras can be used with
    a drone to determine crop biomass using visible reflectance for assessing vegetation
    indices [213]. According to Rokhmana [214], using UAVs for remote sensing can
    support precision farming. They can be used to obtain periodic information from
    the field, i.e., stock evaluation, plant health and vegetation monitoring. Several
    researchers examined the chances of applying IoT systems to govern crop health
    and irrigation monitoring. Automated water irrigation was innovated and employed
    by mobile applications [215]. The designed smartphone application can process
    and develop the soil images near the root surface of plants to ascertain sensor-less
    water quality. A smart drip irrigation method was established using an ARM9 processor,
    involving environmental conditions including CO2 amount, low moisture, and high
    temperature [216]. Zaier et al. [217] suggested an irrigation system controlled
    wirelessly to promote groundwater usage in large-scale fields of Oman. Oksanen
    et al. [218] stated that big data and IoT could be used to establish a real-time
    crop growth monitoring system, facilitating precise irrigation estimates. Based
    on the collection of plant data, they suggested establishing a central unit to
    develop a crop growth model, Oksanen et al. [218] proposed a method to forecast
    and diagnose wheat diseases, weeds, and pests using a computerized IoT-based method.
    A fungicide and insecticide management system based on predictive models for pests
    and crop diseases has also been developed using the IoT [219]. A new irrigation
    method based on the IoT was proposed by [220] where humidity sensors were applied,
    and high humidity values of 90–95% were recorded (Table 2). Table 2. Application
    of different types of UAVs for irrigation management. 4.2. Forecasting Smart Irrigation
    Technology with DSSIS A decision support system (DSS) is an interactive software-based
    system used to identify, analyze, and improve decisions based on raw data, documents,
    and personal knowledge [99]. Various decision support systems (DSSs) have been
    designed for managing irrigation water to improve WUE [230,231]. A smart and efficient
    DSS has to consider several factors, such as soil water status, crop type, irrigation
    method, weather information, and application, to develop irrigation scheduling
    [19]. To facilitate precise irrigation scheduling by minimizing errors in field
    soil moisture estimates, DSSs provide irrigation schedules not only for the current
    day but also to forecast irrigation events for future days. Based on the idea
    of forecasting irrigation, recently a prototype of an irrigation scheduling DSS
    called decision support system for irrigation scheduling (DSSIS) has been developed
    for arid regions [232]. This DSSIS has the ability to predict irrigation events
    for the current day as well as forecast irrigation for the future by using the
    weather information of the next 4 days. The DSSIS prototype consists of irrigation
    pipelines, software and hardware to control irrigation and peripheral equipment
    The irrigation pipelines consist of a drip irrigation system, valves and polyvinyl
    chloride pipes. The software controlling the irrigation system includes RZWQM2
    (Root Zone Water Quality Model) integrated with an irrigation scheduling software
    (RZ Irrsch and an online weather data acquisition system [233]. The irrigation-controlling
    hardware contains automatic control equipment. A peripheral equipment consists
    of a water reservoir, circulating pumps, and strainers. In DSSIS, the RZWQM2 model
    works as an engine and facilitates decision-making about irrigation scheduling.
    The RZWQM2 is first calibrated and validated according to site-specific experimental
    data (crop, weather, and soil data). The IrrSch software generates daily weather
    data from the nearby weather stations and also forecasts upcoming 4-day weather
    using a weather application program interface (API) then transfer this information
    to RZWQM2 [99]. Based on the information given by IrrSch, RZWQM2 predicts crop
    evapotranspiration, soil water stress factor (SWFAC), and soil moisture content
    for the current and next 4 days. When the current day’s water stress level falls
    below the preset threshold, an irrigation event is initiated. The amount of water
    to be supplied is computed by RZWQM2 using field capacity and the predicted soil
    water content and rooting depth. This system (DSSIS) has been tested for cotton
    irrigation scheduling under full, deficit, experience, and sensor-based irrigation
    treatments in an arid region. Under deficit irrigation, DSSIS saved 50% of irrigation
    water with a 4% increase in yield and up to 80% increase in water productivity
    over experience-based irrigation [232]. In another study, Chen et al. [234] evaluated
    the effect of irrigation scheduling by DSSIS on water productivity, seed cotton
    yield, and economic profitability under an arid desert climate. Under DSSIS, water
    productivity, seed cotton yield, and economic benefit were higher than soil moisture
    sensor-based irrigation scheduling. Full irrigation DSS also maintained crop yield
    under deficit irrigation treatment. In a three-year field study, Chen et al. [233]
    evaluated irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) in cotton using the RZWQM2 model
    with DSSIS in an arid oasis. After validation, the RZWQM2 model was run with seven
    irrigation scenarios (from 850 to 350 mm water), and the long-term weather data
    (1990–2019) were used to estimate the best IWUE. The results manifested that the
    irrigation with 660 mm water produced the highest seed cotton yield (4.09 Mg ha−1),
    whereas irrigation with 550 mm water exhibited the highest IWUE (6.53 kg ha−1mm−1).
    These findings provided important guidelines for farmers to use deficit irrigation
    strategies. This will also help the farmers to develop and improve irrigation
    scheduling strategies with respect to their specific crop production settings.
    This irrigation forecasting DSSIS has been tested on a small scale in an arid
    oasis and provided satisfactory results regarding water productivity. It could
    be promoted over a large scale. To further improve the site-specific irrigation
    management, the soil textural variability could be analyzed and a local-level
    soil database could be developed through extensive soil sampling and analysis.
    This soil database could be integrated with DSSIS for scheduling irrigation for
    a specific field. This concept of irrigation is termed soil test-based irrigation
    prescription (STIP). Availability of site-specific soil information may result
    in potential gains in improved WUE and higher profitability in arid regions where
    existing irrigation strategies are poorly connected with local agronomic and biophysical
    settings. Hence, development of the STIP concept could be a way forward to improve
    WUE and further strengthen efforts to conserve and efficiently utilize the limited
    water resources in arid and hyperarid regions. 5. Future Prospects This paper
    presented an overview of advanced and smart irrigation practices for improving
    WUE in water-limited regions, but still there are some challenges that are important
    to consider for designing smart, sustainable and user-friendly irrigation systems.
    I. Variability in soil texture is a vital source of uncertainty because it influences
    the current and potential soil water storage estimates both vertically and latterly
    in a field. Therefore, site-specific soil analysis is one way to rectify this
    problem and obtain the exact soil parameter information needed for accurate irrigation
    scheduling. Site-specific soil test-based information integrated with smart irrigation
    systems can help to improve WUE in arid and semiarid regions. This method is called
    soil test-based irrigation prescription (STIP). The proper execution of STIP needs
    specific field soil sampling, analysis of soil properties and development of a
    soil database. This soil information with crop and weather data can be integrated
    with a model or decision support system to forecast an irrigation event. II. Most
    of the experiments related to smart irrigation systems were conducted on a small
    scale in research fields or under controlled environmental conditions, which cannot
    represent commercial farming practices. Therefore, more on-farm studies in large
    fields are needed for a clear understanding about the implementation of smart
    irrigation technology. III. Most of the commercial smart irrigation systems offered
    by different irrigation companies help to improve water use efficiency, but the
    high cost of these state-of-the-art devices is a serious challenge for farmers.
    Moreover, these commercial smart irrigation systems are custom-built, meaning
    difficulty in control and adaptability. Therefore, affordable and user-friendly
    equipment should be manufactured at a local level. IV. Most of the farmers in
    dryland regions are not well educated and should be trained through practical
    demonstration of smart irrigation systems by expert extension workers. Furthermore,
    governments should provide subsidies to farmers for dissemination of such technologies
    on a large scale. 6. Conclusions This article provided an overview of the major
    constraints to agricultural productivity, traditional irrigation scheduling methods,
    and efforts and advancements that have been achieved to enhance WUE, conserve
    water, and most importantly guarantee food security through the adoption of different
    smart irrigation approaches in dryland regions. Dryland agriculture is largely
    affected by low WUE because farmers are relying upon traditional irrigation scheduling
    methods, resulting in over- and/or under-irrigation of fields and yield reduction.
    In this situation, adoption of smart irrigation approaches or technologies including
    artificial intelligence and deep learning (ANN, fuzzy logic, expert system, hybrid
    intelligent system, and deep learning), model predictive irrigation systems, VRI
    technology, and UAVs could ensure high water use efficiency and productivity in
    water-scarce regions. These technologies consider several factors, including soil
    and climate variation, soil structure and hydraulic properties, plant responses
    to water deficits, and changes in weather factors to apply the right amount of
    water at the right time and place. However, all these methods face some challenges
    regarding accurate execution and performance under field conditions, which could
    be rectified by incorporating indigenous knowledge and through practical demonstrations
    to the farmers. Smart irrigation technologies are revolutionizing global agriculture.
    Such technologies are highly desirable to achieve the SDGs and improve the living
    standards of poor farmers in drylands. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Efficient irrigation scheduling is crucial for both improving crop production
    and saving irrigation water use in arid/semi-arid agricultural regions threatened
    by water shortage and soil salinity. However, irrigation scheduling optimization
    is hindered by the uncertainties of data and optimization model, and adopting
    the optimal irrigation scheduling is subject to farmers'' acceptance. To effectively
    tackle these challenges, this paper presents a novel human-machine interactive
    framework for real-time irrigation scheduling (RIS). The developed modeling framework
    couples a simulation-optimization model, irrigation farmers, and a data assimilation
    procedure within the human-machine interactive framework for RIS. The proposed
    approach is capable of: 1) searching optimal irrigation scheduling through the
    simulation-optimization model; 2) making actual irrigation decisions based on
    farmers'' experiences, knowledge, behaviors, or optimal solutions; and 3) updating
    soil water content based on the model simulations and real-time observations at
    each time period. The RIS is applied to a real-world case in a typical arid agricultural
    region of China. Based on the comparisons with historical irrigation records and
    a tradition simulation-optimization model, the proposed RIS can not only achieve
    higher economic benefit with less irrigation water allocation quotas, but also
    improve irrigation efficiency. This study contributes to the methodology by integrating

    assimilationHuman-machine interaction 1. Introduction Globally, increasing population
    and water scarcity have put enormous pressure on food production, which relies
    heavily on irrigation to avoid yield loss, especially in arid and semi-arid areas
    (Playán and Mateos, 2006). We need to improve the irrigation water use efficiency
    for a sustainable crop production system (Roy et al., 2019). Besides irrigation
    technology advances, optimizing irrigation scheduling (i.e. when and how much
    water to irrigate) is an important issue for both research and practice (Li et
    al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). Irrigation scheduling is challenging due to the
    complex interactions between crop yield and profit, crop water requirement, weather
    forecast, as well as farmers'' attitude and acceptance to scientifically based
    recommendations. This paper presents a real-time irrigation scheduling (RIS) method
    based on optimization-simulation modeling, soil moisture observation and assimilation,
    and human-machine interaction. Numerous simulation, optimization, and coupled
    simulation-optimization models approaches have been widely used to address irrigation
    scheduling problem (Akhtar et al., 2013, Allam et al., 2016, Li et al., 2018,
    Singh, 2012, Wen et al., 2017) Process-based simulation models, e.g., AquaCrop
    model (Linker et al., 2016, Pawar et al., 2017), Environmental-Policy-Integrated-Climate
    model (Gao et al., 2017a), and Soil & Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model (Chen
    et al., 2019, Sun and Ren, 2014), search for the optimal irrigation scheduling
    by testing numerous scenarios of irrigation timing by the models. Optimization
    models determine the optimal irrigation scheduling given prescribed objective(s)
    and constraints using the various algorithms, such as dynamic programming (Epperson
    et al., 1993), linear/nonlinear programming (Garg and Dadhich, 2014), stochastic
    programming (Li et al., 2019), and procedures based artificial intelligence (González
    Perea et al., 2016; Noory et al., 2012). To improve the reality of modeling results
    (Singh, 2015), simulation and optimization models are coupled to decide irrigation
    scheduling (Cai et al., 2003, Chen et al., 2016, Li et al., 2018, Nguyen et al.,
    2017, Wen et al., 2017). One outstanding issue to use these models for real-time
    irrigation scheduling is the accuracy of their results which are often subject
    to systematic bias. Data assimilation (DA) is an efficient approach to assimilate
    real-time observation data and to dynamically reconcile the modeling states. Multiple
    DA algorithms have been used to improve the accuracy of soil moisture simulations
    and crop modeling (Dumedah and Walker, 2017, Fu et al., 2014, Fu et al., 2019,
    Fu et al., 2022, Nair and Indu, 2019, Silvestro et al., 2017, Yu et al., 2014,
    Lu et al., 2021, Rahman et al., 2022, Kwon et al., 2022). For example, Huang et
    al. (2016) proposed an advanced data assimilation method EnKS (Ensemble Kalman
    Smoother) to estimate soil moisture, soil temperature, and surface turbulent fluxes.
    Abolafia-Rosenzweig et al. (2019) developed an integrated particle batch smooth
    data assimilation approach and applied it to land surface model to simulate soil
    moisture and predict daily to seasonal irrigation amount. The ensemble Kalman
    filter (EnKF) is a computationally efficient algorithm that can deal with nonlinearity
    and high dimensionality in soil dynamics, and has been one of the most commonly
    used algorithms in soil moisture assimilation. Additional applications on soil
    moisture and irrigation modeling in some popularly used models include: Wit and
    Diepen (2007) assimilated soil moisture observations into the WOFOST crop model.
    Li et al. (2017) used EnKF to assimilate the soil moisture from Soil Moisture
    Active Passive (SMAP) into Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator (BEPS) for
    improving the estimation of the global gross primary production. Irmak and Kamble
    (2009) developed an ET data assimilation scheme to optimize the parameters of
    Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP) for irrigation management. Li et al. (2018)
    assimilated soil water content measured into Community Land Model by Local Ensemble
    Transform Kalman Filter for real-time irrigation scheduling scheme. Despite the
    wide applications of DA in soil moisture modeling, according to the authors’ knowledge,
    few studies use DA with an integrated simulation-optimization model to support
    real-time irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, previous irrigation scheduling studies
    provide useful guidelines to farmers for their real-world irrigation scheduling
    decisions, however, these studies do not make their model directly interact with
    the decision makers at all time windows during the irrigation season. Thus, they
    are limited in supporting real-time irrigation scheduling. In the real world,
    farmers rarely follow the model suggested time and amount of irrigation application
    through the entire irrigation season. The actual irrigation decision-making by
    farmers depend on many factors, some of which are difficult to be considered in
    a computer-based optimization model, such as policies (Bontemps and Couture, 2002,
    Brown and Rogers, 2006) and the various impacts of farmers’ age, education, attitude
    and knowledge toward irrigation scheduling (Karami, 2006, Moreno et al., 2007).
    Thus, farmers still largely rely on their own experiences, knowledge, behavior
    in real irrigation scheduling. In addition, farmers’ feedbacks to the irrigation
    scheduling suggestions from the optimization model are usually ignored, hence
    such suggestions are not widely accepted in practice (Rose et al., 2016, Tapsuwan
    et al., 2015). Although some efforts have been undertaken to reduce the gap between
    simulation models and farmers’ irrigation decision support needs (Pande and Savenije,
    2016, van Emmerik et al., 2014), little progress has been made in incorporating
    sufficient mental details of farmers into computer models (Bierkens, 2015), especially
    optimization models. As indicated by O''Keeffe et al. (2018), incorporating the
    insights and experiences of farmers directly into an irrigation scheduling decision
    support model can improve the model’s realism. To this end, a real time irrigation
    schedule (RIS) based on human-machine interactive is proposed in this study to
    allow “online” interactions between the models and the decision-makers in each
    time window. Such a human-machine interaction method has been demonstrated in
    other agricultural decision support systems (Rose et al., 2018) and reservoir
    operation support systems (Zhang et al., 2021). In summary, this study integrates
    process-based simulation model (computer model), a data assimilation method, and
    a human-computer interaction method into an optimization framework to support
    real-time irrigation scheduling. This method will allow the assimilation of soil
    moisture observations and incorporation of farmers'' choices into the modeling,
    which is expected to improve the model realism and meanwhile to provide farmers
    with the improved and more realistic recommendations of irrigation timing and
    amount during the irrigation seasons. To demonstrate its applicability, the proposed
    RIS is applied to a real-world case study area in the Hetao Irrigation District,
    located in northeastern China. 2. Methodology 2.1. Overview The RIS framework
    consists of four major components: (1) an optimization module, (2) a human-computer
    interactive process, (3) a simulation module based on the process-based modeling,
    and (4) data assimilation. Fig. 1 shows a flow chart of the framework, especially
    the connection and information flow among all the components. Optimal daily irrigation
    scheduling will be derived from the simulation-optimization model with the given
    objective function and various constraints including irrigation rules. In existing
    real-time irrigation scheduling models, it is usually assumed that farmers will
    adopt the optimal irrigation schedule from the optimization model. However, in
    the real decision-making process, even with an effective model available, farmers
    may not follow the optimal irrigation schedules from the optimization model. Thus,
    the actual irrigation decisions (i.e., a series of irrigation events during the
    irrigation season) are determined via the human-computer interactive method, based
    on the results from the simulation-optimization model, as well as farmers choices
    based on their experiences, knowledge and behaviors (Fig. 1). In this paper, as
    an illustrative example, we set a testing rule for farmers to adopt the computer
    recommended application, i.e., when the daily harvest index is less than a threshold
    harvest index which reflects farmers'' expectation for crop yield based on history
    records, farmers will make their own decision; otherwise, farmers will follow
    the computer recommendations. Other testing rules can be considered which eventually
    depend on farmers’ experiences with the modeling framework. Actual irrigation
    application in a time window is used as input for the agro-hydrological simulation
    model enhanced by soil moisture observation through data assimilation. Specifically,
    the initial states of the simulation-optimization model at the next time period
    will be updated through data assimilation based on soil moisture observations
    and the actual irrigation application within the current time period. Download

    The human-computer interactive method for real-time irrigation scheduling. This
    method is new by directly linking irrigation farmers with a real-time integrated
    optimization and simulation model via assimilation of soil moisture observations.
    The computer model runs by rolling time windows. For each time window (one day),
    it assimilates the observation of soil moisture and adopts the actual irrigation
    application farmers make (which can be the same or different from the model recommendations)
    at the end of the time window, and then moves to next. Meanwhile, the user (a
    farmer) checks the recommended application (including no irrigation) release from
    the model during each time window and decides to take it or not based on their
    own justification. Framers’ actual application of water for irrigation at some
    time windows will affect soil moisture, which will be “observed” by soil moisture
    sensors and assimilated to the crop-water simulation modeling. Thus, the data
    assimilation procedure plays a key linkage between human and machine. Previously
    published irrigation scheduling decision support systems (DSS) also tackled irrigation
    scheduling using optimization, simulation and data assimilation, e.g., Ines et
    al. (2006) combined remote sensing-simulation modeling and genetic algorithm optimization
    for irrigation water management options; Han et al. (2016) update soil hydraulic
    properties together with soil moisture in the Community Land Model (CLM) using
    the Local Ensemble Transform Kalman Filter to obtain irrigation scheduling. However,
    those DSSs usually assume that the optimal irrigation scheduling is strictly followed
    by the farmers, and mainly aim to tackle the uncertainties of process-based modeling
    and observations, rather than the uncertainties of farmers’ irrigation decision-making.
    They can provide decision support information, which can be used or not by the
    real user (a farmer), but they do not track the actual decisions made by the users.
    2.2. Real-time simulation-optimization model Optimization algorithms have been
    proved to be effective to find the optimal irrigation strategies with an explicit
    objective function, such as maximizing economic benefits subject to essential
    and constraints (Cai and Rosegrant, 2004, Cai et al., 2003, Li et al., 2020).
    In this paper, a rule-based irrigation schedule is optimized to provide irrigation
    decisions based on daily soil water content information. The rules are based on
    a water stress indicator and the crop yield simulated by the Environmental Policy-Integrated
    Climate (EPIC) model (Williams and J.C.A, 1989), which is involved in the objective
    function of the optimization model. In the process of irrigation decision-making,
    the optimized irrigation schedule is obtained through the optimization model.
    The iterative simulation model is used to take the irrigation schedule as the
    input, and output of simulation model is performed as the state variable of the
    irrigation decision model in the next time period. 2.2.1. EPIC model The EPIC
    model is a comprehensive dynamic processed-based model for quantitative evaluation
    of the “climate-soil-crop-management” system, which has been widely used in the
    world. The crop growth module is a mechanism model based on the physiological
    and ecological processes of crops, which simulates the daily phenological development
    of crops. The parameters data required by the EPIC crop module have been verified
    by a number of studies (Gao et al., 2017b, Liu, 2020). (1a) (1b) where HI is harvest
    index; HIadj is harvest index under the environmental stress; WSYF is a drought
    sensitivity parameter, describing the sensitivity of harvest index to drought;
    WS is the water stress factor; Ba is the crop biomass above ground calculated
    by Leaf area index (LAI) and Plant radiation use efficiency (BE) (a conversion
    factor of crop transferring the energy to biomass). The details of the EPIC model
    can be referred to Appendix. 2.2.2. The optimization model The optimization model
    runs at a daily time step (t = 1, 2, …T) during the irrigation season. For day
    t, the model adopts the actual irrigation applications (m3/ha) in days 1, 2.t-1,
    (IW1*, IW2*, … IWt-1*) and determines the application in day t (IWt). The model
    also foretells the future irrigation applications based on a “normal” weather/climate
    projection in the rest of the irrigation season (IWt+1,. IWT), which will be updated
    in days t + 1 … T, respectively. The normal irrigation season IWt+1,. IWT is obtained
    by simulation-optimization model based on daily meteorological data on day t + 1…
    day T. The objective function of the optimization model is to maximize the crop
    profit per hectare: (2a) Where Yc is crop yield calculated by the EPIC model,
    kg/ha; Pc is the net price of the crop, Yuan/kg (Chinese); wc is the cost of irrigation,
    Yuan/m3; Ω are state variable of the EPIC model, e.g., temperature, leaf area
    index, and harvest index. The major constraints include the lower and/or upper
    bounds for irrigation water amount, maximum available irrigation water amount
    Q, and salt accumulation during the growth stage. For the case study area, this
    paper assumes that soil salt accumulation should be less than 640 mg/ L from the
    crop planting day to the harvest day based on the assessment in (Li et al., 2020):
    (2b) (2c) (2d) where IWt is irrigation amount on day 1,2…t,. T,Csrbeg, Csrend
    are the salinity concentration in the actual root zone at the beginning and the
    end of crop growth stage, respectively (mg L-1), determined by the dynamic soil
    water-salt simulation model described in Section 2.3. Real-time irrigation timing
    relies on the soil moisture condition in the actual root zone ma. Relative daily
    water stress λ (ma/mf) is defined as the ratio of ma at a time period and the
    saturated soil moisture content (mf). Water stress means the soil water content
    reduce below the saturated soil moisture content. λ is used to determine whether
    irrigation is needed, based on an empirical threshold (e.g., 60% −80% of mf for
    the case study area based on farmers’ experiences and expert suggestions in the
    area, which can be changed based on users’ input): If λ ≤ an empirical threshold,
    then Irrigation (with the amount to be determined by RIS) else (2e) 2.2.3. No
    irrigation A Genetic algorithm (GA) is used in this study to find the optimal
    daily irrigation water amount (Haq and Anwar, 2010, Wardlaw and Bhaktikul, 2004)
    if the threshold (equation 1e) is reached. 2.3. Soil water-salt flow dynamic simulation
    model Considering the dynamics of water and salt movement in the field and their
    impacts on crop yield, an integrated model has been developed to describe the
    complexly coupled agro-hydrological, water/salt dynamic, and crop production processes.
    Here, we employed the Agricultural Water Productivity Model for Shallow Groundwater
    (AWPM-SG) (Gao et al., 2017a) to calculate water-salt dynamic recharge between
    soil and groundwater. The soil profile is divided into soil zones: the actual
    root zone, the potential root zone, the transition zone, and the saturated zone
    (Fig. 2), the red dashed is the root development. Download : Download high-res

    profile. When , water-salt balance is calculated in the actual root zone: (3a)
    (3b) where RD is the root depth, cm; RDmax is the maximum root depth, cm; Wa is
    water content in the actual root zone, mm; ma is the daily average soil moisture
    in the actual root zone, cm3/cm3; P is precipitation, mm; IW is irrigation, mm;
    CAP is the capillary rise from potential root zone, mm; CR is the water flux from
    deeper zone to the actual root zone due to root growth, mm; ET is the actual evapotranspiration,
    mm; J1,2 is percolation from the actual root zone to potential root zone, mm.
    The details of CAP, CR, Dr, J1,2 and the actual crop evapotranspiration should
    be referred to the Appendix. Salt flows along the vertical soil profile of the
    root zone with soil water, thus salt balance is same to water balance. The salt
    balance in the actual root zone is calculated as follows: (3c) (3d) where Csr
    and Csg are the salinity concentration in the actual root zone and potential root
    zone, respectively (mg L-1); Cirr is the salt concentration of the irrigation
    water (mg L-1). Water-salt balance is calculated in the potential root zone: (3e)

    is percolation from the potential root zone to groundwater, mm; Cgw is the salinity
    concentration in the groundwater (mg L-1); G is the difference between the groundwater
    table depth and the depth that groundwater fluctuations cannot reach (mm) (Xue
    et al., 2018). the details should be referred to the Appendix. When , there will
    be no potential root zone, the water balance calculation of actual zone is similar
    to the potential root zone under , the details should be referred to Appendix.
    2.4. Data assimilation The accuracy of simulation models is still a challenge.
    In addition, in order to obtain a more accurate result, data assimilation (DA)
    is used to utilize information gained from both hydrological models and observations
    synergistically. The soil moisture that couples atmospheric and crop growth processes
    is usually changed significantly by irrigation. Gravimetric method, sensors, neutron
    scattering technique satellite-based observation products, etc. have been applied
    to measuring soil moisture (Bittelli, 2011). In the paper, the data assimilation
    method assimilates the soil moisture observations with the agro-hydrological simulation
    model to update the soil water content at the next period. The Ensemble Kalman
    Filter (EnKF) combines the prior model uncertainty and observational uncertainty
    to improve estimation of the model state (i.e., soil water content). The EnKF
    is a two-step process consisting of forecasting and updating processes, given
    by the following: (4a) (4b) (4c) (4d) where is the nth ensemble member forecast
    of the soil water content at time period t + 1; is the nth updated ensemble member
    of the soil water content at time period t; is the generated system noise for
    the nth ensemble member, which follows a Gaussian distribution with zero mean
    and a diagonal covariance matrix Ut which is diagonal; represents the model structure;
    Γ is the system parameter; is the nth updated ensemble member of the soil water
    content at time period t + 1; is the Kalman gain matrix; Cov is covariances; is
    the nth observation soil water content at time period t + 1, generated by adding
    the observation error to the actual observation , is also assumed to follow a
    Gaussian distribution with zero mean and specified diagonal covariance matrix
    ; The standard derivation of model state errors and observation errors are set
    as 0.05 and 0.01, respectively, the observation errors 0.01 comes from Sensors
    Data, comparatively, we assume the standard derivation of model state errors is
    0.05, the assumption needs additional work to test, and it is worth studying in
    the future; is the measurement operator, which maps the state to the observation.
    In EnKF, the updated states may violate some constraints such as nonnegativity
    and maximum water availability. In the study, the forecast and updated ensemble
    member of the soil water content are constraint below the field capacity. So constrained
    Ensemble Kalman Filter (CEnKF) is proposed to deal with the violations (Wang et
    al., 2009). CEnKF with the Accept/Reject Method developed by Wang et al. (2009)
    is an efficient algorithm with good performances in estimation quality and the
    computational time. CEnKF could check the violation of all the constraints in
    the forecasted and updated states, respectively. We set the ensemble size to 100,
    and the assimilation interval to one day. 3. Case study 3.1. Study area The Hetao
    Irrigation Distract (HID) (40°19′–41°18′N, 106°20′–109°19′E) is located in the
    upper reach of the Yellow River Basin of northwestern China. The HID has a total
    irrigation area of 570,000 ha, and a very flat slopes of 0.02% (Xu et al., 2010).
    As the third largest irrigation district in China, HID is one of the major sunflower
    production regions. A sunflower field from Shahaoqu experimental station in HID
    (Fig. 3) is selected to test the RIS. The area has an arid and semi-arid climate
    with annual average precipitation of 160 mm and mean yearly pan evaporation of
    2200 mm. Irrigation in the HID mainly depends on the Yellow River with annual
    4.7 × 109 m3 (Chen et al., 2020). The groundwater level is relatively shallow,
    ranging from 0.5 to 3.0 m during a year due to massive water pumping and poor
    drainage. The groundwater mainly moves vertically because of the low gradient.
    Currently, soil salinization has been a key issue for the agro-ecosystems of the
    area under saline Yellow River irrigation water and saline shallow groundwater.

    is planted on June 1, 2017 and June 5, 2018，harvest on September 15 in both years,
    covering 2213 m2. Daily meteorological data, such as air temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed is obtained by the weather station at the Shahaoqu experimental
    station. The daily average soil water content observations in 2018 and 2017 are
    provided at the depths of 0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm during the
    growth stage by using Hydra Probe Soil Sensors (Stevens Water Monitoring System
    Inc., Portland, OR, USA) (Liu et al., 2020). The time step in the simulation process
    was also set to one day, and the actual root zone observed soil moisture data
    were assimilated into the dynamic soil water flow-salt simulation model for each
    assimilation interval. The real-time soil water content observations are the combination
    of historical observations and virtual observations (optimal soil water content).

    derived from the proposed RIS is compared to that from a traditional simulation-optimization
    model (i.e., without data assimilation and human-computer interaction), as well
    as the historical irrigation records in real world. Hereafter, we refer the irrigation
    scheduling from the traditional simulation-optimization as “optimal solution”.
    As mentioned before, in the study, we assume that farmers follow a recommended
    irrigation application when the harvest index (Eq. 1b) is higher than the harvest
    index threshold; otherwise, they decide if and how much to irrigation within a
    particular time window based on their own justification. In the paper, as an illustrative
    example, in the optimal module of the developed model and the automatic optimal
    model, irrigation is applied when the λ is lower than 0.7 (Equation 1e). Specially,
    in 2017, the soil salt accumulation constraint (Eq.2d) is used by the , because
    the soil salt accumulation increased under water shortage of 255 mm total available
    water quotas. The irrigation scheduling from the RIS, simulation-optimization
    model, and the historical records in 2018 and 2017 are shown in Fig. 4 and Fig.
    5. In 2018, the historical records (Fig. 4c) include five irrigation applications
    on days 16, 20, 41, 48, and 88 and with irrigation depths of 134 mm, 60 mm, 114 mm,
    40 mm, and 130 mm, respectively. The total irrigation water amount is 4780 m3/ha
    and the profit is 24,750.5 Yuan/ha. The optimal solution (Fig. 4b) with a constraint
    of 478 mm total available water quotas, results in three irrigation applications
    on days 16, 53, 80 with irrigation depths of 139.9 mm, 149.9 mm, and 148.7 mm
    of water application, respectively. The total irrigation water amount is 4389 m3/ha,
    and the profit is 23,470.4 Yuan/ha. Compared to the historical record, the simulation-optimization
    model achieves an 8% irrigation water saving but a 5% decrease in the profit.
    Such results follow the constraint of total water availability and a maximum allowed
    soil salinity accumulation set in the optimization model. Due to the salinity
    constraint, a certain amount of water is used for salt leaching. The soil salt
    accumulation change of − 1.48 g/L (i.e., the salt concentration is reduced) during
    the growth stage from the simulation-optimization model satisfies the soil salt
    accumulation constraint (−0.64 g/L). The optimal solution shows larger salinity
    leaching than the historical record (−1.21 g/L), less amount of water use (4389 m3/ha
    vs. 4780 m3/ha) and slightly lower profit (23,470.40 Yuan/ha vs. 24,750.53 Yuan/ha).
    In the real world, farmers in the irrigation district use large amount of water
    for leaching, which may cause groundwater level increase (i.e., waterlogging)
    and bring additional salt to crop root zone (Ren et al., 2019). Download : Download

    determined by a) RIS b) the simulation-optimization model (optimal solution),
    and c) historical records in 2017. The irrigation scheduling from the RIS (Fig.
    4a) suggests six irrigation applications on days 16, 20, 44, 58, 75 and 76 with
    irrigation depths of 152.50 mm, 60 mm, 152.19 mm, 39.82 mm, 7.80 mm, and 44.64 mm,
    respectively. Note that the application on day 20 follows the historical record;
    all other applications follow the optimal solutions with some slight differences,
    which are probably caused by the randomness of the GA solution and/or the improved
    simulation by the data assimilation procedures. The total irrigation water amount
    is 4572 m3/ha and the profit is 25,008.80 Yuan/ha. Compared to the historical
    records, the RIS ends with a lower irrigation water use and a higher profit; compared
    to the traditional simulation-optimization model, the proposed modeling framework
    increases the profit by 7 % with 4 % increase of irrigation water use. The RIS
    solution shows slightly smaller salinity leaching (−1.14 g/L) than the historical
    record (−1.21 g/L), less amount of water use (4572 m3/ha vs. 4780 m3/ha) and higher
    profit (25,008.80 Yuan/ha vs. 24,750.53 Yuan/ha). In 2017, the historical records
    have two irrigation applications on days 26, 53 and with irrigation depths of
    134 mm, 121 mm, respectively (Fig. 5c). The total irrigation water amount is 2551 m3/ha
    and the profit is 24,094.10 Yuan/ha. The optimal solution with a constraint of
    255 mm total available water quotas, results in four irrigation applications on
    days 27, 45, 79, 90 with irrigation depths of 120.0 mm,106.1 mm,19.5 mm and 9.1 mm,
    respectively (Fig. 5b). The total irrigation water amount is 2548 m3/ha and the
    profit is 24,127.60 Yuan/ha. The soil salt increased 0.34 g/L during the growth
    stage. Compared to the historical record, the simulation-optimization model have
    higher profit. The soil salt accumulation 0.23 g/L is less during the growth stage
    from the simulation-optimization model. The irrigation scheduling from the RIS
    suggests four irrigation applications on days 26, 48, 66, 98 with irrigation depths
    of 134.0 mm, 86.5 mm, 26.3 mm and 7.4 mm, respectively (Fig. 5a). Note that the
    application on day 26 follows the historical record; all other applications follow
    the optimal solutions. The total irrigation water amount is 2543 m3/ha and the
    profit is 24,381.52 Yuan/ha. Compared to the historical records, the RIS ends
    with a higher profit. And, the soil salt accumulation change of 0.18 g/L is less
    than the historical records during the growth stage from the RIS model. Overall,
    the RIS combines simulation-optimization model, observation, human consideration,
    and ends with higher profit. 5. Discussion 5.1. Model performance comparison under
    different water availability conditions We further investigate the results of
    the RIS and the simulation-optimization model under different irrigation water
    availability levels in 2018 (Fig. 6 and Table 2) and 2017(Fig. 7 and Table 3),
    which are set as 100%, 80%, and 60% of the total historical irrigation water use.
    The objective function for the optimization model are the same as in Section 2.2.1.
    The results suggest that the irrigation quotas significantly affect irrigation
    timing, as well as the crop yield and profit (Fig. 6, Fig. 7 and Table 2, Table
    3). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size image

    (g/L) 0.34 -0.13 0.46 Similar to the results in Section 4, RIS combines some irrigation
    applications recommended by the simulation-optimization model and some from the
    historical records. As shown in Fig. 6a, under a 20% reduction of irrigation quota,
    RIS suggests five irrigation applications. The farmer chooses to follow the recommended
    application on day 16, switches to their own choices on day 20 when the crop harvest
    index is lower than the threshold, and comes back to follow the recommended applications
    on days 45, 56 and 72. Under a 40% reduction of the irrigation quota (Fig. 6b),
    the number of irrigation applications recommended by the proposed model increases
    to nine but with a less irrigation depth in each of the application events. The
    number of irrigation applications with reduced water availability from the RIS
    is larger than that with the 100% water quota, and the irrigation depth decreases
    largely for each applications. This suggests that more frequent applications should
    be taken even with small water depths when the total amount of water available
    for irrigation is limited. This is reasonable since small amount of water applications
    can reduce drainage and deep percolation, and thus increase field irrigation efficiency
    and reduce waterlogging which brings salt from groundwater to the crop root zone.
    As shown in Table 2, the yield with less irrigation depths from the RIS is larger
    than that from the simulation-optimization model. This is consistent from previous
    studies, e.g., (Aujla et al., 2007, Singandhupe et al., 2003), who stated that
    low-volume but more frequent irrigation applications tended to increase crop yield
    and save water. Table 2 shows total irrigation water amount, salt accumulation,
    crop yield and profit from the optimization model and RIS under 100%, 80% and
    60% of water use of the historical records of 2018, compared to the numbers from
    the historical records. Compared to the optimal solution, the RIS is able to produce
    more profit with less water under the two scenarios with reduced irrigation water
    quotas. Compared to the historical scheduling, RIS results in a large amount of
    water saving at a relatively small expense of profit. Specifically, with RIS,
    the total irrigation water use is reduced by 28% with 6% of profit loss with the
    80% water quota scenario; the irrigation water saving reaches to 42% with 10%
    profit loss under the 60% water quota scenario. As shown in Table 2, the salt
    accumulation from RIS decreases from − 1.14 to − 0.67 g/L when the irrigation
    amount is reduced from 4572 m3/ha to 2756 m3/ha. The irrigation water amount reduced
    will increase salt accumulation. Also, it is found that further reducing the irrigation
    water quota will cause a violation of the soil salinity constraints. The implies
    that the soil salinity control puts an upper limit for irrigation water saving
    especially in regions with shallow-saline groundwater. Differently, 60% of the
    total historical irrigation water use is too few for plant growth and do not satisfied
    the salt constraints. Similar to the results in Section 4, RIS combines some irrigation
    applications recommended by the simulation-optimization model and some from the
    historical records in 2017 historical records. As shown in Fig. 7a), under a 20%
    reduction of irrigation quota, RIS suggests three irrigation applications. The
    farmer chooses to their own choices on day 26, and comes back to follow the recommended
    applications on days 49, 85. As shown in Table 3, with RIS, the total irrigation
    water use is reduced by 20% with 5% of profit loss with the 80% water quota scenario,
    but the salt accumulation from RIS increases 0.46 g/L. It means less irrigation
    water quota will cause soil salt accumulation. 5.2. Crop water productivity vs
    irrigation water productivity under different water availability conditions In
    the study, crop water productivity (CWP) is defined as the yield per unit of evapotranspiration;
    irrigation water productivity (IWP) is defined as the yield per unit of irrigation
    water use during the crop growth season (Sadras, 2009, Zwart and Bastiaanssen,
    2004). Significant differences were found in the water productivity in different
    irrigation scheduling in 2018 and 2017 (Fig. 8). The crop water productivity from
    optimal solution under 100%, 80%, and 60% irrigation water quotas in 2018 is 1.93 kg m−3,
    1.91 kg m−3, and 1.88 kg m−3, respectively, which are close to the values from
    RIS, 1.93 kg m−3,1.90 kg m−3, and 1.87 kg m−3. Also, The crop water productivity
    from optimal solution under 100%, 80% irrigation water quotas in 2017 is 1.86 kg m−3,
    1.79 kg m−3, respectively, which are close to the values from RIS, 1.90 kg m−3,1.90 kg m−3.
    The crop water productivity from the historical record is 1.93 kg m− 3 and 1.88 kg m− 3
    in 2018 and 2017. The decrease of water quota reduces crop water productivity.

    Fig. 8. Water productivity and irrigation water productivity of sunflower for
    different irrigation scheduling of 2018 and 2017 from RIS and the simulation-optimization
    model. Zooms a, b and c show the CWP vs. IWP under the scenarios of 100%, 80%
    and 60% water quotas of 2018, respectively. Zooms d and e show the CWP vs. IWP
    under the scenarios of 100%, 80% water quotas of 2017, respectively. The irrigation
    water productivity from the historical record in 2018 and 2017 is 1.32 kg m− 3
    and 2.38 kg m− 3. In comparison, the irrigation water productivity from RIS is
    significantly higher than that of historical record and the optimal solution under
    100%, 80%, and 60% irrigation water quotas in all years. We also identify a significant
    increasing trend of IWP with declining irrigation water quota, which is consistent
    with previous studies (Huo et al., 2012, Sun et al., 2006), i.e., IWP can be improved
    with moderate deficit irrigation. Among the investigated irrigation scheduling,
    the one generated from RIS under 80% irrigation water quota of 2017 has the highest
    irrigation water productivity. These results thus indicate that the proposed RIS
    performs better under more restricted irrigation water availability. 6. Conclusions
    In this study, we develop a human-machine interactive method for real-time irrigation
    scheduling (RIS). The method is based simulation-optimization model that includes
    complex agro-hydrology system interactions between crop growth, soil water, groundwater
    and soil salinity, and link the model directly with irrigation farmers via assimilating
    soil moisture observations. This method combines model, observation and human
    justification into an “online” rolling over framework throughout the irrigation
    season. The method is applied to a case study site in Hetao Irrigation District
    in northwestern China with arid/semi-arid climate and shallow saline groundwater.
    The results from the RIS are compared to the optimal solution from the simulation-optimization
    model and the historical irrigation records. It is found that RIS can use less
    irrigation water and result in larger profit than the historical records, while
    remaining similar salt leaching results. Overall, the RIS ends with higher irrigation
    water productivity. The RIS based on human-machine interactions can be applied
    to other irrigation districts with soil moisture observation to support more effective
    real-time irrigation scheduling. In future studies, the proposed method will be
    tested to a real-time irrigation season in the case study area with farmers’ involvement.
    In particular, farmers’ behaviors in irrigation decisions underlying weather uncertainty,
    policy regulation, and market variability will be addressed to develop more appropriate
    rules for farmers to accept machine recommended irrigation applications during
    the human-machine interactions. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors

  description: Considering the high-quality requirements related to agricultural crop
    production, the collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler
    drip irrigation is an important issue in precision agriculture. The objective
    of this review is to give a comprehensive demonstration focusing on the subject
    of collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler drip irrigation,
    by using a set of comparative analysis and literature bibliometric maps, therefore
    the sprinkler drip irrigation quality considering actual influential factors could
    be determined and analyzed. This review establishes on a broad spectrum of agricultural
    drip irrigation performance, throughout its whole procedure of collaborative monitoring,
    irrigation scheduling, application efficiency, and environmental influence, covering
    such aspects as soil physicochemical quality, irrigation scheduling, water resource
    redistribution, crop productivity, tillage management, climate adaptation, and
    environmental monitoring, etc. This review indicates that, the irrigation efficiency
    and drip infiltration quality of soil field can be planned precisely and allocated
    reasonably by sprinkler drip irrigation, which has extraordinary infiltration
    capability and enables much better performance, than that of other ordinary irrigation
    approaches in accuracy, stability, regularity, and efficiency. Thereafter, the
    investigation on the collaborative operation and application influence of sprinkler
    drip irrigation can be used to ensure the infiltration uniformity of moisture
    distribution, and then the high-quality requirements of practical irrigation performance
    can be met, too. This systematic review facilitates the productive soil-moisture-environment
    management for precision irrigation and agricultural production.

    8 billion in November 2022 (UNFPA, 2022). This population growth was primarily
    driven by Asia and Africa and is expected to drive the next billion by 2037 (UNFPA,
    2022). This increased population is expected to increase the demand for the three
    basic needs of human existence: food, clothing and shelter. Intensive crop production
    to harvest more food, fodder and fibre (clothing) requires more water (Flörke
    et al., 2018); however, water available for such uses is limited. Although the
    most abundantly available resource on earth is water, with 70% of its surface
    covered by water, only a fraction (2.5%) of Earth''s water is fresh water (Siddique
    & Helen, 2014). Nearly 40% of global food production comes from irrigated fields
    (Chai et al., 2014). Although the global area equipped for irrigation has risen
    to 330 million ha (2015) (Mehta et al., 2022) from a meagre 100 million ha in
    1950, the rate of growth in irrigated areas has been declining and might have
    stagnated (Chai et al., 2014). Additionally, this declining rate of growth in
    irrigated areas might also be due to declining water levels in aquifers. Declining
    groundwater levels due to the overpumping of water from aquifers (Jasechko & Perrone,
    2021) have been reported predominantly from the major countries of the globe,
    viz., China (Chai et al., 2014), USA (Butler et al., 2018; Perrone & Jasechko,
    2019), India (Rodell et al., 2009) and Bangladesh (Hoque et al., 2007). The increasing
    depth of tube wells to draw water from deeper layers of the earth may cause food
    security issues in major food baskets of the world (Chai et al., 2014). A decline
    in the availability of water for agriculture combined with the threat of climate
    change may further decrease food production. The demand for more water for irrigation
    is further expected to increase with the increasing challenge of global climate
    change, which is manifested in the form of increased CO2 concentrations, warmer
    temperatures and altered rainfall patterns (IPCC, 2007). In addition to agriculture,
    cities around the globe are constantly expanding due to increasing urban migration,
    and urban water demand is expected to increase by 80% up to 2050 (Flörke et al.,
    2018). Additionally, the existence of constant tension between the different sectors
    of the economy for limited water resources has been observed (Endo et al., 2017;
    Flörke et al., 2018). Considering the above factors, water allocation to the agriculture
    sector needs to be looked at again to make way for other sectors of the economy.
    Therefore, the development and design of new strategies to manage water resources
    are crucial, and efforts to popularize the use of farmer-friendly approaches that
    improve agricultural water use may serve as an important adaptation strategy (Flörke
    et al., 2018). The published literature indicates that the term ‘water productivity’
    (WP) has been exclusively used to denote the amount or value of product obtained
    per unit volume or value of water consumed (Fernández et al., 2020). The product
    value has been described in terms of biomass, grain or monetary value (see Table
    2). Various units, such as kg m−3 or kg (ha mm)−1, have been used to measure WP
    (Gheysari et al., 2017; Paredes et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2012; Singh et al.,
    2014). Much research has focused on WP in relation to a particular crop. Currently,
    there are several reviews that concentrate on WP, which are either country-specific
    (Chai et al., 2014) or limited to specific topics, such as physiological interventions
    (Farooq et al., 2019) and individual methods of enhancing water use efficiency
    (WUE), such as regulated deficit irrigation (Chai et al., 2014). However, there
    is still a lack of a well-synthesized and comprehensive overview of the impact
    of WP in relation to the implementation of different strategies, such as precision
    land levelling, seed priming, WUE genotypes, automation of irrigation, etc., to
    enhance crop WP at a single place. To fill this gap and offer a well-synthesized
    overview of research progress, we have decided to review and compile information
    pertaining to practical approaches to enhance WP at the farm level, with a major
    focus on Asia. Therefore, the major goal of this review is to give decision-makers
    a selection of the best tools for making decisions that will help them successfully
    implement operating, strategic and tactical plans to efficiently manage agricultural
    water resources with a major focus on Asia. We adopted a methodological framework
    to compile and review the literature related to practical approaches for enhancing
    WP at the farm level. This framework placed major emphasis on searching the literature
    from 2000 to 2023 from irrigation and drainage-specific journals, as well as utilizing
    different search engines such as PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar and others. We
    searched and compiled the literature using 20 different keywords. This approach
    has resulted in the comprehensive review and conceptualization of published literature
    on (i) the status and definition of WP; (ii) factors responsible for low WP in
    agriculture and practical approaches to efficiently manage agricultural water
    resources covering all field crops and a range of soil types, which include (i)
    agronomic interventions; (ii) genetic interventions such as the identification
    and cultivation of crop cultivars with high WP; (iii) genotype, environment and
    crop management interactions for higher WP; and (iv) modern Internet of Things
    (IoT)-based smart irrigation systems, which are rarely covered by other reviews.
    2 GLOBAL SCENARIO OF THE WATER FOOTPRINT OF IMPORTANT CROPS The consumption of
    fresh water for producing food grains can be better understood through the concept
    of the water footprint, which helps to quantify the hidden water use associated
    with food production and assists in better management of global freshwater resources
    (Ercin et al., 2012). The water footprint can be divided into three categories:
    blue, green and grey. The blue water footprint refers to the volume of surface
    and groundwater consumed for crop production, while the green water footprint
    refers to the rainwater consumed. The grey water footprint of a product refers
    to the volume of fresh water that is required to assimilate the load of pollutants
    based on existing ambient water quality standards (Hoekstra & Mekonnen, 2012).
    Recently published reports (Mekonnen & Gerbens-Leenes, 2020) revealed that the
    global average water footprints of major crops are approximately 5875 m3 t⁻¹ for
    lentils, 4478 m3 t⁻¹ for millet, 3048 m3 t⁻¹ for sorghum, 2782 m3 t⁻¹ for groundnut,
    2145 m3 t⁻¹ for soybean, 1827 m3 t⁻¹ for wheat, 1673 m3 t⁻¹ for rice, 1423 m3
    t⁻¹ for barley, 1222 m3 t⁻¹ for maize and 210 m3 t⁻¹ for sugar cane. Among the
    different countries, the total water footprint is largest for India (1047 Gm3
    yr⁻¹), China (967 Gm3 yr⁻¹) and the USA (826 Gm3 yr⁻¹). Mekonnen and Hoekstra
    (2010) estimated global water consumption in agriculture, which is listed in Table
    1. The grid-based dynamic water balance model developed in this study estimates
    crop evapotranspiration and yield by computing a daily soil water balance and
    calculating crop water requirements, actual crop water use and actual yields.
    The model is applied at a global scale using a resolution of 5 by 5 arcminute
    grid size. Wheat and rice have the lowest green water footprints but the highest
    blue water footprints, while millet and sorghum have the opposite pattern. Maize
    is the only cereal that has both low blue and green water footprints (Kayatz et
    al., 2019). Wheat, with the highest blue water footprint, is exclusively grown
    as an irrigated winter crop. Wheat and rice together account for 45% of the global
    blue water footprint, with wheat consuming the largest share of this volume; it
    uses 1087 Gm3 yr⁻¹ (70% green, 19% blue, 11% grey). TABLE 1. Global average water
    footprint in important crops. Crop Global average water footprint (m3t−1) Green

    9371 3 CURRENT STATUS OF WATER PRODUCTIVITY AMONG MAJOR CROPS The term ‘water
    productivity’ (WP) refers to the amount or value of product produced per unit
    volume or value of water consumed (Fernández et al., 2020). The volume of water
    includes irrigation water and water from precipitation during the crop cycle.
    The product value can be measured in terms of biomass, grain or monetary value
    (as shown in Table 2). Different units, such as kg m−3 or kg ha-1 mm−1, have been
    used to express WP (Gheysari et al., 2017; Paredes et al., 2018; Pereira et al.,
    2012; Singh et al., 2014). Various methods have been explored to maximize the
    WP in both irrigated and rainfed crops, and this remains a major focus of current
    plant–environment interaction research. Any intervention that increases crop yield
    with minimal water demand directly improves WP (Molden et al., 2010). TABLE 2.

    regions. Sharma et al. (2018) compiled the WP of major crops (Table 3) and reported
    a wide variation in WP among the crops and crop cultivars. To achieve improved
    WP, it is important to rely only on agronomic practices that demand less irrigation
    and provide maximum crop yield (Pawar & Khanna, 2018). The high variability in
    productivity data indicates a huge scope for improving WP. TABLE 3. Water productivity

    Y/I 4 FACTORS RESPONSIBLE FOR LOW WP IN CROP PRODUCTION Producing more crops with
    less water is a major challenge, especially in arid and semi-arid regions under
    changing climatic conditions (Hassanli et al., 2009; Shayanmehr et al., 2022).
    WP is the net result of several interacting factors, such as water-use-efficient
    genotypes, soil fertility status, timing and method of irrigation application,
    water seepage and percolation, soil depth and texture, irrigation channel design
    and maintenance, crop field division, weather during the crop cycle, weed control
    and size of the irrigated area, which affect water management and crop yield.
    The factors responsible for the lower WP of crops are summarized in Figure 1.
    FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Factors causing decline in WP in semi-arid
    climates. 4.1 Conventional irrigation methods Conventional, unscientific on-farm
    water management practices contribute to low WP. Conventional inefficient irrigation
    methods, such as flooding, lead to the loss of water through leaching and evaporation
    (Kharrou et al., 2011; Meena, Tripathi, et al., 2015; Pool et al., 2022; Rao et
    al., 2016), and their efficiency ranges between 25 and 40% (Amarasinghe et al.,
    2007). On the other hand, advanced irrigation methods, such as sprinkler and drip
    irrigation systems, achieve an efficiency of nearly 90% (Delpiazzo et al., 2023;
    Kumar & Palanisami, 2011; Narayanamoorthy, 2006). However, due to the high installation
    cost, maintenance and repair cost in subsequent years, additional energy/electricity
    required to run the system, and lack of awareness about incentives made available
    in the form of subsidies in a few states, only approximately 15% of the irrigated
    area is covered under drip systems in countries such as the USA, China and India,
    followed by Turkey and Tunisia (7%) and Iran and Saudi Arabia (5%) (Mamun Hossain
    et al., 2017). 4.2 Conventional soil and crop management practices Improper land
    levelling is a common problem under conventional irrigation methods, which greatly
    affects uniform water distribution and contributes to low WP (Jat et al., 2004,
    2006; Jat, Gathala, et al., 2009; Kaur et al., 2012). Moreover, WP under the common
    planting method of conventional flat sowing has been reported to be 6–40% lower
    than that under improved planting methods such as raised bed planting (Mollah
    et al., 2009; Ram et al., 2011). Crop density and planting techniques significantly
    influence root development, solar radiation interception and field evaporation,
    ultimately impacting WP (Hatfield & Dold, 2019; Singh et al., 2014). 4.3 Policy
    issues that contribute to the overuse of water The governments of many states
    in the South Asian region provide a highly subsidized power supply to the agriculture
    sector. Such policies encourage farmers to indiscriminately withdraw groundwater
    for irrigation, which has led to low WP and other disadvantages, such as excessive
    electricity consumption, leaching of nitrogenous fertilizers below the root zone,
    groundwater pollution and increased weed infestation (Meena, Karnam, Rinki, et
    al., 2019). Indiscriminate withdrawal of groundwater that is supported by tariff-free
    electricity supply has resulted in a rapid decline in groundwater levels in different
    parts of India (Kumar et al., 2005; Meena, Karnam, Rinki, et al., 2019). 4.4 Inefficient
    infrastructure Government agencies are responsible for surface water systems for
    building irrigation facilities, maintenance and distribution. Currently, approximately
    three-quarters of the area is irrigated by groundwater in India (Bhaduri et al.,
    2012) and 38% worldwide (Siebert et al., 2010). Groundwater resources are under
    the control of individuals who own the land. This excessive dependency on groundwater
    has led to a sharp depletion of the water table worldwide. Cheap, subsidized electricity
    for pumping worsens the situation because farmers use more water per irrigation
    than the actual requirement (Meena, Karnam, Rinki, et al., 2019; Mitra et al.,
    2023). More water withdrawal than the annual recharge for irrigation (Chai et
    al., 2014) creates a water scarcity situation in arid and semi-arid regions. South
    Asia is the largest user of groundwater (Hirji et al., 2017; Mukherjee et al.,
    2015), with the greatest fall in the groundwater table (Sekhri, 2012). There is
    an urgent need to increase infrastructure to enhance the use of surface water
    systems for irrigation, with collective efforts from governments and individuals
    at various levels. 5 STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE WATER PRODUCTIVITY Improvement in WP
    is directly linked to water savings in irrigation, along with maintaining or increasing
    crop yield. Researchers have proposed several measures to enhance WP, including
    both agronomic and genetic methods (Figure 2). Agronomic practices include precision
    land levelling, seed priming, tillage practices, planting methods, mulching, and
    appropriate irrigation methods and scheduling. Moreover, the genetic variability
    of drought tolerance can also be exploited to improve the WP by plant breeding
    drought-tolerant and water-use-efficient genotypes. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Multi-pronged strategies to enhance crop WP. 5.1 Agronomic measures
    to improve water productivity 5.1.1 Precision land levelling Improper land levelling
    can lead to overirrigation or water deficits in certain areas of the field, which
    can negatively impact crop growth, yield and WP (Saheed et al., 2022). Soil experts
    have suggested precision land levelling as a way to improve water distribution
    efficiency (Table 4). Precision land levelling has been shown to improve water
    application uniformity, reducing irrigation water requirements by up to 30% and
    increasing crop production by up to 20% (Jat et al., 2006; Kaur et al., 2012).
    Several reports have indicated that laser-guided land levelling is superior to
    manual levelling (Jat et al., 2015, 2011; Jat, Sharma, et al., 2019; Naresh et
    al., 2014; Saheed et al., 2022), conserving water by up to 20% and reducing irrigation
    time and electricity consumption (Jat et al., 2006; Kaur et al., 2012). TABLE

    Seed priming technology in suboptimal soil moisture scenarios Challenges to improper
    germination and poor crop establishment are common in arid and semi-arid regions
    with limited water availability. Seed priming is a presowing operation that partially
    hydrates the seed before emergence (Chen & Arora, 2011; Meena, Tripathi, et al.,
    2015; Roy & Srivastava, 1999) and has been suggested as a way to address these
    challenges (Table 5). Seed priming has been found to have numerous benefits for
    crops such as cereals (e.g. wheat, rice, maize and barley), pulses such as chickpea
    (Cicer arietinum), mung bean (Vigna radiata) and lentil (Lens culinaris) and vegetable
    crops. These benefits include uniform and faster germination, vigorous plant growth,
    high yield gain (Devika et al., 2021; Harris & Hollington, 2001; Harris et al.,
    1999) and improved WP (Sihag et al., 2015). Moreover, seed priming improves early
    crop establishment, which can lead to yield maximization (Harris et al., 1999;
    Harris & Hollington, 2001; Shabbir et al., 2014). It has also been found to enhance
    antioxidant enzymes, leading to higher seedling vigour (Roqueiro et al., 2012).

    6). Under the rice–wheat (RW) cropping system, ZT is recognized as a simple, cost-effective
    and beneficial tillage operation that helps conserve residual moisture (Choudhary
    et al., 2020; Erenstein & Laxmi, 2008; Jat, Gupta, et al., 2009). Several reports
    indicate that ZT saves considerable amounts of water in wheat cultivation (Hobbs
    & Gupta, 2003; Humphreys et al., 2005; Malik et al., 2002; Meena et al., 2014).
    Zero tillage is a simple technology that reduces evaporation losses, regulates
    soil temperature, increases soil organic carbon, enhances crop yield, and leads
    to higher WP (Phogat et al., 2020). TABLE 6. Effect of tillage practices on water

    Hasan et al. (2017) 5.1.4 Crop diversification Despite rice having a low WP compared
    to other crops, the major cropping system in South Asia is the rice–wheat system,
    which results in decreased overall WP (Humphreys et al., 2010; Kumar et al., 2021;
    Tyagi et al., 2005). Rice (lowland) is less water productive (0.2–1.2 kg m−3)
    than wheat (0.8–1.6 kg m−3) and maize (1.6–3.9 kg m−3) (Kumar et al., 2021). Therefore,
    crop diversification can be achieved by replacing traditional rice with less water-intensive
    crops, such as soybean, maize and pigeon pea. This could address not only the
    issues of low WP but also deteriorating soil health and high energy consumption.
    Several studies (Table 7) have indicated that the cropping system significantly
    influences water saving. Crops other than rice were irrigated at critical growth
    stages, whereas rice remained submerged at all times. Jat et al. (2020) documented
    that the maize–wheat cropping system is a highly practical substitute for the
    existing RW system in terms of water saving, WP and economic returns due to the
    lower water use and higher yield of the maize–wheat cropping system. TABLE 7.

    Sandy loam 29 Tripathi & Das (2017) On the other hand, intercropping practices
    have been shown to increase input use efficiency, including water, making a significant
    contribution to global food security and providing economic benefits to farmers
    (Yin et al., 2018). Intercropping can be a wise strategy to reduce the irrigation
    water required by the crop. For instance, the wise layout of intercrop strips,
    such as maize–pea strip intercropping, with four rows of maize and four rows of
    pea, reduced irrigation water use by 10.2–13.7% compared to sole cropping (Mao
    et al., 2012). Additionally, the water absorption space and root distribution
    of intercropping systems with different rooting patterns and water transport mechanisms
    can produce a complementary effect (Mu et al., 2013; Sekiya et al., 2011), thereby
    enhancing the overall WUE of the system. 5.1.5 Improved planting methods Conventional
    flat sowing and flood irrigation practices have been found to be disadvantageous
    because of inundation/waterlogging and overirrigation causing crop failures. However,
    improved planting methods such as furrow-irrigated raised bed (FIRB) planting
    have been found to have several benefits, including higher WP than flat sowing
    (Jat, Singh, et al., 2005; Jat, Srivastava, et al., 2005; Saheed et al., 2022).
    The alternate ridges and furrows under the FIRB help check runoff, improve the
    percolation rate and enhance the soil surface area for retaining rainfall, facilitating
    better drainage (Tripathi & Das, 2017). Several studies have reported significant
    water savings of up to 50% in wheat and pearl millet using the FIRB system compared
    to flat sowing (Choudhury et al., 2013; Jat et al., 2020; Jat, Singh, et al.,
    2005; Jat, Srivastava, et al., 2005; Mollah et al., 2009; Saheed et al., 2022;
    Tripathi & Das, 2017) and pearl millet (Rathore et al., 2008). In salinity-affected
    soils, FIRB planting and irrigation are an ideal technology. Crops are planted
    in furrow bottoms, resulting in less evaporation, higher wheat yield (4%) and
    higher WP (5%) at a salinity level of 7.5 dS m−1 (Mosaffa & Sepaskhah, 2019).
    FIRB also plays a significant role in saving other inputs, such as seeds, fertilizers
    and herbicides, in different crops (Dhindwal et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010;
    Singh et al., 2014). Apart from FIRB, other management practices, such as altering
    plant populations (Farooq et al., 2019; Singh et al., 2003), direct seeding in
    rice instead of transplanting (Gill et al., 2006; Jat, Singh, et al., 2005) and
    planting at optimum sowing times (Kumar, Karaliya, & Chaudhary, 2017; Meena, Meena,
    et al., 2018; Pal et al., 1996; Sihag et al., 2015) have also been reported to
    enhance WP. 5.1.6 Biodegradable plastic mulch for specialty crop production Biodegradable
    plastic mulch is a modern approach that can improve the WP of crops. By reducing
    the evaporation rate, biodegradable film conserves moisture in the soil and controls
    weeds (Hayes et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021). It is easy to use, versatile and
    environmentally friendly, as it prevents the use and accumulation of low-density
    polyethylene, thus avoiding plastic waste pollution (Zumstein et al., 2018). Studies
    have revealed that biodegradable mulching can be a better substitute for common
    polyethylene mulch for crops such as cotton, potato, peanut and beets because
    it preserves soil moisture (Wang et al., 2021). The use of biodegradable materials
    has been reported to lead to significantly higher WP (11.5%) in wheat (Chai et
    al., 2022), maize (8.2%) (Chen et al., 2019) and cotton in arid regions (69.5%)
    (Deng et al., 2019). In an extensive review, Adhikari et al. (2016) emphasized
    the potential of sprayable biodegradable polymer mulch in the future to produce
    more food with limited water. There are enormous opportunities to encapsulate
    agrochemicals and nutrients in the form of a sprayable biodegradable polymer mulch
    and investigate the efficacy and impact of the developed biodegradable polymer
    formulations on ecosystem services and soil health (Adhikari et al., 2016; Filipović
    et al., 2020). 5.2 Irrigation strategies to enhance WP Irrigation methods such
    as microirrigation and regulated deficit irrigation are crucial in maximizing
    crop yield and improving WP. It is important to adopt efficient water application
    methods and appropriate irrigation schedules to achieve the goal of ‘more crop
    per drop’. This section highlights the scientific evidence supporting the location-specific
    adoption of these methods to enhance WP. 5.2.1 Microirrigation Microirrigation
    is a technology that enables precise and efficient water application to the root
    zone of plants in the form of spray, mist, sprinkle and drip (surface drip and
    subsurface drip) at low pressure (Hla & Scherer, 2003). It plays a significant
    role in higher precision and WP. Microirrigation has several advantages, such
    as reducing the irrigation cost, energy and fertilizer usage by 20–50, 31 and
    7–42%, respectively (Varma et al., 2006). Moreover, it allows for the application
    of water at the right time and at a precise rate based on the crop''s water requirement
    (Evans & Sadler, 2008). Studies have shown that adopting drip systems can save
    irrigation water by 30–60% compared to surface irrigation while increasing yield
    by 20–50% in various crops (Sivanappan, 1994; van der Kooij, 2009). The adoption
    of microirrigation has been found to enhance WP, as listed in Table 8. TABLE 8.

    system Drip irrigation is considered to be an advanced irrigation technology.
    It operates on the fundamental concept of delivering water directly to plants
    instead of irrigating the entire land surface. The system offers several advantages,
    including substantial water savings of up to 60%, higher WP and a significant
    increase in crop yield. Drip irrigation can be installed on the field surface
    or subsurface, depending on the placement of drip laterals. Surface drip irrigation
    (SDI) system SDI is considered one of the most viable irrigation systems in the
    agricultural sector with the additional advantage of water saving, according to
    many published reports (Ayars et al., 1999; Lamm et al., 1997; Meena, Sharma,
    et al., 2015; Umair et al., 2019). SDI provides a significantly higher application
    efficiency of 20–37% over conventional irrigation methods, such as sprinkler and
    flood irrigation (Han et al., 2018; Martínez & Reca, 2014; Narayanamoorthy, 2006).
    Fertigation, the application of nutrients along with irrigation through SDI, has
    been reported to increase nitrogen use efficiency in major crops (Hagin et al.,
    2002; Nagaraju et al., 2014; Sidhu et al., 2019). SDI has demonstrated several
    beneficial effects over conventional methods, including precise application with
    a high degree of control, minimum evaporation losses, optimum soil moisture content
    in the root zone and minimum weed infestation, especially in arid zones. Sugar
    cane, soybean, cotton, maize and wheat crops have shown improved performance with
    the use of SDI (Aujla et al., 2007; Hogeboom & Hoekstra, 2017; Meena, Sharma,
    et al., 2015). Subsurface drip irrigation (SSDI) SSDI, an advanced water-saving
    irrigation technology, has been acknowledged by several reports (Jat et al., 2021;
    Sidhu et al., 2019; Umair et al., 2019). SSDI helps to avoid evaporation losses,
    weed proliferation, and the problem of repeated installation and removal of laterals
    during land preparation and harvesting of the crop. Compared to flood irrigation,
    SSDI saves irrigation water by approximately 50% in cereal crops such as rice,
    wheat and maize, thereby improving WP (Jat, Sutaliya, et al., 2019; Jat et al.,
    2020). In addition to water saving, the SSDI system has several other advantages,
    such as reduced labour costs, improved nitrogen-use efficiency by 25% through
    direct root zone delivery (Jat, Datta, et al., 2019; Jat, Sharma, et al., 2019;
    Sidhu et al., 2019) and direct seeding of the crop with no-tillage practices (Ayars
    et al., 1999). Furthermore, SSDI systems have been found to reduce downstream
    contamination of water bodies with nitrogen compared to conventional systems (Jensen
    et al., 1990; Shaxson, 2006). In the present scenario of water shortage and climate
    change, SSDI systems hold great importance for all kinds of farmers. Crops grown
    under SSDI have uniform growth because water is distributed evenly across the
    field. However, one major constraint for the adoption of such systems is their
    high implementation cost. 5.2.2 Regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) RDI is an irrigation
    strategy that involves applying water to crops at a level lower than the optimum
    evapotranspiration demand with the aim of increasing WP (Chai et al., 2015; García-Tejero
    et al., 2010; Mushtaq & Moghaddasi, 2011). The approach involves underirrigation
    of crops at specific stages of the crop cycle when the crop is less sensitive
    to water deprivation, while at critical stages of crop development, irrigation
    is applied to meet the crop water requirements. RDI can be implemented in various
    ways, such as alternate wetting and drying, reduced irrigation depth, omitting
    irrigation at less responsive crop growth stages and irrigating the crop only
    in alternate furrows (Du et al., 2015; Kang et al., 2000). Studies have demonstrated
    the benefits of RDI in reducing irrigation water requirements and improving WP
    (Table 9) (Aujla et al., 2007; Meena, Karnam, Rink, et al., 2019; Ünlü et al.,
    2011). Significant improvements in WP (10–42%) have been observed in principal
    cereal crops such as rice, wheat and maize with the practice of RDI (Ilbeyi et
    al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2019; Meena, Karnam, Tripathi, et al., 2019). RDI can
    also help plants improve their water stress tolerance capabilities by stimulating
    various physiological modifications under gradual water stress conditions (Turner,
    2004). TABLE 9. Regulated deficit irrigation aided water savings in major crops.

    system Automated irrigation systems are a form of precision agriculture technology
    that automates the irrigation process in crop production. It employs sensors,
    controllers and water delivery systems to manage and optimize water usage for
    crops (Figure 3). The objective is to provide the appropriate amount of water
    at the right time and location, which can enhance crop yield, reduce water wastage
    and increase the efficiency of water use in agriculture. Automated irrigation
    systems are the most recent smart technology that ensures precise water application
    and proper scheduling of irrigation, leading to improved water productivity (Parimala
    et al., 2021). Advanced techniques such as precise control over volume and time
    of delivery, real-time feedback and computerized control systems are used to achieve
    full automation (Kumar et al., 2016, 2018; Meena, Tripathi, et al., 2018). A prime
    example in this case is the decision support system (DSS) developed by integrating
    moisture sensors for real-time irrigation scheduling (Kumar et al., 2021; McClymont,
    2007). Computer-based simulation models such as CROPWAT, IrriSatSMS, IrriSat and
    PILOTE provide information on irrigation scheduling for various crops and serve
    as an essential input for automation (D''Urso et al., 2013; FAO, 1992; Hornbuckle
    et al., 2009; Kumar, Patel, & Rajput, 2017). The developers involved and the specific
    use of these crop models are given in Table 10. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Smart irrigation system components (adopted from Munir et al., 2018).
    TABLE 10. The developers involved and the specific use of a few of the water-saving
    crop models. Software name Developer(s) Specific example of use CROPWAT Food and
    Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) CROPWAT is a computer program
    that helps farmers and irrigation managers calculate the water requirements of
    crops based on climate data, soil type and other factors. It can be used to optimize
    irrigation scheduling and improve WUE. IrriSatSMS IrriWatch IrriSatSMS is a smartphone
    application that uses satellite data to provide real-time information on crop
    water use and soil moisture levels. It can be used to optimize irrigation scheduling
    and reduce water waste. IrriSat IrriWatch IrriSat is a web-based application that
    uses satellite data to monitor crop water use and soil moisture levels. It can
    be used to optimize irrigation scheduling, improve crop yield and reduce water
    waste. PILOTE INRAE, AgroParisTech PILOTE is a software application that helps
    farmers and irrigation managers optimize irrigation scheduling based on soil moisture
    measurements. It can be used to reduce water use, improve crop yield and save
    energy costs. Automated irrigation systems often include a network of remote sensing
    and plant sensors, which provide critical information for managing water resources
    and optimizing crop growth. Remote sensing relies on satellite or aerial imagery
    to measure crop conditions, such as crop growth, soil moisture and temperature.
    These data are recorded by sensors on the ground, aircraft or satellites and transmitted
    to a computer system for analysis. The information gathered helps farmers make
    informed decisions about irrigation scheduling and crop management. Plant sensors
    are another type of device used in automated irrigation systems. They measure
    plant parameters such as leaf temperature, humidity and water stress. These sensors
    can be placed directly on the plant or in the soil and provide real-time data
    on the crop''s health. The data collected from plant sensors are then used to
    determine the appropriate irrigation levels and timing for the crop. An automated
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based smart irrigation system utilizes smart algorithms
    and integrates communication between a set of sensors installed in the field for
    real-time collection of soil moisture status and weather data. The system enables
    quick decision-making and reduces water loss (Rawal, 2017), leading to a reduction
    in labour and time and also promote water savings (Jitendra et al., 2016; Subramanian,
    2000). Parameswaran and Sivaprasath (2016) reported a significant increase in
    WP of approximately 90% when using an automated irrigation system compared to
    a conventional flood irrigation system. The use of automated irrigation has been
    reported to be beneficial in saving substantial amounts of irrigation water (Table
    11). Al-Ghobari et al. (2017) compared automated irrigation vs. conventional flood
    irrigation and found that WUE values were increased in automated irrigation (1.64 kgm−3)
    compared to the control (1.47 kgm−3) for wheat and tomato (automated: 7.50 kgm−3
    vs. control: 5.72 and 4.70 kgm−3). Dassanayake et al. (2009) demonstrated that
    using a well-connected network of sensors can save water at the farming system
    level in Australian conditions over conventional border-check irrigation. Ojha
    et al. (2015) reported the results of a survey conducted on the use of wireless
    sensor networks in India and globally. The results indicated a water saving of
    30% over the conventional irrigation methods. TABLE 11. Water saving through an
    automated irrigation system. Cropping system/Crop Water saving (%) References

    5.3 Irrigation scheduling To ensure efficient use of irrigation water, it is important
    to adopt an appropriate irrigation schedule that avoids both over- and underirrigation.
    Zhao et al. (2020) suggested reducing irrigation frequency and amount as a feasible
    approach for saving irrigation water. In sandy loam soils with pH 7.8 and EC 0.26 dS
    m⁻¹ in a 1 : 2.5 soil water suspension, low-volume drip irrigation with a higher
    frequency can increase WP by 30.6% compared to traditional irrigation scheduling
    at fixed intervals. Tensiometers are important tools for intelligent irrigation
    scheduling that can determine the optimal irrigation time based on soil moisture
    status. Meena, Tripathi, et al. (2018) reported an increase in WP when wheat crops
    were irrigated using tensiometers set at 60 and 80 kPa. They found that total
    irrigation water consumption ranged from 300 to 484 mm when irrigation was scheduled
    using tensiometers, compared to 390 to 602 mm when irrigation was scheduled only
    at critical growth stages. Tensiometers consider various factors, such as soil
    type, temperature, relative humidity and sunshine hours, which are not accounted
    for in fixed crop growth stage-based irrigation scheduling. In tomato crops, tensiometer-guided
    irrigation scheduling can reduce water requirements by 40–50% (Dukes et al., 2010).
    Soil moisture sensors play a vital role in sustainable agriculture by providing
    real-time, in situ moisture measurements that enable precise irrigation scheduling
    (Kumar et al., 2021; Skierucha & Wilczek, 2010; Thompson et al., 2007). 5.4 Other
    new emerging concepts 5.4.1 Identification of crop cultivars with high WP In addition
    to agronomic management practices, breeding water-use-efficient or drought-tolerant
    cultivars has emerged as one of the most promising approaches to alleviate moisture
    stress and enhance crop WP. Selecting suitable cultivars that can produce higher
    or at par yield under moisture deficit conditions has tremendous scope to improve
    WP (Meena, Karnam, Rinki, et al., 2019). Genotypes with high WP have been found
    in several crops, including wheat (Meena, Karnam, Rinki, et al., 2019; Siahpoosh
    et al., 2011; Siahpoosh & Dehghanian, 2012), barley (Hubick & Farquhar, 1989),
    sorghum (Donatelli et al., 2012), cowpea (Ashok et al., 1999; Ismail, 1993), peanut
    (Hubick et al., 1988; Wright & Rao, 1994), soybean (Hufstetler et al., 2007; Mian
    et al., 1996) and cotton (Fish & Earl, 2009; McMichael & Quisenberry, 1991; Saranga
    et al., 2004). 5.4.2 Genotype, environment and crop management layering for higher
    WP Understanding the complex interaction of genotype, environment and crop management
    (G × E × M) is crucial for making informed farm decisions, especially in terms
    of genotype selection, economic planning and sustainable farm management. Crop
    WP is a complex quantitative trait that is greatly influenced by both external
    environmental factors and internal inputs. Therefore, it is important to develop
    high-yielding and consistently performing genotypes under different crop management
    practices across diverse environments. Tillage operations can greatly affect the
    biological, physical and chemical properties of the soil system (Gathala et al.,
    2011; Jat et al., 2013), highlighting the need to understand the behaviour of
    crop cultivars under different agro-ecological environments and crop management
    practices to improve WP. Synthesizing research studies suggests that adopting
    the following steps can lead to high crop WP: (i) evaluating crop genotypes under
    G × E × M interaction systems, (ii) identifying high-yielding genotypes with better
    WP under different cropping systems and diverse crop management regimes, and (iii)
    building genotype-oriented management strategies and recommending superior genotype(s)
    within and across agro-ecological zones. 6 CONCLUSIONS The continuous shrinking
    of irrigation water availability has made it imperative for crops and cropping
    systems to switch to efficient water-saving technologies. Lower WP due to mismanagement
    of irrigation water is a major issue that needs to be addressed. Various promising
    pathways for improving WP are available across the continuum, ranging from water-scarce
    rainfed to fully irrigated cropping systems. After a vigorous review of various
    studies, it can be concluded that there is much scope for improving the WP of
    crops and cropping systems. Considerable amounts of irrigation water can be saved
    by adopting many agronomic practices, such as precision land levelling (13–40%),
    modern tillage methods (15–71%), improved planting methods (20–50%), microirrigation
    (25–70%), regulated deficit irrigation (5–50%), modern irrigation systems (26–38%)
    and mulching (5–25%). In addition, selecting suitable ‘less water demanding’ crops
    and cropping systems, such as maize–wheat rather than rice–wheat, coupled with
    agronomic practices, should help increase WP. Furthermore, the use of water-efficient
    cultivars with efficient rooting and shooting characteristics can also be an important
    strategy in this regard. Cutting-edge water-conservation approaches such as conservation
    agriculture coupled with irrigation technologies such as subsurface drip irrigation
    are promising and could lead to a marked increase in WP. Under such circumstances,
    a deep understanding of the G × E × M interaction system becomes important in
    making vital farm decisions. Most importantly, the success of such systems largely
    depends on awareness among farmers, policy makers and associated stakeholders.
    7 FUTURE PROSPECTS Research activities should focus on modern technologies such
    as remote sensing and IoT to enable automated precise irrigation. Plant breeding
    for water-efficient genotypes needs more attention. Therefore, research should
    be focused on evaluating less water-consuming crops and cropping systems in comparison
    to water-intensive crops. Furthermore, strengthening irrigation infrastructure
    and networking must be one of the top priorities for storing rainwater and harnessing
    runoff water in an effective and efficient manner. Most importantly, the success
    of such systems depends on awareness among farmers. Therefore, there should be
    farmer-oriented awareness campaigns and programmes aimed at improving their skills
    and knowledge. CONFLICT OF INTEREST STATEMENT No potential conflict of interest

    Palavras-chave: agricultura de precisão; gestão da água; economia de água; tecnologias
    na irrigação INTRODUCTION: Precision agriculture currently plays a significant
    role in the spatial and temporal management of the inputs involved in agricultural
    production. This science focused on the optimization of water resources in irrigated
    areas is called precision irrigation (PI), whose objective is to develop appropriate
    technologies to increase water productivity in irrigated agriculture through the
    application of water in precise and accurate amounts at the right time, according
    to the spatial and temporal variability of the irrigated areas (ABIOYE et al.,
    2020 ; BWAMBALE et al., 2023 ; ABAGALE & ANORNU, 2023; CAPRARO et al., 2018 ).
    In addition, considering irrigation management, this is elaborated, according
    to soil, plant and climate information, which generate a large volume of data
    to be transformed into prescription maps of irrigation depths, based on the variability
    of soil attributes, landscape features and growing conditions (STONE et al., 2015
    ). In view of this, precision irrigation has tools capable of identifying contrasting
    spatial differences in an agricultural production area and establishing personalized
    management in a rational way in the field (CASANOVA et al., 2014 ; CORWIN, 2013;
    PAN et al., 2013 ). The technologies being used, including in an integrated way,
    are as follows: automatic weather stations, remote sensing, global positioning
    system (GPS), geographic information systems (GIS) (BARKER et al., 2018 ; GIOTTO
    et al., 2016; MENDES et al., 2019 ; MILLER et al., 2017 ; NEUPANE & GUO, 2019
    ), multispectral cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) (GAGO et al., 2015 ;
    MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018 ), network of wireless sensors (WSN) (IBRAHIM et al.,
    2015 ), software (GOLDSTEIN et al., 2017 ; MCCARTHY et al., 2014 ), and plant
    growth and water flow simulation models (LIAKOS et al., 2019 ; LOZOYA et al.,
    2016 ; OLDONI & BASSOI, 2016 ; PEREA et al., 2017 ). Therefore, in this review,
    we focused on strategies, methods, new technologies and trends that are available
    to farmers and professionals in the context of precision irrigation with a focus
    on optimizing water use. Precision irrigation technologies and trends Soil moisture
    sensors in agriculture Irrigation management via soil moisture sensors has recently
    undergone several commercial innovations, many of which have been introduced by
    technology companies and independent research groups around the world (FERRAREZI
    et al., 2020 ). Many of these innovations are due to a significant decrease in
    the prices of monitoring equipment and data storage in digital agriculture. TIGLAO
    et al. (2020 ), who used a system of wireless sensors that cost half the price
    of commercial systems, achieved savings of 81% in water consumption applied in
    irrigation management. Although, the accessibility of sensors has increased in
    recent years, their operation still has the same fundamentals based on physical,
    chemical and mechanical methods for the determination of information of interest,
    which can be obtained electrically, electromagnetically, optically, radiometrically,
    mechanically, acoustically, pneumatically or electrochemically, with the methods
    of electrical resistance (Boyoucus), tensiometry, neutron moderation and time
    domain reflectometry (TDR) being the most used to estimate the amount of water
    available in the soil (ZINKERNAGEL et al., 2020 ). The most common and simple
    sensors that use indirect (non-destructive) methods to measure soil moisture are
    resistive sensors that work by monitoring the variation in electrical resistance
    between two electrodes embedded in the soil. Advantages of their use include low
    acquisition cost, simple sensor operation and easy availability in the market;
    as a disadvantage, they do not have high accuracy in soil moisture readings. Models
    such as FC-28 and SEN0114 are found on the market. The other sensors are capacitive,
    such as the SHT10 and EC-5 models; they work by measuring the dielectric constant
    of the soil by the time elapsed after emitting an electromagnetic pulse generated
    by metal rods embedded in the soil. These sensors have the advantage of high accuracy
    in readings; however, due to the construction of their sophisticated and expensive
    electronic components, their acquisition costs can be high (GASCH et al., 2017
    ; GOMES et al., 2017 ; MATOS et al., 2017 ). Other models found on the market
    include Decagon 10HS, Meter TEROS-12 (also measures temperature and electrical
    conductivity), Sentek Drill & Drop (measuring moisture, temperature and salinity
    every 10 cm) and Watermark 200SS (measures the tension of water held in the soil
    in kPa). Due to the wide variety of methods for obtaining data and the very nature
    of construction of humidity sensors, a series of usage characteristics and recommendations
    for each field condition can be specified in each specific situation ZINKERNAGEL
    et al. (2020 ). One of the biggest advantages of using soil moisture sensors is
    linked to irrigation management, since monitoring the amount of water in the soil
    is a direct indication of the irrigation needs of an agricultural area (HAMAMI
    & NASSEREDDINE, 2020 ).This applicability can be observed in research carried
    out by O’SHAUGHNESSY et al. (2020 ) in the state of Texas, USA, studying the productivity
    of Sorgum bicolor L., in which the productivity of irrigation water was quantified
    based on three different management methodologies, via plant-based thermal patterns,
    via soil-based neutron probe measurements, and a hybrid method combining plant
    and soil monitoring over a period of three consecutive years. The researchers
    reported that in the periods of joint use of monitoring methods (hybrid method),
    there was a consistent increase in the accumulation of biomass, resulting in both
    productivity gains per unit of area and water savings. EL-NAGGAR et al. (2020
    ), in an experiment in New Zealand with bean and pea crops under two irrigation
    management methods, via climatological water balance and via capacitive soil moisture
    sensors (FDR) coupled with radiofrequency data transmission systems (IoT), observed
    a difference in the volume of water applied and at the beginning of irrigation
    operations, resulting in savings between 27-44% of the volume of water used in
    areas managed with soil moisture sensors. This result was attributed to the imprecision
    of the balance methodology of water in predicting the effects of poor soil drainage,
    especially resulting from the presence of a physical impediment in the soil profile,
    which underestimates the real volume of water available to the plants. In addition
    to monitoring, the use of sensors also encompasses the use of automation in irrigation
    systems, as can be seen in a study carried out by CONESA et al. (2021 ), where
    the use of an automatic irrigation system based on capacitance sensors (FDR) showed
    better results in the efficiency of water use, resulting in a decrease in the
    irrigation depth compared to methods based on monitoring the evapotranspiration
    of the water reference (ETo) and in the use of crop coefficients (Kc) in the literature.
    JAISWAL & BALLAL (2020 ) used an automatic system based on soil and climate sensors
    operating with fuzzy logic to control the flow of the irrigation system, achieving
    a smaller volume of water between 45% and 30%, respectively, as well as lower
    irrigation costs, when compared to the flood irrigation system. According to DOMÍNGUEZ-NIÑO
    et al. (2020 ), the use of sensors in agriculture also allows a better understanding
    of the real situation of humidity in different areas with plants in different
    stages of growth, since monitoring via sensors takes place directly at the place
    of interest and not in a generalized way, such as in climate monitoring, which
    often considers irrigation sites based on a single stage of plant growth. The
    automation of irrigation systems based on soil sensors associated with the use
    of IoT technologies can be observed in the research of BARKUNAN et al. (2019 )
    in which the soil moisture and climate monitoring sensors were connected through
    a microcontroller capable of sending messages to the operator’s smartphone, providing
    information on the soil moisture conditions and the beginning of the irrigation
    period. This is possible through the use of wireless communication devices that
    allow data transfer between applications without cables. The use of a wireless
    sensor network is very important in precision irrigation because, according to
    irrigation management, extension of the area to be irrigated and producer preferences,
    it is necessary to use spatially distributed sensor mesh to attend to data collection
    remotely from several irrigated sectors, for example. Cabe points out that the
    choice of type of wireless device must consider the range of the device. For example,
    a Bluetooth device, model HC-06, with an SPP usage profile (Serial Port Profile),
    has a maximum distance of 10 m between connected devices, with a point-to-point
    connection. Another model, the XBee XB24-Z7WIT-004, of ZigBee specification, uses
    radiofrequency signals for communication and low operating power, with a range
    limit of about 100 m, which allows point-to-point and multipoint connections,
    making it possible to form a mesh network of wireless devices. Challenges in the
    application of sensors for soil moisture monitoring One of the challenges for
    using FDR or TDR sensors in soil water monitoring is the relationship between
    factory calibration and sensor installation orientation in the soil profile (vertical
    or horizontal), which can cause systematic variations in the humidity readings.
    This effect was observed by CHEN et al. (2019a ),who when comparing a capacity
    sensor and three TDR sensors in three positions on the ground, observed a significant
    variation in the readings of water content in the soil under irrigation, concluding
    that, in general, for sensors with factory calibration, the vertical orientation
    presents greater precision when compared to horizontal orientation, attributing
    this phenomenon to the greater disruption in the soil that the installation in
    the horizontal position of the sensor causes at the time of installation of the
    sensor. They suggested that irrigators should follow the positioning that manufacturers
    recommend for their equipment. However, SHARMA et al. (2017 ) pointed out that,
    not infrequently, the calibration of sensors provided by manufacturers can overestimate
    the volume of water in the soil and that, although they may be suitable for soils
    of similar texture, they often do not consider factors such as type, amount of
    organic matter and apparent density of the soil, which influence the dielectric
    properties, making a local calibration necessary for better accuracy in the readings.
    For the positioning of sensors in soil layers of different textures, KARGAS &
    SOULIS (2019 ) observed interesting results, concluding that for the correct management
    of irrigation in productive areas, it is necessary to use a different sensor for
    each soil layer or a single sensor installed in the middle portion of the root
    system that is in contact with both layers simultaneously. SILVA et al. (2018
    ), in a study on banana, observed that the ideal positioning of the sensors may
    not be constant throughout the development of the plant; that is, the most representative
    position for the sensor to read the soil moisture may vary along with the phenological
    stage of the plant. Other factors such as salinity, soil textural class and temperature
    where the sensor is installed can also affect the accuracy of soil moisture monitoring,
    which may limit the use of these sensors in areas with higher temperatures, such
    as semi-arid and arid regions, or the use of reused water in irrigation (CARDENAS-LAILHACAR
    & DUKES, 2015 ; INCROCCI et al., 2019 ; OATES et al., 2017 ). Naturally, the use
    of soil moisture sensors in agriculture results in a large amount of data for
    analysis. It is possible to observe a growing trend in researches that use data
    science techniques to interpret the readings of these sensors based on artificial
    intelligence techniques. Researches such as the one by GOLDSTEIN et al. (2017
    ) trained several machine learning algorithms in the interpretation of a series
    of climatic and soil data to propose assertive recommendations for the management
    of irrigation in the field based on data storage in cloud computing. Using more
    robust computational techniques, such as “neural networks” it is possible to employ
    a network of sensors for the precise determination of soil moisture, resulting
    not only in more homogeneous irrigation in the areas but also in water and electrical
    energy savings through the best use of the pumping system (DURSUN & ÖZDEN, 2016
    ). The use of mobile sensor systems, together with graphical software, to better
    understand the determination and monitoring of soil moisture distribution; although,
    in smaller quantities, also expands the options for new research areas and future
    applications at the field level (SHAN et al., 2019 ). Finally, the development
    of the following new types of sensors demonstrate industrial innovations to be
    used in future research: mm-sized soil moisture sensors (ZHOU et al., 2019 ),
    which have the ability to perform better monitoring of water distribution in the
    soil profile; perforated coaxial cylinder (CHEN et al., 2019c ), capable of monitoring
    both soil water volume and temperature; thick film conductivity sensors (SOPHOCLEOUS
    et al., 2020 ), capable of monitoring changes in soil structure through changes
    in conductivity and soil water content; and a Fiber Bragg Grating sensor (ZHANG
    et al., 2019 ), developed for monitoring water pressure in the field. Use of satellites
    and spectral sensors for precision irrigation Advances in spectroscopy have allowed
    the execution of specific analyses of different types of materials in a non-destructive
    and fast way, revealing valuable information through the energy reflection of
    the targets (LILLESAND & KIEFER, 1994). Spectral sensor technology has been used
    to efficiently generate information on a large time-space scale. Data collected
    in the field with point equipment can be, in some cases, more accurate, while
    cost, speed and practicality are advantages of spectral sensors coupled to satellites
    or UAVs to capture information spatially distributed over large areas. The remote
    data analyzed allow considerations about photosynthesis, physiological disturbances,
    phenology and water interactions in real time, which are fundamental for water
    planning and management (KARTHIKEYAN et al., 2020 ). Satellites and sensors There
    are currently several satellites in operation that perform this type of work remotely:
    MODIS, Landsat 7, Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2A. The great acceptance of this technology
    is because they are free products, with good spatiotemporal resolution and radiometric
    quality and with ease of data integration with APIs. The data generated by satellites
    can be useful in several applications at the irrigation level. VANINO et al. (2018
    ) combined meteorological data with data captured by the sensors of the Sentinel
    2A satellite to estimate the leaf area index and surface albedo to use this information
    to calculate the evapotranspiration of tomato crops and validate it through comparison
    with evapotranspiration data obtained by the soil-water balance. The results of
    this research showed the satisfactory suitability of the Sentinel 2A satellite
    to determine water demand. SHADMAN et al. (2017) used thermal band data from the
    Landsat 8 satellite to estimate water stress in sugarcane plants through the crop
    water stress index (CWSI). According to the author, the data capacity of the satellite
    sensors was positive and sufficient to carry out monitoring via remote sensing
    of the water stress of sugarcane without the need for auxiliary soil data. MARINO
    et al. (2014 ) evaluated spectral differences in tomato leaves located in 3 irrigated
    regions, classifying them as high (H), medium (M) and low (L) in terms of water
    use and efficiency; NETO et al. (2017 ) evaluated the spectral reflectance in
    the visible (VIS) and near-infrared region (NIR) of sunflower leaves in water
    deficit to obtain models capable of estimating the status of water and chlorophyll.
    CHEMURA et al. (2017 ) used information from VIS and NIR to create a machine learning
    model using the random forest algorithm to predict the water content in the plant
    in the coffee crop. All studies were conclusive and showed variations in spectral
    identity in relation to variations in water content in plants. In precision irrigation,
    indices generated from orbital satellites have been mainly used to: (a) monitor
    irrigation systems in macro-regions; (b) adapt local crop coefficients for a better
    calculation of plant evapotranspiration; and (c) estimate vegetative metrics such
    as plant density, coverage fraction (fc) and leaf area index (FRENCH et al., 2020
    ). According to CHEN et al. (2018 ), many studies focus only on mapping the extent
    of irrigated areas without considering important information that could also be
    extracted with the use of remote sensing, such as the amount of water with drawn
    from the system and the frequency and time of irrigation. Different levels of
    decision can be used in irrigated macro-regions using satellite systems, since
    it is possible to track the temporal growth of crops, deriving this information
    in basal coefficients that allow a better estimate of regional evapotranspiration.
    Thus, GONZÁLEZ-DUGO et al. (2013 ) developed a methodology called MINARET (monitoring
    irrigated agriculture ET), which uses Landsat data capable of constantly monitoring
    the water consumption of different irrigated crops. MASELLI et al. (2020 ) used
    meteorological data together with Sentinel 2A data to estimate evapotranspiration
    in monitoring irrigated areas in the Italian semi-arid region. Obtaining evapotranspiration
    values with greater precision is a fundamental factor, as it is a key parameter
    in the water and energy balance equation. FAO bulletin 56 states that crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) can be calculated by multiplying the reference evapotranspiration (ETo)
    and a specific crop coefficient (Kc) (ALLEN et al., 1998). Although, the coefficients
    provided by the FAO are general, throughout the growing season, there are variations
    in crop characteristics, so the parameter is intrinsically linked to species,
    variety, plant population density, phenology, water availability, climate and
    other factors. Therefore, a standard Kc may not well represent some localities,
    causing less reliable estimates and directly impacting good water use (MOKHTARIA
    et al., 2018 ). In recent years, several works have contributed to more accurate
    irrigation, developing methods to estimate Kc or Kcb (basal crop coefficient)
    and considering vegetation indices, which are considered great phenological thermometers,
    called Kc-VI (ALAM et al., 2018 ; CAMPOS et al., 2017 ). Still, more recently,
    PEREIRA et al. (2021 ) published a newsletter (Updates and forward to the FAO56
    crop water requirements method - Case studies using ground and remote sensing
    data; applications to update and upgrade the FAO56 method) with updates of these
    coefficients through a collection of several studies, with the use of new tools,
    such as remote sensing and IoT, which bring more precision to the calculation
    of the water needs of crops, which are important advances for precision irrigation.
    FRENCH et al. (2020 ), using data from Landsat and Sentinel mission satellites,
    determined a Kc-VI used to calculate wheat evapotranspiration. The experiment
    was carried out in the American southwest, and it was concluded that the best
    values of Kc and ETc were obtained in the middle of the season until the end of
    senescence, while at a time point sooner than 60 days after planting, a high and
    overestimated ETc was observed due to the low coverage canopy at the time, which
    contributed to the low reflectivity of the plants. Electromagnetic approach applied
    to the determination of the spatial variability of the water status of plants
    in the field based on UAVs Four components must be considered before selecting
    the appropriate UAV for IP (GAGO et al., 2015 ): experimental design, type of
    data to be obtained, data acquisition, and data processing and results. In addition
    to UAVs, sensors are essential for the quality of the images obtained. Decision-making
    regarding the type of camera to be used depends directly on the project objective.
    The cameras embedded in UAVs most used in the IP concept aiming intelligent management
    of water are thermal, multispectral, hyperspectral, RGB and near infrared (NIR)
    cameras. To monitor biotic and abiotic stress, thermal (1 band) and hyperspectral
    (100-250 bands) cameras are recommended, while multispectral (6-12 bands) and
    RGB cameras (3 bands) are indicated for growth and biomass assessment (ADÃO et
    al., 2017 ). High-resolution RGB cameras are traditionally used in agroforestry
    applications; however, they lack the precision and spectral range to trace the
    material characteristics that hyperspectral and multispectral cameras can provide.
    SUSIČ et al. (2018 ) demonstrated the potential of using hyperspectral images
    ranging from 400 to 2500 nm to assess the water deficit status in tomato plants.
    ZARCO-TEJADA et al. (2012 ) used UAV-based hyperspectral and thermal cameras to
    assess water stress levels in citrus crops and confirmed a link between PRI and
    canopy temperature. Recently, LOGGENBERG et al. (2018 ) used hyperspectral technology
    combined with machine learning to discriminate between water-stressed and non-stressed
    vines. Hyperspectral imaging cameras generally capture more detail in spatial
    and spectral ranges compared to other cameras. LOGGENBERG et al. (2018 ) observed
    that the main limiting factor in the application of hyperspectral data is the
    inherent issue of dimensionality, which results in reduced precision. In addition,
    hyperspectral cameras are very expensive and complex (ELVANIDI et al., 2018 ),
    which limits their expeditious and wide application, especially in commercial
    agriculture. Multispectral cameras are composed of multiple sensors with high-quality
    filters that can simultaneously capture images using different wave frequencies.
    They can record both the light spectrum that is visible to the human eye and the
    non-visible spectrum; thus, these cameras allow for much more accurate measurements
    of plant health and phenological status than conventional cameras (RGB) (KHANAL
    et al., 2017 ). Multispectral and hyperspectral cameras do not have a resolution
    comparable to traditional RGB cameras, which causes some initial frustration for
    users new to the spectral area accustomed to traditional high-resolution images.
    The resolution of RGB cameras is in the range of 20-120 MB, while multispectral
    and hyperspectral cameras have a resolution between 0.2-3 MB. According to POBLETE
    et al. (2017 ), plant water status is not accurately predicted using multispectral
    imaging between the 500 and 800 nm spectral bands due to the lack of sensitivity
    to water content; however, wavelengths greater than 800 nm are best for this purpose.
    RALLO et al. (2014 ) observed that satisfactory estimation of leaf water potential
    at leaf and canopy levels can be obtained using vegetation indices based on the
    NIR shortwave infrared domain, with specific optimization of the “central bands.”
    Recently, some researchers have developed artificial neural network (ANN) models
    derived from multispectral images to predict the spatial variability of water
    potential in agricultural crops. ROMERO et al. (2018 ) classified the water status
    of the vine based on 10 vegetation indices (VI) using bands of Red, Green, Red-Edge,
    and NIR wavelengths and found that there were no significant relationships between
    individual VIs, with values of correlation lower than 0.3 for almost all the studied
    indices. There is a very specific spectral band called RedEdge, which lies between
    red and infrared, has excellent correlation with chlorophyll fluorescence and
    effectively differentiates between healthy and senescent vegetation (MATESE &
    DI GENNARO, 2018 ). There is already a range of specific multispectral cameras
    for use embedded in UAVs (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018). Among them, Tetracam, Airinov
    and Micasense camera manufacturers can be highlighted. Tetracam’s modular cameras
    can be mounted in different arrangements, depending on which bands you want to
    capture and which bandwidths. Airinov’sagro Sensor has 4 bands and has been used
    by the famous eBee AG, the version of the fixed-wing UAV for agricultural applications
    in Switzerland Sensefly (MATESE & DI GENNARO, 2018 ). The American Micasense manufactures
    the RedEdge sensor, a multispectral camera that simultaneously captures 5 different
    narrow-width bands and a more recent dual camera that captures 10 spectral bands.
    In addition to the RGB bands of the visible spectrum, the camera also captures
    the NIR in the non-visible spectrum and the RedEdge, a spectral band that is positioned
    exactly on the threshold between the visible and the non-visible. In addition
    to increasing the sensitivity of certain indices, it is with this spectral band
    that certain diseases and crop pests can be identified (DEVIA et al., 2019 ).
    DEVIA et al. (2019 ) studied biomass production in rice crops using multispectral
    imaging. The authors presented a method for biomass estimation using near-infrared
    (NIR) images captured at different crop scales. The approach estimated the biomass
    of large areas of the crop with an average correlation of 0.76 in relation to
    the traditional manual destructive method. KITIĆ et al. (2019 ) proposed a low-cost
    portable active multispectral optical device for accurate detection of plant stress
    and to perform field mapping called Plant-O-Meter. The device has an integrated
    multispectral source that comprises light in four more indicative wavelengths
    (850, 630, 535 and 465 nm) and allows the simultaneous illumination of the entire
    plant. Sequential illumination and detection provide fast reflectance measurements,
    which are transmitted by wireless to Android-powered devices for data processing
    and storage. The device was tested under laboratory conditions by comparing Plant-O-Meter
    measurements with imaging results from a SPECIM hyperspectral camera and a GreenSeeker
    handheld device under field conditions. The comparison revealed comparable performance,
    showing a strong correlation in both the hyperspectral (R2 = 0.997) and portable
    GreenSeeker (R2 = 0.954) from the laboratory measurements and R2 = 0.886 for the
    field experiments), indicating that the device exhibited strong potential for
    accurate stress measurements. The scientific articles reviewed in this research,
    referring to the use of different spectral technologies in agriculture, indicate
    the types of multispectral and thermal cameras used by the scientific community
    for the rapid detection of water stress in culture. Artificial intelligence in
    precision agriculture Due to climatic uncertainties, the growing demand for food
    and the rapid expansion of the population, the agricultural sector is increasingly
    dependent on the use of new technologies to obtain higher yields in a sustainable
    way with each harvest. In this context, artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly
    developing applications in agriculture aiming productivity gains in a precise
    and effective way, avoiding the waste of resources (SHAIKH et al., 2022 ). In
    recent decades, researchers have strived to allow computers to extract enough
    information from raw data to model the real world. To achieve this, many have
    turned to machine learning algorithms to capture a large amount of information
    and automatically discover the representations needed to detect or classify input
    patterns and solve the various problems and needs of the agricultural sector (KHALIL
    & ABDULLAEV, 2021 ). Machine learning algorithms are computation models with particular
    properties such as learning, generalizing, grouping or organizing data. They consist
    of distributed structures formed by a large number of very simplified processing
    units connected to each other. Intelligent behavior occurs through the interactions
    of the neural network processing units (CANZIANI et al., 2016 ). The first neural
    networks to achieve widespread repercussions were based on unsupervised pre-training.
    However, it was the rediscovery of convolutional neural networks (CNN) (LECUN
    et al., 1998 ) that made this topic one of the main topics in machine learning,
    parallel processing technologies in GPUs (Graphal Processor Unit) and large databases
    that allowed these networks to be used fully. With the good performance being
    demonstrated by such models, other areas of knowledge besides the area of computing
    have been using these models for different purposes, as in the area of agricultural
    sciences since the 1990s with the pioneering work of MCQUEEN et al. (1995 ), in
    which the authors investigated the use of machine learning techniques existing
    at the time for some problems in agriculture and horticulture and presented a
    case study to infer management rules for some invasive plants. Recent research
    has used PCN-type networks (pulse-coupled networks) for the separation of wheat
    grains and to evaluate the physical characteristics of the soil and the growth
    of the cultures, concluding after field experiments that the developed model assisted
    in choosing the crop that best suited the evaluated soil (SHAIKH et al., 2022
    ). Works that involve not only agronomic data but also other technologies, such
    as satellite images, have been developed, such as the classification of management
    areas using satellite images (KHALIL & ABDULLAEV, 2021 ). In the context of the
    use of neural networks for agriculture and with the advent of cheaper computing
    resources combined with the new sensors that are being developed, proposals that
    increasingly use cutting-edge technological resources are noted (SOBAYO et al.,
    2018 ). As a tool to aid strategic decision making, smart agriculture has emerged
    as a new scientific area that employs, among other technologies, machine learning
    algorithms to assess and monitor the conditions of growing areas, such as soil
    and weather conditions, leading to more accurate results (LIAKOS et al., 2018
    ). BACHOUR et al. (2015 ) used a methodology that combines wavelet mult-iresolution
    analysis with the MVRVM algorithm (multivariate relevance vector machine) to predict
    16 days of ETo. More recently, deep learning (DL) is a machine learning technique
    that has shown good results in solving agricultural problems. KAMILARIS & PRENAFETA-BOLDÚ
    (2018 ) presented a review of 40 relevant studies in the area and found that,
    in addition to improvements in the performance of classification/prediction problems,
    DL also reduced resource engineering in many of the works. For crop management,
    for example, yield predictions can be made from satellite images, as presented
    by KHALIL & ABDULLAEV (2021 ). In this research, the authors concluded that it
    is possible to predict wheat yield from image processing with supervised Kohonen
    networks. Another beneficial activity is pest and disease control, where the spraying
    of pesticides is now directed only to the affected plants, reducing financial
    and environmental costs (JIAO et al., 2022 ). In water and soil management, important
    practices have been developed not only to increase crop productivity but also
    to use these resources efficiently. PATIL & DEKA (2016 ) used the extreme learning
    algorithm to estimate the weekly evapotranspiration of a crop in India. In soil
    management, GU et al. (2021 ) presented a new method for estimating soil moisture
    based on ANN models. ANN shave also been the subject of scientific investigations
    in the field of irrigation engineering to estimate the localized pressure drop
    caused by connectors and special parts present in irrigation systems. According
    to ELNESR & ALAZBA (2017 ), the use of neural networks presents a powerful tool
    for estimating the load loss caused by initial connectors when compared to the
    use of empirical models. KADHEM et al. (2017 ) used a neural network to predict
    wind speed data with chronological and seasonal characteristics. The authors concluded
    that the neural network was able to portray variations in wind speed with good
    performance during the different seasons of the year. LIU et al. (2018 ) developed
    a wind speed prediction model based on WPD (wavelet packet decomposition), CNN
    (convolutional neural network) and CNNLSTM (convolutional long short-term memory
    network). To verify the prediction performance of the proposed model, it was compared
    with 8 neural models widely used by the scientific community. The authors concluded
    that the proposed model is robust and effective in predicting wind speed time
    series. Definition of management zones in precision irrigation One way to manage
    physical, chemical and/or biological variations within a growing area is through
    the delineation of management zones (ZM). Management zones are sub-areas within
    a cultivation area that have similar characteristics but differ to a certain degree
    from the others in such a way that a particular agronomic management is justified
    to be adopted in each of them (KITCHEN et al., 2005 ). For management zones to
    be determined, it is necessary to obtain data from the area of interest, which
    can be of various types, such as crop productivity, soil physical and chemical
    properties, topography, vegetation indices, and aerial images. From these individual
    or combined data, thematic maps are created, and this spatial information is then
    interpreted. In this context, BAZZI et al. (2018 ) used soil property data to
    define management zones, such as soil texture and apparent electrical conductivity.
    YAO et al. (2014 ) used soil physicochemical properties and crop yield data and
    determined management zones. Generally, irrigation is carried out uniformly in
    a cultivated area, regardless of the spatial characteristics of that area. In
    the field, the water content in the soil is not homogeneous due to its spatial
    variability, which ranges from crop development, difference in relief and variation
    of soil hydraulic properties and rainfall distribution. Thus, the proper use of
    irrigation in each management zone reduces the volume of water used in the irrigation
    system, as there is an increase in efficiency that provides growth in productivity,
    reducing nutrient leaching and water waste. Management zones are used to optimize
    irrigated areas, where a heterogeneous area is separated into homogeneous zones
    and irrigation management will be the same in these regions (LIANG et al., 2016
    ; PEREA et al., 2017 ). For XIANG et al. (2007 ), cluster analyses and empirical
    analyses are the categories in which most of the methods used to define management
    zones are inserted. Since the empirical methods are simpler, based on specialized
    knowledge and on the distribution of productivity in the production areas, in
    this way, it is possible to divide a heterogeneous area into homogeneous sub-areas.
    However, cluster analysis is a more complex, less subjective method that uses
    multiple variables during the establishment of management zones. In cluster analysis
    methods, data points in a cropping area are divided into different classes, where
    the similarities between the points are evaluated to define the classes, and with
    that, the management zones are defined (GAVIOLI et al., 2019 ; LI et al., 2007).
    To define management zones, several factors and data are often used; in this case,
    a multivariate analysis was used to define the zones. OLDONI et al. (2019 ) also
    used geostatistical and multivariate analyses to determine management zones in
    a peach orchard, with a clustering approach on both soil (soil texture, water
    content, organic matter content) and plant (amount of fruit per tree, average
    fruit weight, total soluble solute content) for differentiated management. Another
    form of multivariate geospatial analysis is kriging factor analysis, a data interpolation
    method that identifies variability and was used in the study by BEVINGTON et al.
    (2019 ), where soil properties and hydraulic parameters were measured to define
    management zones using kriging factor analysis and the fuzzy-c means algorithm.
    CHEN et al. (2019b ) used an RGB camera attached to a UAV to determine the plant
    cover and vigor of the peanut and cotton canopy through the green-red vegetation
    index to determine management zones in Italy, used as indicators of irrigation
    uniformity, which they also served as an indication for the application of variable
    rate irrigation (VRI) in a pivot system. In the research by SCHENATTO et al. (2017
    ), management zones were also created using the fuzzy-c means algorithm, focusing
    on soil characteristics, such as elevation, slope, density, organic matter, clay
    and sand contents, and plant attributes, such as yield. In the study by ANASTASIOU
    et al. (2019 ), multivariate geostatistical techniques were also used to unite
    the multitemporal data from a multiband radiometer and a geophysical sensor and
    thus delimit the management zones of a vineyard, considering the electrical conductivity
    of the soil and canopy area. OHANA-LEVI et al. (2019 ) used a weighted multivariate
    spatial clustering model to determine irrigation management zones in a vineyard.
    Management zones were determined using a multivariate k-means cluster, and machine
    learning and spatial statistics were also used to analyze the variables, which
    comprised soil properties, terrain characteristics and environmental impact. Another
    tool used to collect data and define management zones is the proximal sensing
    of the soil, based on electromagnetic induction techniques, radiometry and fluorimetry
    (CASTANEDO, 2013 ). In the research by CASTRIGNANÒ et al. (2017 ), proximal and
    remote sensors were used in a tomato growing area, and there was integration with
    multivariate geostatistical data to define management zones based on the electrical
    conductivity of the soil, which was measured at different frequencies, sensor
    polarizations and depths. Likewise, MOUAZEN et al. (2014 ) used a soil sensor
    to measure electrical conductivity, soil water holding capacity, available water,
    organic matter, density, clay content and organic carbon, establishing a multi-sensor
    and data fusion approach to delineating management zones for site-specific irrigation,
    best addressed in section 1 of this review. To define management zones, low-cost
    remote sensing data are viable options (section 2 of this review), where spatiotemporal
    information on the biological and physical parameters of vegetation are used (FONTANET
    et al., 2018 ). FONTANET et al. (2020) used remote sensing to define management
    zones in a corn planting area, analyzing normalized difference vegetation index
    (NDVI) time series by remote sensing, soil moisture sensors, and root zone simulation
    predictions. GOBBO et al. (2019 ) also used NDVI in defining management zones
    in corn plantations and combined it with soil texture data to create irrigation
    management zones. In the research by GEORGI et al. (2017 ), remote sensing was
    used together with an automatic delineation algorithm. An automatic segmentation
    algorithm was developed using multispectral satellite data, which is a cheaper
    method for defining management zones. We emphasized that the creation of management
    zones for irrigation is not strictly associated with the application of water
    at a varied rate but rather in specific fields or areas and not exclusively on
    a lateral line of an irrigation system. The creation of these zones can help in
    the sizing of localized irrigation systems, enabling the differentiation of water
    needs by sector, such as ZM, which differs from SS-VRI (site-specific variable
    rate sprinkler). Another point to consider is the limitations of the use of remote
    sensing to create ZM. FONTANET et al. (2020 ) suggested the integration of spatial
    and temporal information, since there are soil and/or plant attributes with spatial
    differences that also change over time; that is, they are not static. For example,
    the NDVI must be combined with a measurement of available soil water to dynamically
    delineate both space and time ZM for irrigation. Irrigation systems with variable
    water application rates Irrigated agriculture is one of the agricultural activities
    with the highest consumption of fresh water in the world. In this sense, precision
    irrigation is an important tool for the development of profitable and sustainable
    agriculture (DU et al., 2015 ; MATEOS & ARAUS, 2016 ). Thus, as discussed in the
    previous section, the creation of irrigation management zones is essential to
    increase the efficiency of the application and use of water in the field. Within
    this tool, Site-specific Variable Rate Irrigation (SS-VRI) is a management method
    that consists of applying water according to spatial variability due to characteristics,
    such as soil and culture; and therefore, through rational application, it is possible
    to increase water conservation and productivity, in addition to reducing the leaching
    rate of nutrients and agrochemicals and optimizing inputs (DU et al., 2015 ; MATEOS
    & ARAUS, 2016 ). SS-VRI differs from conventional sprinkler systems and requires
    variable rate sprinklers, which are based mainly on pulse modulation, angle of
    departure and arrival points, and sprinkler head (SADLER et al., 2005 ).The main
    research covers linear and center pivot sprinkler systems due to the level of
    automation and coverage of the cultivation area through a single side tube (ADEYEMI
    et al., 2017 ). However, this type of management has already been studied for
    other types of irrigation methods, such as drip, considering the challenges of
    directionality and the invariable rate of lateral lines (LINKER, 2020 ). Therefore,
    the main commercial equipment developed thus far is linked to central pivot and
    linear mechanized sprinkler irrigation. The greatest success of implementing VRI
    in center pivot systems, and the focus of this review, is that it allows: first,
    the control of the travel speed of the center pivot, allowing the variation of
    water application/infiltration depth by sector, and second, controlling the variation
    of water application by zone; that is, it allows the differentiation of irrigation
    rates along the lateral pipeline (ANDRADE et al., 2020 ; O’SHAUGHNESSY et al.,
    2019 ; SUI & YAN, 2017 ). SOBENKO et al. (2018 ) developed a sprinkler with flow
    adjustment through the cross section based on an iris mechanism controlled by
    a stepper motor using a deterministic model for flow prediction, but the idealized
    nozzle discharge coefficient (0.60) was below the average values (0.90-0.92) observed
    in conventional fixed nozzles. The management of SS-VRI can be carried out efficiently
    in several ways, such as monitoring the soil moisture content, a subject discussed
    in greater depth in sections 1 and 4. For this, the positioning and number of
    sensors should be chosen with care so that the generated data are representative
    of the area under cultivation. Through analyses of variance and temporal stability
    of soil water content monitored by a neutron probe, BARKER et al. (2017 ) concluded
    that for management zones divided to minimize variations within the zones, the
    number of sensors may be more important than their position in the area. In addition,
    due to the high cost of a number of sensors, a partnership between modeling and
    monitoring soil water is proposed. In a similar study focusing on the placement
    of soil sensors, ZHAO et al. (2017 ) stated that the clay percentile of management
    zones should be considered for the placement of sensors. The use of spectral images
    obtained via satellite or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) has been used in the
    management of variable-rate irrigation systems. The principle of this use is based
    on understanding the spectral response of the leaf, which is applied at the canopy
    level and is used to establish management zones (HANK et al., 2018 ). MENDES et
    al. (2019 ), using images obtained from satellites, carried out the mapping of
    areas considering the variability for the application of variable-rate irrigation
    depths via the central pivot system. With the same objective, SHI et al. (2019
    ), with the help of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), obtained multispectral images
    of the vegetation and used vegetation indices to determine the spatial variability
    and constitution of homogeneous areas. Similar work was developed by BHATTI et
    al. (2020 ), in which the comparison of multispectral images obtained by UAV and
    satellites was performed to evaluate the response of crops to variable irrigation
    based on canopy temperature and surface energy balance modeling. More examples
    of the use of images in precision irrigation are mentioned in sections 2 and 3.
    Despite all the benefits, the uptake of SS-VRI systems has grown slowly. The main
    justifications for this are that this type of management requires qualified technical
    assistance, and the acquisition of the necessary equipment still has a high cost,
    requiring a careful analysis of the economic viability of production (ABIOYE et
    al., 2020 ). To assist in these matters, simulation models are viable options
    for assessing the response of crops to different irrigation management methods.
    MCCARTHY et al. (2014 ) used a model called VARIwise based on the predictive control
    model methodology to evaluate the performance of cotton cultures grown on a center
    pivot with variable application rate irrigation compared to conventional systems.
    In most results, simulations of precision irrigation performance had superior
    results. In a similar research, THORP (2019) carried out a long-term evaluation
    through simulations using the same crop under soil variability parameters to analyze
    the advantages of the system. However, modeling applied to precision irrigation
    can be complex because it deals with the dynamics of water in soil. The following
    topic discusses in-depth examples of models and applications of modeling in irrigated
    agriculture. Modeling agricultural crops and their interaction with the prescription
    of variable water depths in precision irrigation Extreme drought events have increased
    in intensity in recent decades and predictions from agrometeorological modeling
    indicate that climate extremes of drought will become more frequent and prolonged
    due to a set of factors, among which global warming stands out (IPCC, 2018). Agriculture
    is one of the human activities most dependent on climatic conditions, especially
    traditional rainfed crops, so the development of studies to evaluate the effects
    of these on agricultural production is important. However, carrying out field
    experiments becomes limiting due to a series of factors, such as manpower, available
    time and financial resources. An alternative or complementary solution is the
    use of agricultural modeling to forecast the development of agricultural crops
    in new climate scenarios. Crop simulation models are based on biophysical processes
    to make estimates such as growth, development and production, based on physiological
    characteristics of the crop in question and environmental variables (MONTEITH,
    1996 ). Understanding these models becomes the conceptual basis for modeling agricultural
    crops. Mechanistic models, based on the physics and physiological processes of
    plants, become allies in the development of teaching, research and crop management.
    Among them, the DSSAT (Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer) presents
    a set of models developed for several important crops, such as corn and soybean
    (JONES et al., 2003 ). In a review of the opportunities and approaches for modeling
    spatial variations of water at the field level, TENREIRO et al. (2020 ) pointed
    out that, among the irrigation methods, there are three ways to simulate irrigation
    applications in crop models: a) determination of a calendar by the user; b) an
    irrigation program based on the water capacity of the soil, applying constant
    or variable rates; and c) through a schedule based on multiple criteria, such
    as the phenological stage of the crop, water content in the soil, restrictions
    on the availability of water and type of cultural management. These methodologies
    have the potential to calculate the varied rate of irrigation to be provided to
    plants, “when,” “where” and “how much” they need, resulting in the optimization
    of the use of this water resource (HAGHVERDI et al., 2016 ), thus validating the
    three ways to simulate field-level irrigation applications in the models. In the
    literature, the prescription of variable irrigation depths follows two methodologies:
    a) make individual use of crop simulation models or hydrological models, which
    focus on the movement of water in the soil and b) make combined use of these two
    models. The DSSAT model, because it is a simulation of cultivation, is advantageous
    in the study of irrigation management scenarios, as presented by MALIK & DECHMI
    (2019 ) in a study carried out in Spain with different cultures. They evaluated
    two scenarios, one based on irrigation applied by producers and another on irrigation
    adjusted to the water demand of the crop, with crop and soil data collected for
    model calibration and validation. The authors reported up to a 27% reduction in
    the application of irrigation depths. Similar researches are presented by CAMARGO
    & KEMANIAN (2016 ), PEREZ-ORTOLA et al. (2015) and XIANGXIANG et al. (2013 ).
    Another well-established model is APSIM, which also focuses on modeling agricultural
    crops and assesses the impacts of different crop management practices, including
    irrigation (AMARASINGHA et al., 2015 ; DUTTA et al., 2020 ). PEREA et al. (2017
    ), for example, carried out an integrative modeling coupling a deterministic model
    of water application with the Aquacrop model, simulating the impacts of heterogeneous
    irrigation caused by wind drift and pressure variation in the irrigation system.
    They concluded that variable-rate irrigation was the best method in all scenarios
    of pressure variation in the system to save water and increase onion yield. ROY
    et al. (2019 ) also proposed the integration of crop and hydrological models using
    HYDRUS-2D software and DSSAT to identify the most appropriate irrigation management
    to maximize water use efficiency through precision irrigation using retention
    technology of subsurface water, together with a computational procedure of evolutionary
    multi-objective optimization to link the two models. The authors concluded that
    the optimization procedure reduced water use and increased corn yield prediction
    by 6-fold compared to non-optimized and randomized irrigation management without
    subsurface water retention membrane. For the combination of models, another proposal
    developed by GARCÍA-VILA & FERERES (2012 ), in which they combined the AquaCrop
    model with an economic optimization model, identified irrigation strategies and
    predicted their impact on income. in which the simulated results indicated that
    the best strategy under water restrictions combined the planting of crops with
    low water use in part of the area as a way of making more water available for
    the most profitable crops and with the greatest water need. In this review, several
    premises involving precision irrigation were addressed, from the use of soil sensors,
    remote sensing, artificial intelligence, management zones for irrigation, and
    variable-rate irrigation to agricultural modeling in view of optimizing the use
    of water resources. However, there are other techniques and technologies used
    in RI that help in the efficient use of both water and energy resources, such
    as the use of wastewater (IBEKWE et al., 2018 ; SHANNAG et al., 2021 ; VERGINE
    et al., 2016 ), solar panels to reduce energy costs with water pumping and automation
    in irrigation systems (GRANT et al., 2022 ; SINGH et al., 2021 ) and the use of
    microorganisms (fungi and bacteria) to mitigate damage caused by water deficit
    (ASHWIN et al., 2022 ). CONCLUSION: This review of trends and prospects for precision
    irrigation for irrigation monitoring and management is based on relevant past
    and current research work that has contributed to achieving greater water savings
    in agriculture. It is hoped that this review article has given a broad overview
    of research trends and generated new ideas for readers on implementation and execution
    approaches to choosing the best smart irrigation strategy, paying attention to
    the fact that the combination of monitoring methods via soil, plant and climate
    is the most assertive strategy to increase the energy efficiency of water use
    in irrigated fields. However, it results in a large volume of data to be analyzed,
    making it necessary to use algorithms based on artificial intelligence, which
    promotes a fast and efficient monitoring system of the collected data, aiming
    the assertive recommendation of irrigation at a variable rate in the area irrigated
    to save water and energy so as not to overload the irrigating farmer with the
    daily decision in determining the irrigation dose. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS The authors

  description: The use of biodegradable film has been increasingly recommended as
    an alternative to conventional plastic films. Several studies have evaluated the
    applicability of biodegradable film mulching (BRM). However, the large-scale effects
    of BRM on the spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration (ET) and crop
    yields remain unclear. Furthermore, existing DSSAT (decision support system for
    agrotechnology transfer) models cannot accurately represent crop yields, as they
    fail to account for the impact of the disintegration rates of biodegradable films
    (DR) on air temperature (Ta) compensation, which represents the effect of soil
    temperature changes in mulched conditions on crop growth in the form of air temperature
    changes. Therefore, this study proposed an improved DSSAT model under BRM (BDSSAT)
    by considering the impact of DR on Ta compensation, and the performance of the
    model was compared with those of the DSSAT and modified DSSAT (MDSSAT). These
    models were validated using observed data from nine typical experimental sites
    in Inner Mongolia from 2015 to 2018. Moreover, 96 meteorological stations and
    soil textures were selected to evaluate the effect of BRM on soil water storage
    (SWS) (the amount of water stored in a given soil body, mm), ET, and crop yields
    of the primary cultivated crops (sunflower, potato, corn). Our findings demonstrated
    that the BDSSAT model could accurately simulate the SWS, ET, and crop yield under
    BRM. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of ET simulated by the BDSSAT
    model was 49.4 % and 66.3 % lower than that of the MDSSAT and DSSAT models, respectively.
    An apparent spatial difference in SWS, ET, and crop yield was found in different
    regions due to the differences in soil texture, meteorological data, and agricultural
    management strategy. The spatial distributions of ET and crop yield of sunflower,
    potato, and corn in different regions were largely consistent with the spatial
    distribution of SWS. Furthermore, the ET and crop yield of sunflower and potato
    crops in different regions increased with time (2015–2018) due to an increase
    in rainfall. However, these effects were not observed in corn yields in the eastern
    region. Additionally, the DR in the western, middle, and eastern regions should
    not exceed 55 %, 73 %, and 90 %, respectively, to ensure high field production
    (crop yield was higher than the historic average). Crop yields in different regions
    increased in response to future climate change, as the average Ta was projected
    to increase by 0.8 °C from 2019 to 2050, except for sunflower yields in the western
    region.

    Abstract The use of biodegradable film has been increasingly recommended as an
    alternative to conventional plastic films. Several studies have evaluated the

    BRM. The normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) of ET simulated by the BDSSAT
    model was 49.4 % and 66.3 % lower than that of the MDSSAT and DSSAT models, respectively.
    An apparent spatial difference in SWS, ET, and crop yield was found in different
    regions due to the differences in soil texture, meteorological data, and agricultural
    management strategy. The spatial distributions of ET and crop yield of sunflower,
    potato, and corn in different regions were largely consistent with the spatial
    distribution of SWS. Furthermore, the ET and crop yield of sunflower and potato
    crops in different regions increased with time (2015–2018) due to an increase
    in rainfall. However, these effects were not observed in corn yields in the eastern
    region. Additionally, the DR in the western, middle, and eastern regions should
    not exceed 55 %, 73 %, and 90 %, respectively, to ensure high field production
    (crop yield was higher than the historic average). Crop yields in different regions
    increased in response to future climate change, as the average Ta was projected
    to increase by 0.8 °C from 2019 to 2050, except for sunflower yields in the western
    region. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Biodegradable

    change 1. Introduction Inner Mongolia, is an autonomous region located in the
    north of China, which is an important global production hub for grain and oil
    plants. This region has a cultivated land area of 11.5 million hectares, accounting
    for 9.0 % of the total cultivated land area in China (China Statistical Yearbook,
    2021). The latest statistical data reported that the total yield of grain and
    oil plants reached 36.6 and 2.2 million tons in Inner Mongolia, respectively (Inner
    Mongolia Statistical Yearbook, 2021). However, the uneven spatiotemporal distribution
    and severe deficit of water resources have threatened the long-term agricultural
    development of this region. Plastic film mulching (PM) can effectively decrease
    soil evaporation (Es) (Zribi et al., 2015) and increases soil moisture and crop
    yield (Thidar et al., 2020; Mendonça et al., 2021). Therefore, this technology
    has been widely applied worldwide (Bandopadhyay et al., 2020, Chen et al., 2022a,
    Zribi et al., 2015). By 2020, the usage and mulched area of plastic film in Inner
    Mongolia reached 83 thousand tons and 143 thousand hectares, respectively (China
    Rural Statistical Yearbook, 2021), with the primary cultivated crops under PM
    being corn, potato, and sunflower (Bai et al., 2015). However, plastic film is
    mainly made of polyethylene, which hardly disintegrates in natural conditions
    due to its stable molecular structure (Espí et al., 2006). Long-term use of plastic
    film has resulted in widespread plastic residue accumulation in soil, which seriously
    affects agriculture ecosystem environments and crop growth (Liu et al., 2014).
    Biodegradable films have been increasingly recommended in agricultural production
    as a promising alternative to conventional plastic films (Brodhagen et al., 2017;
    Goldberger et al., 2013; Sintim et al., 2019). Biodegradable films can degrade
    into CO2 and H2O through oxidation and microbial activity (Bandopadhyay et al.,
    2020, Mari et al., 2020), thus effectively reducing the levels of residual plastic
    film in the soil. Previous literature involving the effects of biodegradable film
    mulching (BRM) on agriculture ecosystem environments has mainly focused on soil
    moisture, soil solute, and crop yields at the field scale (Chen et al., 2019,
    Sintim et al., 2019, Giordano et al., 2020). For example, Saglam et al. (2017)
    reported that soil moisture for BRM was close to that of PM, and can significantly
    increase the crop water productivity (WP) of corn compared to no film mulching.
    Zhang (2017) compared the effects of BRMs and PM on sunflower yield, and demonstrated
    that sunflower yields under BRM decreased by 6.1 % compared with that of PM due
    to the low water preservation capacity of biodegradable film during the middle
    crop growth stage. Similarly, Chen et al. (2021a) found that ET and Es/ET under
    BRM increased by 15.6 % and 59.2 % compared with PM, respectively, whereas corn
    yield under BRM decreased by 9.9 % compared with PM. This occurred because mulching
    area of biodegradable film was significantly lower than that of plastic film during
    the middle and late crop growth stages due its higher disintegration rate, which
    promoted water vapor transport from the soil surface to the atmosphere and led
    to decreases in soil moisture and crop yield under BRM. In contrast, Gao et al.
    (2021) reported that ET and potato yield under BRM and PM were not significantly
    different because the degradation of biodegradable films at late crop growth stages
    has a limited effect on ET when there is a high degree of crop coverage, and potato
    yields under BRM were only 2.3 % lower than under PM from 2018 to 2019. Although
    previous studies have reported on the responses of water consumption and crop
    yield to the soil water deficit caused by an increase in the disintegration area
    of biodegradable film, these observations have only been made at the field scale
    (Chen et al., 2021b; Gu et al., 2020; Morra et al., 2016). The unique climate
    conditions, hydrology, and soil texture in different regions will inevitably result
    in variations in the distribution of field water consumption and crop yields under
    BRM. However, no previous studies have explored these variations, and the responses
    of crop yield and WP to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable film
    and climate change remain uncharacterized. Pure field experiments would be highly
    time-consuming and costly. Moreover, the results of this approach cannot be easily
    applied to improve regional productivity. The use of mathematical methods combined
    with field experiments enables researchers to easily estimate crop yields on a
    regional scale. Currently, the mainstream models of crop growth include the Agricultural
    Production Systems sIMulator (APSIM) (Keating et al., 2003), DSSAT (Hoogenboom
    et al., 2019), and AquaCrop (Raes et al., 2009). Among these models, DSSAT has
    been widely used to simulate crop yields on a regional scale due to its friendly
    user interface and high simulation accuracy (Tooley et al., 2021). However, the
    model is mainly used to study fields without mulching because it does not consider
    the effects of mulching on water consumption and crop yields (Garibay et al.,
    2019, Woli et al., 2019, Roy et al., 2019). In recent years, the simulation of
    crop yields under PM using DSSAT can be achieved via the accumulated temperature
    compensation method. However, the simulation of crop yield under BRM remains lacking,
    particularly for the effects of BRM on ET and crop yield in large areas (Li et
    al., 2019). Although Shen et al. (2021) considered the effects of the disintegrated
    area of plastic film on water vapor in the soil-air interface using a modified
    DSSAT (MDSSAT), the impacts of the disintegrated area on soil temperature, Ta,
    and crop yield were not be considered. Particularly, the MDSSAT model did not
    consider the effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of
    biodegradable film on crop growth. The estimation of ET and crop yield primarily
    depend on Ta, rainfall, and solar radiation (SR) in DSSAT. Thus, it is of great
    significance to propose an improved DSSAT model by considering the effects of
    the disintegration area of biodegradable film on Ta and crop yield. Moreover,
    the responses of crop yield and WP to the potential disintegration rate of biodegradable
    film and climate change need to be further explored using the improved DSSAT model.
    Therefore, the main objectives of this study were 1) to propose an improved DSSAT
    model (BDSSAT) by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable
    film on Ta; 2) to validate and compare the simulated accuracy among the BDSSAT,
    MDSSAT, and DSSAT models using the observation data from multiple years and sites;
    3) to reveal the spatiotemporal distribution of SWS, ET, and crop yield of primary
    cultivated crops (sunflower, potato, corn) under BRM in different regions of Inner
    Mongolia; 4) to identify the optimal disintegration rate of biodegradable film
    for different regions; and 5) to quantify the effects of future climate change
    on crop yield WP under BRM. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental sites and
    data sources A total of 96 meteorological stations and soil textures were selected
    to evaluate the effect of BRM on SWS, ET, and crop yield in the eastern, middle,
    and western regions of Inner Mongolia. The western, middle, and eastern regions
    fall within the warm temperature, moderate temperature, and cold temperature climate
    zones, respectively. The average annual precipitation in the western, middle,
    and eastern regions during the study period was 212.2, 204.7, and 302.6 mm, respectively.
    The main soil type of the western region is classified as sandy loam soil, whereas
    the middle and eastern regions primarily exhibit loam soil. In the field experiment,
    the soil type of Dengkou, Linhe, and Urad Front was sandy loam soil based on the
    soil triangle of USDA, whereas the soil type of Huade and Tongliao was loam soil.
    Moreover, Linhe, Urad Front, and Huade exhibited Plaggept soil based on the USDA
    classification system, and the soil types of Dengkou and Tongliao were Orthid
    and Argiborolls, respectively. Table 1 provides additional details on the soil
    textures (bulk density and the proportion of sand, clay, and silt, soil organic
    carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium) at soil depths
    of 0–10, 10–30, and 30–100 cm in the western, middle, and eastern regions. Table

    In general, the meteorological variation from west to east in Inner Mongolia shows
    an increase in rainfall, improvement in soil fertility, a decrease in Ta, and
    a reduction in SR. Additionally, nine representative experimental sites were chosen
    to conduct a field experiment. The typical sites in the western region are Dengkou,
    Linhe, and Urad Front; the middle region includes Siziwang, Chahar Right Front,
    and Huade; the eastern region includes Kharchin, Jalaid, and Tongliao (Fig. 1).
    The experimental data involving Dengkou, Linhe, Urad Front, Huade, and Tongliao
    were determined through a field experiment from 2015 to 2018. Moreover, four years
    of the experimental data from Siziwang, Chahar Right Front, Kharchin, and Jalaid
    were obtained from a public literature database (Zhang and Liu, 2020). Download

    The distribution of meteorological sites and experimental sites in the western,
    middle, and eastern regions in Inner Mongolia, China. 2.2. Experimental designs
    and management The main crops in the western, the middle, and eastern regions
    of Inner Mongolia are sunflower, potato, and corn, respectively (Feng, 2021, Li,
    2017, Yang et al., 2021). Local recommendation seeding dates for nine representative
    experimental sites were adopted in this study. Sunflower seeds were sown on May
    21–26 during 2015–2018; potato seeds were sown on May 10–19 during 2015–2018;
    corn seeds were sown on May 1–8 during 2015–2018, respectively. Sunflower and
    potato were harvested at the end of September, whereas corn was harvested in mid-October.
    A complete biodegradable film (80 cm width × 0.008 mm thick) made of polybutyl
    hexanoate (corn starch, polycaprolactone, and masterbatch at a 30:65:5 ratio)
    was laid flat on the surface soil using an automatic machine, which can completely
    disintegrate into CO2 and H2O through microbial activity. The percentages of breaking
    elongation, maximum loads, and tensile strengths of the biodegradable film were
    149.0 %, 0.58 N, and 14.5 MPa, respectively. The irrigation depths of sunflower,
    potato, and corn were 22.5, 40, and 30 mm, respectively. From 2015–2018, the sunflower,
    potato, and corn crops were irrigated a total of 5–7, 9–12, and 7–11 times, respectively.
    The fertilizer application strategy adopted in this experiment was based on the
    recommendations from local farmers. Before sowing, 375 kg ha−1 of diammonium phosphate,
    600 kg ha−1 of formulated fertilizer, and 450 kg ha−1 of controlled-release fertilizers
    were applied in the field of sunflower, potato, and corn as basal fertilizers,
    respectively. The field management strategy (planting density, planting depth,
    row spacing, irrigation depth, fertilization application amount, and fertilization
    depth) of nine representative experimental sites was identical to the local strategy
    (Table 2). The seeding date and field management strategy in other sites was similar
    to that of the representative experimental sites in the same region. Therefore,
    to reduce the workload, this study assumed that the seeding date and field management
    strategy in other sites (i.e., non-experimental site) were completely consistent
    with those of representative experimental sites in the same region. Moreover,
    the heterogeneity of soil texture and meteorology at the same county level may
    affect the simulation results at the regional scale. Therefore, the soil texture
    and meteorology of sites located in the same county were also assumed to be homogeneous.

    of ninety-six stations in Inner Mongolia from 1956 to 2018 were downloaded from
    the China Meteorological Administration (http//www.cma.gov.cn/), including daily
    rainfall, maximum air temperature (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), and
    sunshine hours (Fig. 2). Moreover, sunshine hours were used to determine daily
    SR using the Ångström method (Ångström, 1924): (1) where Q0 is the radiation-income
    (MJ m−2 d−1), S is the sunshine hours, and a and b are the experimental parameters,
    which are 0.22 and 0.54 for Inner Mongolia (Liu et al., 2021), respectively. (2)
    where G0 is solar constant (W m−2 d−1), dr is the Earth orbital eccentricity,
    ωs is the sunset hour angles (°), φ is the geographic radian, and δ is the solar
    declination (°). (3) (4) (5) (6) where J is the day of year. Download : Download

    and forecast period (2019–2050) in the western (a), middle (b), and eastern regions
    (c), respectively. Note that the subscript B represents the observed data; the
    subscript F represents the forecasted data. Soil textural properties of the 0–30,
    30–60, and 60–100 cm soil layers for ninety-six stations, including bulk density,
    soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium, were
    obtained from the China Soil Scientific Database (http//www.soil.csdb.cn/). Soil
    water content (SWC) in the 0–30, 30–60, and 60–100 cm soil layers were monitored
    using two TIME-probes (IMKO GmbH Inc.; IPH, TRIME-PICO, Germany) installed in
    the middle of the crop rows and the bare area once every 5–7 days. The probes
    were calibrated by gravimetric measurements in same sampling interval. Soil water
    storage (SWS) was determined by multiplying SWC and root zone depth (i.e., 100 cm).
    Actual evapotranspiration (ETc) (mm) was calculated using the field water balance
    method: (7) where P is precipitation (mm), I is irrigation depth (mm), D is deep
    drainage or rising capillary (mm) and it was determined using Darcy''s law, R
    is surface runoff (mm), and ΔW is the SWS variation within the root zone (mm).
    R was not accounted for in this study due to the negligible flow rate, flat experimental
    site, and weak rainfall. Eq. (1) was simplified as follows: (8) When sunflower,
    potato, and corn reached physiological maturity, ten plants from a harvesting
    area of 20 m2 were collected to determine the crop yield of sunflower, potato,
    and corn. WP (kg m−3) was calculated using the following equation (Fernández et
    al., 2020): (9) The disintegrated area of the biodegradable film in sunflower
    (Dengkou, Linhe, and Urad Front), potato (Huade), and corn (Tongliao) fields were
    photographed using a digital camera (Canon EOS Rebel T3, Japan) from a distance
    of approximately 25 cm above the surface of the biodegradable film, once every
    20 days from 2015 to 2018 (Chen et al., 2022b). Images were geometrically corrected
    and background subtraction was conducted using Adobe Photoshop software. The disintegrated
    area was calculated using the ImageJ software. The disintegration rate of the
    biodegradable film (DR) was calculated using the following equation (Fig. S1):
    (10) where Ad is the disintegrated area of the biodegradable film (cm2) and At
    is the total area of film mulching (cm2). 3. Modeling description 3.1. DSSAT model
    The DSSAT model consisted of weather, soil, crop, and field management modules,
    among which the crop module included over 18 different CSM crop models (Hoogenboom
    et al., 2019). The dynamics of soil water and nitrogen were simulated by the principle
    of soil water and nitrogen balance in the DSSAT model. Additionally, crop growth
    and development were estimated by the CERES, CROPGRO, CROPSIM, and SUBSTOR modules.
    In this study, three process-based crop models in the DSSAT families (CERES-Maize,
    SUBSTOR-Potato, and OILCROP-sunflower) were used to evaluate the response of the
    development of sunflower, potato, and corn on soil water dynamics under biodegradable
    film mulching. Crop yields were determined by multiplying the harvest index and
    dry matter. (11) where HI is the harvest index and DM is the dry matter (kg ha−1).
    3.2. Modified DSSAT model (MDSSAT) In the MDSSAT model, the soil evaporation module
    was improved by introducing the evaporation ratio under PM. Es was divided into
    two stages: stage I (the constant rate stage) and stage II (the falling rate stage)
    (Shen et al., 2021). In stage I, Es was not affected by the variation in SWC,
    and Es in this stage was computed using the following equation: (12) where Esi
    is the cumulative soil evaporation (mm d−1) and Es0 is the actual soil evaporation
    on day i. In stage II, Es depends on the water vapor flux through the shallow
    soil layer, which was computed using the following equation: (13) where α is the
    soil hydraulic characteristic parameter (mm d−0.5) and t is the evaporation time
    (d). Given that soil water vapor would be transported into the atmosphere through
    the small holes caused by maize stalks, Es was related to the mulching fraction
    of plastic film. Thus, Es was determined using the following equations (Shen et
    al., 2021): (14) (15) (16) where Ffm is the mulching fraction, Ah is the area
    of small holes at the root zone (cm2), and r is the radius of the small holes
    (cm). The effects of soil temperature under PM on crop growth were determined
    using the temperature compensation coefficient method (Zhang et al., 2003). 3.3.
    The proposed DSSAT model considering BRM (BDSSAT) Although the effect of the disintegrated
    area on water vapor in the soil-air interface has been previously determined using
    the MDSSAT model (Shen et al., 2021), the impacts of the disintegrated area on
    soil temperature, Ta, and crop growth were not be considered, especially for the
    effect of soil temperature fluctuation after the disintegration of biodegradable
    film on crop growth. Thus, an improved air temperature compensation method was
    deduced by considering the effect of the disintegration area of biodegradable
    film on temperature in the DSSAT model (BDSSAT). The compensation coefficient
    (C) was determined using the following equation: (17) where Tcum-a-s is the effective
    air accumulated temperature under no-film mulching (°C), Tcum-a-f is the effective
    air accumulated temperature under biodegradable film mulching (°C), Tcum-s-s is
    the soil accumulated temperature under no-film mulching (°C), and Tcum-s-f is
    the effective soil accumulated temperature under biodegradable film mulching (°C).
    The effective accumulated temperature was calculated by the following equation:
    (18) where Tai is the average air temperature on day i and Tb is the biological
    lower limit base point temperature of maize (8 °C). Ta under biodegradable film
    mulching was compensated based on air temperature under no-film mulching by the
    following equation (Zhang et al., 2003): (19) where△Ta is the air temperature
    difference between biodegradable film mulching and no-film mulching (°C), △Ts
    is the soil temperature difference between biodegradable film mulching and no-film
    mulching (°C), and Ts is the daily soil temperature under no-film mulching (°C).
    △Ts was obtained using the following equation (Chen et al., 2021b): (20) where
    dh is the heat flux increase after mulching (J), c is the soil heat capacity (J
    kg−1 °C−1), and m is the soil mass (kg). (21) (22) where Tfmax is the highest
    soil temperature after mulching, Df is the film thickness (mm), Tcf is the thermal
    conductivity of film (J m−1 s−1 °C−1), Tav is the daily average air temperature
    (°C), Tmax is the daily maximum air temperature (°C), and β is the empirical constant,
    which can be determined based on the local Ta, SR, and soil texture. c was determined
    by calculating the ratio of soil volume heat capacity and soil wet density: (23)
    where cv is soil volume heat capacity and ρ1 is soil wet density, which was determined
    using the following equation: (24) (25) where ρs is soil dry density (g cm−3),
    θ is soil water content (cm−3cm−3), ρw is water density (g cm−3), cs is the specific
    heat of soil minerals (J cm−3 °C−1), and cw is the specific heat of water (J cm−3
    °C−1). The mulched region changed in response to increases in the disintegrated
    area of biodegradable film. Therefore, m is a variable that was obtained using
    the following equation: (26) Therefore, the maximum air temperature (Tmax-f) and
    minimum air temperature (Tmin-f) after compensation under biodegradable film mulching
    were calculated using the following equations: (27) (28) ET is typically estimated
    by the PT model associated with SR, Tmax, and Tmin in DSSAT. Therefore, the potential
    evapotranspiration (ETp) and ETc under BRM can be obtained by the following equations:
    (29) (30) (31) 3.4. Model parameters The CERES-Maize model includes six genetic
    parameters of maize (Table 3). Four of them are related to crop growth and development
    (P1, P2, P5, PHINT), and two genetic parameters affect crop yield (G2 and G3).
    Similarly, the SUBSTOR-Potato model contains five genetic parameters of potato.
    Four of them are related to crop growth and development (G2, PD, P2, TC), and
    one is related to crop yield (G3). Moreover, the OILCROP-sunflower model contains
    eighteen genetic parameters of sunflower. Seven of them are related to crop growth
    and development (EM-FL, FL-SH, FL-SD, SD-PM, FL-LF, SFDUR, PODUR), four are related
    to crop yield (XFRT, WTPSD, SDPDV, THRSH), one is related to protein content (SDPRO),
    and the remaining one is related to oil content (SDLIP). Table 3. Calibrated genetic

    an algorithm-based and manual joint calibration method was adopted. Firstly, crop
    genetic parameters were calibrated using the Genetic Coefficient Calculator (GENCALC)
    package in DSSAT. Next, the corresponding parameters were further calibrated by
    manually comparing simulated and observed values. 3.5. LarsWG weather generator
    and correction method The LarsWG weather generator was developed by Lausanne Laboratory
    to promote the development of a crop growth model and hydrological model (Dixit
    and Telleria, 2015, Pozdniakov et al., 2020), which includes fifteen GCMs climate
    scenarios based on IPCC4. The LarsWG weather generator can generate a series of
    meteorological data for a certain period in the future based on historical meteorological
    data and geographical data, such as rainfall, SR, Tmax, and Tmin (Fig. 2). The
    generator has been widely applied in the projections of crop yield, soil erosion,
    and extreme environmental events. The correction method aims to obtain multiple
    weather series with the same monthly mean and standard deviation as the original
    series. The weather series after correction can be obtained using the following
    equation: (32) where Gci is the weather series after correction, μcj and σcj are
    mean and standard deviation, respectively, and Gni is the normalized weather series.
    (33) (34) where ∆μj and ∆σj are the relative change of mean and standard deviation,
    respectively. (35) (36) where and are the mean and standard deviation of the original
    series, respectively, and and are the mean and standard deviation of the weather
    series after correction, respectively. The normalized weather series can be determined
    as follows: (37) 3.6. Evaluation of model performance The model performance was
    evaluated using percentage bias (PBIAS) (%), the determination coefficient (R2)
    (-), and normalized root mean square error (nRMSE) (%). These statistical indicators
    have widely used in previous studies and applications (Gong et al., 2019, Qiu
    et al., 2021, Rosa et al., 2012). (38) (39) (40) where S is simulated values,
    M is measured values, i is measured pint, and n is the number of data points.
    4. Results 4.1. Model evaluation Crop genetic and soil hydraulic parameters were
    calibrated using the measured SWS, ET, and crop yield data from different experimental
    sites in 2015, and were validated using corresponding data from 2016 to 2018.
    Our findings demonstrated that the BDSSAT model could precisely capture the dynamics
    of SWS, ET, and crop yields (Table 4). In the calibration period (2015), the average
    PBIAS, R2, and nRMSE of SWS in different experimental sites were 6.8 %, 0.86 %,
    and 9.3 %, respectively, and 7.0 %, 0.89 %, and 6.9 % for ET. The average PBIAS
    of crop yield in different sites was only 8.1 %. In the verification period (2016–2018),
    the average PBIAS, R2, and nRMSE of SWS in different sites were 9.0 %, 0.83 %,
    and 11.0 %, respectively, and 6.4 %, 0.86 %, and 9.0 % for ET. The average PBIAS
    of crop yield in different sites was 8.6 %. Compared with the BDSSAT model, ET
    and crop yield simulated by the MDSSAT model were overestimated by 15.3 % and
    13.8 %, respectively, as the MDSSAT model did not consider the effect of reduction
    of soil temperature after the disintegration of biodegradable film on the field
    water cycle and crop growth. Furthermore, SWS simulated by the MDSSAT model was
    underestimated by 16.1 %. Additionally, the DSSAT model did not account for the
    effect of increased soil temperature under BRM on crop growth, which resulted
    in an underestimation of ET and crop yield. The average ET and crop yield in sunflower,
    potato, and corn fields were underestimated by 25.5 % and 19.5 % in the DSSAT
    model, respectively, whereas SWS was overestimated by 25.3 %. In general, the
    BDSSAT model exhibited a better simulation accuracy compared with the MDSSAT and
    DSSAT models (e.g., the nRMSE of ET simulated by the BDSSAT model was 49.4 % and
    66.3 % lower than that of the MDSSAT and DSSAT models). Therefore, the BDSSAT
    model could be applied to accurately simulate the water cycle and crop growth
    under BRM. Table 4. Statistical analysis for soil water storage (SWS), evapotranspiration

    4.2. Spatiotemporal distribution of soil water storage under biodegradable film
    mulching in different regions An apparent spatial difference in SWS under BRM
    was found in different regions. In the western region, the distribution of SWS
    under BRM showed an increasing trend from west to east. The highest SWS was observed
    in the Hohhot-Baotou-Ordos region, whereas the lowest value occurred in the Alxa
    Right Banner (Fig. 3). The average maximum difference of SWS between the Hohhot-Baotou-Ordos
    region and the Alxa Right Banner reached 63.7 mm in four years. In the middle
    region, the distribution of SWS was high in the north and south and low in the
    middle. The highest SWS occurred in the Duolun region, and the lowest value occurred
    in the Sonid Left Banner. The average maximum difference of SWS in two places
    reached 175 mm in four years. However, in the eastern region, the spatial distribution
    of SWS exhibited an increasing trend from south to north (Fig. 3). The highest
    SWS occurred in Jalaid, whereas the lowest value occurred in Linxi, with the average
    maximum difference between these two locations reaching 162.5 mm in four years.
    Additionally, an apparent temporal difference in SWS under BRM was identified
    in 2015–2018. The highest SWS in the western region occurred in 2018 with 135.6 mm,
    which increased by 24.8 %, 14.9 %, and 41.1 % compared with 2015, 2016, and 2017,
    respectively. However, the highest SWS in the middle and eastern regions occurred
    in 2016. The average SWS in the middle region in 2016 was 180.3 mm, which was
    9.5 %, 22.6 %, and 8.0 % higher than that in 2015, 2017, and 2018, respectively.
    Moreover, the average SWS in the eastern region in 2016 was 150.7 mm, which increased
    by 19.7 %, 20.1 %, and 22.7 % compared with 2015, 2017, and 2018, respectively.

    h, and k), and eastern (c, f, i, and l) regions in Inner Mongolia, respectively.
    4.3. Spatiotemporal distribution of evapotranspiration under biodegradable film
    mulching in different regions The spatiotemporal distribution of ET in different
    regions was similar to that of SWS (Fig. 4). In the western region, the highest
    ET of sunflower fields occurred in the Ordos, whereas the lowest ET occurred in
    the Alxa Left Banner. The average maximum difference in ET in the two locations
    reached 195 mm in four years. In the middle region, the highest ET of potato fields
    occurred in the Duolun, whereas the lowest ET occurred in the Sonid Left Banner
    (Fig. 4). The average maximum difference in ET in the two places reached 245 mm
    in four years. However, ET and SWS exhibited opposite trends in the eastern region.
    The spatial distribution of ET in the eastern region showed a decreasing trend
    from south to north as Ta in the north was lower than in the south. The highest
    ET of corn fields occurred in the Aohan region, whereas the lowest ET occurred
    in the Xin Barag Right Banner, with an average maximum difference between the
    two places reaching 150 mm in four years. An apparent temporal difference in ET
    was found in different seasons. In general, the highest ET occurred in 2018 for
    different regions, except for the eastern region. The average ET in the western
    region in 2018 was 316.2 mm, which represented an increase of 19.1 %, 9.1 %, and
    14.6 % compared with 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. The average ET in the
    middle region in 2018 was 376.7 mm, which was 9.5 %, 22.6 %, and 8.0 % higher
    than that in 2015, 2017, and 2018, respectively (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the average
    ET in the eastern region in 2018 was 391.7 mm, which constituted an increase of
    5.1 % and 6.8 % compared with 2017 and 2018, respectively, but a decrease of 3.8
    % compared with 2015. Download : Download high-res image (996KB) Download : Download

    2017, and 2018 seasons in western (a, d, g, and j), middle (b, e, h, and k), and
    eastern (c, f, i, and l) regions in Inner Mongolia, respectively. 4.4. Spatiotemporal
    distribution of crop yield of sunflower, potato, and corn under biodegradable
    film mulching in different regions There is an obvious spatiotemporal difference
    in crop yield under BRM in different regions from 2015 to 2018. In terms of spatial
    distribution, the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region was high
    in the east and low in the west (Fig. 5). The highest sunflower yield occurred
    in the Hohhot-Baotou-Ordos region with an average yield of 4.8 × 103 kg ha−1 in
    four years, whereas the lowest yield occurred in the Alxa Right Banner with an
    average yield of 2.2 × 103 kg ha−1. The highest WP of sunflower fields in the
    western region reached 3.0 kg m−3. In the middle region, Duolun exhibited the
    highest average potato yield of 43.6 × 103 kg ha−1. In contrast, the lowest potato
    yield occurred in the Sonid Left Banner with an average yield of 16.0 × 103 kg
    ha−1. The highest WP of potato fields in the middle region reached 10.1 kg m−3.
    In the eastern region, the highest and lowest yield of corn occurred in Jalaid
    (with an average yield of 11.3 ×103 kg ha−1) and Mohe (4.4 ×103 kg ha−1), respectively.
    The highest WP of corn in the eastern region was 4.3 kg m−3 (Fig. 5). An apparent
    difference in crop yields was observed in different regions in terms of temporal
    distribution. The highest sunflower and potato yields occurred in 2018. The average
    sunflower yield in the western region in 2018 was 4.3 × 103 kg ha−1, which represented
    an 11.2 %, 7.2 %, and 17.9 % increase compared with 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively.
    Moreover, the average potato yield in the middle region in 2018 was 33.3 × 103
    kg ha−1, which increased by 33.0 %, 14.7 %, and 18.6 % compared with 2015, 2016,
    and 2017, respectively. Furthermore, the highest corn yield in the eastern region
    occurred in 2015 with an average of 7.6 × 103 kg ha−1, which was 12.1 %, 3.3 %,
    and 2.1 % higher than in 2016, 2017, and 2018, respectively. Download : Download

    in western (a, d, g, and j), middle (b, e, h, and k), and eastern (c, f, i, and

    rate of biodegradable film on crop yield and crop water productivity To further
    evaluate the effects of the disintegration rate of biodegradable film (DR) on
    crop yield and WP of sunflower, potato, and corn in different regions, six DRs
    were evaluated in this study: 0 %, 20 %, 40 %, 60 %, 80 %, and 100 %. The simulated
    results showed that the sunflower, potato, and corn average yields decreased by
    6.6 %, 3.5 %, and 7.2 % in response to an increase in DR of 10 %, respectively
    (Fig. 6). Moreover, the average WP of the sunflower, potato, and corn decreased
    by 9.7 %, 6.4 %, and 13.0 %, respectively. To maintain high productivity rates
    (i.e., the crop yields did not fall below the historic average), the DR in the
    western, middle, and eastern regions should not exceed 55 %, 73 % and 90 %, respectively.
    Moreover, the DR in the western, middle, and eastern regions should not exceed
    62 %, 53 %, and 41 % when WP was above the historic average. Download : Download

    Mongolia, respectively. 4.6. Variation in crop yields and crop water productivity
    under climate change conditions Meteorological data from 2000 to 2050 were predicted
    based on the LarsWG5 weather generator to evaluate the effects of climate change
    on crop yield and WP. Briefly, meteorological data from 1956 to 2000 were used
    as basal data, and the corresponding values from 2000 to 2018 were used as validation
    data (Fig. 2). The validation results showed that the meteorological data forecasted
    using the LarsWG5 weather generator were highly accurate, with R2 values ranging
    from 0.72 to 0.94, PBIAS ranging from − 12.8–7.2 %, and nRMSE ranging from 7.6
    % to 13.5 % (Fig. S2). In general, the crop yields of potato and corn in different
    regions increased in response to future climate change, as the average Ta markedly
    increased by 0.8 °C from 2019 to 2050 (Fig. 2 and S2), except for sunflower yield
    in the western region. For example, potato yields in the middle region increased
    annually by 1.7 %, whereas WP annually decreased by 1.9 % from 2019 to 2050. Corn
    yields and WP in the eastern region increased annually by 2.8 % and 2.6 % from
    2019 to 2050, respectively (Fig. 7). However, sunflower yield and WP in the western
    region decreased annually by 7.5 % and 6.7 % from 2019 to 2050, respectively.
    This was likely because the rainfall in the western region was projected to decrease
    by 3.5 % in the future (2019–2050) (Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image

    rate of biodegradable film in different regions The disintegration process of
    the biodegradable film mainly includes two sub-processes: oxidation and biodegradation
    (Reddy et al., 2009; Martínez-Romo et al., 2015; Wiles and Scott, 2006). First,
    the macromolecular materials of the biodegradable film are disintegrated into
    smaller molecules via oxidation in natural conditions. Moreover, small molecule
    polymers are further degraded into CO2, H2O, and microbial biomass via microbial
    decomposition (Bonifer et al., 2019, Kim et al., 2017). The DR primarily depended
    on external environmental factors such as wind speed, temperature, and microorganism
    species (Stroganov et al., 2014; Seligra et al., 2016; Sameshima-Yamashita et
    al., 2016). DR typically increased in response to an increase in wind speed since
    the oxidation rate was improved by increasing the contact area between the biodegradable
    film and the atmosphere. Similarly, high soil temperature promoted DR by stimulating
    microbial activity and decreasing the tension of the film. Additionally, microorganism
    species are the main factor that contributes to the disintegration of biodegradable
    films. For instance, Meyer-Cifuentes et al. (2020) reported that the Actinomycetes
    and Bacteroides genera were more abundant in the free community than in the membrane
    community, whereas members of the genus Bacillus were more abundant in the membrane
    community. In general, the differences in DR in the different examined regions
    were caused by external factors. For example, the high DR in the western region
    was attributed to the high wind speed and temperature in this area. In contrast,
    DR decreased as wind speed and temperature decreased from west to east in Inner
    Mongolia (Fig. S1). The average DR in the middle and eastern regions was 52 %
    and 37 %, respectively. Moreover, microbial activity decreased as the soil temperature
    decreased from the western region to the eastern region, which further limited
    DR. A similar result was found in the previous studies. For example, Chen et al.
    (2021a) demonstrated that DR reached 60 % in the western region. Feng (2021) found
    that DR was only 40 % at the end of the crop growing season in the eastern region.
    However, a different phenomenon was observed in previous experimental studies.
    For example, Li et al. (2020) found that biodegradable film reached a “fragmentation”
    period (i.e., the disintegration rate was approximately 80 %) at the end of the
    crop growing season. These effects were likely due to the composition of the biodegradable
    film. A biodegradable film with a high disintegration rate was adopted in the
    study of Li et al. (2020). Therefore, although low temperature limited the disintegration
    rate of biodegradable film, its disintegration rate was still higher than that
    of other biodegradable films (e.g., the biodegradable films with medium and low
    disintegration rates). 5.2. Spatial difference in soil water storage, evapotranspiration,
    and crop yield in sunflower, potato, and corn fields in different regions Spatial
    differences in SWS and ET were caused by multiple factors such as soil texture,
    meteorological data, and agricultural management strategy (Bosmans et al., 2016;
    Olivera-Guerra et al., 2014). In general, SWS in a sandy field was apparently
    lower than that of loam and clay fields, as sandy soil has larger porosity and
    poor water retention. The corresponding ET in a sandy field was lower than that
    of other soil textures due to its low transpiration. For example, Razzaghi et
    al. (2012) reported that the maximum transpiration in a sandy field was 2.5 mm
    d−1, and it decreased by 17 % compared with that of sandy loam fields. A similar
    result was found in the present study, e.g., the lowest SWS and ET occurred in
    the Alxa Right Banner in the western region, which featured sandy soil (Fig. 3).
    However, the impact of soil texture on SWS and ET may be negligible in the eastern
    region. The spatial difference in meteorological data may be the main factor that
    affected the spatial distribution of SWS and ET in the eastern region. The north
    of the eastern region is located in a high latitude area. Therefore, Ta in this
    area remains low due to the high atmospheric pressure. The average air temperature
    in the north of the eastern region was far below the optimal temperature for corn
    growth (i.e., 20–24 °C) (Yan and Tu, 2003). Thus, the Ta difference between the
    north and south in the eastern region resulted in a “high in the south and low
    in the north” distribution for SWS and ET (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The spatial distribution
    of crop yields in different regions was consistent with the spatial distribution
    of ET. For instance, the distribution of sunflower yields in the western region
    showed a “high in the east and low in the west” trend; the potato yield in the
    middle region showed a “high in the south-central region and low in the north”
    trend; the corn yield in the eastern region showed a “high in the south and low
    in the north” trend (Fig. 5). Li et al. (2022) reported that the potato yield
    in the south of the middle region increased by 41.7 % compared with that of the
    north, and the corn yield in the south of the eastern region was approximately
    71.4 % higher than in the north. Nevertheless, there is an apparent difference
    in terms of the size of the crop yields in this study and a previous study. Li
    et al. (2022) indicated that the yields of sunflower, potato, and corn in the
    western, middle, and eastern regions were approximately 700, 2500, and 3300 kg ha−1,
    which far lower than the corresponding crop yields determined in this study. These
    differences may be attributed to different agricultural management strategies.
    Li et al. (2022) mainly adopted rainfed irrigation under no mulching, whereas
    the present study adopted a drip irrigation technology under BRM. This approach
    has significant advantages compared to rainfed irrigation under no mulching, such
    as decreasing Es, improving the soil temperature, and increasing crop yield (Saglam
    et al., 2017; Gu et al., 2020). In general, BRM not only effectively increases
    crop yield and WP of sunflower, potato, and corn, but also reduces plastic-residue
    pollution and promotes the development of sustainable agriculture. However, it
    is worth nothing that the seeding date and field management strategy in the same
    region was assumed to be completely homogeneous in this study. Moreover, the soil
    texture and meteorology of the study sites located in the same county were also
    assumed to be equal. The above assumption may cause some discrepancies between
    the modeling and measurement results. Moreover, the data collected for this study
    was not sufficient to evaluate the long-term effects of biodegradable film mulching
    on ET and crop yield. However, the modeling results of this study can still provide
    a valuable reference for areas with similar experimental and environmental conditions.
    5.3. Temporal differences in evapotranspiration and crop yield in sunflower, potato,
    and corn fields in different regions Apparent temporal differences in ET and crop
    yields of sunflower, potato, and corn were observed in different regions under
    BRM. For instance, the highest ET and crop yield in the western and middle regions
    occurred in 2018, whereas the highest values of these indicators occurred in 2016
    in the eastern region. This phenomenon may be attributed to seasonal differences
    in meteorological factors over the course of the observation period (i.e., 2015–2018).
    In general, the key meteorological factors affecting crop yield include Ta, rainfall,
    and CO2 concentration (Brown and Rosenberg, 1997; Soureshjani et al., 2019; Wakjira
    et al., 2021). In the western region, the inter-annual fluctuation of rainfall
    was the main reason for the temporal difference in ET and crop yield. For example,
    rainfall in the western region in 2018 increased by 50.7 % compared with 2015
    (Fig. 2), and the corresponding ET and sunflower yields in 2018 was 19.1 % and
    11.2 % higher than in 2015, respectively (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). The cause of the inter-annual
    difference in ET and potato yields in the middle region during the 2015–2018 period
    was similar to that of sunflower yield in the western region. However, the main
    meteorological factor affecting corn yield in the eastern region was Ta, as this
    region receives fewer daylight hours. ET and corn yields in the eastern region
    in 2018 decreased by 3.8 % and 2.1 % compared with 2015 (Fig. 3, Fig. 4), respectively,
    as Ta in 2018 decreased by 1.3 % relative to 2015 (Fig. 2). Additionally, the
    inter-annual fluctuation of CO2 concentration may be an important driver of crop
    yield differences from 2015 to 2018. In recent years, CO2 concentration in Inner
    Mongolia continuously increased due to the impact of human activities, which increased
    the Ta in the ground layer since CO2 concentration promoted the atmospheric absorption
    of long-wave radiation (Karlén, W, 2001). Moreover, these high CO2 concentrations
    further promoted plant growth and development by improving leaf photosynthesis
    (Natali et al., 2009). Thus, increases in CO2 concentration may enhance crop yields
    of sunflower, potato, and corn in Inner Mongolia. 6. Conclusions The BDSSAT model
    could more accurately simulate the SWS, ET, and crop yields of sunflower, potato,
    and corn under BRM compared with the MDSSAT and DSSAT models. An apparent spatial
    difference in SWS, ET, and crop yield was found in different regions due to the
    differences in soil texture, meteorological data, and agricultural management
    strategies. The distribution of SWS showed a trend of “low in the west and high
    in the east,” “high in the north and south, and low in the middle,” and “low in
    the south and high in the north” in the western, middle, and eastern regions,
    respectively. The spatial distribution of ET and crop yields in different regions
    was largely consistent with the spatial distribution of SWS. Furthermore, there
    was an apparent temporal difference in ET and crop yield from 2015 to 2018. Collectively,
    our findings indicated that ET and crop yields in sunflower and potato fields
    in different regions increased with time, except for corn fields in the eastern
    region. Additionally, the disintegration rates of biodegradable film in the western,
    middle, and eastern regions should not exceed 55 %, 73 %, and 90 %, respectively,
    to ensure high field production. The crop yields of potato and corn in different
    regions increased in response to future climate change, except for sunflower yield
    in the western region. The finding of this study can effectively promote the application
    of biodegradable film at a global scale. Declaration of Competing Interest The

    irrigation water management has attracted a considerable degree of attention because
    it is crucial to guarantee water and food security worldwide. A smart irrigation
    system is applied for the rational use of water in agricultural fields and for
    maximizing crop yield. Thus, the high demand for water resources is decreased,
    and the adverse environmental impacts of irrigation are reduced. Different irrigation
    approaches were developed to reduce overirrigation by assessing the soil moisture
    content or crop water stress index. This paper aims to review conventional and
    smart irrigation technologies and discuss their effect on water savings, yield,
    and crop quality. The analysis of prominent studies highlighted that the water
    use efficiency based on soil moisture sensors depends on the volumetric moisture
    content threshold value set by farmers. Soil moisture sensor controllers, evapotranspiration
    controllers, and rain sensors have been shown to save 20%–92%, 20%–71%, and 7%–50%
    of water, respectively, while maintaining crop growth and quality. The optical
    sensor-based system showed a better ability to assess crop and soil variability
    in the field than the on-site measurements. The conventional controlled deficit
    irrigation technique was found to decrease the crop yield to less than 25% with
    water savings of up to 13%. 1 INTRODUCTION Global demand for food is increasing
    due to rapid population growth, which entails greater pressures on water resources
    (García et al., 2018). Water is consumed largely in the agricultural sector, with
    approximately 70% of global water withdrawals used for irrigation (Simionesei
    et al., 2020). In arid and semi-arid climates, the water crisis is among the major
    problems faced by the agricultural sector (Nazari et al., 2018). This issue is
    raised because farmers supply regular irrigation to all parts of the crop field
    without considering the water need of the crop. Overirrigation or underirrigation
    of some part of a farm, which may cause undesired water stress on the crops, is
    a drawback of the aforementioned irrigation practice (Abioye et al., 2020b). Thus,
    proper management of irrigation water is crucial to guarantee worldwide water
    security (Nazari et al., 2018). A precision or smart irrigation system is a sustainable
    water saving method for maximizing crop yield and reducing the undesirable environmental
    impacts from irrigation (Mason et al., 2019). The difference between water demand
    and supply in agriculture is considered an issue that should be solved by using
    advanced technologies to optimize irrigation water use (Pereira et al., 2020).
    Several irrigation scheduling techniques have been developed and tested at a large
    scale by various researchers (Figure 1), including soil moisture sensor (SMS)
    controllers, evapotranspiration (ET) controllers, and rain sensors (RS). In general,
    SMS estimate and provide soil moisture content (SMC) data that can be set to a
    certain threshold by a controller. Hence, irrigation events will be bypassed automatically
    when the SMC exceeds the set threshold (McCready et al., 2009). RS are constructed
    to stop programmed irrigation events after a certain depth of rainfall. Standalone
    controllers or manually programmed irrigation controllers, historical-based controllers
    that provide historical weather data, and signal-based controllers that estimate
    real-time weather data received by on-site systems have been the main ET controllers
    used for irrigation management in recent decades (Migliaccio et al., 2010). FIGURE
    1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Number of papers on smart irrigation systems
    (data analysis on February 10, 2022) Likewise, the application of optical sensors
    such as on drones and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) as plant-based irrigation
    management to attain precision irrigation in agriculture has recently attracted
    significant research attention (Gao et al., 2021). The principle of this technique
    is that the crop canopy data obtained from UAV data are used to predict the crop
    water stress index (CWSI) (Peres & Cancelliere, 2021). The internet of things
    (IoT), a concept that joins wireless and mobile tools embedded via the internet
    (Gulati & Thakur, 2018; Mousavi et al., 2021a), plays a vital role in many fields,
    especially in the agricultural sector (Richa et al., 2021). Combining the IoT
    with the abovementioned sensors for their connection to data platforms to provide
    real-time data and provide more informed decisions allows for intelligent irrigation
    solutions (Mousavi et al., 2021b). Consequently, the IoT facilitates crop irrigation
    operations where water resources can be controlled and monitored to meet demand
    while reducing waste and cutting operational costs. Management of irrigation and
    enhancement of crop water productivity using conventional deficit irrigation (DI)
    techniques has also been the object of increasing research attention in recent
    decades (Rathore et al., 2021). The principal of this process is based on the
    application of less water volume than the plant necessities (Kovalenko et al.,
    2021). In this way, the water use efficiency increases, while the crop yield can
    be maintained above the accepted value (Razzaghi et al., 2020). The aforementioned
    irrigation techniques (Figure 2) are outlined in this paper, and their effects
    on water economies, growth, and crop quality are discussed. To the best of our
    knowledge, advanced control strategies for precision irrigation have been previously
    highlighted (Abioye et al., 2020b; Bwambale et al., 2022); however, their effect
    on water savings, crop growth, and crop quality compared to conventional practices
    has not been addressed or reported elsewhere. It is expected that this paper will
    serve as a useful reference for researchers and farmers to choose the appropriate
    irrigation management strategy according to the water saving data presented and
    obtained experimentally from previous research. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer

    2 SMART STRATEGIES FOR PRECISION IRRIGATION Generally, four smart irrigation strategies,
    including RS, SMS, ET-based controllers, and optical sensors, are available on
    the market to avoid wasting water during irrigation in the field. In this section,
    the effect of these techniques on water savings and crop quality is highlighted.
    2.1 Soil moisture-based irrigation management The water balance in the soil and
    the need for crop irrigation can be estimated by measuring the SMC (Qin et al.,
    2021). Several studies have reported on irrigation monitoring based on soil moisture
    sensing (Blessy, 2021; Hamouda et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Typically, the
    scheduling process consists of using the data from the sensor to monitor timed
    irrigation procedures. Thus, if the SMC exceeds the adjustable threshold setting,
    the event is bypassed (Dukes, 2005). It was reported that a much better performance
    in weekly citrus tree irrigation estimation was attained when combining soil sensor
    data with weather information (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). In this section,
    different smart irrigation systems used as SMS are reviewed. A low-cost radio
    frequency identification (RFID) technology that transmits data to the receiver
    was wirelessly connected to two soil temperature and three Watermark moisture
    sensors for real-time sensing and used to schedule irrigation of cotton. The centrally
    located receiver was linked to a computer and sensor nodes (soil sensors and RFID)
    installed in the crop field. The outcomes indicated that the soil water tension
    did not exceed adjustable trigger points. However, the centre pivot irrigation
    system did not respond immediately to the real-time water needs of the crops.
    To address the technical drawbacks mentioned above, the use of a smart sensor
    array in combination with a variable rate irrigation system was suggested (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). A hygrometer used as SMS, connected to an Arduino Uno (Chengdu
    Ashining Technology Co., Ltd. China) along with a temperature sensor, was used
    to monitor the water supply according to the sensor''s measurement. Thus, if the
    moisture level of the soil was below the threshold setting, the Arduino activated
    the water supply to the soil, and the farmer could access the data from his smartphone
    via a cloud server (Kothawade et al., 2016). These IoT-based systems along with
    humidity sensors or RS have been applied for the smart irrigation of different
    crops, such as wheat (Jha et al., 2017) and beans, where a regression algorithm
    was utilized to estimate the quantity of water needed for the next irrigation
    (Kumar et al., 2017). In another study, a wireless robot interfaced with a Raspberry
    Pi 2 Model B (Shenzhen Jeking Electronic Corp. China) was used to execute different
    tasks, such as spraying pesticides, moisture sensing, and switching electric motors
    on and off. To capture the crop field and examine live events occurring in the
    field, a camera was interfaced with the Raspberry as well (Krishna et al., 2017).
    Recently, to enhance the utilization of water for chestnut irrigation, SMC was
    tracked during the vegetative stage. To promote good tree water status, irrigation
    scheduling was activated when the sensor at 30–60 cm soil depth was above −100.000 Pa
    (Mota et al., 2018). The abovementioned systems efficiently monitored the sensed
    parameters. However, water use efficiency has not been evaluated. An automated
    crop field irrigation system based on the IoT using soil, temperature, and humidity
    sensors proved to be 92% more efficient than traditional practices, as the total
    water requirement for a 600 m2 crop field was 341 m3 for traditional irrigation
    and 29 m3 for automated irrigation for a period of 2 months (Rajalakshmi & Mahalakshmi,
    2016). In another work, SMS-based drip irrigation used 20% less water than manual
    drip irrigation of banana (Panigrahi et al., 2019). In a separate investigation
    (Grabow et al., 2013), 39% water savings were obtained compared to the timer-based
    irrigation practice. Recently, SMS applied to irrigate pear orchards were found
    to save 50% of applied irrigation water while maintaining good crop production
    and quality (Hamouda et al., 2021). In a study carried out by Rajaram and Sundareswaran
    (2020), SMS were used for precision irrigation of brinjal plants, where the quantity
    of water needed was calculated based on the temperature and humidity obtained
    from the probes. The results indicated that 53% of water has been saved from wastage.
    The volumetric moisture content (VMC) threshold is a key factor in properly elaborating
    an irrigation schedule using SMS. In the study conducted by McCready et al. (2009),
    Acclima Digital TDT RS500 (Acclima Inc., Meridian, ID) and LawnLogic LL1004 (Alpine
    Automation, Inc., Aurora, CO) were used for smart irrigation of St. Augustine
    grass. Three different VMC thresholds were set by the sensor systems (low, medium,
    and high). The medium threshold setting sensor system could save 74% water and
    produce good plant quality. According to the experimental research carried out
    on the smart irrigation of walnut, the necessary water volume by crop depending
    on the growth phase can be defined from soil moisture data by using software that
    was operated in IOS/Android-based systems. In this system, closing and opening
    processes were carried out according to the seasonal water requirement (Işık et
    al., 2017). In an automatic drip irrigation system in a greenhouse tomato cultivation
    experiment, a wireless SMS was installed in a 0–100-cm soil profile. In this system,
    the spatiotemporal features of soil moisture distributions were exploited to approximate
    dynamic plant water uptake depth, and then the estimated data were obtained using
    a central irrigation regulator to reach an accurate irrigation depth at each irrigation
    scheme. The tomato irrigation water use efficiency attained 41.23 kg/m3, which
    was an apparent enhancement compared with that achieved using a conventional irrigation
    scheme (31.58 kg/m3) (Liao et al., 2021). On the other hand, exploiting ZigBee
    wireless network technology in smart irrigation to deal with monitoring SMC has
    attracted significant research attention (Saraf & Gawali, 2017). In this system,
    there is a node with sensors that determine the temperature, humidity, and moisture
    content of the soil and compare these values with the established values. The
    wireless system, which is programmed to continuously track water pump valves,
    has been established using the ZigBee approach (Rasin et al., 2009). In a study
    conducted in Algeria, the irrigation system is managed from a long distance using
    a 6LoWPAN (Renesas Electronics Co. USA) wireless sensor network that joins the
    ZigBee network with the internet. In this system, soil moisture values obtained
    from SMS can be transmitted through a ZigBee mesh network to a smart gateway and
    then sent to a web service via a mobile data communication network to evaluate
    the data and act according to the obtained data (Khelifa et al., 2015). Similarly,
    the ZigBee wireless communication technology was successfully used for monitoring
    citrus soil moisture, temperature, and nutrients based on the IoT system, where
    the water content was monitored at depths of 20 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm. The system
    could save 20% water and fertilizer resources (Zhang et al., 2017). To overcome
    the limitations of the fixed sprinkler system, a model of the ZigBee (Chengdu
    Ashining Technology Co., Ltd. China) strategy based on the adaptive sprinkler
    irrigation machine (Figure 3) was developed recently (Bodunde et al., 2019). The
    ZigBee XBee module, which is configured as a transmitter, microcontroller, and
    moisture sensor, was placed on the irrigated area. The system can alarm the farmer
    to water the plants manually. Combining the IoT with this designed robot will
    be a promising technology in agriculture. ZigBee technology and a soil moisture
    prediction algorithm can also be used to predict soil moisture based on the data
    measured from the sensors installed in the field and the weather forecast data
    obtained from the internet. The proposed algorithm showed high accuracy, with
    R2 equal to 0.96 (Goap et al., 2018). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Sprinkler irrigation robot. Source: Reproduced with permission from Bodunde et
    al. (2019) Fuzzy logic systems have been used in various studies because they
    help farmers make smart decisions with respect to watering necessities (Anand
    et al., 2015; Kia et al., 2009). As a proof of concept, a control system-based
    fuzzy logic using the IoT was proposed to compute input parameters such as temperature,
    soil moisture, and humidity to generate motor status outputs. This system was
    compared in terms of water use efficiency with the drip irrigation and manual
    flooding irrigation approaches over a period of 3 days. The results indicated
    that the smart system pumps water in a period of 7 hr, while the other two methods
    pump water in periods ranging from 12 to 20 hr (Krishnan et al., 2020). The main
    limitation of automated irrigation using fuzzy logic approaches is that the water
    required for the other plants could be dissimilar, which would hence necessitate
    a mild variation in the fuzzy logic values (Sudharshan et al., 2019). As seen
    above, there is no convenient facility to predict and intimate the farmers about
    the health status of the plants if they were to continue to grow in the current
    environmental conditions. For this reason, to determine crop water use and examine
    the growth rate and health status of the mustard leaf plant grown in a greenhouse,
    an IoT-based weather station was deployed in the greenhouse to compute the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0) value, and a camera was linked to the Raspberry Pi. Soil
    moisture and ET0 data were exploited for arranging drip irrigation using ESPresso
    Lite V2 (Shenzhen Jeking Electronic Corp. China) and Raspberry Pi 3 as the control
    and processing unit. To determine the irrigation instance of the system, the real-time
    VMC and ET0 data were combined to develop the irrigation decision algorithm embedded
    on the Raspberry Pi (Abioye et al., 2020a). Similarly, soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH were analysed to determine whether crops required irrigation and to predict
    plant health using machine learning algorithms (Reghukumar & Vijayakumar, 2019).
    Block chain tools play a vital role by offering scalability, privacy, and reliability
    in IoT-based smart irrigation systems (Bodkhe et al., 2020; Lin et al., 2020).
    An advanced watering system with the capability of blockchain security support
    and a fuzzy decision support system was designed, which showed the communication
    channels between smart tools; sensors, such as soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity sensors; actuators and cloud storage; and users and networks (Figure
    4) (Munir et al., 2019). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Blockchain-based

    irrigation management Apart from using SMS for monitoring irrigation, ET estimates
    have also been used to schedule irrigation and are considered a potential water-saving
    technology (Davis & Dukes, 2009; Seagraves et al., 2010). This strategy ideally
    provides irrigation based on the ET requirements of the crop. Crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) is the evaporation from the soil surface and the transpiration through the
    plant canopies. ETc can be measured as the product of ET0 and the crop coefficient
    (Kc), which is based on the type of crop, production milieu, and development stage
    (Davis et al., 2007). The crop water requirement (CWR) is the amount of water
    needed to replace ET. Weather parameters (i.e., temperature, relative humidity,
    and wind speed), crop factors (i.e., crop type), and management and environmental
    factors (i.e., soil fertility) can affect the water requirement of a particular
    crop (ETcrop) (Kisekka et al., 2010b). Controllers that use weather information
    to estimate ET are referred to as ET controllers (Isaya et al., 2009). According
    to the ways in which ET0 information is received, ET controllers are categorized
    into three main classes: (1) standalone controllers that determine climatic variables
    from on-site sensors and then measure ET0, (2) signal-based controllers that collect
    ET0 data and rain information via wireless communication from weather stations
    (satellite signals), and (3) historical-based controllers that rely on monthly
    historical ET0 information for the area (Figure 5) (Riley, 2005). It is worth
    mentioning that the precision of ET0 estimation can affect the performance of
    ET-based smart controllers. For example, it was found that approximately 11% more
    water was consumed by the ET-based group than by the timer-based group due to
    the overestimation of ET0 by the controllers (Grabow et al., 2013). Typically,
    three main controllers have been used for ET-based smart irrigation: Weathermatic
    (Weathermatic, Inc., Dallas, TX; stand-alone controller), Toro (Toro Company,
    Inc., Riverside, CA), and ETwater (ETwater Systems LCC, Corte Madera, CA; signal-based
    controllers) (Davis & Dukes, 2012). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Evapotranspiration (ET) controller categories used in smart irrigation 2.2.1 Case
    studies using ET controllers In landscapes of Las Vegas homeowners, signal-based
    ET controllers were found to reduce water applied by approximately 20% compared
    to control sites (Devitt et al., 2008). Irrigation scheduling in gardens in Valdebebas,
    Madrid, Spain, has been well managed using ET controllers based only on climatic
    conditions, with water savings of up to 35% (Canales-Ide et al., 2019). McCready
    et al. (2009) studied irrigation of St. Augustine grass, where water was applied
    using two varieties of ET controllers, and indicated that water savings ranged
    from 25% to 62% (McCready et al., 2009). Similarly, the water savings of the Toro
    Intelli-Sense (Toro company, Inc., Riverside, CA) controller compared to a standard
    timer-based scheduling were found to be 59% while producing good turfgrass quality
    (Shedd et al., 2007). ET controllers, such as Weathermatic SL1600 with SLW15 weather
    monitor, Toro Intelli-Sense, and ETwater Smart Controller 100, could potentially
    generate annual reserves of 42% when compared to conventional irrigation practice,
    replacing net irrigation necessity without rain switch and still maintain good
    plant quality (Davis et al., 2009). ET controllers were compared to a theoretically
    derived soil water balance model in the winter, spring, and summer seasons. The
    Weathermatic and Toro controllers applied 3%–26% and 27%–31% less than would theoretically
    be required for the winter and spring seasons, respectively. However, in summer,
    4% overirrigation was found by applying the Toro controller, which is attributed
    to RS associated with this controller bypassing irrigation only for extreme rainfall
    conditions. For ET water treatment, the controller applied 46% and 10% less than
    the theoretical requirement for the spring and summer seasons, respectively. The
    incorporation of RS is extremely important to the success of ET controllers (Davis
    & Dukes, 2010). Along with SMS and RS scheduling irrigation technologies, the
    seasonal average irrigation adequacy rating for all treatments was up to 99% (McCready
    & Dukes, 2011). The combination of rain switch and rain pause on the Toro Intelli-Sense
    controller reduced St. Augustine grass irrigation by 41% compared with the application
    of no rain features. Therefore, using both the rain switch and the rain pause
    feature is suggested to interrupt irrigation events on the Toro Intelli-Sense
    controller (Rutland & Dukes, 2012). The above smart irrigation technology has
    been transferred along with soil moisture-based controllers to conserve water
    use for turf and landscape irrigation in residential settings. The water savings
    of the SMS experiments were 44%, while those of the ET group were 20% (Nautiyal
    et al., 2010). Similarly, papaya irrigation research indicated that the plant
    was managed successfully with high water savings of approximately 65% either by
    tracking soil water or using historic ET data compared to conventional irrigation
    without affecting the physiological and production features (Migliaccio et al.,
    2010). Likewise, ET-based irrigation controllers have been used for the irrigation
    management of wheat and tomatoes. The system is composed of digital electronic
    controllers, ET sensors, and modules. ETc for the local microclimate was calculated
    automatically by the system based on the modified Penman equation, for which a
    scientific program was created and downloaded to the controller. Then, irrigation
    run times can be adjusted to only replace the quantity of water the plants have
    lost. The outcomes indicated that the system could save 27% water (Al-Ghobari
    & Mohammad, 2011). Irrigation experimentation results of woody fruit orchards
    revealed that ET-based irrigation arrangements obtained from real-time or historical
    weather information applied more than 70% less irrigation water compared to a
    time-based treatment (Kisekka et al., 2010a). More recently, ET-based irrigation
    systems for mustard green crop using either public weather forecasting or a microclimatic
    weather station have shown water savings of approximately 71% compared to manual
    irrigation, without affecting crop growth (Cruz et al., 2020). It is worth noting
    that soil moisture probes are practical to verify if the irrigation schedule is
    accurate (Widyanto et al., 2014). As proof of concept, the management of wheat
    crop irrigation in In Salah, Algeria, showed that the practical ETc applied for
    irrigation approved with soil moisture data reduced the irrigation water quantity
    by 5% compared to the theoretical computation based on meteorological statistics
    (Debauche et al., 2020). The same strategy was used for the irrigation management
    of strawberries, where a 10-year series of recorded ET0 was used. Then, water
    requirements were updated by means of the data obtained from the weather station
    and SMS (Morillo et al., 2015). In a simulation study conducted using Root Zone
    Water Quality Model-based software (Gu et al., 2017), deficiencies in water supply
    were detected, and 4-day-ahead weather forecast data (precipitation, air temperature,
    humidity, wind speed, and radiation) were developed for soybean and corn irrigation
    management by simulating the appearance of water stress and then determining the
    volume of irrigated water to be supplied to return the current soil water content
    to the soil water content across the crop''s full rooting depth. The water saving
    capacity of this model was up to 35% without affecting crop yield. 2.3 RS-based
    irrigation management RS are considered one of the simplest irrigation-sensing
    strategies. These tools proved to be useful for water savings at a relatively
    low price (Cardenas-Lailhacar & Dukes, 2008). RS can delay or interrupt the scheduled
    irrigation cycle when there is a predetermined amount of rain that disables the
    solenoid valves until the sensor dries out (Dobbs et al., 2013). Typically, RS
    should be installed in open areas where they will be exposed to unobstructed rainfall
    (Dukes & Haman, 2002). By using RS, runoff or deep percolation can be minimized,
    weed pressure and diseases can be reduced, and unnecessary irrigation events can
    be eliminated. In addition, RS have a long life, more than 10 years according
    to the producer, and a 5-year warranty (Cardenas-Lailhacar & Dukes, 2008; Dukes
    & Haman, 2002). Water savings by applying RS ranged from 19% to 34% under standard
    rainfall occurrence in central Florida (Cardenas-Lailhacar et al., 2008; Haley
    & Dukes, 2007). The impact of Mini-Clik RS (Hunter Industries, Inc., San Marcos,
    CA) at two rainfall set points (3 mm and 6 mm) and three different irrigation
    frequencies (1, 2, and 7 days/week) on water savings and turf quality studies
    indicated that RS with different set points and irrigation frequencies had water
    savings ranging from 7% to 30% with acceptable turfgrass quality (McCready et
    al., 2009). Similarly, it was found that the RS treatment with a 7-day/week irrigation
    frequency using a 6-mm set point applied less water per irrigation event than
    the SMS treatment (McCready & Dukes, 2011). In another study, two RS types (Mini-Clik
    and wireless Rain-Clik) were evaluated with respect to water saving potential,
    with the wireless Rain-Clik accounting for the highest potential water conservation
    of 44% (Cardenas-Lailhacar & Dukes, 2008). Likewise, the water savings of RS-based
    Bahia grass irrigation systems compared to conventional irrigation were up to
    49% at 32-mm irrigation depth and 2-days/week irrigation frequency. In addition,
    the leachate NO3–N and NH4–N were also managed using RS (Dobbs et al., 2014).
    To determine the real-time rainfall, RS were connected to an ARM7 microcontroller
    (Shenzhen Leadwon Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. China), and the quantity of
    water present in the soil was determined by the SMS according to the rainfall
    information of the land. The irrigation pump motor was monitored using the sensor
    data and then transferred to the farmer''s smartphone via GSM (Global System for
    Mobile Communications) technologies. The water saving results of the system tested
    on tomato cultivation were up to 50% in the germination stage and more than 30%
    in the repining periods compared to drip irrigation (Barkunan et al., 2020). The
    same smart irrigation system was applied for monitoring paddy irrigation, and
    it was found that 41.5% and 13% of water can be saved compared to the conventional
    flood and drip irrigation processes, respectively (Barkunan et al., 2019). Several
    input parameters, that is, temperature and humidity, integrated with RS that could
    reduce the accuracy of the system are considered drawbacks of the above strategy.
    Examples of reviewed smart irrigation systems using the aforementioned techniques
    are summarized in Table 1. It can be concluded that SMS and ET controllers are
    promising strategies to increase water use efficiency and are the most applied
    strategies for irrigation management compared to RS due to their accuracy and
    high water economy potential without affecting crop quality. As shown in Table
    1, irrigation management with the abovementioned devices showed different water
    savings because it depends on the application, techniques used, and climate conditions.

    of things. The above soil contact-based strategies were shown to be cost-effective
    and efficient for irrigation scheduling. However, we should mention that the sensors
    contain electronic elements that may have some drawbacks, such as their exposure
    to salts of the soil and their limited durability. In addition, they may be subject
    to errors and uncertainties. For example, it was found that the deviation of sensor-measured
    ETc from true ETc ranged from −14% to −31% in silt loam soil (Sharma et al., 2021).
    Consequently, researchers have moved towards finding new hot technologies for
    precision agriculture using plant-based methods because symptoms of canopy stress
    can be identified much earlier than symptoms in soil (Mwinuka et al., 2021). 2.4
    Optical sensors: Plant-based irrigation management The abovementioned sensors
    used for precision irrigation require particular hardware for wired and wireless
    connections to buried sensors, which may lose signal due to disconnection issues
    (Al-Naji et al., 2021). To avoid using SMS buried in the soil, novel techniques
    have been applied to manage irrigation by using optical sensors such as drones,
    UAV, and red/green/blue (RGB) cameras (Ajith et al., 2018). UAV-based remote sensing
    is a breakthrough technology that has been extensively exploited in smart irrigation
    over a large scale due to its cost-effectiveness, easy construction procedures,
    convenient transportation, high flexibility, short operating cycle, and relatively
    high resolution (Boursianis et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2019). Compared to satellite
    imagery, crop canopy data from UAV imagery proved to be more related to in-field
    assessments (Khaliq et al., 2019). Typically, a histogram of canopy temperature
    supplied from UAV thermal infrared images is used to estimate the CWSI, thus improving
    irrigation water use efficiency (Bian et al., 2019). Diverse categories of sensors
    can be integrated into UAV, such as visual, thermal, and multispectral sensors
    (Mwinuka et al., 2021). For example, in water saving irrigation, a UAV with an
    RGB camera captured images of rice fields and successfully estimated the height
    of rice plants with a high correlation coefficient (Yang et al., 2020). The amount
    of water present in the soil of a tea plantation was recorded from images of the
    crops and soil. The tea leaf pictures were assembled for evaluation of tea deficiency
    by using a high-definition camera placed on the UAV. The suggested system saves
    water from wastage to a significant degree (Jia et al., 2019). Recently, in a
    semi-arid climate, a six-band multispectral camera mounted on a multirotor UAV
    was used to capture images at 50 m above the ground during cotton flowering and
    boll forming to monitor and determine plant water content. With this experiment,
    13 vegetation indices were extracted from the camera, and the results indicated
    that crop water content can be retrieved by combining crop canopy temperature
    with UAV multispectral data (Chen et al., 2020). Likewise, a technique to design
    trajectories for precision crop irrigation with UAV was developed based on a CWSI
    image in which spatially variant irrigation was found to save up to 123% of water
    use per segment (Albornoz & Giraldo, 2017). Similarly, multispectral images captured
    by UAV cameras containing a Sony IMX 219 CMOS sensor were integrated with a decision
    support system and exploited to estimate the normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) map used for precise management of the linear sprinkler device used
    for the irrigation of tomatoes. The outcomes revealed that higher water savings
    could be attained with the combination of the NDVI technical index with a decision
    support system (Aleotti et al., 2018). In other investigations, multispectral
    images obtained from Red Edge (Parrot Co. Ltd, Paris, France) and MCA-6 (Mini-MCA-6
    Tetracame, Inc., Chatswort, CA, USA) camera-mounted UAV were used to predict the
    spatial variability of the water status of maize and grapevine, respectively (Baluja
    et al., 2012; Poblete et al., 2017; Romero et al., 2018). The UAV-based system
    was shown to have more abilities to assess the field variability of crops and
    soil than the on-site measurements. Bellvert and his team performed measurements
    with UAV-based irrigation management and reported that the CWSI maps created by
    airborne thermal imagery from UAV were effective in assessing the spatial variability
    of water stress across a vineyard (Bellvert et al., 2014). For precision viticulture,
    a multisensor UAV system capable of flying 70 m above the ground was implemented
    with three sensors simultaneously, a multispectral camera, a thermal camera, and
    a high spatial resolution RGB camera, where 80% of the total missing plants were
    identified by the implemented system (Figure 6) (Matese & Di Gennaro, 2018). FIGURE

    farming. Source: Reproduced with permission from Matese and Di Gennaro (2018)
    In southwestern Spain, UAV mounted onboard thermal cameras were flown over a commercial
    drip-irrigated orchard (almond, apricot, lemon, orange, and peach) to track water-stressed
    fields (Figure 7) and define the CWSI threshold. The CWSI thresholds to start
    irrigation were found to be 0.27, 0.31, and 0.37 for apricot, almond, and peach,
    respectively (Gonzalez-Dugo et al., 2013). FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    from Gonzalez-Dugo et al. (2013) 3 CONVENTIONAL STRATEGIES 3.1 DI strategies DI
    is a simple approach or practice applied by farmers to save water (Rathore et
    al., 2021). The strategy consists of supplying lower water quantities than the
    plant requirements (Kovalenko et al., 2021). In this case, the applied water could
    be minimized to a great extent, while the crop yield can be maintained above the
    accepted value (Razzaghi et al., 2020). Figure 8 indicates that the number of
    research papers on DI techniques is higher than that on sensor-based irrigation
    management, which can be attributed to its simplicity. In this section, the effect
    of this strategy on the water use efficiency and crop growth is compiled. FIGURE
    8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Distribution of papers according to irrigation
    management strategies (data from February 10, 2022) A moderate DI strategy covering
    75% of tomato ET in a semi-arid climate saved 28% of water and caused a moderate
    reduction in yield of approximately 16%, with an increase in soluble solid content
    of 8% (Lahoz et al., 2016). In semi-arid Mediterranean climate conditions, a higher
    level of DI with 50% tomato ETc represented water savings of 46%, and with 100%
    ETc restoration up to flowering and then 50% ETc restoration treatment, average
    water savings of 30% were attained. The treatments improved the tomato quality
    in terms of vitamin C content, soluble solid content, and titratable acidity,
    while they did not considerably influence the marketable yield (Patanè et al.,
    2011). To minimize yield loss, controlled deficit irrigation (CDI) represents
    an attractive substitute because it seeks to maximize the use of water stress
    only in the noncritical phase of plant development (Kassaye et al., 2020); for
    example, during the fruit set, growth, or repining phase, the irrigation amount
    can be reduced (Nuruddin et al., 2003). An effective use of CDI requires a good
    comprehension of detailed crop growth phases showing tolerance to water stress
    (Farré & Faci, 2009; Kirda et al., 2004; Navarro et al., 2010). As proof of concept,
    in a semi-arid climate, the effect of mild (100%–75% ETc) and moderate (100%–50%
    ETc) CDI on the agronomic performance of processing tomato was analysed in two
    growing areas. The findings indicated that with moderate levels of CDI, an average
    water saving of 26% was achieved, and productivity was reduced on average by 10%,
    which is better than what was found in DI. Mild CDI levels did not alter productivity
    and still resulted in water savings of 13% (Valcárcel et al., 2020). On the other
    hand, reducing the irrigation to 75% or 50% of tomato ETc after the fruit set
    phase had no significant impact on the accumulation of carotenoids, while it increased
    the levels of polyphenol and L-ascorbic acid content (Martí et al., 2018). Deficit-irrigated
    potatoes have been studied by various researchers. For example, in experiments
    conducted in Prosser, Washington, USA, it was found that covering 70% of potato
    ETc demonstrated negative effects on tuber yield and quality (Alva, 2008). Similar
    results were found by Shock and Feibert (2012) in Oregon, USA. In the dry Mediterranean
    climate, continuous DI of processing potato covering 80% of ETc after plant establishment
    allowed the preservation of tuber yield and dry matter content with the possibility
    of saving 17% of irrigated water (Darwish et al., 2006). Similarly, water savings
    of up to 195 mm were obtained without any reduction in potato total yield by wetting
    the top 50% of the root zone (Nimah, 2010). In contrast, CDI potato experiments
    in a semi-arid climate proved that applying water shortages during the bulking
    and ripening periods had a negative effect on yield (Fabeiro et al., 2001). DI
    wheat studies showed that the highest water savings of approximately 39% were
    obtained in the alternate deficit treatment (nonirrigation during the jointing
    to shooting and flowering to soft dough stages of the wheat growth period), which
    have less adverse impacts on yield. Applying irrigation only in the first joint
    and anthesis stages results in the maximum water savings with less dramatic yield
    reduction (16%) (Xue et al., 2006). Grain yield was found to be affected by the
    DI approach, where it can be decreased in continuous DI (Rady et al., 2021). In
    contrast, it can be improved by applying CDI (Zhang et al., 2006). Combining the
    raised-bed planting method of wheat with DI treatment improves the grain yield
    (Rady et al., 2021). Likewise, decreasing the irrigation of Pêra-IAC sweet orange
    to 50% ETc maintained the fruit yield above an acceptable level compared to the
    control treatment and increased it compared to the rainfed treatment, with a maximum
    water use efficiency of approximately 33.5 kg mm−1 ha−1 (Silveira et al., 2020).
    Some examples of DI treatments on water use efficiency and crop production are
    presented in Table 2. The crop yield reduction using CDI depends on the crop and
    climate conditions. TABLE 2. Examples of deficit irrigation treatments on the

    Water resources are limited on earth. Thus, the utilization techniques of water
    need to be managed urgently. Different smart and conventional techniques have
    been used to reduce irrigated water, including SMS controllers, ET controllers,
    RS, optical sensors, and DI. Smart irrigation devices were developed to minimize
    excess irrigation by measuring or estimating the SMC or CWSI. In this review,
    the effects of the abovementioned approaches on water savings and crop production
    have been compiled. The literature provides evidence that smart irrigation controllers,
    especially weather-based (ET) and on-site SMS versus manual irrigation, conserve
    water across a variety of scenarios. The following is a summary of the most significant
    results and possible future research work: The water use efficiency based on SMS
    depends on the VMC threshold value set by the farmers. SMS controllers have been
    shown to save 20%–92% of water. ET controllers have been shown to save 20–71%
    of water. The performance of ET controllers is impacted by the precision of ET0
    estimations. RS have been shown to save 7%–50% of water. Crop growth was maintained
    using the reviewed strategies. The optical sensor-based system was demonstrated
    to have more abilities to assess the field variability of crops and soil than
    the on-site measurements. Crop yield decrease using CDI was less than 25% with
    water savings of 13%. Applying smart irrigation technologies to large varieties
    of consumable crops worldwide, such as tomatoes and potatoes, should be further
    studied in the future. Further research is needed related to the evaluation of
    the economic viability of the irrigation techniques studied. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

    Introduction Food security is a complex multidimensional phenomenon encompassed
    by the key dimensions of food availability, access, utilization, and stability
    of food supply for all people (FAO 2010). A country’s food security status is
    the sum of its citizens’ food security situation. Thus, food security is a global
    concern facing nowadays many challenges such as climate change, population growth,
    economic development, and the change in diet which consequently are putting pressure
    on resource availability (FAO 2020a). Climate change resulting in different weather
    patterns can threaten food production as both plant and animal productivity are
    affected. Crop yields are reduced, infectious diseases and pests are prevailing,
    frequent occurrence of environmental contaminants and chemical residues are observed
    along the food chain hampering food safety and security (FAO 2020b). As stated
    by the United Nations, the world’s population is expected to increase by 2 billion
    people in the next decades, from 7.7 billion in 2020 to 9.7 billion in 2050 (United
    Nations Homepage 2020a) with a subsequent required increase of 60% in food production
    by then (FAO 2020a). However, an estimated 821 million people worldwide suffered
    from hunger in 2018, making hunger and malnutrition among the biggest risks to
    health. From a wider perspective, it is assessed that more than 2 billion people
    do not have consistent access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food, including
    not only those suffering from hunger but also those who are affected by moderate
    levels of food insecurity (United Nations Homepage 2020b). Agricultural food production
    is a resource-intensive activity accounting for 70% of global water withdrawal
    including the need for irrigation, livestock, and aquaculture (FAO Aquastat Homepage
    2020). Besides, approximately 75% of all industrial water withdrawals were used
    for energy production in 2014 (United Nations Homepage 2020c) and 25% of the energy
    used worldwide is utilized for food production and supply (FAO 2020a). Therefore,
    it is evident that traditional agricultural systems are insufficient to meet the
    increasing food demand. Consequently, there is an urgent need for a transition
    to sustainable and precision agriculture taking advantage of the technological
    progress to increase crop productivity while preserving the existing resources.
    Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) and smart greenhouses are key solutions
    to overcome these challenges as they can optimize crop production by manipulating
    the indoor climate while mitigating the climate change effect (Ouammi et al. 2020a).
    Moreover, they offer effective energy and water management solutions optimizing
    resource input while there have been recently developed innovative systems reaching
    nearly zero energy consumption and pesticide use with minimum water consumption
    (Bersani et al. 2020). Finally, the smart grid can play a significant role in
    enhancing the sustainable energy supply (Ouammi et al. 2020b). The term Controlled
    Environment Agriculture (CEA) refers to the growth and development of plants in
    a fully controlled environment with the use of modern horticultural techniques
    and technological advances resulting in achieving higher yields and improving
    product quality (Gómez et al. 2019). On the other hand, greenhouses are structures
    with transparent materials in which the microclimatic parameters are also modified
    to enhance plant growth and productivity and ensure all-year-round production
    (Shrawan Singh et al. 2008). CEA is a broader term that includes greenhouses,
    rooftop greenhouses, growth chambers, plant factories as well as vertical farms.
    This paper focuses on the technological advances in the greenhouse sector worldwide
    as well as in Qatar, as food production in the country is mainly realized in open
    fields and greenhouses. Qatar is a small country in terms of land area located
    in the Arabian Gulf with an arid desert climate. The available land and resources
    are limited; therefore, the country was importing 90% of its food basket products
    until 2017 (Miniaoui et al. 2018). Agricultural food production in Qatar faces
    many challenges such as scarce freshwater, limited arable land and a climate that
    is not favoring agriculture as the summers are long, hot, and humid with low annual
    rainfall and often dust storms. Nonetheless, food security is a national priority
    for the State of Qatar and the government has launched many initiatives to boost
    local agricultural production while reducing its import dependency. Therefore,
    in the last decade between 2010 and 2019, the greenhouse and open field production
    of the most consumed vegetables in the country has increased from 31.573 tons
    to 66.500 tons, recording an approximate 110% increase (Planning and Statistics
    Authority in Qatar 2020a, 2014). Moreover, the Qatar greenhouse market is a developing
    sector, expected to mark double-digit growth during the near future and reach
    a value of approximately 259 million US$ by 2025 (Expert market research Homepage
    2020). The research method of this study includes a thorough review of the scholarly
    literature as well as data from gray literature (e.g., reports, discussion articles,
    policy documents) and databases (e.g., FAOSTAT, World Bank) from Qatar and other
    countries. The search included all the documents that were indexed up to the year
    2015, so only recent studies were considered on the development of greenhouses
    and technologies worldwide as well as for the greenhouse sector development in
    Qatar. Hence, the present paper provides an overview of the current status of
    greenhouse technology, aiming to offer effective supporting information to decision
    and policymakers as well as overall professionals and end-users in introducing
    new technologies and benefiting from the advances in monitoring techniques, artificial
    intelligence and communication infrastructure in the agricultural sector. Then,
    it focuses on Qatar, with the main objective to present a comprehensive understanding
    framework of the actual greenhouse development in the country, able to support
    the transition to sustainable precision agriculture meeting the country’s food
    security and sustainability goals. Specifically, this review paper: analyzes the
    actual development of greenhouses and technologies worldwide (Sect. 2); elaborates
    on smart greenhouses in the food-energy-water nexus focusing on the energy and
    water resources (Sect. 3); gives an overview of the greenhouse sector development
    in Qatar by analyzing the actual agriculture situation and examining its potential
    development regarding the existing drivers and barriers (Sect. 4); and presents
    the policy measures already implemented in Qatar while analyzing the future development
    of the local greenhouse sector in terms of sustainability and resources saving
    perspective as well as its penetration into Qatar’s economy (Sect. 5). 2 Actual
    development of greenhouses and technologies Global challenges linked to population
    growth, urbanization, and climate change have led to bringing innovative features
    to conventional greenhouse cultivation techniques (Specht et al. 2019). In fact,
    over the past few years, the greenhouse industry has been transformed to include
    modern technologies allowing farmers to grow a consistent product all year round
    using far fewer resources than conventional production (Tuomisto 2019). The main
    part of this transformation is the introduction of vertical systems that have
    been proposed as a concept to address the issue of sustainability (Graamans et
    al. 2018) and as a solution to improving food production involving land and water
    use optimization (Kalantari et al. 2020; Benke and Tomkins 2017; Bao et al. 2018;
    Yeşil and Tatar 2020). Vertical systems consist of growing crops in vertically
    stacked layers under a protected environment to limit the use of the agricultural
    land and therefore the ecological footprint of agriculture (Anda and Shear 2017).
    This concept, in addition to other major advances, has not only transformed the
    greenhouse industry but also led to new farming methods such as hydroponics (Al-Kodmany
    2018), as well as the introduction and widespread adoption of full automation
    technologies and advanced lighting techniques. 2.1 Full automation technologies
    Currently, greenhouse crop production is facing increased demand for automation
    and robotics. In fact, although the initial reason for using greenhouses was to
    grow crops in controlled environments, today the integration of smart systems
    can reduce reliance on labor and increase profitability while ensuring efficiency
    and sustainability. In this context, enormous progress has been made in the automation
    of greenhouses, mainly based on environmental sensors that play a key role in
    the programmed operation. Indeed, smart greenhouse solutions incorporating advanced
    sensor technologies have become widely used for crop growth environment monitoring.
    For example, different sensors of various environmental parameters have been used
    to support a greenhouse monitoring system consisting of a Programmable Logic Controller
    (PLC) and a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system which are
    different layers of automation in a system known as the Automation Pyramid (AP)
    (Ding et al. 2018). The different sensors and machines can communicate with each
    other by exchanging data, the so-called Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS).
    These systems can fit into the existing farm decision-making tools and particular
    in the production processes as the database and information they offer is precise
    and constantly updated thus creating transparency in multifactorial decisions.
    A camera has been also used as part of the imaging platform of a greenhouse powdery
    mildew detection machine vision system (Wspanialy and Moussa 2016). Furthermore,
    huge steps forward have been also made in the field of Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) as an effective solution to many problems associated with the conventional
    cabled sensors (Oliveira et al. 2016; Cenedese et al. 2012). Moreover, WSN has
    been developed under the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm, by integrating web-based
    technologies, providing thus an interface to view the greenhouse status and remotely
    control the environmental parameters (Li et al. 2017a; Akkaş and Sokullu 2017;
    Danita et al. 2018). As an illustration, different sensors ranging from simple
    (temperature, humidity, pH, illumination, pressure, UV, CO2, wind speed, solar
    radiation (Jahnavi and Ahamed 2015; Thirukkuralkani et al. 2018; Jiang et al.
    2016; Erazo-Rodas et al. 2018) to complex [cameras (Hwang and Yoe 2016), mid-infrared
    spectroscopy (Wang et al. 2016)] have been used, and their measurements were communicated
    wirelessly to the host system using several technologies such as Zigbee (Chen
    et al. 2016a, 2017; Xing et al. 2017; Raheemah et al. 2016; Pascual et al. 2015;
    Luo et al. 2016; Liu and Bi 2017; Aiello et al. 2018; Rao et al. 2016; Ismail
    et al. 2016; Ibayashi et al. 2016; Erazo, et al. 2015; Çaylı et al. 2017), radio
    (Liang-Ying and Zhao-Wei, 2015; Achour et al. 2018; Mahbub 2020), GSM/GPRS (Liang-Ying
    and Zhao-Wei, 2015; Liu and Zhang 2017; Navarro-Hellín et al. 2015; Mat et al.
    2016), 3G/4G (Zhou and Duan 2016; Chung et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2015), Wi-Fi
    (Aiello et al. 2018; Chung et al. 2015; Mohapatra and Lenka 2016; Liang et al.
    2018a) and Bluetooth (Hong and Hsieh 2016; Taşkın et al. 2018). However, to keep
    the greenhouse automation trouble-free, a secure protocol for wireless sensor
    networks has been proposed in the automated agricultural environment and has allowed
    more reliability (Sivamani et al. 2018). The WSN’s sensed data are processed and
    then used as multi-inputs to drive advanced control algorithms-based artificial
    intelligence to manage intelligently the greenhouse internal microclimate and
    to optimize the use of water and energy. These controllers can also vary from
    simple, such as feedback controllers (Mekki et al. 2015; Maher et al. 2016; Pawlowski
    et al. 2017), to modern ones such as fuzzy logic controllers (Rahmawati et al.
    2018; Alpay and Erdem 2018; Xu et al. 2016; Pahuja et al. 2015; Márquez-Vera et
    al. 2016; Chen et al. 2016b; Wang and Zhang 2018; Li et al. 2017b, 2018; Ben Ali
    et al. 2018; Faouzi et al. 2017; Carrasquilla-Batista and Chacon-Rodrıguez 2017),
    artificial neural networks (Nicolosi et al. 2017; Huang et al. 2018; Francik and
    Kurpaska 2020; Singh 2017; Hongkang et al. 2018; Moon et al. 2018; Taki et al.
    2016), genetic algorithms (Wang et al. 2017a; Mahdavian and Wattanapongsakorn
    2017), model predictive controllers (Ouammi et al. 2020b; Liang et al. 2018b;
    Hamza and Ramdani 2020), sliding controllers (Khelifa et al. 2020; Oubehar, et
    al. 2016), adaptative controllers (Essahafi and Lafkih 2018), frequency controllers
    (Bagheri Sanjareh et al. 2021), and receding horizon controllers based on prioritized
    multi-operational ranges (Singhal et al. 2020). Nevertheless, although WSN has
    been widely implemented as an automation technology offering numerous benefits,
    the research on applied robotics has also grown recently attaching great importance
    to mobile sensing as a sustainable solution for cost improvement (Li et al. 2019a;
    Roldán et al. 2016). On this basis, an autonomous mobile robot was developed to
    map the greenhouse and collect humidity, temperature, and light data (Durmus et
    al. 2016). Another improved robot, comprising ground and aerial vehicles, has
    been proposed to measure the temperature, humidity, luminosity, and carbon dioxide
    concentration in the ground and at different heights of the greenhouse (Roldán
    et al. 2016). However, robotic systems have not been used only for environmental
    monitoring, but also to perform greenhouse unsafe tasks like the UV-C treatment
    against powdery mildew (Mazar et al. 2018). In fact, robotic systems have been
    designed to help labor tasks such as pesticide spraying with path-planning and
    traveling-control abilities (Nakao et al. 2017; Mahmud et al. 2019), transplanting
    (Han et al. 2018), fertilizing (Yuan et al. 2016), phenotyping (Atefi et al. 2019)
    and harvesting (Wang et al. 2017b; Arad et al. 2020; Woo et al. 2020). In addition,
    they have been tightly related to image-based detection algorithms and near-infrared
    spectroscopy, and therefore, to crop disease detection (Rizk and Habib 2018; Schor
    et al. 2016, 2017), classification and picking (Zhao et al. 2016; Feng et al.
    2015). But despite the fast development of these greenhouse robotic systems, there
    are several research challenges concerning the supervision, control and optimization
    of robots that must be addressed to ensure the competitiveness of this sector.
    Several steps have been made towards optimizing robots’ efficacy, for example,
    heuristic and genetic algorithms have been implemented to reduce the duration
    of type-c ultraviolet radiation treatment performed by a battery-powered robot
    (Mazar et al. 2020). Moreover, a green pepper recognition method based on the
    least-squares support vector machine optimized by the improved particle swarm
    optimization (IPSO-LSSVM) has been proposed (Ji et al. 2019). And finally, a greenhouse
    layout optimization system that enables rapid and safe robot navigation has been
    developed (Uyeh et al. 2019). 2.2 Hydroponics The introduction of hydroponics
    may be taken as a significant advance in modern greenhouses, where crops are grown
    in a soil-free environment, using only mineral nutrient solutions in water. The
    hydroponic techniques used to this end are mainly the deep flow technique (DFT)
    and nutrient film technique (NFT) (Son et al. 2020). Regarding the first one,
    panels are floating in a container filled with nutrient solution (10–20 cm deep),
    while for the second, a nutrient solution flows from the upper end to the lower
    end and passes through troughs of about 10 cm placed on trays at a slope of 0.5–2%.
    Generally, the choice of the DFT or NFT hydroponic system does not lead to important
    changes under greenhouse conditions (Santos et al. 2019). Nevertheless, DFT allowed
    an increase of 2.6 g in fresh weight of fresh basil compared to plants grown in
    NFT systems (Walters and Currey 2015). Overall, compared to conventional greenhouses,
    hydroponics offers several advantages such as: improving the quality and nutrient
    content, increasing yield and conserving water. It has been documented in the
    literature that various plant species have been found to have better characteristics
    when grown hydroponically. For example, hydroponic strawberries were higher in
    terms of fruit yield and plant survival rate compared to systems traditionally
    grown in soil (Treftz and Omaye 2016). In addition, for hydroponic lettuce, the
    technique has offered 11 ± 1.7 times higher yields and 13 ± 2.7 times less water,
    but required 82 ± 11 times more energy compared to conventionally produced lettuce
    (Barbosa et al. 2015). However, to deal with the high-energy consumption issue,
    an innovative hydroponic greenhouse and a new solar air heater with latent storage
    energy have been assessed and have allowed an annual energy production reduction
    of over 4600 kWh. The innovation of this work is to guarantee an enhanced hydroponic
    greenhouse microclimate through a pilot unit with latent thermal storage using
    exclusively solar energy (Baddadi et al. 2019). 2.3 Advanced lighting techniques
    The adoption of supplemental artificial lighting systems is a key solution providing
    important progress in modern greenhouses promoting agricultural production. Commonly,
    high-pressure sodium (HPS) lamps have been widely used as the main supplemental
    light source in greenhouses, because of their high electrical efficiency and high
    photosynthetically active radiation emission (Viršilė et al. 2017). However, recent
    developments have given rise to light-emitting diode (LED) due to their technological
    advantages, especially in terms of spectral output, light distribution, heat emission,
    lifespan, and control capabilities (Iersel 2017; Alsanius et al. 2017). In the
    literature, numerous comparative studies have been carried out to assess the effectiveness
    of each technology. For instance, three are different types of lighting, namely
    HPS standard lighting, HPS top lighting and LED inter-lighting, and 100% LED lighting
    have been tested in a lettuce greenhouse, and the results indicated that the efficiency
    of light use was the highest in the 100% LED combination and the lowest in HPS
    (Kowalczyk et al. 2020). Also, a comparison of 1000 W HPS lighting system versus
    650 W LED lighting system has shown that LED lighting has 38%-47% less environmental
    impact in terms of global warming, ozone depletion, and acidification than HPS
    lighting system (Zhang et al. 2017). In fact, supplemental lighting by light-emitting
    diodes (LED) has shown further benefits in other studies, such as improving water
    use efficiency of greenhouse crops (Li et al. 2019b), increasing fruit weight
    and size (Paucek et al. 2020), enhancing lettuce growth and yield (Zhang et al.
    2019) and reducing energy consumption (Wang and Wei 1956). In addition, extra
    studies have been conducted to determine the effects of LED colors on crop production,
    such as for lettuce where supplemental lighting with 80% red and 20% blue light
    has proven to be advantageous (Długosz-Grochowska et al. 2017), as well as for
    the artichoke where seedlings under red light condition were much better (Rabara
    et al. 2017). Furthermore, another important step consistent with the research
    is the design of an intelligent hybrid system for greenhouse plants by 3D supplementary
    lighting, which can be auto switched to sunlight or LED depending on weather conditions.
    This last has shown the ability to accelerate vegetables and fruits’ growth rate
    (Tang et al. 2019). 3 Smart greenhouses in the food-energy-water nexus Due to
    the intensive exploitation of energy, water, and food resources, induced by population
    growth and rapid urbanization, increasing interest has been given to the preservation
    of these resources and leading to the introduction of the food-energy-water nexus
    (FEW) as an approach to the sustainable development of agriculture among other
    practices (Li et al. 2019c). The FEW nexus is a holistic approach to the resources
    of food, energy and water examining their interrelatedness and interdependencies
    rather than considering each resource individually (United Nations University
    2022). Hence, sustainable FEW systems can be defined as systems that can meet
    their food, energy, and water demands with sustainable sources rather than using
    non-renewable inputs. They aim at effective management of natural resources, optimization
    of potential conflicts and reinforcement of multisectoral integration (Lahlou
    et al. 2020; El-gafy 2017). In this context, agricultural technologies like smart
    greenhouses have been increasingly encouraged as means to achieve regional food
    security and reduce the stress on water and energy resources. They can be considered
    as FEW systems able to yield food while minimizing energy and water consumption
    and maximizing economic productivity (Karan et al. 2018). As part of this paradigm,
    a decision-making framework based on the approach of the FEW nexus for the development
    of new greenhouses has been introduced and has led to a reduction in CO2 emissions
    and an economy of water resources (Al-Ansari et al. 2018). In addition, a novel
    decision-making methodology in greenhouse cultivation has been proposed using
    the FEW nexus approaches, which assesses the investment and operating costs and
    the potential for global warming, for food production based on economic and environmental
    performance (Namany et al. 2019). Moreover, an approach based on both GIS, analytical
    hierarchy process and resource assessment has been proposed to improve water and
    energy efficiencies (Haji et al. 2020). However, the performance of the FEW nexus
    has been conventionally analyzed through energy and water indicators. 3.1 Energy
    considerations in smart greenhouses From the energy viewpoint, smart greenhouses
    focus consideration on integrating different types of renewable energy to support
    sustainable growth. Solar energy remains the primary renewable source used to
    generate electricity in greenhouses to economically meet the electrical load of
    any actuating machine. Solar technologies used for this purpose can be divided
    into three categories: photovoltaic systems, solar thermal collectors, and hybrid
    photovoltaic/thermal (PV/T) modules. Classically, solar thermal collectors have
    been adopted in greenhouses to accumulate the maximum amount of solar energy (Patil
    and Gawande 2016; Awani et al. 2015), especially for drying purposes, where their
    use has allowed a remarkable reduction in drying hours from 24 to 17 h for red
    pepper compared to open sun drying (ELkhadraoui et al. 2015). As for photovoltaic
    systems, they have also been highly integrated into greenhouse applications to
    cater in a clean way to energy-consuming activity (Trypanagnostopoulos et al.
    2017; Marucci and Cappuccini 2016; Fatnassi et al. 2015; Marucci et al. 2018;
    Gao et al. 2019). Moreover, by combining these two technologies, photovoltaic/thermal
    (PV/T) systems have gained popularity by increasing the use of solar energy (Good
    2016; Achour and Zejli 2018; Kim et al. 2016). They have been used for several
    greenhouse applications such as crop drying (Tiwari and Tiwari 2016a, b; Shyam
    et al. 2015; Tiwari et al. 2018, 2016a) and biogas heating (Tiwari and Tiwari
    2017; Tiwari et al. 2016b). Differently, another example of renewable energy implemented
    in greenhouses is geothermal energy. It consists of circulating fluid in the depths
    of the earth to use its underground temperature as a source of energy. Its employment
    in greenhouses includes space heating and cooling, agricultural drying, and ground-source
    heating pumps (GSHP) (Ha et al. 2015; Roumi et al. 2017; Ozturk 2017; Andritsos
    et al. 2015; Papachristou et al. 2016; Urbancl et al. 2016). In addition, the
    implementation of energy supply optimization strategies is another aspect of efficiently
    improving the water, energy, and food security in greenhouses. The optimization
    strategies have varied from feedback conventional controllers to advanced ones
    based on artificial intelligence such as: fuzzy logic controllers (Su et al. 2017),
    hybrid particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithms (Chen et al. 2015),
    model predictive controllers (Ouammi et al. 2020a, b; Lin et al. 2020) and optimal
    controllers (Beveren et al. 2015, Beveren et al. 2020; Singh et al. 2015). Their
    common goal is to maximize production yield by tracking the desired trajectories
    of the controlled variables while minimizing the use of available water and energy
    resources. In another way, the optimization of energy consumption can be done
    by implementing high-tech solutions that facilitate the development of smart greenhouses.
    In this context, new innovative hardware technologies have been studied to ensure
    the safe and sustainable use of resources such as LED and novel covering materials.
    In fact, recent developments have opened a new perspective for LEDs as a light
    source technology having more technical advantages for greenhouse cultivation
    over traditional light sources, in terms of high-energy efficiency, low maintenance
    cost and longevity (Singh et al. 2015). In addition, innovative covering materials
    have gained a significant amount of attention in the research community as promising
    technologies. By way of illustration, a material based on TiO2 mixed with low-density
    polyethylene in the form of heterogeneous granules, developed as an alternative
    material to face up to the high heating and cooling energy requirements showed
    improved thermal insulation characteristics (Kavga et al. 2018). In addition,
    a feasibility study of many combinations of different types of glass with different
    types of F-Clean plastic films showed that the double covering material has high
    insulation levels, saving 50% energy compared to single glass (Kempkes et al.
    2017). While considering the energy needs of a greenhouse it is important to include
    the energy demands for the desalination of water for irrigation purposes. The
    salinization of water resources is a progressive phenomenon mostly affecting coastal
    and delta areas, as well as arid and semi-arid regions. This is due to natural
    and anthropogenic sources such as climate change and overexploitation of groundwater
    resources (Mastrocicco and Colombani 2021). Especially in the case of hydroponics,
    the regulation of salinity levels is imperative as it can detrimentally affect
    plant growth and development. Although desalination increases water resources
    and improves water quality, the general problem with this process is the relatively
    high-energy requirement and the associated CO2 emissions in the case of conventional
    energy supply (Hussein and Lambert 2020). Specifically, the energy required to
    desalinate seawater could be between 2.5 and 4 kW-h/m3 (Pearce 2008) depending
    on salinity levels and other factors, such as operating conditions, prevailing
    temperature, recovery, etc. 3.2 Water considerations in smart greenhouses From
    a water-saving point of view, although there is consensus that smart greenhouses
    are sustainable in terms of their water use, they remain undoubtedly the sector
    of activity where the consumption of irrigation water is very intensive. For that,
    smart greenhouses are challenged to save more water without compromising their
    economic viability (Warner et al. 2020), by adopting effective management strategies
    aiming at conserving water while maintaining satisfactory production and water
    use efficiency levels. Smart greenhouse water management techniques include water
    conservation practices (Warner et al. 2018), scheduling strategies (Nikolaou et
    al. 2019) and desalination processes (Kabeel and El-Said 2015; Martínez-Alvarez
    et al. 2016). Regarding water conservation practices, drip irrigation was the
    method justifying the most efficient use of water and has been widely used for
    many species, like tomato (HongJun et al. 2015), muskmelon (Li et al. 2016), pepper
    (Sharma et al. 2017; Rameshwaran et al. 2016), sugar beet (Kiymaz and Ertek 2015)
    and cotton (He et al. 2018). In fact, dispensing small amounts of water at high
    frequencies has shown a significant increase in water use efficiency (Yao et al.
    2019), but greater efficiency has been achieved with water pillow irrigation.
    The latter is a new irrigation method incorporating mulching techniques to drip
    irrigation through flexible plastic pipes (Fang et al. 2018). In this context,
    many studies have been carried out to assess the superiorities of water pillow
    irrigation over the drip irrigation method under greenhouse conditions. For example,
    for the tomato crop, the exploitation of water pillows has proven to have more
    efficient water use by saving 52% of water compared to drip irrigation (Gerçek
    et al. 2017; Altunlu et al. 2017). As well as for eggplant, the use of colored
    water pillows and mulching treatments has demonstrated a decrease in the irrigation
    water amounts of 22% and 16%, respectively (Gerçek and Demirkaya 2020). For lettuce
    also, the results suggested that using plastic film mulching was interesting for
    increasing the biological water use efficiency (Chen, et al. 2019). Overall, the
    benefits of the mulching effect in maintaining the water amount in the root area
    made this technique yield better outcomes than drip irrigation regarding crop
    water consumption and irrigation water use efficiency. Always within the framework
    of water conservation practices, an alternative water source for greenhouse crop
    production is the use of rainwater harvesting systems that are demonstrated to
    reduce the consumption from the water supply network by 80–90% in the case of
    a rooftop greenhouse. Otherwise, for a standard greenhouse, the application of
    drainage water blended with water of low electrical conductivity has allowed savings
    of 17% of the water in comparison to the standard nutrient solution treatment
    (García-Caparrós et al. 2018a, b). Also, deficit irrigation, defined as an optimization
    strategy consisting of irrigating the root zone with water below the evapotranspiration
    requirements (Aly et al. 2015), has proved to be a success in water saving for
    a wide range of crops. Indeed, many studies have been carried out to investigate
    the effects of applying different amounts of water on crop yield and water use
    efficiency under greenhouse conditions. A summary of the most recent studies,
    since 2015, is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Works carried out on the impact of
    irrigation regimes on water use efficiency (WUE) under greenhouse conditions Full
    size table However, to further improve water conservation techniques, greenhouse
    irrigation scheduling has been widely promoted as an effective tool in attempting
    to prevent water wastage. The main technique used for this purpose is the use
    of soil and plant sensors (Çakir et al. 2017). Indeed, although several technological
    innovations based mainly on thermal infrared imaging systems have been introduced
    in humidity sensors (Wang et al. 2020), the tensiometer remains the most common
    sensor due to its low cost, simplicity of use, high accuracy, and direct measurement
    of matric potential (Garcia-Caparros et al. 2107; Montesano et al. 2015; Contreras
    et al. 2017). It offers a better use of the water resource without being influenced
    by the temperature and the osmotic potential of the soil (Buttaro et al. 2015).
    The main interest of this functionality is to provide the opportunity to integrate
    tensiometer based sensor networks in the classic irrigation systems, like what
    was reported in numerous researches carried out on wireless sensor networks, proving
    this to be an alternative way to solve the water resources optimization and to
    support the decision making (Hamouda and Elhabil 2017; Harun et al. 2015; Montesano
    et al. 2018; Nawandar and Satpute 2019; Lea-Cox et al. 2017; Khan et al. 2018;
    Ferentinos et al. 2017; Silva et al. 2018). Besides, the tensiometer demonstrated
    the ability to assist the development of smart autonomous precise irrigation control
    systems that can lead considerably surpass the conventional approach in terms
    of water consumption (Angelopoulos et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2015). A resource-saving
    method as it maximizes overall output and minimizes the use of space, soil, water,
    and other resources is hydroponics, a soilless cultivation technique. Hydroponic
    crop production apart from the low land and chemical fertilizers use, requires
    less water as the nutrient solution can be recirculated. Hence, the hydroponic
    production of lettuce can result in 64% water savings than the soil cultivation
    (Majid et al. 2021) or even higher, as it needs 13 ± 2.7 times less water compared
    to conventionally produced lettuce (Barbosa et al. 2015). Fully automated hydroponic
    systems for smart farming (Shetty et al. 2021) and the use of internet of thing
    (IoT) technology (Aliac and Maravillas 2018), results in even less amount of water
    resource consumption when compared to traditional methods. Further water use optimization
    in hydroponics can be realized by the implementation of the circular economy concept.
    A two-level cascade cultivation system using the drainage solution of a primary
    crop to irrigate a secondary crop significantly improved water use efficiency
    as it reduced by approximately 30% the freshwater consumption of the second crop
    plants in comparison to plants irrigated with freshwater (Elvanidi et al. 2020).
    4 Overview of greenhouses development in Qatar 4.1 Market growth Qatar is a small
    peninsula with a set of islands located in the Arabian Gulf with a total area
    of approximately 11.628 km2 including the islands (Planning and Statistics Authority
    in Qatar 2013a). Food production faces many challenges in hot arid countries like
    Qatar, which is marked by sparse rainfall with an annual average of 83.4 mm in
    2019, high temperatures in summer (> 45°C) starting from June till the middle
    of September, high humidity and strong winds as reported in Figs. 1 and 2 (Homepage
    2020). The harsh climate, the limited freshwater availability with the dependency
    on the desalination treatment as well as the limited available arable land, with
    65.000 ha or 5.6% of the total area being arable (Al Yousef et al. 2000) are reflected
    in the limited agricultural sector in the country, which provided 0.2% of Qatar’s
    GDP in 2019 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2018). Fig. 1 Hourly temperature
    (°C) and wind speed (km/h) in Qatar in 2019 (Homepage 2020) Full size image Fig.
    2 Hourly humidity (%), pressure (kPa) and visibility (km) in Qatar in 2019 (Homepage
    2020) Full size image The main component driving the progress of the greenhouse
    market in Qatar is the capability to maximize crop production contrasted to the
    traditional cultivation practices. To expand the self-sufficiency of agricultural
    production, the need for greenhouses has been increasing in Qatar. As Qatar has
    a harsh climate throughout the year, consequently, new technologies, methods and
    practices are introduced to ensure the quality the continuous crop production
    as well as increase their conservation periods. Furthermore, the Ministry of Municipality
    and Environment (MME) declared 34 new strategic investment projects-based greenhouses
    technology in 2018 (Gulf Times Homepage 2020). Additionally, the adoption of hydroponic
    greenhouse and the collaborations with Spanish companies in Qatar have offered
    a variety of valuable businesses in the country (Businesswire Homepage 2020).
    On the other side, many factors like an elevated investment and import-dependent
    agriculture in Qatar favour the expansion of the market. Therefore, the Qatar
    greenhouse market reached a value of US$ 97.9 million in 2018, a value of 112
    million US$ in 2019, and it is anticipated to mark a value of US$ 216 million
    by 2024 (IMARC Group Homepage 2020) as stated in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Greenhouse market
    evolution (million US$) from 2018 to 2024 in Qatar (IMARC Group Homepage 2020)
    Full size image More specifically, the cooled greenhouse area increased from 49
    ha in 2017 to 73 ha in 2018, with a subsequent increase in vegetable production
    from 4.814 tons to 6.500 tons in the same years (Table 2). Similarly, the no-cooled
    greenhouse area increased from 200 to 220 ha from 2017 to 2018 with an increase
    in vegetable production from 17 thousand tons to 20 thousand tons during the same
    period. The same trend is recorded for the open field vegetable cultivation where
    the cropped and production area increased from 1,910 ha to 2,484 ha and from 33,000
    tons to 36,000 tons, respectively. Therefore, according to Table 2, the total
    vegetable production in Qatar has been significantly increased within one year
    (2017–2018) from 54,814 tons to 62,500 tons and it is noteworthy that the land-use
    efficiency, in terms of land resource input and production output varies among
    the three crop production systems. In the case of vegetable greenhouse production,
    the land-use efficiency is much higher when compared to open field cultivation.
    However, there are small differences between the cooled and the non-cooled greenhouse
    production. Table 2 Vegetable production area (ha) and production amount (tons)
    for greenhouse and open field cultivation in Qatar for 2017–2018 (Qatar International
    Islamic Bank 2019) Full size table According to market experts, the Qatar greenhouse
    market is a dynamic sector, and it is expected to mark double-digit growth during
    the next five years and reach a value of almost 259 million US$ by 2025 (Expert
    market research Homepage 2020). This trend is reflected in the increased domestic
    production of vegetables in the country, as shown in Fig. 4. During the last decade,
    the greenhouse and open field production of the most consumed vegetables, like
    tomatoes, cucumber, marrows, eggplants, lettuce, and green pepper, has increased
    from 31,573 tons in 2010 to 75,063 tons in 2020, marking an approximate 138% increase.
    It should be highlighted that after 2017, domestic vegetable production has more
    than doubled, reaching a more than 100% increase within three years, from 2017
    to 2020 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2020a, 2014). The main driver
    behind this remarkable increase in local food production was a 3.5-year land,
    air and sea blockade imposed on Qatar by neighboring countries and allies in the
    region between June 2017 and January 2021, making the issue of food security a
    fundamental national security concern. Till then, the state of Qatar imported
    approximately 90% of its foodstuffs from other countries while 27.4% of the imports
    came from the blockade imposing countries such as Saudi Arabia and the UAE (Miniaoui
    et al. 2018). After the blockade, Qatar was forced to develop new suppliers for
    food products and begin to implement local production of perishable goods such
    as vegetables and milk while nearly tripling local production (Collins 2018; Hassen
    and Bilali 2019). Self-sufficiency in many goods like meat, dairy products and
    vegetables has increased in the country since 2017 and although the blockade has
    ended, the government of Qatar together with the Ministry of Municipality and
    Environment has set solid targets to increase up to 70% self-sufficiency on greenhouse
    vegetables and reach the size of 110 hectares with high-tech greenhouses by 2023
    (Ministry of Municipalities and Environment 2020). Fig. 4 Production (tons) of
    main vegetables (greenhouse and open field cultivation) in Qatar over the period
    2010–2020 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2020a, 2014) Full size image
    The main companies and competitors in the Qatari greenhouse market are the NAAAS
    Agricultural Consulting & Greenhouse (Naaas Group), the Arab Qatari Agricultural
    Production Company (QTFA), the Qatari Agricultural Development Company (Agrico),
    the Al Rayyan Agricultural and final the Pergola Contracting & Green Houses company.
    4.2 Technologies implemented Greenhouse design in hot arid climates should tackle
    challenging climatic conditions such as the high temperature and humidity levels
    and the abundant sunshine. The types of greenhouses found in Qatar can be segmented
    into categories by the type, the used material and technology. Amongst free-standing
    and gutter-connected greenhouses, the latter represents the leading type, holding
    the largest share (IMARC Group Homepage 2020). As Qatar has mild winter, the most
    important function is cooling than heating and consequently, most greenhouses
    have cooling systems with the evaporative cooling system with pads and fans being
    the most frequently used. Moreover, the most common greenhouses in the country
    have plastic or net as covering material, instead of glass. This is because glass
    is mostly used in countries with colder climates since the temperature inside
    is higher than the ambient. The following three types of greenhouses could be
    distinguished according to the used technology: Low-tech: uncooled and unheated
    plastic houses or net houses. Mid-tech: greenhouses with evaporative cooling and
    with/without air-conditioning for night cooling. High-tech: computer-controlled
    greenhouse microclimate i.e., temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration and lighting.
    For Qatar, the most frequent types are the low-tech uncooled, reaching 220 ha
    total area, followed by the cooled greenhouses with 73 ha area, as shown in Table
    2. The number of high-tech greenhouses is gradually increasing with technologies
    adapted to the country’s specific geo-climatic conditions (Businesswire Homepage
    2020). Thus, CO2 enrichment of the greenhouse environment and artificial light
    are not common practices in Qatar, as most greenhouses are not fully closed, for
    ventilation purposes and sunshine is abundant. The methods of natural and forced
    ventilation and external shading are effective and low-cost ways to control the
    greenhouse climate in hot areas, with the most optimal method being the evaporative
    cooling pads (Ghani et al. 2019). However, the evaporating cooling method, has
    its limitations in the summer months, as the high levels of humidity are reducing
    its effectiveness (Hassabou and Khan 2019). Besides, this type of cooling requires
    a significant amount of water which in most cases exceeds the amount of water
    needed for irrigation purposes, especially during the hot season from April to
    June. According to the collaborative research report of important agricultural
    companies in the field of greenhouse crop production, fertilizer and plant products
    in Qatar, Agrico, Qatar Fertilizer Company (QAFCO) and Yara International ASA
    conducted in 2019 (Enikeeva and Khadra 2019), the low-tech net houses have low
    cost and a 10-month growing period per year for winter crops. However, the growing
    season can be extended in summer for crops like okra and melon. The mid-tech greenhouses
    have a growing period of 10 months per year; nonetheless, the air-conditioning
    night cooling function can extend the summer growing season. The most productive
    system is the multi-span plastic greenhouse equipped with evaporative cooling
    and air-conditioning for night cooling, which can reach a tomato yield of 33.2
    kg/m2, followed by the same type of greenhouse without night air-conditioning
    with a tomato yield of 29 kg/m2. Nevertheless, the first greenhouse type has a
    higher capital expenditure (CAPEX) compared to the latter, as shown in Table 3.
    Table 3 General characteristics of some of the different greenhouse types used
    in Qatar in 2019 (Enikeeva and Khadra 2019) Full size table Greenhouse cultivation
    includes soil and soilless cultivation systems, like hydroponics and recently
    in 2021, aquaponics. Soilless cultivation methods are more suitable for arid climates
    with limited arable land, like Qatar, as they overcome the limitations of soil
    and water availability. As agriculture is one of the main water consumers in Qatar,
    consuming almost 1/2 of the total gross water supplied by the water supply industry
    which is 310 out 671 million m3 per year in 2019 (Planning and Statistics Authority
    in Qatar 2019), water-saving hydroponic and aquaponic systems are a possible solution
    reducing agricultural water use (Barbosa et al. 2015). There are many pilot projects
    in Qatar initiated mainly by the Ministry of Municipality and Environment aiming
    to improve yields and consequently increase self-sufficiency in various crops
    (Qatar International Islamic Bank 2019). According to researchers, aquaponics
    is indeed a viable solution to address both food security and sustainability issues
    in the country but as is an emerging innovative system, it needs more research
    and development (Abusin and Mandikiana 2020). Nonetheless, it is a promising sector
    and the first aquaponic farm in Qatar by Agrico Agricultural Development started
    producing tilapia and lettuce in 2021 (Doha News Homepage 2022). 4.3 Capacity
    and potential development Greenhouse cultivation is an effective way of getting
    over the limitations in agricultural production in Qatar, which are the harsh
    climate and the resources scarcity of water, land, and soil. Therefore, the greenhouse
    sector has significant potential for development. This rise of course is following
    the country’s efforts to increase food and nutrition security by reducing at the
    same time import-dependent agriculture. Other factors that seem to favor the sector’s
    rise are economic welfare and population growth with a consequent increase in
    food demand. Qatar is among the richest countries in the world with a 66.622 US$
    GDP per capita and a 0.1% unemployment rate for 2019 (Focus Economics Homepage
    2020). The country has witnessed unceasing variations in the population size and
    its growth rates as reported in Fig. 5, showing the estimation of the yearly population
    growth (Planning and Statistics Authority of Qatar Homepage). According to the
    Planning and Statistics Authority of Qatar, the population has augmented to reach
    2.733.624 in September 2020; 1.969.032 of them being males and 754.592 females

    with the help of knowledge and innovation and the introduction of new techniques
    for modernizing the agricultural sector across the value chain. Greenhouse production
    can become smarter and less resource-intensive while integrating dynamic technologies
    such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and aquaponics and adapting advanced cooling
    technologies to increase crops’ shelf-life (Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
    in Doha 2019; Karanisa et al. 2021). The government’s attitude can enable the
    greenhouse sector to advance even further, in cooperation with educational institutes,
    researchers and the private sector on a national and international level. Thus,
    in summary, the following research areas could boost the agricultural sector and
    domestic production (GDA 2017) and subsequently achieve food security up to a
    certain level: (1) Greenhouse research on hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical
    farming. (2) Smart agriculture focused on increasing agricultural productivity.
    (3) Resources management research on soil, water, and energy to optimize their
    use avoiding depletion while enhancing conservation. (4) Marine, fisheries, and
    aquaculture research to develop innovative technologies to produce fishes, shrimps,
    seaweeds, etc. (5) New crop varieties that are heat and humidity-resistant and
    less water-intensive. (6) Post-harvest technology to increase crops’ shelf-life.
    4.4 Policies and regulations Food security and sustainable development are high
    priorities in the Qatar National Vision 2030 (General Secretariat for Development
    Planning 2008), thus the Qatari government has launched different initiatives
    and strategies for boosting the local food production, as the further development
    of Qatar’s agricultural industry is fundamental to ensuring food security in the
    country. Consequently, some of these initiatives are focusing on the greenhouse
    market as it represents the second major agricultural production method in the
    country (Qatar International Islamic Bank 2019). Additionally, the government’s
    attention is engaged in resource security by improving their use efficiency and
    ensuring their conservation. Therefore, special attention is given to the use
    of groundwater, as without appropriate water resource management, the aquifers
    will be depleted while the salinity levels of groundwater water will be increased.
    According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment (MME), Qatar is aiming
    to double the number of farms in the near future to cover 8% of Qatar’s surface
    area compared to 4% in 2019 (Qatar International Islamic Bank 2019). These farms
    will include animal and livestock farmlands along with vegetable production. That
    is in alliance with the Qatar National Food Security Strategy (QNFSS) 2018–2023,
    which has set a target to increase up to 70% domestic self-sufficiency in greenhouse
    vegetables and reach the size of 110 hectares with high-tech greenhouses by 2023.
    This strategical and policy guidance aims to achieve a high level of food security
    while regulating local production, improving crop yield, and protecting the country’s
    food supply from external shocks. Moreover, special attention is given to environmental
    protection by preserving water resources and reducing food waste. These targets
    will be achieved by finalizing greenhouse cluster infrastructure plans and by
    developing bid guidelines and subsidy programs (Ministry of Municipalities and
    Environment 2020). Besides, the local government had launched agricultural strategic
    investment projects in 2018 and had been jointly working with companies from Spain
    to install state-of-the-art greenhouse facilities spread across 100 hectares of
    land, which required an initial investment outlay of about 430 million QR (117.6
    million US$) (Businesswire Homepage 2020; Alpen Capital 2019). Moreover, 350 greenhouses,
    cooled and non-cooled, were installed on 85 local farms in 2019 by the Department
    of Agricultural Affairs of MME with all the necessary equipment and agricultural
    supplies to enhance agricultural production (Qatar Tribune Front 2020). In addition,
    Qatar Development Bank launched a ‘’Greenhouse financing program’’ in 2019. Urban
    scale greenhouses can be financed by 100% of the value with a maximum of 70.000
    QR, developing the culture of agriculture and enhancing self-sufficiency among
    the local community (Qatar Development Bank Homepage 2020). Although there have
    been considerable steps enhancing the agricultural and greenhouse sector, Qatar
    should strengthen even more synergies among government, industry, academic circles,
    and community. The lack of agricultural legislation in the State of Qatar is a
    big challenge for the local farmers and agricultural companies because the legislation
    would support marketing and monitor production more effectively. 5 Food security-greenhouses
    interaction in Qatar 5.1 Climatic and socioeconomic barriers to sustainable GHs
    development in Qatar The barriers to sustainable greenhouse development in Qatar,
    in terms of continuation and technological advancement, are geo-climatic and socioeconomic.
    Qatar’s climate is characterized by a hot summer starting from May till October
    with recorded temperatures as high as 34–37.2°C between 2010 to 2020, whereas
    winter starts from December till the end of February, and it is generally mild
    (Fig. 6). Rainfall is low and humidity is high; 71.4 mm recorded average rainfall
    between 2010 and 2020 and 51.4% average annual relative humidity during the same
    period, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 6 Temperature (°C) per month in Qatar from 2010
    to 2020 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2013a, 2015a, 2020b) Full
    size image Fig. 7 Relative Humidity (%) and rainfall (mm) per month in Qatar from
    2010 to 2020 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2013a, 2015a, 2020b)
    Full size image Qatar’s total arable land is a stable area of 65.000 ha and represents
    only 5.6% of the total country’s area (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar
    2013a). In the years between 2010 and 2020, the cultivated land was between 14
    to 21% of the total arable land while most of the land is used for green fodder
    production followed by date palm and vegetable production (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 Land
    utilization of crops (ha) in Qatar from 2010 to 2020 (Planning and Statistics
    Authority in Qatar 2014, 2020a) Full size image These factors have hindered the
    development of the greenhouse and the agricultural sector in general in the past
    and might prevail the further development of the sector, as they limit the crop
    production period and the land availability. Greenhouse cooling systems like the
    pad and fan system, which are widely used in Qatar, are not operating effectively
    in the summertime due to high humidity levels, causing big stress in plants thus
    having a negative yield impact. The socio-economic barriers to the future development
    of the greenhouse sector are mainly the acceptability and the adaptability of
    the existing high technology by the farmers and the agricultural professionals,
    followed by the initial high greenhouse capital investment, the lack of awareness
    and the need for the expertise in labor force. It is very often that agricultural
    professionals are reluctant to adopt new methods and technologies as opposed to
    the traditional ones, with the main barriers being the risk and the cost they
    might face. The research on the greenhouse sector has been making great advances
    as proved by the number of published research articles on agriculture, which has
    an increased average annual rate of 0.4% between 1999 and 2018, while the greenhouse
    technology articles have increased by 1.1%, which highlights the advancement of
    the sector (Aznar-Sánchez et al. 2020). Therefore, it is evident that the research
    institutions have resources and facilities to support the farmers in adopting
    new technologies, however, there is a gap between scientific knowledge and its
    implementation. On one hand, adoption of new technologies by the farmers is mostly
    influenced by their personal characteristics such as their age, educational level,
    income, their general attitude towards technology which is influenced by the level
    of accessibility they have (Li et al. 2020), and on the other hand, it is also
    often negatively influenced by perceptions of being a costly and risky investment.
    Thus, it is recommended that the economic-financial feasibility of the novel applications
    should be addressed together upon introduction for their successful adaptation
    by the end-users (Aznar-Sánchez et al. 2020). Moreover, farmers should be well
    trained and experienced enough to manage efficiently the agricultural farms, thus
    achieving the highest possible yields. The highly skilled farmers are even more
    important in the case of the hydroponic cultivation system, which requires specialized
    knowledge. Additionally, hydroponics has expensive infrastructure costs related
    mainly to irrigation. As most of the water used in agriculture in Qatar is abstracted
    fresh groundwater (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2017a), it should
    be desalinated before use in the hydroponic cultivation system, because of elevated
    levels of salinity, ranging between 6 to 10 g/l. The high salinity levels in the
    groundwater are caused by overexploitation; the excessed extraction of aquifers
    causes seawater intrusion (Ahmad and Al-Ghouti 2020). Thus, a desalination system
    investment including reverse osmosis water filtration system and water reservoirs
    is crucial, and these high costs are contemplated only in large-scale investments.
    5.2 Energy and water savings potential in Qatar Greenhouse crop production consumes
    large amounts of energy and water resources. In countries with a similar climate
    as Qatar, most of this energy is required for cooling and ventilation while the
    agricultural sector is the first biggest water consumer using 92% of the total
    abstracted groundwater (Ahmad and Al-Ghouti 2020). Besides, a considerable amount
    of water is needed for cooling purposes apart from irrigation as the evaporative
    cooling system, which is the most prevalent cooling system in Qatar, is significantly
    water intensive. Notably, the groundwater abstraction rates in Qatar substantially
    exceed the rate of rainfall-induced recharge, leading to decreasing aquifers levels
    and deterioration of groundwater quality. Indeed, the groundwater salinity levels
    have been increased due to over pumping and subsequent seawater intrusion affecting
    negatively not only the crop yield but also the used equipment such as water pipelines
    and irrigation drippers. Consequently, the increasing groundwater salinity levels
    will make groundwater not suitable for direct irrigation use without pre-treatment
    in desalination systems. In turn, this will increase the total energy needs as
    desalination is a process with relatively high-energy requirements and there are
    associated CO2 emissions in the case of conventional energy supply (Hussein and
    Lambert 2020). For energy needs, the greenhouse sector in Qatar depends mostly
    on fossil fuels, which have a big environmental impact on the country. Fossil
    fuels emit high CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) gases, making Qatar amongst the
    top countries with high carbon emissions per capita, recording 35.640 metric tons
    in 2020 (Knoema. 2022). The biggest share of emissions in 2019 came from the natural
    gas sector with 42.7%, followed by the manufacturing sector with a 21.7% share
    while the domestic power sector contributed 16% of total net emissions (Doha News
    2016). Although only 0.1% of the total GHG emissions were from the agricultural
    sector in 2015 in Qatar (Sayeed 2016), nonetheless, this number is expected to
    have increased with the subsequent growth of the sector despite the lack of more
    recent data. Besides, the whole food chain including transportation and processing
    is energy-intensive, along with production itself. The greenhouse sector could
    be more sustainable if alternative sources were used for water consumption and
    energy production, shifting away from fossil fuel use such as petroleum and carbon
    energy and natural groundwater resources. Namely, the use of Treated Sewage Effluent
    (TSE) and recycled water for irrigation purposes as well as the use of renewable
    energies like solar, wind, hydro and geothermal, respectively, in combination
    with innovative resource-saving technologies and greenhouse designs adapted to
    the local conditions, could contribute to lower carbon emissions and save the
    groundwater resources of Qatar. Practices and standards from other regions such
    as Europe and America cannot always be applied in hot arid countries like Qatar
    due to climatic differences which affect energy efficiency and consequently the
    operation cost (Alkhalidi et al. 2020). Pakari and Ghani (Pakari and Ghani 2019)
    have proposed a new greenhouse design that limits the available solar radiation
    thus reducing the high cooling demand during the hot season in subtropical countries
    like Qatar. The innovative thermally insulated greenhouse can reduce approximately
    80% of the cooling load in comparison with a conventional greenhouse. Other researchers
    (Hassabou and Khan 2019) have developed a Passive Solar greenhouse in Qatar with
    roof PV panels, which can have a grid zero carbon footprint. The energy and ventilation
    needs are covered with solar cooling, achieving more than a 77% reduction in annual
    energy consumption, in comparison with a conventional greenhouse design. The use
    of TSE for irrigation purposes in agriculture and landscaping in Qatar had already
    started back in 2004 with 25 million m3 (5%) and increased by about 3 times from
    32.69 m3 in 2006 to 86.0629 million m3 in 2019, as shown in Fig. 9. There have
    been considerable efforts to increase the use of TSE in agriculture and landscaping
    from different sectors, thus in 2017, 30% of the TSE was used for agriculture
    irrigation by the agricultural sector and 27% was used for green space irrigation
    by the government sector (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar 2017a). Fig.

    size image 5.3 Impacts of greenhouses penetration on the national economy Open
    field farming in Qatar is suitable only for a limited type of crops while the
    growing season is limited to certain months per year, from October to June approximately.
    Therefore, during the hot summer season, the country is relying exclusively on
    food imports to cover the local market needs. Additionally, the environmental
    impact of this type of farming is high, as it consumes large amounts of resources
    such as water, pesticides, and fertilizers with substantial losses, compared to
    greenhouse farming (Marucci et al. 2011; Bartzas et al. 2015; Planning and Statistics
    Authority in Qatar 2017b). Greenhouse production could lead Qatar in achieving
    higher levels of food security since it can overcome all the limitations that
    hindered the development of agriculture in the past, such as water scarcity, limited
    land availability, and the harsh climate. Additionally, it can achieve higher
    yields than open-field farming with significant product quality increase, while
    offering the possibility of year-round production, therefore changing the balance
    between exports and imports of foodstuff in the country. In the last decade, from
    2010 to 2020, Qatar’s imports in basic agricultural plant products for human consumption
    such as cereals, fruits, dates, and vegetables were 10,909,591 tons whereas the
    exports and re-exports were 132,396 tons. Simultaneously, the local production
    of the same products reached only 994.932 tons, as shown in Fig. 10. Vegetable
    production under greenhouse cultivation can boost domestic production while reducing
    the reliance on exports and increase Qatar’s resilience to supply shocks and disruptions
    in the future. Fig. 10 Agricultural supply (tons) of cereals, fruits, dates, and
    vegetables in Qatar from 2010 to 2020 (Planning and Statistics Authority in Qatar

    implications Considering climate change, shortage of resources, population growth,
    and harsh climate, the agricultural sector in Qatar is encountering several challenges
    in ensuring its growing food needs. Advanced technological solutions such as active
    smart greenhouses, IoT and precision agriculture, as well as alternative sources
    for water and energy, can support the state of Qatar to achieve its National Vision
    2030, particularly the food security, environmental and sustainability challenges.
    This paper aims to generate the knowledge, innovation, technologies, and practices
    needed to boost the local food production as well as increase the self-reliance
    of communities in four aspects: (1) lead to a state-of-art deep understanding
    of the actual situation of agriculture in Qatar as well as introducing smart greenhouses
    as a key solution to overcome agriculture challenges at the national level; (2)
    develop win–win business opportunities for massive portfolios assets that are
    beneficial for consumers, farmers, and industrials; (3) contribute to the modernization
    and transition to precision agriculture through adoption of smart greenhouses,
    integrating effective energy us, and water into agri-technology, as well as promoting
    the incorporation of pertinent technologies in the agricultural sector and (4)
    may offer researchers and scientists with knowledge, which encourage them to develop
    advanced solutions and practices to answer the challenges linked to the transition
    to sustainable and precise agriculture. Therefore, the areas of greenhouse development
    that could potentially lead to higher food security levels while meeting the sustainability
    goals of Qatar are: innovative greenhouse designs adopted to the Qatari climate
    characterized by high temperatures, humidity and solar radiation; new technological
    systems for food production like hydroponics, aquaponics and vertical farming;
    innovative cooling systems allowing all-year-round crop production especially
    during summer months while being less water intensive than e.g., the evaporative
    cooling system; advanced technological solutions such as the Internet of Things
    (IoT), metering and communication infrastructure, artificial intelligence, advanced
    monitoring and control techniques and smart greenhouses targeting ways to optimize
    resource use, maximize agricultural productivity, adaptation and mitigation against
    climate change; use of alternative energy sources like solar, wind, geothermal,
    etc. to cover the needs of irrigation, cooling and desalination while reducing
    the associated carbon emissions of the use of fossil fuels and use of alternative
    water sources other than fresh groundwater like TSE or recycled water in agriculture.
    These greenhouse advancements will generate local socio-economic and environmental
    advantages. Besides, they will provide an attractive occasion for fostering sustainable
    development, guaranteeing the high-performance abilities and thus promoting the
    renovation of the agricultural sector. This is of incredible significance for
    the efficient design and expansion of the next-generation agricultural sector
    in terms of self-monitoring, self-control, and optimal operation. Data availability

  description: Under changing climate and burgeoning food production demands, climate-smart
    agriculture (CSA) practices are the need of the hour. Physically-based crop models
    have been designed, which require large sets of input variables, besides being
    timeworn, tedious, and not user-friendly in the current situation. There is a
    rapid advancement in the modeling approaches in agricultural practices. But, still,
    there is a shortage of comprehensive information related to the recent technological
    advancement in the modeling applications toward CSA and its prospects. The paper
    reviews, critically assess, and discusses the present state-of-art modeling technologies
    related to the CSA. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting the current research
    trends in the different crop simulation models and their CSA applications. The
    assessment and analysis of the combined implications of crop simulation and hydrological
    models form another vital area of our review. Subsequently, the suitability and
    future scope of AI in crop simulation models is thoroughly assessed. Finally,
    the ways to address future challenges for CSA through the models and AI-based
    approaches are evaluated. We have selected and critically reviewed the literature
    to deliberate on the various aspects of modeling and their impact on CSA. Overall,
    we attempted to distinctly bring out the different latest and advanced technologies
    and their potential roles in modeling exercises towards CSA. The current review
    also collates and presents new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with
    techno-feasible solutions. The review involves the simulation-optimization framework
    for coupling hydrological and climate models with crop models that presently have
    the utmost importance for the CSA. Concurrently it also highlights the overarching
    significance of different models and suggests refined solutions that enable better
    crop and environment estimation, field management, and decision-making.

    Abstract Under changing climate and burgeoning food production demands, climate-smart
    agriculture (CSA) practices are the need of the hour. Physically-based crop models
    have been designed, which require large sets of input variables, besides being
    timeworn, tedious, and not user-friendly in the current situation. There is a
    rapid advancement in the modeling approaches in agricultural practices. But, still,
    there is a shortage of comprehensive information related to the recent technological
    advancement in the modeling applications toward CSA and its prospects. The paper
    reviews, critically assess, and discusses the present state-of-art modeling technologies
    related to the CSA. Special emphasis is placed on highlighting the current research
    trends in the different crop simulation models and their CSA applications. The
    assessment and analysis of the combined implications of crop simulation and hydrological
    models form another vital area of our review. Subsequently, the suitability and
    future scope of AI in crop simulation models is thoroughly assessed. Finally,
    the ways to address future challenges for CSA through the models and AI-based
    approaches are evaluated. We have selected and critically reviewed the literature
    to deliberate on the various aspects of modeling and their impact on CSA. Overall,
    we attempted to distinctly bring out the different latest and advanced technologies
    and their potential roles in modeling exercises towards CSA. The current review
    also collates and presents new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with
    techno-feasible solutions. The review involves the simulation-optimization framework
    for coupling hydrological and climate models with crop models that presently have
    the utmost importance for the CSA. Concurrently it also highlights the overarching
    significance of different models and suggests refined solutions that enable better
    crop and environment estimation, field management, and decision-making. Graphical

    management 1. Introduction A wealth of resources to attenuate existing and emerging
    technologies, through a series of assumptions, are opened by advances in data
    acquisition, accuracy, computation, remote sensing (RS), and application of crop
    models. The paths toward climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices are paved by
    robustly positioned crop models to combat several issues related to precision
    agriculture systems (Pasquel et al., 2022). Precision agriculture is a management
    strategy that gathers, processes, and analyzes temporal, spatial, and individual
    data and subsequently combines them with other information to support management
    decisions. The strategy takes into consideration the estimated variability for
    improved resource use based on efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability,
    and sustainability of agricultural production. Globally, crop yield is a gold
    standard for assessing agricultural systems. Yet, burgeoning changes in global
    climate have severely threatened the crop production system, with some regions
    slated to experience a 70% decrease in production (Guedes and Bocinsky, 2018).
    In 2014 the 5th assessment report (AR-5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
    Change (IPCC) underscored stringent reduction in crop production, post-2050. In
    addition, the IPCC endorsed the impact of factors like regions, crops, and adaptation
    strategies on climate change. Thus, the impact on crop production in the southern
    hemisphere could be negative; while, in the northern hemisphere, it could be either
    positive or negative (IPCC, 2014). The adverse impacts of climate change on crop
    production are documented to hamper global food security in terms of quantity
    and quality (Tripathi et al., 2016). The significant increase in cereal consumption,
    brings to the fore, the importance of sustainable agricultural practices to meet
    rising consumer demand (Patrício and Rieder, 2018). Therefore, precise crop practices
    will significantly facilitate vulnerability assessment, agronomic adaptation against
    climate change, crop management, and CSA-oriented decision-making (Jin et al.,
    2018). CSA intrinsically helps to transform and reorient traditional agricultural
    systems to ensure food security and support rural livelihood in a changing climate
    scenario (Azadi et al., 2021). Techno-feasible solutions like crop modeling can
    contribute to global nutrition and food security with an enhanced, comprehensive,
    and wide-ranging outreach (Reynolds et al., 2018). The crop models can play decisive
    roles in assessing climate change''s impact on the stabilization of crop production
    under different management practices (Therond et al., 2011). Concurrently crop
    models have the capacity to quantify the effect of climate change on crop growth,
    soil, agricultural sustainability, and productivity. They require reliable model
    input data on site-specific parameters of weather, soil physicochemistry, irrigation,
    agronomical practices, and water management (Chenu et al., 2017). Towards attaining
    these objectives, RS data can assist in providing spatial information on actual
    field conditions. Thus, by securing crop biophysical characteristics and crop
    condition data, good quality and precise yield data estimates can be generated
    as outputs (Kasampalis et al., 2018). Agriculture and food systems are simultaneously
    greatly affected by climate change, and drive climate change via greenhouse gas
    emissions, land use land cover (LULC), soil and vadose zone, and physical and
    chemical properties of water (Porter et al., 2019). The present extensive application
    of, crop models for crop growth and yield risk assessment helps decision-makers
    and farmers minimize the quantum of risk and maximize food security (Jha et al.,
    2021a). Further, in the areas of hydrogeology and subsurface flow, transport models
    have also been extensively used for the simulation of the fate and transport of
    fertilizers, pesticides, and soil water. Along with the crop models, eco-hydrological
    modeling coupled with geographic information systems (GIS) have been widely adopted
    to predict and calculate the level of pesticide contamination. The development
    of a contamination monitoring network offers advantages of high computational
    resilience, precision, accuracy, reduced time and cost, with coverage of a wide-scale
    and wide range of scenarios. (Chen et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019b; Yuan et al.,
    2018). Thus, the significant importance of the soil-plant water relationship,
    coupled hydrological modeling, and crop growth modeling applications have progressively
    increased over recent decades (Siad et al., 2019). Additionally, the crop models
    can also provide best-fit solutions for irrigation strategy selection, crop productivity
    increment, and farm water management (Mandal et al., 2020). To date, several crop
    models have been designed and developed, and all of them require large sets of
    input variables and physical systems. In addition, these timeworn models are tedious,
    not user-friendly, and have enormous demands. The technological evolution of computer
    systems has led to more extensive use of physically-based mechanistic crop models
    and empirical models. These empirical models are generally used in information
    processing like crop yield, crop water, and nutrient status estimation; crop disease
    detection through image recognition, internet of things (IoT) applications, and
    agricultural automation (Jha et al., 2019). Artificial intelligence (AI) is a
    technology that enables a machine to simulate human behavior (Haykin, 2009). Machine
    learning (ML) is a subset of AI that spontaneously allows a machine to learn from
    past data without any previous programming. ANN (Artificial Neural Network) is
    a subset of the AI system that has been widely recognized for its nonlinearity,
    adaptability, and mapping techniques (Ben and Hanana, 2021). Recently ANN and
    other AI-based models have been applied widely and successfully to solve various
    agro-technological problems (Fieuzal et al., 2017; Kouadio et al., 2018). In general,
    ANN models possess several advantages over other conventional regression models
    such as, being independent of certain hypothesis testing, and data distribution
    patterns (Abiodun et al., 2018). AI-based models can also effectively overcome
    the time-consuming complexity of conceptually interpretable models. However, AI-based
    models can only learn to model existing data locally and as accurately as possible,
    but extrapolation is beyond its capability. It cannot make predictions about scenarios
    outside of the known conditions. Further, the computational cost of the black
    box models depends upon the amount of data used, the complexity of the algorithms
    used, the availability of the code, and the computational power. In a nutshell,
    with the advancement of accurate data acquisition, computing facilities, and RS
    techniques, the crop models offer vast potential resources to solve several issues
    related to precision agriculture and agro-hydrological systems in a more robust
    manner and pave the path toward CSA. But, still, there is a dearth of comprehensive
    and systematic information related to the modeling application toward CSA and
    its future prospects. Looking at the pertinent issue present review offers comprehensive
    information about different AI and model-based applications, and techniques in
    agriculture. It has also effectively outlined the technological background and
    usability of different models and their applications, which is critical in understanding
    how these models can form a baseline for CSA practices. Hence, to register the
    technological transformation, the present review (1) systematically collates and
    highlights the current research trends of different crop simulation models and
    their applications for CSA; (2) assesses and analyzes the combined implications
    of crop simulation and hydrological models; (3) analyzes the suitability and future
    scope of AI in crop simulation models, and (4) explores ways to address future
    challenges for CSA through the modeling approaches. 2. Modeling approaches toward
    CSA The commonly used crop models are mechanistic, as they depend upon the soil-plant
    water physical relationships and simulate specific outcomes. Likewise, coupled
    eco-hydrological crop models have both stochastic and deterministic components.
    Besides these models, numerical simulation models simulate the heat, moisture,
    and solute transport process through soils by applying several analytical or numerical
    techniques like the finite difference method (FDM), and the finite element methods
    (FEM). Empirical crop models are mainly location and crop-specific, that use regression
    crop models to predict crop growth and yield as functions of weather data (Shirley
    et al., 2020; Spitters, 1989). In the empirical models, the relationship between
    input and output data is either expressed as regression equations or AI-based
    models. While the regression equations could be linear or nonlinear, the AI-based
    models could be based on the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), the Support Vector
    Machine (SVM), or the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM). Advancements in GIS and
    RS technology have made, acquiring spatial data on soil moisture, LULC, crop,
    and watershed geomorphological characteristic data expedient, and less expensive.
    In addition, data from these sources were not only applicable for the simulation
    of crop models but coupling hydrological models with crop models was rendered
    much easier (Table 1). Table 1. Different types of models are associated with
    CSA. Model types Major Purpose Major types Crop models • Used to simulate crop

    Crop modeling applications The history of agricultural system modeling is replete
    with several key events and innovations that have led scientists to develop and
    use models for various purposes. Some of the earliest (1950s) modeling applications
    in the agricultural systems helped optimize decisions at a farm scale and evaluate
    policy impacts on the rural development economy. Concurrently, De Wit (1958) and
    Van Bavel (1953) developed early computational analyses of plant and soil processes.
    Agricultural production system modeling was formally initiated in the 1960s, allowing
    agricultural economists to employ them at the farm scale. Such ground-scale applications
    led to the augmentation of numerous ecological models, including models of grasslands
    during the late 1960s and early 1970s, which were commonly used for studying livestock
    grazing. Subsequently, in the late 1970s, the availability of improved and high
    computational facilities, led to a boom in crop models (Jones et al., 2017); while
    the introduction of RS technologies made the crop models dynamic, and enabled
    spatial data utilization to anticipate crop production (Erickson, 1984). During
    the 1980s, these models moved to the next level with the ability to numerically
    simulate relationships between the soil, plant, and atmosphere, solute transport
    processes, and convection-diffusion process through the vadose zone (Van Genuchten
    et al., 1974). The collation of crop and climate models for climate change impact
    assessment were initiated after the publication of the first assessment report
    (AR-1) of the IPCC in 1990 (Curry et al., 1990; Rosenzweig and Parry, 1994). Post-2000,
    hybrid improved crop simulation models with climatic data (obtained from climate
    models) as inputs increased expeditiously. From late 1990 onwards, optimization
    theory, AI, and ML added new dimensions to crop modeling. These models reduced
    the time consumption, the complexity of input data, and calibration parameters
    compared to the older mechanistic models. A brief chronology of crop modeling
    approaches is illustrated in Fig. 1. Examples of various standard crop models

    rather unusual aspect into focus, Dentener et al. (2020) estimated that the COVID-19
    lockdown engendered a low air pollution impact on wheat yield using the TM5-FASST
    global source receptor model; while considering six different scenarios of the
    NOx and non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) emission reduction percentage.
    The TM5-FASST global source receptor model is based on the framework that can
    compute ambient contaminant concentrations, a wide range of contaminant-related
    impacts on agricultural crop production, and human health parameters at the regional
    or national level (Dingenen et al., 2018). Jha et al. (2021b) used the DSSAT crop
    simulation model to project the COVID-19 impact on four cereal crops: rice, maize,
    sorghum, and millet in Senegal and Burkina Faso in different planting areas coupled
    with changing scenarios. They found cereal production varied in the four centers
    from 1.47 M tons to 2.47 M tons in Senegal and 4.51 M tons to 7.52 M tons in Burkina
    Faso. 2.2. Coupling of hydrological models with crop simulation models Crop models
    are tools that help estimate crop yields as a function of weather, soil conditions,
    and applied management practices (Guerra et al., 2002). Hydrologic models are
    developed for estimating, predicting, and managing water distribution at the soil-atmosphere
    interphase as a function of various parameters, used for describing soil and watershed
    characteristics (Gioia et al., 2012). The efficiency of hydrology-based crop models
    depends upon several intermediate factors like soil moisture distribution, land
    use type, soil hydraulic properties, vegetation types, leaf area index (LAI),
    evapotranspiration (ET), and amount of rainfall. The hydrological model can be
    enhanced with a module that simulates vegetation development, especially since
    balance is also affected by ET, which is a function of LAI. These are not only
    limited to the small scale but also extend to the scale of watersheds (Dokoohaki
    et al., 2016), as hydrologic models actually use a simplified version of crop
    models. The hydrological models can simulate water balance across the field and
    catchment scale, and improve crop models by estimating soil moisture distribution.
    Crop models can be improved by efficient modeling of water flow distribution,
    quantifying the quantity of water that infiltrates into the soil versus water
    that runs through the ground surface. The interactions among these complex processes
    can compute effectively water available for crops in the rhizosphere. These hydrological
    models or hydro-climatic models can also be used for flood simulation, and thus
    help the decision-makers to optimize crop planning and management. The simple
    water balance-based hydrological modeling approaches are extended to GIS-based
    larger catchment scale rainfall-runoff models for flood flow simulations. Hydrological
    models also act as a tool for multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) to discover
    optimal land-use practices by their ability to locate critical zones at the watershed
    scales. Kumar et al. (2021), therefore combined the Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) model with Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) to identify the critical
    zone for biofuel crop plantation. A similar approach for assessing hydrological
    dynamics of watersheds during extreme events in the Hamilton Harbour watershed,
    Canada was also conducted using the SWAT model (Dong et al., 2019). Several commonly
    used hydrological models are the Stanford watershed model (Crawford, 1966), NAM
    (Nielsen and Hansen, 1973), MIKE-SHE (Refsgaard and Storm, 1995), TOPMODEL (Beven,
    1997), HBV (Lindström et al., 1997), MIKE 11 (Havnø et al., 1995), and SWAT (Arnold
    et al., 1998). Wang et al. (2019b) reviewed the worldwide applicability of the
    SWAT model for pesticide transport simulation from agricultural lands at the watershed
    scale. They concluded that existing algorithms of SWAT based on watershed behaviors,
    management strategies, and pesticide properties, should be improved. Further,
    Siad et al. (2019), reviewed the coupling of several hydrological and crop growth
    models and presented a framework that linked hydrological models to the crop simulation
    models and different types of coupling. Vilvert et al. (2018) proposed a multi-model
    ensemble approach that included a combination of soil water models (SWAT) with
    crop models (APSIM, DSSAT, MONICA, AquaCrop) and farm-economic models (e.g., FSSIM
    (Tittonell et al., 2005)) to assess the sunflower food chain in Tanzania. Vadose
    zone flow and solute transport models like HYDRUS 1D (Kool and Van Genuchten,
    1989), HYDRUS 2D/3D (Šimůnek et al., 2008), DRAINMOD (Skaggs, 1978), SWAP (Kroes
    et al., 2000; Van Dam, 2000), and root zone water quality model (RZWQM) (Development
    Team RZWQM et al., 1998) can effectively simulate the soil moisture distribution,
    vadose zone transport of fertilizers, and levels of insecticides. These models
    can be further integrated into groundwater flow models like MODFLOW, and FEFLOW
    models. Some of the examples are WOFOST-MODEFLOW-HYDRUS 1D (Peña-Haro et al.,
    2012), DSSAT-SWAT- MODEFLOW (Uddameri et al., 2017), DSSAT-MODEFLOW (Xiang et
    al., 2020). A coupling of crop and the hydrological system model has been conceptualized
    and presented in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (649KB) Download :

    crop-hydrological system model. ET0 and ETc are referenced as evapotranspiration
    and crop evapotranspiration respectively. Recently, Siad et al. (2019) presented
    the necessity of coupling between different modeling systems. There are several
    strategies of coupling, which mainly include the following: • Sequential coupling:
    where models are decoupled completely. Examples of such coupling are remote sensing
    indices namely Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), LAI, the fraction of Absorbed
    Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR), the Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI), and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) with the AquaCrop model
    (Saab et al., 2021). • Loose coupling: where each model has a separate database
    and, the input and output (I/O) data are transferred between the models. An example
    of such coupling is WEP-WOFOST (Jia et al., 2011) • Shared coupling: where sharing
    of graphical user interface (GUI) and I/O database takes place. Most of the crop
    models are coupled with GUI and their own database. • Embedded: where one model
    is entirely contained in the other model as a subroutine. An example of such coupling
    is RZWQM-DSSAT (Ma et al., 2012) • Integrated: Models are merged at the code source
    level. An example of such coupling is HYDRUS 1D-EPIC (Wang et al., 2017) • Tight
    coupling: where data management tools like GIS are integrated and share the same
    database. Examples of such tools are ArcHydro, Arc SWAT which can facilitate tight
    coupling between hydrological models and GIS-based models (Maidment and Morehouse,
    2002; Winchell et al., 2007). • Framework: where the models are coupled using
    a third-party tool generally known as ‘coupler’ which is based on a combination
    of the previous models. An example of such coupling is VIC-DSSAT (Andreadis et
    al., 2017) To create a decision support system (DSS) for the CSA, it is imperative
    to couple crop simulation models with hydrological models, GIS models, data models,
    geometric representations, and spatial referencing. 2.3. Integration of remote
    sensing (RS) application with crop simulation models RS provides several types
    of spatial information that include soil, LULC, and crop biophysical data, which
    are crucial for the augmentation of crop model performance. It can also represent
    the missing data and describe crop conditions throughout various crop growth stages.
    RS can minimize the unpredictability of spatial information associated with crop
    models (Kasampalis et al., 2018). For example, if LAI is being monitored frequently
    across various scales and resolutions, then in conjunction with actual evapotranspiration
    and soil moisture estimations from thermal satellite images, they have been used
    with crop models. The RS application initially started with the large area crop
    inventory experiment (LACIE) using LANDSAT data to estimate wheat production (Erickson,
    1984). The application of crop models can be extended to larger spatial scales
    by incorporating GIS (Lal et al., 1993; Priya and Shibasaki, 2001). RS provides
    information on the several indices of VI, LAI, and FAPAR, in addition to soil
    moisture value for crop models to calculate ET, biomass, and yield estimation.
    (Bai et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2020; Khaki et al., 2021; Paul et al., 2021).
    Furthermore, an integrated RS application employing TerraSAR-X images has also
    been used in the classification of woody structures in Hannover, Germany. Such
    techniques play a helpful part in monitoring, investigating, and enhancing the
    habitat structures in agricultural areas (Bargiel, 2013). Some RS-based surface
    energy balance models used for ET computation are the surface energy balance algorithm
    for land (SEBAL) model, mapping evapotranspiration at high-resolution initialized
    calibration (METRIC) model, and the 3 T model (Ali et al., 2021; Zhang et al.,
    2020b). Hyperspectral RS, also known as imaging spectroscopy, is a technology
    used to detect and identify minerals, terrestrial vegetation, man-made materials,
    and backgrounds. Hyperspectral imaging collects and processes information from
    across the electromagnetic spectrum. The goal of hyperspectral imaging is to obtain
    the spectrum for each pixel in the image of a scene. The hyperspectral data sets
    are generally composed of about 100 to 200 spectral bands of relatively narrow
    bandwidths (5–10 nm). Thus, hyperspectral imaging data allows for the identification
    of many materials, even in a heterogeneous mixture. Data obtained from hyperspectral
    RS can provide several pieces of information about crop biophysical properties
    and can accurately estimate the yield data (Oppelt, 2010). Multispectral RS involves
    the acquisition of visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared images in several
    broad and discrete wavelength bands. Since materials reflect and absorb energy
    at specific wavelengths; land surface features, landscape patterns, and the existence
    of various materials can be detected by their spectral signatures. Poor-resolution
    multispectral sensors are more widely available than high-resolution hyperspectral
    sensors. Unfortunately, the latter are handicapped by being costly, complex, and
    less in number than multispectral satellites. Fast computers, sensitive detectors,
    and large data storage capacities are needed for analyzing hyperspectral data.
    Mariotto et al. (2013) performed a comparative study between hyperspectral RS
    (Field spectrometer, Hyperion EO-1 satellite) and multispectral RS (IRS, Quickbird,
    Landsat, IKONOS) for yield estimation of annual crops through empirical models.
    They conclude the better variability of hyperspectral RS over multispectral RS.
    In the last decade, the rapid development of optical RS data (Landsat 8, Sentinel
    2, Spot-6, GeoEye-1, Worldview-2) has perfected the estimation of LAI, and biomass
    with the help of high spatial resolution images (Clevers et al., 2017; Li et al.,
    2017). Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data like Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2, RISAT-1,
    and ENVISAT also have extensive application in crop canopy state variables estimation
    like LAI, crop height, and biomass estimation (Chauhan et al., 2019; Liao et al.,
    2018; Mandal et al., 2019; Pipia et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019a). SAR has the
    unique proficiency in acquiring information even in the presence of clouds which
    has an immense advantage in agricultural research. With the advent of new technologies,
    the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system has become a cutting-edge technology
    for crop water status detection, plant density estimation, crop biophysical parameter
    estimation, and several other applications. Though UAVs are capable of providing
    very high-resolution images, the images are limited by insufficient area coverage
    and insufficient flight time (Dos Santos et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2017b; Santesteban
    et al., 2017). Jin et al. (2018) illustrated several data assimilation algorithms
    for the integration of RS data to the crop models, namely the Kalman filter (KF),
    Three-Dimensional and four-dimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR and
    4DVAR), ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), hierarchical Bayesian method (HBM) and
    particle filter (PF). They also proposed several methods to calibrate the sensitivity
    and uncertainty of crop model parameters for adjustment of optimal consistency
    between the data obtained by RS, and the data simulated using the crop model by
    manual calibration. The methods included, auto-calibration methods such as simplex
    search algorithm, least square method (LSM), particle swarm optimization (PSO),
    very fast simulated annealing (VFSA), shuffled complex evolution (SCE-UA), and
    maximum likelihood solution (MLS). 2.4. Application of different climate models
    within crop models An adequate understanding of climate change impact is critical
    for crop yield prediction and irrigation water management (Rauff and Bello, 2015).
    Climate change may impose severe threats to farmers to maintain future agricultural
    production (Gomes et al., 2020). On the other hand, agriculture contributes to
    the anthropogenic GHG emissions that drive climate change (Smith and Gregory,
    2013). The variability of climate depends upon various extremities, which can
    cause a significant catastrophe in the farming sector. Cline (2007) projected
    the impact of climate change on the percentage change in agricultural production
    up to 2080 and found that agricultural production in developing countries may
    fall between 10 and 25%. As climate change and its impacts vary with the future
    scenarios, the study of climate change in the agro-ecosystem leads to the adoption
    of crop simulation models, climate models like global climate models (GCMs), and
    regional climate models (RCMs). Decision support system for agrotechnology transfer
    (DSSAT) is one of those first crop models that modified weather simulation generators
    (Rauff and Bello, 2015). The climate models can generate future climate data,
    which has an essential role in predicting prospective crop yield, crop water requirement,
    and estimation of crop nitrogen status. Additionally, crop models in conjunction
    with climate models, also estimate the uncertainty associated with future prediction
    and determine climate change''s impact on agro-ecohydrological systems (Lehner
    et al., 2019; Stéfanon et al., 2015). This future prediction about climate change
    assisted policymakers and researchers in the development of optimal crop planning,
    and efficient irrigation management systems that are resilient to climate change
    (Baethgen et al., 2003). Modeling associated with agricultural research such as
    crop models and coupled crop-hydrological models requires multiple climate data,
    obtained from several climate models. Globally, climate change variability leads
    to uncertainty in water distribution in many places, which leads to floods and
    drought conditions. Thus, flood frequency analysis is crucial to avoid severe
    crop damage against flooding. Several statistical flood frequency techniques such
    as Gumbel distribution for maximum annual flows (Gumbel, 1941), Weibull distribution
    (Chow, 1964), extreme value-based flood frequency distribution (Boughton, 1980),
    rainfall frequency atlas (Hershfield, 1961), random number, and random variable-based
    frequency analysis (Todorovic, 1978), L-moment methods (Hosking, 1990), copula
    application (Yin et al., 2018; Zhang and Singh, 2006) can assists in CSA along
    with the hydrological models, by predicting and analyzing extreme rainfall and
    flood event in a particular catchment area. In recent years, worldwide extreme
    climatic changes have accelerated drought or drought-like situations. Drought
    modeling includes space-time forecasting characteristics and imminent climate
    change impacts (Singh, 2018). For CSA, drought characterization and drought forecasting
    are critical, to mitigate the catastrophic effects on the agricultural sector
    and crop management practices. Drought indices are the functions of temperature,
    precipitation, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture. Commonly used drought indices
    are palmer drought severity index (PDSI) (Palmer, 1965), standardized precipitation
    index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993) for meteorological drought, crop moisture index
    (CMI) (Palmer, 1968), aridity index (AI), crop water stress index (CWSI) (Jackson
    et al., 1981), soil moisture drought index (SMDI) (Hollinger et al., 1993), standardized
    precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) for agricultural drought and the
    RS-based drought indices like vegetation indices (Mishra and Singh, 2010). 2.5.
    Application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in crop modeling AI is
    a state-of-the-art technology that mimics the natural human thinking processes.
    For the last two decades, AI models have been used successfully in different aspects
    of farming and its allied sectors. AI is a technology that enables a machine to
    simulate human behavior. ML is a subset of AI which allows a machine to automatically
    learn from past data without specific programming. Multifaceted applications of
    AI include prediction of reference evapotranspiration, pan evaporation, soil moisture,
    soil temperature, crop yield, crop height, leaf area index, canopy cover, stem
    width, above-ground biomass, leaf color, chlorophyll content, crop water status,
    crop disease detection, weed management, pest management, agricultural robots,
    smart irrigation systems, automated agricultural machinery and several agro-meteorological
    applications (Feng et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2020; Majhi and Naidu, 2021; Maroufpoor
    et al., 2019; Nourani et al., 2019; Bedi and Gole, 2021; Raza et al., 2020; Sharma
    et al., 2020). The AI application integrated with adaptive management strategies
    at the field or farm level is schematically presented in Fig. 3. Download : Download
    high-res image (388KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. Schematic diagram
    of AI application in smart farming. With the advance in computing systems, several
    AI techniques are being invented, such as ANN, deep neural network (DNN), convolution
    neural network (CNN), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy interface system (ANFIS). Apart
    from ANN, several ML techniques, namely extreme learning machine (ELM), support
    vector machine (SVM), linear regression, logistic regression models, gaussian
    process regression (GPR), and random forest regression (RF) are widely employed
    as prediction tools (Sharma et al., 2020). 2.5.1. Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
    ANN structures consist of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output
    layer (Garg and Jain, 2020). The input layer collects data from nature, this data
    is processed in the hidden layer by activation functions, and output is generated
    in the output layer. The inputs are multiplied by weights in each layer and with
    some added bias. Commonly used activation functions are sigmoid, linear, and hyperbolic
    tangent sigmoid. Each layer''s weights are updated to minimize the error based
    on the error between the actual versus the ANN predicted outputs. To date, several
    ANN models are widely used for water management and production estimation of different
    crops (Elbeltagi et al., 2020; Nema et al., 2017). A feedforward neural network
    (FFNN) is an artificial neural network wherein connections between the nodes do
    not form a cycle and differ from its descendent which is the recurrent neural
    network. The FFNN was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network.
    The processing units or neurons are organized in layers. Every unit in a layer
    is connected with all the units in the previous layer. FFNN is widely used in
    agricultural system modeling (Khoshroo et al., 2018). Commonly used FFNNs are
    multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function neural network (RBF-NN), and
    generalized regression neural network (GRNN). In ANN, recurrent or feedback neural
    networks (RNN) are majorly used in pattern recognition (Abiodun et al., 2018).
    A multilayer perceptron (MLP) network works similarly to the ANN, whereas a deep
    neural network (DNN) is a modification of the MLP network with several hidden
    layers (Khaki and Wang, 2019). MLP is one of the simplest ANN types, with a specific
    feed-forward neural network architecture mechanism. The MLP has a specific FFNN
    architecture, where the multiple fully connected layers are stacked up (thus completely
    avoiding any convolution layers), and the activation functions of the hidden units
    are often a sigmoid or a hyperbolic tangent sigmoid. The output layer nodes usually
    have softmax activation functions (for classification) or linear activation functions
    (for regression). The typical MLP architectures are not “deep”, consisting of
    a few (1 to 5) hidden layers. DNN is one of the most advanced neural network forms
    with multiple hidden layers in comparison to the MLP. The main advantage of MLP
    is that it is the simplest type of ANN that can work well with large input data
    and can be applied to complex non-linear problems. In DNN massive parallel computations
    can be performed using GPUs, and are scalable for large volumes of data. Moreover,
    it delivers better performance results when the amount of data is huge. Also,
    the features are automatically deduced and optimally tuned for the desired outcome
    in the DNN. Thus, the features do not require to be extracted ahead of time, which
    avoids time-consuming ML techniques. The RBF neural network consists of a single
    hidden layer subjected to a radial basis function as an activation function (Pandey
    and Mishra, 2017). An RBF has a real-valued function whose value depends only
    on the distance between the input and some fixed point, either the origin or some
    other fixed point called a center. Further, GRNN is another advanced version of
    the FFNN used for agricultural water management and crop yield estimation (Niedbała,
    2019; Ruiming and Shijie, 2020). This type of neural network consists of four
    layers, out of which two layers exist in between the input and the output layer,
    namely a pattern layer with an RBF function and a summation layer. CNN is a type
    of deep learning tool widely employed for crop disease detection, weed identification,
    crop yield, crop water stress, by image processing, and widely used applications
    with grid-like datasets (An et al., 2019; Hulse et al., 2021; Jiang et al., 2020;
    Ma et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2019b). For example, the CNN model can be used as
    a robust tool for assessing crop biosecurity by detecting crop-based diseases.
    Such CNN based model attained 93.34% accuracy and could effectively address the
    current milieu of food security (Gokulnath and Usha, 2021). This type of neural
    network model consists of multiple layers used for convolution processes through
    kernel functions to predict the outputs. Convolution is a mathematical operation
    based on two functions that produce a third function that expresses how the shape
    of one is modified by the other. Kernel function generally transforms the training
    set of data so that a non-linear decision surface is able to transform to a linear
    equation, in a higher number of dimension spaces. In addition, RNN is a special
    type of neural network that allows previous outputs to be used as inputs while
    having hidden states. The connection between nodes forms a directed graph along
    a temporal sequence and is used for crop yield modeling (Khaki et al., 2020).
    The Long short-term memory (LSTM) network is an improved version of RNN that can
    deal with the vanishing gradient problem and has been used for yield detection
    through feature selection (You et al., 2017). 2.5.2. Extreme Learning Machine
    (ELM) ELM is a special regularized neural network consisting of single or multiple
    hidden layers with randomly assigned and never updated hidden nodes. Generally,
    ‘hidden nodes’ output weights are gleaned from single steps (Huang et al., 2006).
    Hidden neurons of ELM are also subject to several transfer functions like sigmoid,
    Gaussian, wavelet, hyperbolic, and inverse hyperbolic functions. Similarly, as
    with other ML techniques ELM model has numerous applications in agriculture, such
    as crop ET modeling, crop growth prediction, crop biophysical, and biochemical
    parameter estimation (Maimaitijiang et al., 2017; Taherei Ghazvinei et al., 2018;
    Zhu et al., 2020). ELM can be used to classify multispectral, thermal images to
    estimate chlorophyll content and nitrogen concentration, LAI, and above-ground
    fresh and dry biomass (Maimaitijiang et al., 2017). 2.5.3. Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) SVM is a traditional type of ML technique initially developed by Vapnik
    (1963) for extensive use in classification and regression problems (Cortes and
    Vapnik, 1995; Drucker et al., 1997). An SVM model depicts the examples as points
    in space, mapped so that distinct category examples are divided by a clear gap
    with a possible maximum width. Commonly used kernel functions for supporting vector
    machine regressions are linear, polynomial, and Gaussian (Han et al., 2020). SVM
    has a wide range of applications in the agricultural for crop yield estimation,
    classification, disease detection, ET modeling, and water stress estimation (Ashrafzadeh
    et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2018; Kaneda et al., 2017; Oguntunde et al., 2018;
    Son et al., 2018). 2.5.4. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) GPR is a type of nonlinear
    regression based on Gaussian distribution, which is generally associated with
    high dimensional space problems (Rasmussen, 2003). Gaussian process regression
    also consists of kernel functions like exponential, Gaussian, and exponential
    kernels. This non-parametric and Bayesian approach-based regression is also efficiently
    workable for small datasets. The Gaussian process is a compilation of random variables
    whose characteristics are a finite number of subsets that follow a joint Gaussian
    distribution (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006). Gaussian processes are parametric:
    they are principled on the assumption that the underlying data is from a stationary
    Gaussian field. GPR offers broad applications in modeling evapotranspiration,
    pan evaporation, and crop yield prediction (Karbasi, 2018; Shabani et al., 2020;
    You et al., 2017). 2.5.5. Random Forest Regression (RFR) RFR is an ensemble type
    of machine learning model which resolves classification or regression type of
    problems by combining a large set of decision trees (Breiman, 2001). Decision
    trees are decision support models that classify patterns using a sequence of well-defined
    rules. They are tree-like graphs in which each branch node represents an option
    between a number of alternatives, and each leaf node represents an outcome of
    the cumulative choices. In this process, each tree is built by selecting a random
    set of variables and samples of the dataset (Cai et al., 2019). After generating
    many decision trees, RFR tunes the hyper-parameters: the maximum depth of trees,
    the number of features for the best split, and the number of trees. RFR can handle
    high-dimensional datasets and can quantify the relative importance of variables.
    High dimensional data refers to a dataset in which the number of features is larger
    than the number of observations. It can handle binary features, categorical features,
    and numerical features. There is very little pre-processing required, and data
    does not need rescaling or transformation. RFR can be coupled with the RS technique,
    and it can be used for crop yield and type mapping and estimations of leaf nitrogen
    content and crop water stress (Hunt et al., 2019; Krishna et al., 2019; Liang
    et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019a). 3. Combination of different modeling approaches
    and decision analysis toward CSA Modeling and simulations are being extensively
    used in open-field applications as well as protected farming structures. Despite
    RS, image processing, and IoT applications, precision agriculture includes protected
    cultivation structures like poly houses, shade net houses, micro-irrigation technologies
    like drip irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, and farm pond design. These protected
    cultivation structures protect crops from adverse weather conditions, bolster
    off-season cultivation, and enhance the farm economy by increasing crop yield.
    Micro-irrigation systems increase application efficiency, and therefore reduce
    the plant water requirement. Accurate design of micro-irrigation systems and protected
    cultivation structures are very crucial for CSA. Computational fluid dynamics
    (CFD) modeling is a sophisticated design and analysis tool that uses computers
    to simulate fluid flow, heat and mass transfer, phase change, chemical reaction,
    mechanical movement, and solid and fluid interaction. CFD modeling is being recently
    integrated with agriculture for soil-tool interaction study, farm implements design,
    pressure-flow simulation in drip, sprinkler irrigation pipeline, drip emitters,
    drip, sprinkler irrigation system design, thermal and structural analysis of greenhouse
    systems (Baghel et al., 2021; Fernández-García et al., 2020; Fordjour et al.,
    2020; Kim et al., 2021; Mudarisov et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2020a). In open
    field cultivation, crop models are combined with hydrological models for the agricultural
    overland runoff inflow-outflow estimation, and vadose zone soil water flow simulations.
    It also includes nonpoint source pollution modeling from the surface, subsurface
    water through agricultural runoff, subsurface flow via infiltration, and deep
    percolation. On the other hand, in the case of protected cultivation structures,
    the internal microclimates can be simulated from the ambient external climate
    data by using thermodynamic heat and mass transfer modeling. These thermodynamic
    models can be either static or dynamic type of models. The thermodynamic models
    are used for internal airflow, and the temperature flux includes CFD approaches.
    Thus, the output of the microclimatic models, which are the internal climatic
    variables, can be used further for crop models for yield estimation inside protected
    cultivation structures. Several software packages are being developed for CFD
    simulations that can be successfully used for precision agricultural system analysis
    and designs such as protected cultivation structures, and micro-irrigation systems
    namely ANSYS CFX, ANSYS FLUENT, COMSOL MULTIPHYSICS, SOLIDWORKS (Norton et al.,
    2007). Further, most crop models include the Penman-Monteith equation for ET,
    which is a classic example of the “big-leaf” approach (Bonan et al., 2021); where
    the plant canopy is assumed as a big leaf and the water flux from vegetation is
    regulated by canopy stomatal conductance (Luo et al., 2018). This ET estimation
    can be further improvised by a multilayer canopy model (Bonan et al., 2021). The
    crop models are being successfully combined with climate models as future yield
    simulation requires future climatic data, which can be derived from the climate
    models from different scenarios (Boonwichai et al., 2019). The local future bias-corrected
    climate data from the crop models are being successfully derived in several research
    works. They arise from the global or regional climate models, by various statistical
    or dynamical downscaling techniques followed by different bias correction methodologies.
    Similarly, these climate models can combine with hydrological models for future
    flow simulations and thus generate flood inundation maps, which help in crop planning
    and management. In combination with the modeling and simulation process, the Multi-Criteria
    Decision Making (MCDM) process also plays an immense role for the decision-makers
    for agricultural systems management. Several research works suggest the global
    applications of MCDM techniques like analytical hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy
    analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) for land suitability, land quality assessments,
    site selection for suitable irrigation system implementation, and water harvesting
    structures (Kumar and Jhariya, 2015; Neissi et al., 2019; Özkan et al., 2020;
    Paul et al., 2020; Tiwari et al., 2018). The MCDM informs decision-makers about
    the suitability assessments of agricultural systems by generating weights of the
    different layers that have been obtained from GIS. These layers include land-use
    land cover, terrain, land slope, hydrologic information, hydrogeologic information,
    socioeconomic information, crop information, and soil data. It has been also reported
    that the MCDM in combination with hydrological models and optimization can reduce
    the uncertainty associated with the solution adopted by the decision-makers to
    identify suitable zones for crop planning and management (Kumar et al., 2021).

    as effective tools for predicting crop yield and anticipating the impacts of climatic
    change on crop growth and yield. Adequately calibrated and evaluated models based
    on sound physiological data can extrapolate alternative cropping cycles and locations.
    Properly calibrated and validated models can contribute efficiently and cost-effectively
    to the sustainable development of agriculture. An overview of different crop models,
    hydrological models, and AI-based models is presented in Table 3. Table 3. General

    Name Description Freely available Programming language Parameters requirements
    Specific aspects ANN Uses the processing of the brain as a basis to develop algorithms
    that can be used to model complex patterns. ✓ Python, C++, JavaScript, Java, Julia,
    Scala, R., MATLAB Moderate • Require processors with parallel processing power,
    by their structure. For this reason, the realization of the machine is dependent
    • After learning from the initial inputs and their relationships, it can infer
    unseen relationships on unseen data as well, thus making the model generalize
    and predict on unseen data. ELM A type of feedforward neural network for classification,
    regression, clustering, and feature learning with a single layer or multiple layers
    of hidden nodes, where the parameters of hidden nodes need not be tuned ✓ Python,
    Scala, C++, Golang, MATLAB Moderate • Major strength is that the hidden layers''
    learning parameters, including the biases and input weights, do not have to be
    iteratively tuned. Hence the ELM is capable of achieving faster speeds and lower
    costs • Able to bridge the gap between biological learning machines and conventional
    learning machines • Not capable of managing large high dimensional data since
    it needs more hidden nodes compared to the conventional tuning algorithms GPR
    A probabilistic supervised machine learning framework that has been widely used
    for regression and classification tasks by making predictions incorporating prior
    knowledge (kernels) and providing uncertainty measures over predictions ✓ Python,
    R, MATLAB, Julia Low • The prediction by GPR is probabilistic (Gaussian) so that
    one can compute empirical confidence intervals and decide based on those if one
    should refit (online fitting, adaptive fitting) the prediction in some region
    of interest. • GPR loses efficiency in high dimensional spaces – namely when the
    number of features exceeds a few dozens. SVM A supervised learning model with
    associated learning algorithms that analyze data for classification and regression
    analysis ✓ Python, Java, C++, R, JavaScript, MATLAB Low • Works relatively well
    when there is a clear margin of separation between classes. • Effective in cases
    where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples. • Does not
    perform very well when the data set has more noise i.e. target classes are overlapping.
    • In cases where the number of features for each data point exceeds the number
    of training data samples, the SVM will underperform. RFR A supervised learning
    algorithm that uses the ensemble learning method for regression. It operates by
    constructing several decision trees during training time and outputting the mean
    of the classes as the prediction of all the trees ✓ Python, R, Java, C++, Golang,
    MATLAB Moderate • Uses the single best variable when it splits responses at each
    node of decision trees and averages the predictions of the trees in the forest
    to make a multidimensional step function • The behavior of the RF model may be
    less intuitive to interpret than traditional regression models because its algorithm
    consists of an ensemble of a large number of decision trees that may not be fully
    described mechanistically. • With RF, only the values included in training data
    are used for splitting regression trees and thus lumping the predictions for the
    conditions outside the range of training data. This means making predictions beyond
    the training data range is impractical because of the inherent inability to extrapolate
    to data dimensions (e.g., future climate) where no training has been done. This
    limitation of RF regression could be critical since at least some part of the
    current crop field is expected to have new and more extreme environmental conditions
    in the future that did not exist in the past and present data domains. To date,
    although much work has been done based on crop modeling and the application of
    hydrological models for crop models applying the CSA, yet the universal superiority
    of any particular model cannot be predicted (Battisti et al., 2017; Palosuo et
    al., 2011; Rötter et al., 2012; Salo et al., 2016). Applications and results of
    all the models vary along with problem definitions, input data quality, quantity,
    field expertise, uncertainty, parameter quantifications, modeling errors, performance
    criteria, and computational ability. Fig. 5 depicts a conceptual framework for
    optimal crop planning and agricultural water management system by integrating
    the hydrological model with the crop model with a simulation optimization structure.

    Fig. 5. A conceptual framework of simulation and optimization structure for optimal
    crop planning and agricultural water management systems. Mathematical models have
    several limitations, which may be grouped into two major classes, i.e., conceptual
    limitations and application-oriented limitations. Conceptual limitations are related
    to the representation of the actual process or natural system with the mathematical
    model. For example, analytical models are limited by certain initialized assumptions
    and inherent simplifying assumptions that may not apply to an actual field problem
    with complex conditions. Application-oriented limitations occurred due to the
    solution procedure used in the model development, or the effort required to implement
    the solutions. For example, errors that occurred in numerical modeling due to
    the approximation of the governing differential equations in those models, are
    commonly known as numerical errors. These include truncation errors and numerical
    dispersions. The discretization of time and space also influences the models.
    Several models suffer from numerical instabilities, which leads to unrealistic
    oscillating solutions if a sufficiently small-time step is not used. The disadvantage
    is that the computational cost involved in the modeling process increases as the
    time step decreases. Spatial discretization also depends upon the spatial variability
    of model parameters, physical boundaries of the system, and the type of models
    used. Model limitations constrain finer spatial discretization, data handling
    limitations, runtime, and computational costs. Besides these modeling errors,
    numerical models are also limited by their complexity of applications, and therefore
    to minimize this limitation, proper training and expertise are needed for the
    efficient application of numerical models. Preparation of inputs for complex modeling
    may be time-consuming, even with recently developed high-end computers. A relatively
    fast computer is necessary to analyze complex problems using numerical modeling.
    In association with the above problems, achieving the required familiarity level
    in modeling is time-consuming and expensive. Hence, it could be prohibitive when
    funding and time are limited. Besides manual calibration techniques, several autocalibration
    techniques have been applied to crop simulation models for parameter estimation.
    Such autocalibration techniques include different optimization algorithms. Examples
    of such combinations are AquaCrop-PSO (Jin et al., 2017a), WOFOST-PSO (Bai et
    al., 2019), DSSAT with general likelihood uncertainty estimation (GLUE) (DSSAT-GLUE)
    (Ma et al., 2020), stochastic crop modeling with Bayesian Monte Carlo approach
    (Marin et al., 2017), genetic algorithm (GA) (DSSAT-HYDRUS 2D-GA) (Roy et al.,
    2019). There are significant structural dissimilarities between physically-based
    and AI-based models. The physically-based models are more advantageous for determining
    the reasons for variation in yield and may have robustness in non-stationarity
    relationships between weather and crop yield. In contrast, the AI-based models
    can perform extensively well for reproducing historical weather-induced yield
    variation at regional scales (Watson et al., 2015). The complex nature of the
    agricultural system, which copes with several factors affecting crop yield, significantly
    calls for nonlinear methods to elucidate the relationships between these factors
    and crop performances. The inadequacy of the physically-based model in terms of
    time, computational cost consumption, and operational complexity indicates the
    AI base models in agriculture, are becoming a widely exciting area of research
    in the near future. However, the performance behaviors of several AI-based models
    differ from place to place and from problem to problem, similar to physically-based
    models. Therefore, it cannot be concluded that a particular AI-based model is
    superior to all other models in all contexts. ANN models are more fault-tolerant
    than AI models like SVM, ELM, and RF. That is, they can handle incomplete data
    and noise, and they can solve non-linear problems. Also, trained ANNs, can generalize
    at high speed and make predictions. However, proper selection of ANN parameters
    like the optimum number of layers and the number of hidden nodes is still in a
    trial-and-error phase. Thus, ANN is always considered as an empirical black-box
    model with associated improper training and over-fitting issues. However, proper
    training and overfitting issues may improve with time and quantum of data. Analogous
    to physically-based models, several optimization algorithms and hybridization
    methods are being widely used with the traditional AI-based models for applications
    in the agricultural domain. Several research works reveal numerous weight update
    techniques in the field of neural network modeling in agriculture, out of which
    the backpropagation technique is very common. The backpropagation method is one
    of the fastest, simple, and most good standard methods for training feed-forward
    neural networks. The input variables are only numbers with no specific parameters.
    The backpropagation method includes calculus-based training algorithms like Levenberg-Marquardt
    and conjugate gradient, which are faster in nature, but these algorithms face
    problems of being stuck in local minima (Dela Cruz et al., 2017; Mustika and Nugroho,
    2018). Several nature-inspired algorithms are being used to overcome the problem
    for the training of ANN and other AI-based models which lead to the model hyperparameters
    optimization and conclusively model improvements; out of those, GA, and PSO are
    widely used (Gu et al., 2017; Sabzi and Abbaspour-Gilandeh, 2018). However, several
    research works have described the applicability of other nature-inspired optimization
    algorithms that are used in the agricultural modeling field such as the firefly
    algorithm (FA), artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm, whale optimization algorithm
    (WOA), and several other algorithms (Ehteram et al., 2019; Ghorbani et al., 2018;
    Jian et al., 2018; Mohammadi and Mehdizadeh, 2020; Sabzi et al., 2018; Wu et al.,
    2019). The AI-based models offer extended synchronization with already working
    models, by providing missing and time-worn information. For instance, Rosetta
    and ANN-based models can be effectively aligned with the bootstrap method, and
    thus offer uncertainty estimates of the predicted soil hydraulic parameters (Schaap
    et al., 2001). 5. Conclusions The current review systematically collated and presented
    new and innovative modeling approaches toward CSA with techno-feasible solutions.
    It focused on the concept of the modeling-oriented CSA system. The present review
    has also explored the pervasive applicability of crop simulation models coupled
    with hydrological models and RS data for different agricultural management practices.
    With insights into the amalgamation of the physically-based crop models, AI, and
    RS technologies significantly contribute to cost-effective and refined solutions
    that enable better crop and the state of environment estimation, field management,
    and decision-making. This deliberation on convenient CSA examples and could act
    as an information retreat for researchers and policymakers to improve agro-hydrological
    studies, water resource management, crop improvements, and cleaner technologies.
    The review highlighted the primary governing factors, novel applications, and
    limitations of different modeling applications. We believe the deliberations made
    in this review would facilitate academicians, policymakers, and stakeholders in
    selecting suitable modeling techniques for potential applications under CSA and
    strengthening sustainable agricultural practices. Authors'' contributions Debaditya

  description: Considering the high quality requirements related to agricultural production,
    the intelligent prediction of sprinkler drip infiltration quality (SDIQ) of the
    moisture space distribution in soil fields is an important issue in precision
    irrigation. The objective of this research is to adaptively predict an optimal
    data set of SDIQ indices using a robust prediction algorithm called the regulated
    sparse autoencoder–niche particle swarm optimization (RSAE-NPSO) system, so that
    the SDIQ indices of various irrigated layers of loam, sandy, chernozem, saline–alkali,
    and clay soils can be predicted and analyzed. This prediction procedure involves
    the following steps. First, the drip infiltration effectiveness of the moisture
    on specific irrigated soil layers is measured. Second, a complete set of SDIQ
    indices used for assessing the moisture space distribution is introduced. Third,
    an analytical framework based on the RSAE-NPSO algorithm is established. Fourth,
    the intelligent prediction of SDIQ indices using RSAE-NPSO computation is achieved.
    This research indicates that when the irrigation parameters include the sprinkling
    pressure (Pw) at 224.8 KPa, irrigation duration time (Id) at 2.68 h, flow discharge
    amount (Fq) at 1682.5 L/h, solar radiation (Sr) at 17.2 MJ/m2, average wind speed
    (Aw) at 1.18 m/s, average air temperature (At) at 22.8◦C, and average air relative
    humidity (Ah) at 72.8%, as well as the key variables of the irrigation environment,
    including the soil bulk density (Sb) at 1.68 g/cm3, soil porosity (Sp) at 68.7%,
    organic carbon ratio (Oc) at 63.5%, solute transportation coefficient (St) at
    4.86 × 10−6, evapotranspiration rate (Ev) at 33.8 mm/h, soil saturated hydraulic
    conductivity rate (Ss) at 4.82 cm/s, soil salinity concentration (Sc) at 0.46%,
    saturated water content (Sw) at 0.36%, and wind direction Wd in the north–northwest
    direction (error tolerance = ±5%, the same as follows), an optimal data set of
    SDIQ indices can be ensured, as shown by the exponential entropy of the soil infiltration
    pressure (ESIP) at 566.58, probability of moisture diffusivity (PMD) at 96.258,
    probabilistic density of infiltration effectiveness (PDIE) at 98.224, modulus

    high agreement between the predicted and actual measured SDIQ indices is achieved.
    RSAE-NPSO has extraordinary predictive capability and enables much better performance
    than the other prediction methods in terms of accuracy, stability, and efficiency.
    This novel prediction method can be used to ensure the infiltration uniformity
    of the moisture space distribution in sprinkler drip irrigation. It facilitates
    productive SDIQ management for precision soil irrigation and agricultural crop
    production.

    Figures Versions Notes Abstract Considering the high quality requirements related
    to agricultural production, the intelligent prediction of sprinkler drip infiltration
    quality (SDIQ) of the moisture space distribution in soil fields is an important
    issue in precision irrigation. The objective of this research is to adaptively
    predict an optimal data set of SDIQ indices using a robust prediction algorithm
    called the regulated sparse autoencoder–niche particle swarm optimization (RSAE-NPSO)
    system, so that the SDIQ indices of various irrigated layers of loam, sandy, chernozem,
    saline–alkali, and clay soils can be predicted and analyzed. This prediction procedure
    involves the following steps. First, the drip infiltration effectiveness of the
    moisture on specific irrigated soil layers is measured. Second, a complete set
    of SDIQ indices used for assessing the moisture space distribution is introduced.
    Third, an analytical framework based on the RSAE-NPSO algorithm is established.
    Fourth, the intelligent prediction of SDIQ indices using RSAE-NPSO computation
    is achieved. This research indicates that when the irrigation parameters include
    the sprinkling pressure (Pw) at 224.8 KPa, irrigation duration time (Id) at 2.68
    h, flow discharge amount (Fq) at 1682.5 L/h, solar radiation (Sr) at 17.2 MJ/m2,
    average wind speed (Aw) at 1.18 m/s, average air temperature (At) at 22.8 °C,
    and average air relative humidity (Ah) at 72.8%, as well as the key variables
    of the irrigation environment, including the soil bulk density (Sb) at 1.68 g/cm3,
    soil porosity (Sp) at 68.7%, organic carbon ratio (Oc) at 63.5%, solute transportation
    coefficient (St) at 4.86 × 10−6, evapotranspiration rate (Ev) at 33.8 mm/h, soil
    saturated hydraulic conductivity rate (Ss) at 4.82 cm/s, soil salinity concentration
    (Sc) at 0.46%, saturated water content (Sw) at 0.36%, and wind direction Wd in
    the north–northwest direction (error tolerance = ±5%, the same as follows), an
    optimal data set of SDIQ indices can be ensured, as shown by the exponential entropy
    of the soil infiltration pressure (ESIP) at 566.58, probability of moisture diffusivity
    (PMD) at 96.258, probabilistic density of infiltration effectiveness (PDIE) at
    98.224, modulus of surface radial runoff (MSRR) at 411.25, infiltration gradient
    vector (IGV) at [422.5,654.12], and normalized infiltration probabilistic coefficient
    (NIPC) at 95.442. The quality inspection of the SDIQ prediction process shows
    that a high agreement between the predicted and actual measured SDIQ indices is
    achieved. RSAE-NPSO has extraordinary predictive capability and enables much better
    performance than the other prediction methods in terms of accuracy, stability,
    and efficiency. This novel prediction method can be used to ensure the infiltration
    uniformity of the moisture space distribution in sprinkler drip irrigation. It
    facilitates productive SDIQ management for precision soil irrigation and agricultural
    crop production. Keywords: soil irrigation; sprinkler drip infiltration quality;
    prediction; moisture space distribution; RSAE-NPSO 1. Introduction It is well
    known that sprinkler-irrigated agriculture plays crucial roles in global water
    resource usage. Sprinkler drip infiltration, as an essential issue in agricultural
    irrigation, is critical for soil tillage and crop cultivation. Prediction of the
    quality of the sprinkler irrigation, known as the sprinkler drip infiltration
    quality (SDIQ), is highly necessary and important in order to regulate the moisture
    space distribution, and can ensure that the soil irrigation process is highly
    productive. Owing to the varied infiltration characteristics and moisture contents
    in the typical soil types of Guangzhou city, such as loam, sandy, chernozem, saline–alkali,
    and clay soils, the intelligent prediction of the SDIQ values of these soil types
    is imperative to ensure high efficiency and good sprinkler irrigation performance,
    facilitating the satisfactory maintenance of crop cultivation areas. However,
    detailed investigations from a moisture space distribution perspective remain
    scarce. According to the moisture infiltration principles for infield soil during
    the sprinkler irrigation process, the SDIQ can be determined from the drip infiltration
    mechanism. These infiltration phenomena cause cumulative infiltration when the
    final moisture content reaches the critical limit, particularly in the optimized
    deep learning enhancement of the infiltration effect prediction process [1,2].
    By analyzing the drip infiltration mechanism, many intelligent prediction models
    have been developed to describe the drip infiltration effectiveness, accounting
    for the dispersion of the moisture distribution properties of different soil specimens.
    Certain novel examples include measuring the combined water infiltration in cracked
    soils and data misalignment [3], multiple linear regression models [4], moisture
    variation simulations [5], and infiltration investigations of soil texture and
    environmental conditions [6]. In view of the inhomogeneous properties of drip-irrigated
    soils, Cui et al. [7] developed a multi-stage calculation method for a moisture
    infiltration analysis in unsaturated soil spaces based on the stochastic evaluative
    theory. Concurrently, a complete wavelet cointegration prediction analysis for
    irrigation water infiltration based on multi-parameter coupling was conducted
    to depict the statistical properties of infiltration effectiveness [8,9]. Although
    these studies have provided a theoretical basis for the infiltration quality prediction
    of sprinkler drip irrigation, a systematic analysis of SDIQ characteristics not
    limited to traditional discussions based on pure experimental investigations or
    direct empirical predictions has not yet been presented. In contrast to the above-mentioned
    analyses, convolutional neural networks have been frequently used to describe
    the drip infiltration process in clay loam soil [10], while parametric modeling
    and infiltration quality prediction processes have also been conducted for the
    applied irrigation depths at the farm level [11]. Yassin et al. [12] investigated
    the influence of gene expression programming in furrow irrigation on the infiltration
    effectiveness of crop irrigation. Moreover, furrow irrigation using artificial
    neural networks and nitrate accumulation and leaching beneath groundwater-irrigated
    corn fields [13,14] have been proposed as approaches to study the moisture space
    distribution during the drip infiltration process. These mentioned approaches
    have also been introduced and applied in modeling gypsifereous soil infiltration
    for the purpose of evaluating the whole-field irrigation performance, simulating
    the soil water movement during canal irrigation, and determining the accuracy
    of different water infiltration models [15,16,17,18]. In this domain, the effects
    of sprinkler drip infiltration variability on irrigated soils can be accurately
    obtained, and can be employed to verify the probabilistic quality model using
    machine learning for sprinkler drip infiltration [19,20,21]. These studies have
    analyzed the characteristics of soil irrigation and the prediction of infiltration
    quality, particularly considering the complex effects of sprinkler drip irrigation,
    areas that deserve increased attention. The moisture distribution of infield soil
    has also been investigated. It is well known that conventional infiltration effect
    estimation is mainly based on experimental data from standard soil specimens,
    and the complex effects of the moisture space distribution characteristics are
    frequently ignored. Sengupta et al. [22] studied the effects of machine-learning-based
    prediction models based on the deficit irrigation and moisture distribution characteristics.
    Actual infiltration index evaluations should be based not only on the soil properties
    but also on the infiltration development theory under the continuous sprinkler
    drip irrigation process [23]. Owing to the inherent limitations of traditional
    drip infiltration evaluation tests [24,25,26,27], it is necessary to analyze the
    complex effects of moisture infiltration on the irrigation scheduling and field
    capacity of multi-layered agronomic soils [28,29]. Moreover, regarding infiltration
    quality predictions, studies [30,31,32,33,34,35] have reported the latest investigative
    results in terms of predictive optimization for estimating on-the-spot infiltration
    quality. It is understandable that SDIQ predictions cover the majority of soil
    irrigation performance results and present original suggestions for enhancing
    the drip infiltration productivity. However, this new topic of SDIQ determination
    considering the complex influence of soil characteristics is still in a state
    of infancy, and its advancement is the motivation of the current study on precision
    irrigation. The objective of this research is to adaptively predict an optimal
    data set of SDIQ indices using RSAE-NPSO, so that the SDIQ indices of various
    irrigated layers of loam, sandy, chernozem, saline–alkali, and clay soils can
    be predicted and analyzed. Based on this research, the infiltration quality of
    infield soils could be monitored and improved, meaning the high quality requirements
    for sprinkler drip irrigation performance could also be reached. Motivated by
    the need to adaptively predict the SDIQ of the moisture space distribution, Section
    2 presents the methods and materials, including the SDIQ indices of the moisture
    space distribution, the working mechanism of the regularized sparse autoencoder,
    and the working mechanism of the NPSO approach incorporated with the RSAE. Thereafter,
    Section 3 concentrates on the results and discussion, including the experiment
    preparation, experimental data measurements, intelligent prediction of SDIQ indices,
    significance analysis using F-ratio tests, and calibration coefficients of prediction
    error, which are all investigated in detail, contributing to the conclusions drawn
    in Section 4. 2. Methods and Materials 2.1. SDIQ Indices of Moisture Space Distribution
    Since the accurate prediction of the SDIQ is one of the most critical and complex
    problems in sprinkler drip irrigation, the inverse logarithm variable of the drip
    infiltration probability for the moisture space distribution, φ, is a function
    of the infield drip-causing infiltration coefficient τo, the maximum infiltration
    rate Zo, the exponential entropy of soil infiltration pressure Nfk (ESIP), and
    the soil volume subjected to infiltration effectiveness ΔV, which is expressed
    as follows: ln 1 𝜑( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓 ) ≅ 𝜏 𝐶 𝑜 𝑍 −ℎ 𝑜 𝑁 𝑒 ( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓 )Δ𝑉 (1) Above, C = 3, h
    = 7/3, and e = 9/8 for an instantaneous drip–soil contact and e = 10/9 for continuous
    contact of a sprinkling water drip into a soil field [20,21]. The drip-causing
    infiltration index τo determines the durability of the moisture concentration,
    which ensures a uniform distribution of water and infiltration effectiveness over
    the total area of the irrigated soil field. The drip irrigation determining the
    infiltration quality can be calibrated using the maximum orthogonal infiltration
    rate, σ. This is comparable to the depth of the infiltrated soil level, so that
    the infiltration quality determines the influence of the moisture content and
    soil infiltration on the survival probability. The mathematical equation determining
    the SDIQ of infield soil is demonstrated as follows [22,23]: ln 1 𝜑 𝑥𝜓 ( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓
    ;𝜃) ≅ 𝜎 𝐶 𝑥𝜓 ( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓 ;𝜃) 𝑍 −ℎ 𝑥𝜓 𝑁 𝑒 ( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓 ;𝜃)Δ 𝑉 𝑥𝜓 (2) Here, the moisture
    content subjected to various soil infiltrated layers, ΔVxψ, could be defined as
    the product of the elementary water/soil mass ratio measured in the targeted soil
    specimen, Δψ(Nfk)·rbx, and the volume determined by the monitored field area,
    Δx. The drip infiltration depth at which the maximum infiltration rate occurs,
    Zxψ, is as follows: Δ 𝑉 𝑥𝜓 =Δ𝜓( 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓 )· 𝑟 𝑏𝑥 Δ𝑥 𝑍 𝑥𝜓 (3) Here, N is the infiltration
    depth subjected to infield soil. The infield infiltration depends mainly on soil
    types and the moisture space distribution [24,25,26]. Traditional methods require
    large amounts of parametric data and long-term experimental testing; this is particularly
    difficult under actual irrigation conditions owing to the rapid advances in agricultural
    crop production. Herein, the SDIQ of infield soil is proposed for the statistical
    analysis of irrigation test results, including the exponential entropy of soil
    infiltration pressure (ESIP), probabilistic density of infiltration effectiveness
    (PDIE), infiltration gradient vector (IGV), modulus of surface radial runoff (MSRR),
    probability of moisture diffusivity (PMD), and normalized infiltration probabilistic
    coefficient (NIPC). Therefore, the mathematical correlation between the infiltration
    depth, Nf, and the drip infiltration quality index, P, can be determined. The
    coefficients c0 and c1 characterize the moisture regression of the infiltration
    quality of infield soil, providing a clear description of P depending on Nf, which
    is denoted as the probability of moisture diffusivity (PMD) [28,29,30]: lg 𝑁 𝑓
    = 𝑐 0 + 𝑐 1 ·arcsin 𝑃 − − √ 𝑃( 𝑁 𝑓 )= sin 2 [ lg 𝑁 𝑓 − 𝑐 0 𝑐 1 ] (4) The function
    of the normal distribution density for the infiltration effectiveness of infield
    soil is as follows: 𝑝( 𝑁 𝑓 ;𝑃,Σ)= 1 (2𝜋) 𝑛 |Σ| − − − − − − − √ exp(− 1 2 ( 𝑁 𝑓
    −𝑃) 𝑇 Σ −1 ( 𝑁 𝑓 −𝑃)) (5) Above, Nf is the random variable of the infiltration
    depth based on its normal distribution, and the drip infiltration quality, P,
    is the mathematical expectation of Nf, which is expressed as P = (Nfx, Nfy)T.
    Here, Σ is the covariance matrix of Nf [31]; therefore, the computational function
    of the normal distribution covariance matrix is expressed as: Σ=[ 𝜎( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 , 𝑁
    𝑓𝑥 ) 𝜎( 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 ) 𝜎( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 ) 𝜎( 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 ) ] (6) Above, Nfx = Nfy
    = P, σ(Nfx, Nfx) = σ(Nfy, Nfy) = σ22, σ(Nfx, Nfy) = σ(Nfy, Nfx) = 0. To simplify
    the predictive analysis, a fast Fourier transformation (mathematical) is applied
    to determine the spectrum of the probabilistic density of the drip infiltration
    depth, which can be updated with the probabilistic frequency of the controlled
    parameter sampling. This yields the following mathematical expression of infiltration
    quality [32,33]: 𝑆 𝑑 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )= ∑ 𝑦=1 𝑀−1 ∑ 𝑥=1 𝑁−1 𝑠( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 )×exp(−𝑗 2𝜋 𝑁
    𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘),𝑘=0,…,𝑁−1 (7) Above, Sd(Nfk) denotes the probabilistic density of
    infiltration effectiveness (PDIE) and s(NfxNfy) denotes the moisture infiltration
    gradient vector (IGV). Thus, the modulus of surface radial runoff (MSRR) can be
    given as [34,35]: 𝑆 0 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )= ∑ 𝑦=1 𝑀 2 −1 ∑ 𝑥=1 𝑁 2 −1 𝑠 0 (𝑚𝑛)×exp(−𝑥𝑦 2𝜋
    𝑁 𝑚 𝑘 𝑛 𝑘 ),𝑘=0,…, 𝑀𝑁 2 −1 𝑆 1 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )= ∑ 𝑦=1 𝑀 2 −1 ∑ 𝑥=1 𝑁 2 −1 𝑠 1 (𝑚𝑛)×exp(−𝑥𝑦
    2𝜋 𝑁 𝑚 𝑘 𝑛 𝑘 ),𝑘=0,…, 𝑀𝑁 2 −1 (8) Above, the moisture distribution variables of
    drip infiltration exponents on different soil layers can be represented by the
    bounds of the cumulative density function (CDF). Let the CDF of spectrum variable
    k be Nfk. For any k ∈ K, there is a closed interval [Nf_lowerk, Nf_upperk] that
    satisfies Nf_lowerk < Nfk < Nf_upperk. Nf_lowerk and Nf_upperk stand for the envelopes
    of the probability family of infiltration effectiveness. The drip infiltration
    exponents of a soil field at time t can be characterized by [36]: 𝑆 𝑙 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘
    )=𝜇 ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜑( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ;𝜃)𝑑𝑡+𝛿 𝐵 𝐻 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ) (9) Above, φ(Nfk;θ) stands for the nonlinear
    drift term of the overall infiltration trend, μ is the drift coefficient, θ is
    a vector with unknown parameters, δ is a constant moisture diffusion coefficient,
    and BH(Nfk) is fBm. A generalized drip infiltration model describing the moisture
    space distribution can be obtained by replacing μ and δ by the time functions
    φ(x) and ω(x), respectively. Thereafter, the interference term BH(Nfk) is replaced
    by ψ(x), meaning Equation (9) can be rewritten as [37,38]: 𝑆 𝑙 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )=𝜙( 𝑁
    𝑓 𝑘 ) ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜑( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ;𝜃)𝑑𝑡+𝜔( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )𝜓( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ) (10) This investigation considers
    the drip infiltration process as a random interference term with regulated drip
    infiltration properties. This means that the general expression of the drip infiltration
    model is as follows: 𝑆 𝑙 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )=𝜙( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ) ∫ 𝑡 0 𝜑( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ;𝜃)𝑑𝑡+𝜔( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )
    𝑆 𝑑 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ) (11) Simplifying this drip infiltration model yields the following
    form: 𝑆 𝑙 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )=𝜇𝜑( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 )+𝛿 𝑆 𝑑 ( 𝑁 𝑓 𝑘 ) (12) Above, μ and δ are the drift
    and diffusion parameters of the drip infiltration model, respectively. Here, φ(Nft)
    is a time-dependent function used to describe the overall trend of the probability
    density of the moisture content diffusivity, equivalent to the normalized infiltration
    probabilistic coefficient Nfxiqua (NIPC), and which can be described by the linear,
    power rate, and exponential drift functions [37,38]. Based on this arrangement,
    the mathematical properties of SDIQ can be described. 2.2. Working Mechanism of
    Regularized Sparse Autoencoder To accurately predict the SDIQ indices of sprinkler
    drip irrigation, two fundamental problems need to be solved before developing
    the prediction algorithm: (1) the irrigation parameters should be determined accurately
    and robustly to establish the objective SDIQ function; (2) the influence of the
    irrigation performance should be analyzed to accelerate the convergence velocity
    and calculation accuracy of the prediction process. Therefore, the concept of
    RSAE-NPSO is proposed based on the unique integration of a regularized sparse
    autoencoder (RSAE) and niche particle swarm optimization (NPSO), and is employed
    for the intelligent prediction of SDIQ indices. This integrated system first uses
    the RSAE network to extract the drip infiltration properties of infield soil,
    and subsequently the NPSO provides a high-efficiency tool to predict the SDIQ
    indices for the mechanism investigation and performance promotion of sprinkler
    drip irrigation. The RSAE is an excellent autoencoder that can be used to determine
    the SDIQ indices, according to the measured raw data of irrigation performance
    rates, since it incorporates index extraction and process quantification in a
    general-purpose prediction system [38,39]. Both the supervised and unsupervised
    irrigation data are combined in the RSAE framework to improve the regression results,
    based on the functional combination of the clustering and reasoning algorithms.
    The clustering algorithm is applied to identify the clusters of test samples with
    similar mathematical characteristics. Subsequently, a reasoning algorithm is developed
    for each of the previously identified clusters. The SDIQ indices are denoted as
    unlabeled data { 𝐼 𝑑 [( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 );𝜇, 𝜎 2 ]} 𝑀 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑘 𝑓𝑥=1,𝑓 𝑦 =1 . The
    RSAE–decoder uses a mapping function f to calculate the mathematical properties
    of SDIQ indices, as denoted by 𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑘 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 , from Id[(Nfxk,Nfyk);μ,σ2] [40,41].
    𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑘 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 =𝑓( 𝐼 𝑑 [( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 );𝜇, 𝜎 2 ])= 𝜎 𝑟 ( 𝑊 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 𝐼 𝑑 [( 𝑁
    𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 );𝜇, 𝜎 2 ]) (13) Above, WRSAE denotes the weight matrix of RSAE.
    Here, σr(z) is a rectified linear unit employed as an activation function in the
    RSAE–decoder, which guarantees more efficient training during network prediction
    than other traditional functions. Thus, the RSAE–decoder reconstructs { 𝐼 ⌢ 𝑑
    [( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 );𝜇, 𝜎 2 ]} using a mapping function gRSAE: 𝐼 ⌢ 𝑑 [( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘
    , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 );𝜇, 𝜎 2 ]= 𝑔 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 ( 𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑘 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 )= 𝑊 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸2 𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑘 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 (14)
    In order to learn various drip infiltration indices, the cost function of the
    RSAE is proposed as: min 𝑊 1 2 𝑀 𝑘 𝑁 𝑘 ∫ 𝑀 𝑘 1 ∫ 𝑁 𝑘 1 ( | 𝐼 ⌢ 𝑑 ( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁
    𝑓𝑦 𝑘 )− 𝐼 𝑑 ( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 )| 2 )𝑑 𝑥 𝑘 𝑑 𝑦 𝑘 + 𝜆 𝑥 𝑘 𝑦 𝑘 ∫ 𝑀 𝑘 1 ∫ 𝑁 𝑘 1 (|
    𝐻 𝑀 𝑘 𝑁 𝑘 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 |)𝑑 𝑥 𝑘 𝑑 𝑦 𝑘 𝑠.𝑡. 𝑊 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸1 · 𝑊 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸2 =𝐸 (15) Above, WRSAE1 or WRSAE2
    denotes the weight matrix of the RSAE, ensuring that its computational performance
    is maintained in a highly efficient state. Here, λxkyk denotes the regular coefficient
    of the RSAE corresponding to the meshed grid coordinated by (Nfxk, Nfyk). As WRSAE1
    and WRSAE2 are replaced by W and WT, the gradient of JRSAE with respect to W is
    calculated as follows: ∇𝐽= ∂ 𝐽 𝑅𝑆𝐴𝐸 ∂𝑊 =[( 1 𝑀 𝑘 𝑁 𝑘 𝑊·𝐷+ 𝜆 𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑦 𝑘 ·sgn)· 𝜎
    𝑟 ′(𝑊·( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 ))] ( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 ) 𝑇 + 1 𝑀 𝑘 𝑁 𝑘 𝜎 𝑟 (𝑊·( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘
    , 𝑁 𝑓𝑦 𝑘 ))× 𝐷 𝑇 (16) Above, D = WTσr(W∙(Nfxk,Nfyk)) − (Nfxk,Nfyk), sgn denotes
    the sign function of σr(W∙(Nfxk, Nfyk)), σr′ denotes the derivative function of
    the rectified linear unit, σr, and (Nfxk, Nfyk) denotes the matrix form of (Nfxk)
    and (Nfyk). The reiterative update process of W(i+1,j+1) can be written as: 𝑊
    (𝑖+1,𝑗+1) = 𝑊 (𝑖,𝑗) − 𝜂 (𝑖,𝑗) 𝐻 (𝑖,𝑗) 𝐽 (𝑖,𝑗) (17) Above, i and j are the ith
    and jth intervals of the update process of WRSAE1 and WRSAE2, respectively; H(i,j)
    denotes the inverse of the Hessian matrix [42,43], and η denotes the step size
    of the SDIQ update process. The RSAE is trained an adequate number of times, allowing
    the drip infiltration properties of the soil field to be accurately calculated
    and inputted into the NPSO algorithm for the highly efficient calculation of SDIQ
    indices, making NPSO an universal and reliable prediction network for infiltration
    qualities [44,45]. Figure 1 illustrates the operational levels and data transmission
    in the architecture of the RSAE. From this figure, it can be learned that the
    RSAE ranges across the measurement, calculation, and prediction levels. As the
    drip infiltration process is described by the SDIQ monitoring tools, the real-time
    soil infiltration data collected by the soil moisture gauge, data grating system,
    and computing platform are transferred into a complete module in charge of the
    infiltration measurement, the regularized autoencoder, the data input interface,
    and condition monitoring. As all these function modules are located at the calculation
    level, they comprise a constructive data preparation platform for the predictive
    workstation interface, where the feature calculation of SDIQ is implemented. Then,
    the resultant data set can be inputted into enclosed data processing circles,
    in which the statistical modeling, calculation error compensation, infiltration
    prediction, and condition assessment are implemented in sequence. All of these
    data transmission and information processes happen around the center of the intelligent
    prediction system in a bi-directional way. The novel architecture design of the
    RSAE gives us high flexibility in the SDIQ data processing mechanism when the
    sprinkler drip infiltration is monitored instantaneously. Figure 1. The operational
    levels and data transmission in the architecture of the RSAE. 2.3. Working Mechanism
    of NPSO Incorporated with RSAE In this research, we propose an improved NPSO search
    algorithm based on the niche group collaboration to complete the prediction of
    the ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC. The technological advances of the NPSO
    system provide new tools for the optimized prediction of the drip infiltration
    quality. For the purpose of SDIQ index prediction, the solutions in the NPSO search
    space are called the objective particles of computational variables. All of these
    objective particles have their own position vectors, velocity vectors, and fitness
    values, which are determined by the optimized calculation function. This function
    initializes an appropriate group of random particles denoting the given neuron
    variables; thus, the global search solution of the SDIQ index is chosen by calculating
    the optimized index values in several iterations. In this computational architecture,
    each network neuron on a specific layer is connected to all participant neurons
    on the next network layer via direct data links that consist of different network
    weights, meaning the structure of NPSO can be established. To construct a highly
    efficient RSAE-NPSO system, first a training process is conducted to adapt this
    computational network to the complex probabilistic conditions of moisture infiltration.
    This is achieved by adjusting the related neuron weights when different input–output
    data pairs are employed. It is well known that the drip infiltration specifications
    determine the numbers of RSAE network neurons in the input and output layers;
    the number of hidden layers and their topological sizes are determined using the
    testing set of NPSO trial procedures. Moreover, the objective data clustering
    of SDIQ indices is achieved using the multi-layer state perceptrons for the purpose
    of infiltration quality comparisons. In this comprehensive SDIQ prediction process,
    a ten-fold cross-validation scheme is followed to implement exhaustive calculation
    tests of data regression techniques for SDIQ indices [46]. Based on this architectural
    design, Table 1 summarizes the parametric arrangements as the objective function
    (quasi-Monte Carlo simulation) and penalty function being used. Table 1. Parametric
    arrangements of the RSAE-NPSO system. In this table, 𝑁 𝑓𝑋 𝑖 𝑇 =( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 1 , 𝑁
    𝑓𝑥 𝑖 2 ,…, 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 𝑇 ) denotes the solution space vector of the SDIQ index group,
    which shows that the ith parameter group can be used as the optimal self-adaptive
    searching path, while 𝑁 𝑓𝑋 𝑔𝑏 𝑇 =( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 1 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 2 ,…, 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 𝑇 ) stands
    for the solution space vector of the globally optimal parameter group. Here, 𝑁
    𝑓𝑋 𝑙𝑏 𝑇 =( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 1 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 2 ,…, 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 𝑇 ) denotes the solution space vector
    of the locally-optimal parameter group, and 𝑆 𝑖 𝑡 denotes the self-adaptive optimal
    search direction for the parameter group: 𝑆 𝑖 𝑡 → = 𝑐 𝑖 𝑠 𝑖 𝑡 → ⊕ 𝑐 2 ( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏
    𝑡 − 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 𝑡−1 )⊕( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 𝑡 − 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 𝑡−1 ) (18) Here, 𝑠 𝑖 𝑡 ∈ 𝑆 𝑖 𝑡 ; thus,
    𝑆 𝑖 𝑡 → = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         𝑣 𝑖 𝑡 → 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 𝑡 − 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑔𝑏 𝑡−1 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑙𝑏 𝑡 − 𝑁

    1 𝑠 1 + 𝑐 2 𝑠 2 + 𝑐 3 𝑠 3 <𝑆≤1 (19) Therefore, the solution space for the parameter
    group at the next time point can be expressed as 𝑁 𝑓𝑋 𝑖 𝑡+1 = 𝑁 𝑓𝑋 𝑖 𝑡 ⊕ 𝑉 𝑖 𝑡
    , where 𝑁 𝑓𝑋 𝑖 𝑡+1 =( 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 1 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 2 ,…, 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 𝑡 , 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑖 𝑡+1 ,) . The solution
    space coordinates of every SDIQ index group can be updated constantly until 𝑆
    𝑖 𝑇 ≤𝜉 , where ξ denotes the convergence range of the SDIQ calculation error.
    Here, the logical architecture for the data collection and processing control
    in sprinkler drip infiltration provides a highly efficient data processing platform
    for the RSAE-NPSO prediction system composed of a data sensor, database, computation
    workstation, and process monitoring module. It could be seen that when the raw
    data for soil moisture infiltration are measured, the collected data set sourced
    from the irrigation rate and infiltration speed must be processed in the data
    sensor module located at the measurement level, which is followed by the data
    pre-processing, SDIQ index extraction, and RSAE function selection stages. The
    predictive computation process includes data filtering, statistical analysis,
    and regulated classification at the calculation level. When the moisture infiltration
    analysis is performed, the processed data for the ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD,
    and NIPC are transmitted to the computation workstation for the predictive calculation,
    and then to the process monitoring unit for real-time network coordination at
    the prediction level, so that the computed results transmitted and stored in the
    database can be employed freely for the RSAE-NPSO statistical prediction. To verify
    the established NPSO network, the SDIQ indices should be validated. During the
    process of SDIQ index prediction, a few samples of experimental data and random
    prediction errors are considered by using the bootstrap and probability box methods.
    Thus, the global optimum can be determined as 𝑔𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡=min(𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑘= 𝑛 𝑘 3,𝑖=1 ,𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠
    𝑡 𝑘= 𝑛 𝑘 3,𝑖=2 ,𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑘= 𝑛 𝑘 3,𝑖=3 ,…,𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑘= 𝑛 𝑘 3,𝑖= 𝑛 𝑘 ) , and the positions
    and velocities of every particle are updated according to their individual and
    adjacent optimums as follows: 𝑣 𝑘+1 𝑖 =𝜔· 𝑣 𝑘 𝑖 + 𝜆 1 ·𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 𝑖 − 𝑁 𝑓𝑥
    𝑘 𝑖 )+ 𝜆 2 ·𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑑(𝑝𝐵𝑒𝑠 𝑡 𝑘 3,𝑖 − 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 𝑖 ) 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘+1 𝑖 = 𝑁 𝑓𝑥 𝑘 𝑖 + 𝑣 𝑘 𝑖 ;𝜔(𝑘)=
    𝜔 max −( 𝜔 max − 𝜔 min )·𝑘/ 𝑛 𝑘 (20) Based on the logical architecture and computational
    data flow of the RSAE-NPSO prediction system, the data hub of the SDIQ indices
    provides a monitored data set for ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC. Therefore,
    the data processing, decision-making, information collection, and integrative
    control during SDIQ index prediction can be implemented freely. It is also noteworthy
    to point out that such key elements of soil moisture measurements as loop control,
    decision-making support, data processing, data acquisition, and communication
    between the measurement sensors and prediction modules are all interconnected
    to each other through the bi-directional data channel. This unique network architecture
    ensures high computational accuracy and flexible environmental adaption during
    SDIQ index prediction in practice. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Experiment Preparation
    A set of sprinkler drip irrigation tests were carried out at the campus field
    of Guangzhou University (23°03′1.23″ N, 113°24′3.92″ E), from 1 July 2020 to 30
    June in 2021 and from 08:00 to 18:00 every day. The experimental field has several
    typical soil types from the Guangzhou city area, such as loam, sandy, chernozem,
    saline–alkali, and clay soils, which were tested for their unique physical, chemical,
    and biological properties, as detailed in Table 2. Guangzhou has a subtropical
    climate where drought is rarely seen, with a mean annual temperature range of
    21.5–22.6 °C, precipitation range of 1623.6–899.8 mm, and evapotranspiration rate
    of 1603.5 mm, according to the past 60 years of weather records referenced from
    the meteorological agency of Guangzhou metropolitan region: Guangzhou weather
    records from January 1960 to December 2020. Available online: http://gd.cma.gov.cn/gzsqxj/
    and https://data.gz.gov.cn/odweb/catalog/catalogDetail.htm?cata_id=98083 (accessed
    on 20 June 2021). Zoysia matrella was selected as the irrigated plant due to its
    robust adaptation to climate and external environments, making this test ideal
    for SDIQ prediction and growth control in objective soil field. Table 2. The physical
    properties of tested soil types. In order to achieve the adaptive prediction of
    SDIQ indices, the sprinkler drip irrigation platform was composed of the 350HW-8S
    fluid-intensifier pumps (Yancheng Harriston Int’l Co., Ltd., Yancheng, China),
    the revolving HX-3301-1 sprinkler nozzles (Taizhou Hengxin Valve Tech., Taizhou,
    China), the NPS2 CLASS150 pressure valves (Sichuan Saier Valve Mfg. Co., Ltd.,
    Zigong, China), the PVC pressure pipes (Jiangsu Haiwei Plastics Industry Technology
    Co., Ltd., Jiangyin, China), the BONAD RS485 soil moisture sensors (BND-MS10)
    (Shenzhen Bonad Precision Instrument Co., Ltd., Shenzhen, China), and other components,
    including a solar cell panel, charging controller, storage battery, inverter,
    electric control box, circuit controller, and strainer. For the accurate prediction
    of infiltration rates, clods of soil crust with a thickness of 10 cm on different
    infiltrated-depth layers were sampled out after each test. The average distribution
    of water precipitation was measured over a rectangular area measuring 5 × 5 m2
    under calm conditions. Environmental parameters such as the average air temperature,
    average relative humidity, and solar radiation were collected every 10 min. Moreover,
    the local air temperature was measured using an HW-F7 thermometer (LD Products
    Inc. Long Beach City, CA, USA), the air relative humidity was determined using
    Testo 610 hygrometers (Testo Pty Ltd., Croydon South, Victoria, Australia), the
    solar radiation value obtained from an LI-1500 irradiance radiometer (HUATEC.,
    Beijing, China), and the wind speed was measured using RK100-02 RS485 wind speed
    measurement units (RIKA Sensor Inc., Changsha, China). The measurements of soil
    moisture evaporation were carried out using 40 sets of microlysimeters, which
    were equally distributed throughout whole field area. A moderate flow pressure
    of 320 kPa was applied to ensure the infiltrated soil depths were measured easily.
    A pair of sprinkler heads with a vertical height of 80 cm were placed at the linear
    interval of 2.5 m to provide a uniformly distributed soil wetting pattern and
    to guarantee a wetting diameter overlap of 55–60% at all times. 3.2. Experimental
    Data Measuring A highly efficient and precise monitoring procedure of the sprinkler
    drip irrigation tests could be conducted when the following requirements were
    met: sufficient number of irrigation cycles, sufficient amount of water to achieve
    complete coverage of the irrigated area, and adequate moisture concentration to
    achieve the drip infiltration effect, which can be easily measured and clearly
    differentiated from other types of noise interference. A total of 100 sets of
    soil fields were prepared to undergo sprinkler drip irrigation, and 10 grid positions
    in each set of irrigated fields were targeted and monitored for the data measurement
    of infield soil, while the soil moisture content or drip infiltration rate was
    checked once every 10 min. The least-squares interpolation method was applied
    to calculate the SDIQ indices at any coordinate position between two monitored
    points that could not be measured by the soil moisture sensor directly [47,48].
    The following influential irrigation and environmental parameters were shown:
    sprinkling pressure (Pw/KPa), irrigation duration time (Id/h), flow discharge
    amount (Fq/L/h), solar radiation (Sr/MJ/m2), average wind speed (Aw/m/s), average
    air temperature (At/°C), average air relative humidity (Ah/%), soil bulk density
    (Sb/g/cm3), soil porosity (Sp/%), organic carbon ratio (Oc/%), solute transportation
    coefficient (St/×10−6), evapotranspiration rate (Ev/mm/h), soil saturated hydraulic
    conductivity rate (Ss/cm/s), soil salinity concentration (Sc/%), saturated water
    content (Sw/%), and wind direction (Wd) [49]. Because the parametric data in Table
    3 conformed to the stochastic normal distribution of experimental variables, their
    equalized intervals were applied to cover 97% of all possible values, with the
    lowest value denoted as “1” and the highest as “10”. Based on these equalized
    intervals, other parametric grouping stages were achieved sequentially. Therefore,
    the value ranges can be defined to ensure the high repeatability of the testing
    conditions, providing accurate data ranges and facilitating subsequent quantified
    computation in RSAE-NPSO. Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7 and Table 8 list
    the representative parametric sets of sprinkler drip irrigation data for loam
    soil (A), sandy soil (B), chernozem soil (C), saline–alkali soil (D), and clay
    soil (E), based on orthogonal test arrangements. The moisture content on each
    soil layer was obtained from 100 × 10 = 1000 grid positions, covering 94–96% of
    the overall irrigated zone. Table 3. Partitioned levels of sprinkler drip irrigation
    parameters. Table 4. Orthogonal test parametric arrangement for sprinkler drip
    irrigation in loam soil. Table 5. Orthogonal test parametric arrangement for sprinkler
    drip irrigation in sandy soil. Table 6. Orthogonal test parametric arrangement
    for sprinkler drip irrigation in chernozem soil. Table 7. Orthogonal test parametric
    arrangement for sprinkler drip irrigation in saline–alkali soil. Table 8. Orthogonal
    test parametric arrangement for sprinkler drip irrigation in clay soil. Although
    the SDIQ indices were influenced by numerous irrigation parameters and environmental
    variables, only the major and controllable ones were considered. Here, Pw and
    Id were determined using the BF1000-3EB-X full-bridge moisture content gauges
    buried on each soil subsurface layer. Fq, Sr, and Aw were obtained by using a
    DN6-DN300 metering system and calibrated before each test. At and Ah were monitored
    using a Coriolis mass flow meter and transmitted online via signal acquisition
    using a quadratic encoder. Concurrently, Sb, Sp, Oc, St, Ev, Ss, Sc, Sw, and Wd
    were determined by employing the prearranged parametric data [50]. It is worth
    noting that a computer-controlled data acquisition system was applied to collect
    the irrigation data [51,52,53,54]. When the sprinkler drip irrigation test began,
    the measured vertical depths of infiltrated soil ranged from 0 m to 0.8 m, labeled
    as layers A to E, as shown in Figure 2, offering effective observations of the
    moisture space distribution. Based on the error differences between the measured
    and predicted data, RSAE-NPSO defined the adjustment coefficients of network weights,
    and subsequently triggered a set of predictive calculations. Furthermore, one
    decision-making threshold in the prediction-acting unit, based on the least square
    error between the irrigation parameters and the SDIQ indices, was employed; thus,
    the best SDIQ indices were determined to minimize the total prediction error.
    Based on these network optimization steps, the effective and ineffective influential
    variables were differentiated. The latter were redirected to the next cycle of
    coefficient adjustment until accurate neuron weight selection was ensured to allow
    process stabilization and calculation convergence for accurate SDIQ prediction.
    Figure 2. The kernel density figure describing the drip infiltration on the example
    soil surface. Here, the key distributive area with high SDIQ values is identified
    by white circles. 3.3. Intelligent Prediction of SDIQ Indices As an effective
    data analysis and processing algorithm, RSAE-NPSO offers a powerful tool to solve
    the problem of irrigation infiltration calibration with broad SDIQ prospects.
    It uses on-the-spot drip infiltration information to make objective classification,
    regression estimation, pattern recognition, trend prediction, data clustering,
    trend analysis, and causal analysis decisions. Based on this standard initialization,
    its iteration number is set as 16,500, the reporting interval is set as 0.15 s,
    the mean square error is 0.200, and the update interval is 0.15 s. The inputs
    (irrigation parameters and key environmental variables) and outputs (SDIQ indices)
    form logical predictive correlations. Figure 2 presents the obtained kernel density
    diagram describing the drip infiltration properties, as labeled from Test A_1
    to Test E_10. In this figure, the key distributive areas with high SDIQ values
    are identified by white circles, while the drip infiltration indices on different
    soil layers show upward and downward trends, respectively. Moreover, this figure
    suggests that the drip infiltration coverage on a given irrigated area maintains
    a close correlation with the probability density of SDIQ indices. For instance,
    when the rate of drip infiltration coverage ranges from 68% to 84%, the probabilistic
    distribution density of the PDIE is in the range of (80%, 90%), and when the former
    influential factor ranges from 91% to 95%, the latter resultant variable is in
    the range of (85%, 98%). Figure 3 gives us a detailed data illustration of the
    drip infiltration phenomena considering the moisture space distribution on layers
    A–E, with the distribution highlighted in high-contrast color areas and the white
    circles in the data-constructed pictures denoting the high-concentration areas
    of moisture distribution. Figure 3. Data illustration of drip infiltration considering
    the moisture space distribution labeled as sampled layer A. Here, 25% of the experimental
    cases were used for RSAE-NPSO training, while the other cases were used for testing
    to reduce the unexpected signal disturbances caused from the test environment
    and data measurements. Figure 4, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 7 and Figure 8 present
    the loam soil specimen and its SDIQ indices on layers A–E sequentially. Similarly,
    Figure 9, Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14 demonstrate
    the actual and predicted SDIQ values of chernozem soil on tests A_1 to E_10. All
    of these index values were normalized into the data range of (0–100) for a better
    understanding and easy comparison. In Table 3, it can be seen that the values
    were in high agreement under different testing conditions. Figure 4. The loam
    soil specimen and its corresponding SDIQ index values obtained from the sampled
    layer A. Figure 5. The loam soil specimen and its corresponding SDIQ index values

    The computational neuron numbers of the RSAE have an important influence on the
    prediction accuracy of SDIQ indices. To improve the reasoning performance, the
    NPSO algorithm was applied to optimize the number of neurons on each RSAE layer,
    thanks to its high precision, short analysis time, and ease of implementation.
    Moreover, the mathematical degradation for the SDIQ index is included in the RSAE-NPSO,
    which transforms the input irrigation and environmental parametric data into the
    hidden layers, where the feed-forward multi-layer perceptron method is used. To
    quantify the numerical variation in SDIQ indices, Figure 15 demonstrates the comparative
    relationship between the actual measured and predicted results. The inclined full
    line denotes the 1:1 standard ratio between the predicted and actual measured
    indices, while the red points stand for the ratio results. The mathematical errors
    between them were quantified and traced back to the fluctuations in truncation
    error or external environmental interference. Furthermore, Figure 16, Figure 17,
    Figure 18, Figure 19, Figure 20 and Figure 21 illustrate data comparisons based
    on the prearranged conditions. Figure 15. Accuracy comparison between the actual
    measured and predicted SDIQ indices considering soil types. Figure 16. Comparison
    between the actual and predicted ESIP values in typical soil types. Figure 17.

    IGV values in typical soil types. Figure 21. Comparison between the actual and
    predicted NIPC values in typical soil types. From these figures, it could be observed
    that Pw, At, and Fq should be focused on to determine Sb, Sp, Oc, St, Ev, Ss,
    Sc, Sw, and Wd, because they have a remarkable influence on ESIP, PDIE, and PMD,
    presenting intensified accuracy improvements of up to 33–35% of NIPC after one
    complete epoch of RSAE-NPSO prediction. The irrigation parameters of Aw and At
    cause 16–18% reductions in the stability of PDIE and IGV, owing to increased information
    entropy or measurement chaos. The change tendencies of At, Ah, and Sb indicate
    that IGV and MSRR decrease by 15–18%, depending on Fq, Sr, Aw, and their accompanying
    variation. In contrast, PDIE and IGV were found to be most sensitive to the correlation
    mechanism of Pw, Id, Fq, Sr, Aw, and At, owing to the high drip infiltration rate.
    PMD and NIPC are sensitive to Sp, Oc, St, Ev, Ss, Sc, and Sw, owing to the corresponding
    variation in drip infiltration conditions. It can also be found that when a set
    of irrigation parameters such as Pw = 224.8 KPa, Id = 2.68 h, Fq = 1682.5 L/h,
    Sr = 17.2 MJ/m2, Aw = 1.18 m/s, At = 22.8 °C, and Ah = 72.8%; and key variables
    of the irrigation environment, including Sb = 1.68 g/cm3, Sp = 68.7%, Oc = 63.5%,
    St = 4.86 × 10−6, Ev = 33.8 mm/h, Ss = 4.82 cm/s, Sc = 0.46%, Sw = 0.36%, and
    Wd (north–northwest; error tolerance = ±5%, the same as follows) were prepared,
    an optimal data set of ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC could be obtained
    for the purpose of improving the performance quality of the sprinkler drip irrigation
    approach [55]. 3.4. Significant Analysis Using F-Ratio Tests The RSAE-NPSO system
    has two modes of predictive reasoning: causal and diagnostic reasoning. Causal
    reasoning provides tools for predicting what might occur under the presented experimental
    condition, which could be used to determine the statistical characteristics of
    drip infiltration properties. On the other hand, diagnostic reasoning refers to
    the exploration of possible causes of a known irrigation event or inherent moisture
    infiltration characteristics, whereby the posterior probability of the hypothesis
    variable is accurately calculated and used to predict the remarkable variation
    trends related to drip infiltration. Thus, RSAE-NPSO addresses a query of SDIQ
    indices precisely through using basic probability formulae for predictive reasoning.
    To implement a quality inspection for the RSAE-NPSO prediction, the F-ratio criterion
    is used to describe the variance importance of SDIQ indices. Here, p denotes the
    number of SDIQ index levels, and there are mj levels for the jth index, where
    each value level is tested c times; n denotes the total number of orthogonal irrigation
    tests; the obtained values for SDIQ verification cases are marked as x1, x2, …,
    xn, and K1, K2, …, Kmj denote the sum of levels of the jth index with respect
    to the testing time [56]: 𝐾= 𝐾 1  + 𝐾 2  +…+ 𝐾 mj ; 𝑈= 1 𝑚 𝑗 𝑐 𝐾 2 ;𝑊= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛
    𝑥 𝑖 2 ;𝑄= 1 𝑐 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝑗 𝐾 𝑖 2 (21) Thus, the square sum of variance  𝑆𝑆 𝑗 = 1
    𝑐 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑚 𝑗 𝐾 𝑖 2 − 1 𝑚 𝑗 𝑐 𝐾 2 ; degree of variance freedom:  𝑑𝑓 𝑗 = 𝑚 𝑗 −1;
    (22) total square sum:  𝑆𝑆 𝑇 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑥 𝑖 2 − 1 𝑚 𝑗 𝑐 𝐾 2 ; total degree of variance
    freedom:  𝑑𝑓 𝑇 =𝑛−1; (23) square sum of SDIQ error:  𝑆𝑆 𝑒 = 𝑆𝑆 𝑇 − ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑝 𝑆 𝑆
    𝑗 (24) degree error of variance freedom: 𝑑 𝑓 𝑒 =𝑑 𝑓 𝑇 − ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑝 𝑑 𝑓 𝑗 (25) mean
    square value:  𝑀𝑆 𝑗 = 𝑆 𝑆 𝑗 𝑑 𝑓 𝑗 ; mean square value of error:  𝑀𝑆 𝑒  𝑆 𝑆 𝑒 𝑑
    𝑓 𝑒 ; F−ratio:  𝐹 𝑗 = 𝑀 𝑆 𝑗 𝑀 𝑆 𝑒 (26) Thus, the weighted sum of F-ratio can be
    expressed as follows: 𝐹 𝑎𝑙𝑙 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑝 𝐾 𝑗 𝐹 𝑗 𝑝 (27) To confirm the RSAE-NPSO
    prediction quality based on the comparative evaluations of significance level,
    a set of evaluation coefficients were designed using Equations (21)–(27) [57].
    A high F-ratio implies the closeness of the predicted SDIQ indices to the actual
    measured value. Table 9 presents the variance analysis results using test set
    D_8 for the sprinkler drip irrigation as an example. Here, the predicted values
    of ESIP, PMD, PDIE, MSRR, IGV, and NIPC were evaluated in the domains of SSe,
    DfT, Q, Fj, and P, whereby ** represents a highly significant influence, * denotes
    a significant influence, and O indicates no influence. Thus, the predictive quality
    levels of SDIQ indices were calibrated in a clear mathematical manner. Table 9.
    Variance analysis of sprinkler drip infiltration quality indices using F-ratio
    tests. Here, the normality and homogeneity tests of participant parametric variance
    were performed to give a more clear explanation of the statistical analysis. The
    F values, significance levels, and values of SDIQ indices showed the normality
    and homogeneity of those irrigation parameters and the condition variance to be
    reliable. The frequency data can be used for the variance analysis of ESIP, PMD,
    PDIE, MSRR, IGV, and NIPC. For example, the F-ratio variance test of ESIP and
    NIPC indicated that there were significant differences among different SDIQ groups
    (F = 15.886, p = 0.0002 (<0.05)). Similarly, there were significant differences
    for the PMD and PDIE groups (mean F-ratio values of 17.42 and 19.06, respectively,
    p = 0.0154 (<0.05)) and MSRR group (mean F-ratio value of 18.97, p = 0.0315 (<0.05)).
    Finally, for the IGV and NIPC groups (mean F-ratio values of 15.98 and 17.79,
    respectively, p = 0.0010 (>0.05)), there was no significant difference between
    the means of SDIQ values from several RSAE-NPSO prediction trials. All of these
    values of SSe, DfT, Q, Fj, and P sourced from the variance F-ratio tests showed
    the slightly lower heritability values than those corresponding to the original
    SDIQ index data. The normality and homogeneity variability studies in this research
    were likely proposed to satisfy the SDIQ index prediction conditions. In this
    research, the tested samples of soil infiltration effectiveness were used to classify
    the fluctuations in SDIQ indices, such as the fluctuations caused by the variations
    in irrigation parameters or environmental conditions. Because RSAE-NPSO is conditionally
    independent, only the local network map adjacent to the computational neurons
    was focused on. In the predictive calculations, as long as the state of relevant
    neurons is known, the occurrence probability of computational neurons can be estimated.
    Therefore, the complexity of the knowledge acquisition and predictive reasoning
    processes can be reduced. These tested samples provided important references to
    demonstrate the complex influence of irrigation parameters on the SDIQ prediction
    process. As can be seen from Table 10, the significance level showing the high
    significance of the SDIQ indices demonstrates the variance characteristics of
    the SDIQ; the effects of Pw, Id, and Fq on IGV and MSRR are remarkable, while
    Sr, Aw, At, and Ah have larger impacts on PMD and NIPC than on other SDIQ indices.
    Simultaneously, the influence of Pw, Sp, Oc, and Sc on ESIP, IGV, and MSRR cannot
    be ignored. Further analysis shows that Ah, Sb, and Sp have the most influence
    on PDIE and IGV, whereas Pw, Id, At, and Sp are crucial in terms of the infiltration
    quality deviations. After identifying the mathematical effects of these parameters,
    the optimized results of the RSAE-NPSO system can be anticipated by controlling
    the corresponding factors. A comparison of IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC values for
    the given soil samples with and without using the optimized irrigation parameters
    demonstrated the remarkable improvements achieved by the RSAE-NPSO prediction
    approach. Table 10. Performance assessment of SDIQ index prediction method for
    different example soil sets. 3.5. Calibration Coefficients of Prediction Error
    This research also proposes the following calibration coefficients to evaluate
    the accuracy and reliability of RSAE-NPSO prediction, namely the mean absolute
    error (MAE) [49], root mean square error (RMSE) [50], mean percentage error (MAPE)
    [51], percent error of prediction results (Err) [52], correlative error (Corr)
    [53], and relative exponent error (Rob) [54,55], as follows: 𝑀𝐴𝐸= 1 𝑚𝑛 ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑛

    these calibration coefficients for the predicted results using the soil samples
    from A_1 to E_10, Table 10 summarizes the comprehensive prediction evaluation.
    The ESIP and PDIE values show that the efficiency and reliability of this novel
    prediction for sandy and chernozem soils maintain remarkable correlations with
    IGV, MSRR, and PMD, especially when At and Sr are highly focused. RSAE-NPSO has
    strong processing capability for data uncertainty in the determination of MSRR
    and NIPC values. It uses the conditional probability density to express the correlation
    mechanism among various influential factors, which makes the learning and reasoning
    of SDIQ indices under different limited, incomplete, and uncertain conditions
    possible. Even when the experimental SDIQ data are not rich, they can be quantified
    using the expert estimations and statistical corrections or by utilizing the expectation
    maximization (EM). Therefore, RSAE-NPSO combines adaptive prediction and extension
    reasoning to ensure the reliability and stability of SDIQ indices. Here, the MAPE
    of the RSAE-NPSO predictive performance with respect to the probabilistic concentration
    of the drip infiltration notably maintains close relations with Ah, Sb, Sp, and
    Oc when the PMD and NIPC are considered. This is particularly obvious in the irrigation
    cases when saline–alkali soil and clay soil are considered. The MAPE provides
    a critical criterion for Aw, At, Ah, Sb, and Sp; thus, the IGV effectively assesses
    the multi-source information expression and data fusion of the drip infiltration
    properties. This shows that it is suitable for the heterogeneous infiltration
    knowledge representation and reasoning under uncertain irrigation conditions.
    ESIP and PDIE provide reliable mathematical models for uncertainty knowledge representation
    and logical reasoning in the case of SDIQ determination. The predictive reasoning
    principle of RSAE-NPSO is essentially a set of probability calculations considering
    the influences of mean SDIQ percentage errors. The RMSE provides a reliable reference
    criterion related to the drip distribution balance when Id, Sp, and Wd are considered.
    Its value variation causes a corresponding fluctuation in the predictive precision
    of PMD and NIPC when Sr, Aw, and At are concerned. RSAE-NPSO has causal and probabilistic
    semantics, which facilitate the combination of prior knowledge and a probability
    distribution of infiltrated moisture in the experimental cases involving chernozem
    and clay soil. Furthermore, it effectively avoids overfitting and ensures the
    robustness of the prediction of PDIE and IGV, considering the fluctuations in
    Ah, Sb, Sp, Oc, St, and Ev values. Regarding the irrigation cases of loam and
    sandy soil, Err presents close correlations with ESIP, PDIE, and IGV when Sr,
    Aw, At, Ah, Sb, Sp, and Oc are considered, and it is remarkably affected by the
    water mass redistribution also. The quantitative knowledge regarding moisture
    infiltration includes edge and conditional probabilities, which should be fully
    considered in the computation of MSRR and PMD. Because the quantitative relationships
    (probabilities) are mainly derived from the statistical calculations, the professional
    literature, and expert experience, the RSAE-NPSO system has a conditional independence.
    It only needs to consider the finite variables associated with the Sb, Sp, Oc,
    St, Ev, Ss, Sc, Sw, and Wd variables, making the SDIQ determination approach a
    feasible solution in many complex infiltration prediction cases. The Corr parameter
    can be used to regulate the PDIE, IGV, and MSRR calculations and to monitor the
    drip infiltration quality based on the boundary subsurface of infield soil. This
    quality inspection coefficient describes the critical influence of Oc, St, and
    Ev on sandy and chernozem soils. This highly depends on the value ranges of MSRR,
    PMD, and NIPC when Sb, Sp, Oc, St, and Wd are observed closely. This refers to
    the structural relationship with the prediction network and expresses the mathematical
    correlations between PDIE, MSRR, and PMD. The qualitative relationships between
    all SDIQ indices are mainly derived from expert experience, the professional literature,
    and statistical learning. Using this coefficient, RSAE-NPSO can be used to deal
    with different prediction errors. The Rob parameter shows that the predictive
    calculation is strongly influenced by Aw, Sb, Sp, Ev, and Ss, and that its operational
    mechanism is remarkably affected by the accuracy of the Pw, Oc, St, Ev, Ss, Sc,
    and Sr values, particularly in the irrigation of clay and saline–alkali soil.
    RSAE-NPSO itself is a calculation system that visualizes the probabilistic representation
    and reasoning computation processes to determine the mathematical and conditional
    correlations between various neuron variables. IGV, MSRR, and NIPC describe the
    interrelationships among the drip infiltration data via graphic representations
    of relative exponent error, with clear semantics, making this approach easy to
    understand. The mathematical description of Rob makes it easy to assess the consistency
    and integrity of SDIQ indices and to demonstrate the RSAE-NPSO module in the investigation
    of sprinkler drip infiltration. All of the above-mentioned comparative analyses
    indicate that a stable and reliable SDIQ can be ensured by ESIP at 566.58, by
    PMD at 96.258, by PDIE at 98.224, by MSRR at 411.25, by IGV at [422.5,654.12],
    and by NIPC at 95.442 (error tolerance within ±5%). Based on this prediction result,
    an extensive comparative analysis was performed to quantify the applicability
    and efficiency of this new prediction method compared with other frequently used
    methods as follows: (1) a poly tree propagation-based algorithm (PTP); (2) a clique-tree
    propagation-based algorithm (CTP); (3) the graph reduction method (GR); (4) the
    stochastic sampling, search-based, model simplification, and loopy propagation
    (SMSLP) method; (5) the least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) method; (6)
    the multiple linear regression (MLR) method; (7) MLR-GR; (8) the MLR-GR self-organizing
    map (MLR-GR-SOM) method; (9) NPSO-SOM models [56,57,58,59,60]. Table 11 provides
    a performance comparison of SDIQ index prediction results using RSAE-NPSO and
    other methods under identical test conditions. The computation accuracy (%) and
    standard deviation (%) of the network training and testing, together with the
    average computation storage (kb), computation time (s), standard error of prediction
    (%), and the upper and lower error limits of confidence intervals, were selected
    as the calibration coefficients. The calculation performance of the RSAE-NPSO
    is highlighted in bold font in the first column. It can be seen that LSSVM and
    MLR have relatively larger calculation errors, which shows that traditional machine
    learning models cannot adequately fit the complex NPSO problems in this investigation.
    The deep learning approach deals with the SDIQ index prediction better than other
    approaches, while simultaneously the prediction errors of NPSO-SOM, CTP, and SMSLP
    are less than for MLR-GR-SOM. In addition, the predicted SDIQ index facilitates
    the performance profiling of the drip infiltration approach at different soil
    depths, and provides a convenient method to build predictive functions for calibrating
    the moisture space distribution in practice. Table 11. Performance comparison
    of SDIQ index prediction results using RSAE-NPSO and other typical methods. As
    the working mechanism of the RSAE-NPSO prediction approach offers an effective
    tool for investigating the drip infiltration characteristics, the proposed SDIQ
    indices comprehensively describe the moisture space distribution effectively.
    Because the statistical evaluation of the predictive performance was conducted
    under identical irrigation test conditions, it can be observed that RSAE-NPSO
    outperforms the other prediction methods in terms of precision and reliability.
    This novel method describes the dynamic values of SDIQ indices corresponding to
    actual measured values with low estimation errors, and contributes to the optimal
    prediction of ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC. The confidence interval is
    set as 94% of the reference level, which covers all possible values of SDIQ indices.
    The average computational accuracy of this new proposed prediction system reaches
    97.58% in training and 97.42% in testing operations, together with the standard
    deviations of SDIQ indices, which reach 0.296% and 0.256%, respectively. This
    system requires only 1.88 s to complete an entire calculation epoch with the provided
    computation platform. The other outstanding operating capabilities of RSAE-NPSO
    can be observed from its average computational storage size of 1856.2 kb, standard
    error of 4.15%, and upper and lower error limits of 5.14% and 3.25%, respectively.
    RSAE-NPSO has the following advantages: it not only demonstrates causal relations
    among different prediction-making tasks in a robust form, but also integrates
    useful drip infiltration characteristics under uncertain test conditions. Therefore,
    the number of network neurons can be remarkably reduced to avoid over-fitting
    and excessive reasoning. MLR, MLR-BR, and MLR-BR-SOM methods ensure robust predictive
    calculations of PDIE and MSRR that are suitable for describing the distribution
    spectrum of IGV. The LSSVM method achieves excellent predictive performance for
    the SDIQ indices, particularly when MSRR, PMD, and NIPC are highly emphasized.
    NPSO-SOM, PTP, and CTP present precise predictive results for ESIP and PDIE. Concurrently,
    GR and SMSLP show satisfactory capabilities in terms of the computation accuracy
    of ESIP, MSRR, and NIPC. Overall, because the probabilistic density of the sprinkler
    drip infiltration method monitored by the RSAE can help the NPSO process to obtain
    higher accuracy when calculating the SDIQ indices, RSAE-NPSO possesses much better
    operating advantages than alternative systems, supporting its robust predictive
    quality. From the comprehensive experimental description and discussion of the
    result regarding RSAE-NPSO prediction, it can be summarized that with irrigation
    parameters of Pw at 224.8 KPa, Id at 2.68 h, Fq at 1682.5 L/h, Sr at 17.2 MJ/m2,
    Aw at 1.18 m/s, At at 22.8 °C, and Ah at 72.8%, as well as key irrigation environmental
    variables of Sb at 1.68 g/cm3, Sp at 68.7%, Oc at 63.5%, St at 4.86 × 10−6, Ev
    at 33.8 mm/h, Ss at 4.82 cm/s, Sc at 0.46%, Sw at 0.36%, and Wd as north–northwest,
    the optimal SDIQ indices of ESIP at 566.58, PMD at 96.258, PDIE at 98.224, MSRR
    at 411.25, IGV at [422.5,654.12], and NIPC at 95.442 could be achieved. This novel
    prediction method contributes greatly to performance improvements in soil infiltration
    using sprinkler drip irrigation and agricultural crop production in practice.
    4. Conclusions In this study, a new intelligent prediction method called RSAE-NPSO
    is proposed to determine the SDIQ indices of moisture space distribution in irrigated
    soil fields, with loam, sandy, chernozem, saline–alkali, and clay soils being
    tested. We consider the influence of soil characteristics and focus on specific
    irrigation parameters (Pw, Id, Fq, Sr, Aw, At, Ah) and key variables of the irrigation
    environment (Sb, Sp, Oc, St, Ev, Ss, Sc, Sw, Wd). This research makes the following
    theoretical and technological contributions. It presents the accurate prediction
    of SDIQ indices for moisture space distribution analyses. Based on the comparison
    of these predicted indices with actual measurement data, we show that the average
    relative error between them is within ±5%, which clearly verifies the accuracy
    and correctness of the SDIQ estimation process. A novel RSAE-NPSO system is designed
    and subsequently its working mechanism and constructive effects on the SDIQ predictive
    computation are examined. A complete set of SDIQ indices are covered, including
    ESIP, PDIE, IGV, MSRR, PMD, and NIPC. A quality inspection is performed to assess
    the predicted SDIQ results from innovative perspectives, meaning the prediction
    accuracy and calculation stability of the RSAE-NPSO system are confirmed. This
    research compares the SDIQ indices obtained from the RSAE-NPSO system with those
    of other typical prediction methods under identical test conditions, confirming
    the extraordinary accuracy, generalizability, and logical reliability of this
    newly proposed prediction method. Therefore, the irrigation efficiency and infiltration
    quality of soil fields can be monitored instantaneously and planned precisely,
    while the SDIQ prediction also facilitates remarkable improvements in agricultural
    crop production under complex working conditions. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Under tropical conditions, Hass avocado irrigation is a controversial issue due
    to insufficient scientific evidence. The rapid progression of technological advances
    and its incorporation in agriculture have expanded options to improve the irrigation
    scheduling (IS) of Hass avocado. The concept featuring those technological advances
    in agriculture is digital agriculture (DA). Here, we present a mixture of well-known
    studies in the Hass avocado irrigation focused on proximal sensing (PS) technologies
    and recent studies emphasizing the potential of remote sensing (RS), and application
    technologies to schedule the irrigation. PS takes advantage of the soil or trees''
    proximity to output reliable measurements with a high temporal resolution, while
    RS provides a broad set of spectral data in continuous and large areas that can
    be transformed into crop-related biophysical variables. Applications – a term
    grouping mobile (smartphone) apps, desktop programs, and web-based platforms –
    offers portability, high precision, and graphic visualization of variables obtained
    or estimated by sensors. Integrating RS and PS technologies through user-friendly
    applications can represent a suitable option to improve Hass avocado irrigation

  description: Food security is an issue that arises as a result of the rising population
    since population growth decreases agricultural land, leading to water scarcity.
    Agriculture requires large amounts of water, but water scarcity forces farmers
    to irrigate their crops with little or low-quality water, leading to the idea
    of developing smart irrigation. The challenge is how to manage the interactions
    between plants, growing media, microclimate, and water using manufactured systems.
    Good irrigation management will minimize the occurrence of poor irrigation design.
    This review is a way to present various methods and approaches for using sensors,
    controllers, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence in irrigation
    systems with a focus on improving water use efficiency. The study uses SCOPUS
    indexed publications and proceedings to study the evolution of irrigation information
    technology over the last eleven years. We hope this review can serve as a source
    of information to broaden the validity of the findings of irrigation monitoring
    and control technologies and help researchers identify future research directions
    on this subject.

  description: 'In agriculture, given the global water scarcity, optimizing the irrigation
    system have become a key requisite of any semi-automatic irrigation scheduling
    system. Using efficient assessment methods for crop water stress allows reduced
    water consumption as well as improved quality and quantity of the production.
    The adoption of Neural Network can support the automatic in situ continuous monitoring
    and irrigation through the real-time classification of the plant water stress.
    This study proposes an end-to-end automatic irrigation system based on the adoption
    of Deep Neural Networks for the multinomial classification of tomato plants’ water
    stress based on thermal and optical aerial images. This paper proposes a novel
    approach that cover three important aspects: (i) joint usage of optical and thermal
    camera, captured by un-manned aerial vehicles (UAVs); (ii) strategies of image
    segmentation in both thermal imaging used to obtain images that can remove noise
    and parts not useful for classifying water stress; (iii) the adoption of deep
    pre-trained neural ensembles to perform effective classification of field water
    stress. Firstly, we used a multi-channel approach based on both thermal and optical
    images gathered by a drone to obtain a more robust and broad image extraction.
    Moreover, looking at the image processing, a segmentation and background removal
    step is performed to improve the image quality. Then, the proposed VGG-based architecture
    is designed as a combination of two different VGG instances (one for each channel).
    To validate the proposed approach a large real dataset is built. It is com-posed
    of 6000 images covering all the lifecycle of the tomato crops captured with a
    drone thermal and optical photocamera. Specifically, our approach, looking mainly
    at leafs and fruits status and patterns, is designed to be applied after the plants
    has been transplanted and have reached, at least, early growth stage (covering
    vegetative, flowering, friut-formation and mature fruiting stages).'

  description: Lack of precipitation and groundwater for irrigation limits crop production
    in semi-arid regions, such as the Southern High Plains (SHP). Advanced technologies,
    such as variable rate irrigation (VRI), can conserve water and improve water use
    efficiency for sustainable agriculture. However, the adoption of VRI is hindered
    by the lack of on-farm research focusing on the feasibility of VRI. The objective
    of this study was to assess the effect of irrigation rates on cotton yield as
    affected by soil physical properties and topography in the Southern High Plains.
    This study was conducted in two fields within a 194-ha commercially managed farm
    in Hale County, Texas, in 2017. An irrigation treatment with three rates was implemented
    in a randomized complete block design with two replications as separate blocks
    in each field. A total of 230 composite soil samples were collected from the farm
    in spring 2017 and analyzed for texture. Information on apparent soil electrical
    conductivity (ECa), elevation, and final yield were collected from the fields.
    A statistical model showed that the effect of irrigation rates on cotton yield
    depended on its interaction with soil physical properties and topography. For
    example, areas with slope >2% and sand content >50% had no significant response
    to higher irrigation rates. This model suggests that applying irrigation amounts
    based on the yield response can be a basis for VRI. This study provides valuable
    information for site-specific irrigation to optimize crop production in fields
    with significant variability in soil physical properties and topography.

  description: With the increasing global demand for fresh food, the importance of
    the mass agri-producing countries has also increased. Agri-production has undergone
    a significant transformation from traditional practices to precise practices with
    the help of new technologies such as the IoT, big data, and GIS. However, the
    impact of such precision on the overall supply chain is insufficient due to the
    low adaptability of these expensive technologies. Fuzzy logic, known for being
    able to handle uncertainty in different fields of science and technology, may
    be able to address the highly uncertain factors of the agri-supply chain, such
    as the soil content, rainfall, humidity, and production and yield prediction.
    Thus, this study reviews fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain considering
    land suitability, production techniques, irrigation, cold storage deficiencies,
    transportation, waste management, environmental and sustainability issues, and
    drought management and establishes an integrated framework. The integrated framework,
    which aims to analyse the overall supply chain performance, finally concludes
    that there is a lack of efficient knowledge-based models in the domain. Thus,
    using collaborative fuzzy applications with big data and GIS with a higher degree
    of heuristic and meta-heuristic simulations in the agri-supply chain can develop
    more robust models.

    and content Highlights • An SLR represents the growth of fuzzy applications in
    the agri-supply chain. • The agri-supply chain model lacks time-efficient heuristic
    and meta-heuristic algorithms. • GIS and big data-based agri-models are going
    to hold more significant positions in the field in the near future. Abstract With
    the increasing global demand for fresh food, the importance of the mass agri-producing
    countries has also increased. Agri-production has undergone a significant transformation
    from traditional practices to precise practices with the help of new technologies
    such as the IoT, big data, and GIS. However, the impact of such precision on the
    overall supply chain is insufficient due to the low adaptability of these expensive
    technologies. Fuzzy logic, known for being able to handle uncertainty in different
    fields of science and technology, may be able to address the highly uncertain
    factors of the agri-supply chain, such as the soil content, rainfall, humidity,
    and production and yield prediction. Thus, this study reviews fuzzy applications
    in the agri-supply chain considering land suitability, production techniques,
    irrigation, cold storage deficiencies, transportation, waste management, environmental
    and sustainability issues, and drought management and establishes an integrated
    framework. The integrated framework, which aims to analyse the overall supply
    chain performance, finally concludes that there is a lack of efficient knowledge-based

    literature review 1. Introduction With the growing population around the entire
    world, the food demand is also increasing, which is acutely resulting in a food
    supply shortage. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
    Nations (2009), the world’s population is estimated to reach almost 9 billion
    by 2050, which is an approximately 30% increase over the current population. The
    global problem of food supply shortages will certainly be more prominent by 2050.
    Agri-food supply chains, traditionally consisting of autonomous and independent
    actors, are becoming globally interconnected systems of complex relationships
    affecting the chain of food production, process, and delivery to markets (Burch
    and Lawrence, 2005). Currently, Asian tropical and sub-tropical countries such
    as India, Bangladesh, and Sri-Lanka have made significant contributions to meeting
    the demand for high-quality food in western markets (Food and agricultural organization
    of United Nations, 2019). In previous times, these developing countries had to
    depend significantly on the world market to meet their internal food demand. Since
    precision agriculture was introduced to the Indian subcontinent in the early 1990s,
    various technological and methodological developments in the agri-supply chain
    were adapted using the IoT, big data, and GIS, which enhanced the agri-production
    rate (Rovira-Mas et al., 2008). Nevertheless, wrong implementations and low adaptation
    rates of these expensive technologies, especially among small farmers, mean that
    the technologies failed to have a significant impact on the overall supply chain
    (Fountas et al., 2015). Thus, challenges such as a low internal fresh food supply
    rate, high food wastage, and high food prices (Food Corporation of India, 2019)
    remain. Moreover, these developing countries face an increasing suicide rate among
    farmers due to the high production costs, holding costs, and low revenues. The
    National Accidental Death and Suicide in India (2015) explicitly pointed out that
    inadequate income, indebtedness, the lack of infrastructure, natural calamities,
    crop failures, and expensive technology are the main reasons behind the high suicide
    rate among farmers in the Indian subcontinent. Thus, the major issues of the supply
    chain considered in this paper are not merely addressed in the context of the
    fulfilment of global demand. Instead, the issues include the overall development
    of the various driving factors of the agri-supply chain. In addition, the paper
    also includes an in-depth analysis of the technological progress and real-life
    adaptations, especially among small farmers, to assess their impacts on the supply
    chain. An agri-supply chain is slightly different from the supply chain of any
    other product since it is difficult to map via the four general steps of the supply
    chain: procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and distribution. Throughout the
    entire process, the agri-supply chain suffers different uncertain issues such
    as suitable land optimized for cultivation (Gärtner et al., 2013), improper vegetation
    mapping, irrigation (Thomson et al., 1996), inefficient crop management (Aune
    et al., 2008), the proper storage and transportation of perishable agri-products
    (Masson et al., 2016), and environmental issues due to improper pesticide use
    and waste handling (Nilakanta et al., 2008). Moreover, the parameters associated
    with the agri-supply chain are highly uncertain. Thus, they cannot be addressed
    using traditional deterministic and stochastic models. Models and techniques based
    on fuzzy, rough, grey, and neutrosophic sets always perform better when addressing
    such real-time uncertainty. Unlike rough, grey, and neutrosophic sets, which originated
    from the concept of the fuzzy set, the fuzzy set itself has extensive applications
    in almost all fields of engineering, science and technology, biology, management,
    and supply chains (Arriola et al., 2020). However, its use in an agri-supply chain
    has not been fully explored. Therefore, the paper focuses on fuzzy applications
    in the agri-supply chain. The following paragraphs provide the basics of the fuzzy
    set. Fuzzy set and logic are based on the theory of the partial belongingness
    of every object within a set rather than the crisp set, which assumes that an
    object’s existence is only true or false. This degree of partial belongingness
    is called the membership function in mathematical terms (Zadeh, 1975). A fuzzy
    set can be mathematically represented as (1) where defines the objects of fuzzy
    set , and explains the degree of membership corresponding to that particular object
    (Kayacan, 2011). can also be written as (2) where represents the union of all
    . The uncertainties in real-time applications or real-time data have two different
    forms. The first one is when the problem is based on some imprecise crisp data
    because of the uncertainties present within it. In the second scenario, the problem
    does not contain any crisp real-time data. Instead, the data are in linguistic
    form and are gathered from some prescribed source in the form of an expert’s opinion.
    In both of the cases, fuzzy logic first fuzzifies the data by assigning some membership
    to each datum, performs the prescribed fuzzy operations on them, computes the
    results in the form of fuzzy data, and finally defuzzifies them to calculate a
    precise output. The generic block diagram of a fuzzy system is shown below in

    of studies on fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain is sufficiency enriched.
    Thus, a proper review of the fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain needs
    to be performed to justify the effectiveness of this tool, its gaps, and future
    scopes. Download : Download high-res image (151KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Year-wise trends in the number of studies on fuzzy applications
    in the agri-supply chain. Two fundamental problems of the agri-supply chain lead
    to important research questions (RQs), which are highlighted here. RQ1: In a critical
    situation where technology is more concerned with enhancing agri-production rather
    than improving the performance of the entire agri-supply chain, how practical
    are fuzzy applications at filling the gaps in the agri-supply chain? RQ2: How
    efficient are fuzzy tools at dealing with the highly uncertain parameters of the
    agri-supply chain, such as the soil quality, soil moisture content, rainfall prediction,
    product quality and decay rate, yields, and production information? Thus, a thorough
    review of the research on fuzzy applications in an agri-supply chain is done in
    this study to assess the performance of fuzzy models in this field, identify the
    current research trends and research gaps, and propose future research to fill
    the gaps. This study conducts a review of the fuzzy applications in an agri-supply
    chain based on eight major issues shown in Fig. 3 that are thoroughly described
    in section 2. Download : Download high-res image (136KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. Schematic representation of agri-supply chain issues. Thus, the
    primary objectives of this paper can be summarized as follows. • To review the
    fuzzy applications used in an agri-supply chain to check the effectiveness of
    fuzzy-based methodologies in this domain. • To find the research gaps and prescribe
    some future research to handle the uncovered issues of the agri-supply chain more
    effectively and efficiently. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
    2 discusses the traditional issues of an agri-supply chain and how fuzzy-based
    methods helped to eliminate them. Section 3 describes the methodology and algorithm
    of the review process. Section 4 gives the details of the review and analyses
    the reviewed papers from different angles. Section 5 gives the findings and current
    trend of the issues and their solution methods. Section 6 discusses their gaps
    and future scope, and section 7 gives the paper’s conclusion and limitations.
    2. Theoretical background of agri-supply chain issues The agricultural supply
    chain typically depends upon seasonal harvesting to build large inventories. However,
    the demand for a finished product for a particular location typically maintains
    the same pattern throughout the year (Bergen et al., 2018). An agri-supply chain
    usually involves operations such as sowing, growing, harvesting, in-field storage,
    pre-processing, inventory, transportation, processing, and distribution (Carvajal
    et al., 2019). From procuring seeds and fertilizer to the delivery of products
    to end customers, the agri-supply chain is driven by different issues. Based on
    the agri-supply chain literature, eight contemporary issues are identified. Section
    2 thoroughly describes these issues and their impacts on the agri-supply chain.
    2.1. Land suitability Assessing land suitability using vegetation mapping is an
    agricultural planning tool that identifies suitable land for crops and vegetables
    at the lowest economic and environmental costs (Yassoglou et al., 1997). It includes
    assessing the content, quality (Young, 1991), and performance of particular cultivation
    land (Oberthuer et al., 1996). The physiographic soil analysis (Tiwari, 1985)
    includes highly uncertain and complex parameters such as the soil moisture, depth,
    temperature, rainfall, pH level, nutrient content, and nitrogen availability (Dobermann
    et al. 1997). Appropriate land-use policy strengthens the agri-supply chain by
    optimizing production and maintaining the environmental sustainability of the
    land (Olaniyi et al., 2015). Thus, it can be considered to be a driving factor
    of the agri-supply chain. 2.2. Production techniques Agri-production techniques
    mainly include those for the quantitative and qualitative assessment of agri-production
    operations such as seeding, cropping, spreading fertilizer, applying pesticides
    to plants and harvesting. It includes developing artificial intelligence, fuzzy
    and neuro-fuzzy-based advanced agri-machinery and techniques (Wang et al., 2016).
    Appropriate production techniques increase the efficiency of agri-production (Guo
    et al., 2015), lower labour costs and improve the precise procurement of both
    raw materials (seeds, fertilizer, pesticide) and products (Zhou et al., 2013).
    Thus, it can be considered to be a driving factor of the agri-supply chain. 2.3.
    Irrigation Irrigation in agriculture determines the optimum distribution of water
    for plants. It includes the optimum strategy to meet plants’ water consumption
    needs (Maia et al., 2016) and the watering interval. Several factors are essential
    for developing groundwater-based irrigation, such as groundwater resources, land
    fertility, automatic pumping hardware and simulation, the location of the tube
    well, and the supply of advanced drilling equipment (Lejars et al., 2017). Recent
    studies have shown that the agri-supply chain actors widely depend upon groundwater
    irrigation since it improves the quality and quantity of production and their
    businesses (Lejars et al., 2012). 2.4. Cold storage deficiencies One of the common
    problems of post-harvested crops and vegetables is their improper handling. Perishable
    agri-products need to be either stored in automated warehouses or sold in a nearby
    market immediately (Manu et al., 2018). Proper long-term storage capacity and
    location planning includes complex parameters such as long-term production forecasts,
    the market demand, and government export and import policies (Yadav and Singh,
    2020). This issue plays a vital role in the agri-supply chain since it addresses
    the optimal storage and distribution planning and minimizes food loss. 2.5. Transportation
    Agri-transportation involves a mixed strategy for the optimal distribution of
    post-harvested perishable (Orjuela-Castro et al., 2017) and non-perishable (Mogale
    et al., 2017) agri-products throughout the country that considers the proper inter
    and intrastate export and transportation policies (FAO, Seeck, 2010). It includes
    various complex parameters such as precise yield information, market-specific
    demand, government import-export policies, inter and intrastate transportation
    policies, and costs (Wang et al., 2003). Imprecise transportation and distribution
    policies (Onggo et al., 2019), the lack of efficient third-party logistics providers
    (Mehmann and Teuteberg, 2016), and deficient cold chain logistics (Yu et al.,
    2017) lead to an inefficient agri-supply chain. 2.6. Waste management Agricultural
    waste management includes the minimization, collection and recycling of post-harvesting
    field waste, rotten end products, and agro-industrial wastes (Morales et al.,
    2016). The main advantage of agri-waste is that most of it can be recycled (Spada
    et al., 2018). However, the proper classification and collection of the same group
    of waste is very challenging. Moreover, waste predictions for different treatment
    methods such as composting, recycling, or incinerating are also complex (Rulkens
    et al., 1998). Waste management is a part of green supply chain management and
    improves sustainability issues in agriculture by reducing environmental pollution.
    Moreover, proper agri-waste treatment leads to an efficient supply of both agri-oil
    extraction and reusable energy firms (Sany et al., 2019). 2.7. Environmental and
    sustainability issues In the entire process of agriculture, the environment and
    ecosystem are repeatedly disturbed. Usually, environmental pollution occurs in
    three ways: land, water, and air. The first two are mostly the result of inefficient
    fertilizer and pesticide practices whereas air pollution spreads due to both wrong
    waste management and ineffective nitrogen doping practices (Chauhan et al., 2019).
    Malpractices, such as stubble burning (Grzelak et al., 2019), lead to greenhouse
    gas emissions such as methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), and volatile organic
    compounds (VOCs) in the environment (Mishra and Singh, 2019), whereas excessive
    nitrogen doping in the soil leads to NH3 emissions (Behera et al., 2013). Excessive
    chemical doping first affects the ecological land by disturbing its mineral balance.
    Then, it finally mixes in with the groundwater or gathers in nearby water reservoirs
    and disturbs the ecological balance of water too (Borsato et al., 2018). In both
    cases, the pollution kills agriculture-helping microbacteria and insects. Last,
    these three issues affect human health by polluting food, air, and water. Environmental
    and sustainable issues have critical significance in the agri-supply chain (Sufiyan
    et al., 2019) since they are related to public health and food safety (Liu et
    al., 2019a, Liu et al., 2019b). 2.8. Drought management Drought management mainly
    aims to predict the drought-affected regions. Proper pre-drought management measures
    and controls the driving factors of droughts, such as loose soil, the moisture
    content of the soil, and rainfall (Campana et al., 2017). Usually, these environmental
    parameters are very uncertain and complex. Droughts affect the agri-supply chain
    by decreasing the quality and quantity of agri-production and reducing the supply
    of irrigation water (Rey et al., 2017). 3. Research methodology This paper evaluates
    the existing literature to identify the critical research gaps in the area of
    fuzzy applications in the agri-supply chain. To conduct the study, the authors
    have primarily considered databases such as ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google
    Scholar, which cover 34,346 peer-reviewed journals in various areas of science
    and technology. These databases contain articles published by reputed publication
    houses such as Elsevier, Emerald, Informs, Taylor and Francis, Springer, and Inderscience
    (Lamba and Singh, 2017; Tranfield et al., 2003). Since this paper aims to assess
    the substantial methodological developments in the field, peer-reviewed journals
    best fit the review. Hence, Scopus was the best database. Nevertheless, unrelated
    works were contained in the study. To find the mainstream work and to include
    only highly cited papers, this paper considers top journals (Impact factor>1)
    only. After selecting the review papers, they were categorized as per the issues
    of the agri-supply chain. Then, the gaps and future scopes for each area are highlighted.
    The review is accomplished using a cycle of selecting suitable keywords, analysing
    a journal’s impact, and identifying the relevance of the article. Fig. 4 represents
    the algorithm through a flowchart. The following subsections elaborate the flowchart
    and depict how the number of papers is gradually reduced and more concentrated
    towards the main issues in each step. Download : Download high-res image (356KB)

    Keywords selection As the review was done for only on fuzzy applications in the
    agri-supply chain domain, the search option contained the following keywords:
    ‘Fuzzy in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′ Land suitability in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’
    AND ′Agricultural Production’, ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′Irrigation in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’
    AND ′Warehouse and Market location in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′Transportation
    in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′Waste management in Agriculture’, ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′Environmental
    issues in Agriculture’, and ‘Fuzzy’ AND ′Drought management’. The same has been
    done for Type 2 fuzzy logic. Fig. 5 shows the year-wise distribution of papers

    academic journals. That is why only peer-reviewed journals, which are usually
    taken as certified knowledge sources, are included in the study. Books, book chapters,
    doctoral theses, and editorial notes are excluded from the study because, in most
    cases, they describe the theoretical developments rather than a field-specific
    case study. Only publications describing a meaningful fuzzy application that addresses
    agri-supply chain issues are included in the review. Fig. 6 shows the year-wise

    the authors noticed that some of the articles contained specific keywords described
    in section 4.1 but did not have these issues as part of their main focus. This
    issue happened due to two reasons. • The keywords were not in the title or abstract,
    but rather, they were in the body of the paper. Thus, the article does not directly
    focus on the issue but contains some references. • The keywords are in the abstract,
    and the authors referred to those particular keywords only in the conclusion and
    future scope. These papers are out of the scope of the review because only the
    methodologies developed related to the issues are reviewed in this study. Fig.

    adding the exclusion criteria. After accounting for all the requirements, 157
    articles were found to be significant for the agri-supply chain domain. The review
    results also indicate that most of the articles are published in highly referred
    journals. ‘Computers and Electronics in Agriculture’ contains 27 articles used
    for this review. The ‘Journal of Cleaner Production’, which publishes review papers
    on fuzzy logic (Martinez et al., 2019) and focuses on environmental and sustainability
    issues (Sahoo et al., 2018; Grezlak et al., 2019; Pelesaraei et al., 2019), contains
    12 papers used for this review. Since this study is concerned with environmental
    and sustainable agri-supply chains, ‘Computers and Electronics in Agriculture’,
    which has 27 papers on this issue that are included in this review, appears to
    be one of the most suitable journals for publishing this work. Fig. 8 shows the
    journal-wise distribution of the papers. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    4. Review results discussion and analysis This section contains the review analysis,
    which addresses the gaps raised by the two research questions. The entire section
    is divided into two subsections. They are ‘Review Details’ and ‘Review Analytics’.
    Both subsections aim to analyse the development and real-life adaptations of fuzzy-based
    models and methods to address agri-supply chain issues. 4.1. Review Details This
    subsection describes the significant contributions of the different fuzzy-based
    models and their impacts on real-life practice from a set of 157 reviewed papers.
    In the following subsections, agri-supply chain issue descriptions are presented,
    which frame the performance improvements provided by different fuzzy-based models
    in terms of their efficiency, effectively, and adaptation. 4.1.1. Land suitability
    Early on, land quality assessment was performed based on the reasoned intuition
    of field scientists, among which Liebig’s Law of the Minimum Limitation method
    was quite well regarded. This method and others led to a poor definition of land
    productivity factors and results with spurious precision. The first fuzzy-based
    precise land quality evaluation was done by Ranst et al. (1996). They identified
    the critical factors of productive land and their impacts on productivity using
    experts’ knowledge and developed a land assessment model using fuzzy linear regression
    analysis. Followed them, different fuzzy-based mathematical models, such as fuzzy
    goal programming (Datta et al., 1988; Biswas and Pal, 2005), fuzzy multi-objective
    linear programming (Zeng et al., 2010), made significant contributions to suitable
    land optimization. These types of proper mathematical models enhanced the precision
    of land quality assessment. However, these exact methodologies gave implicit results,
    which failed to incorporate the wide variety of products and their critical factors
    of productivity. Binaghi et al. (1996) developed the first fuzzy heuristic and
    simulation-based cognitive mapping algorithm for suitable land optimization for
    rice crops by identifying the critical productivity factors. Followed them, different
    fuzzy heuristic and simulation-based classifiers (Foody, 1996), (Meyer et al.,
    2004) were developed. Later, methodologies that combined fuzzy simulations and
    mathematical tools replaced these exact methods. Some of them, such as farmers’
    knowledge-based soil classification using a fuzzy clustering algorithm (Assimakopoulos
    et al., 2003), the fuzzy inference engine with GA optimization (Liu et al., 2013),
    (Gilandeh and Sedghi 2015), and fuzzy AHP analysis considering qualitative and
    quantitative factors (Seyedmohammadi et al., 2019; Ubando et al., 2020), were
    critically significant. However, in both traditional and fuzzy soil mapping techniques,
    soil used to be classified using discrete soil variations, which was imprecise,
    slow, and costly. After GIS started being effectively used in spatial analysis,
    different fuzzy-based GIS studies started giving more efficient results. Qi et
    al. (2006) developed the first fuzzy GIS-based digital soil mapping technique
    using a fuzzy inference engine. Following them, different methodologies with GIS
    applications were developed. GIS screening based on the fuzzy AHP (Chang et al.,
    2008), the GIS-based fuzzy weighted linear regression method (Reshmidevi et al.,
    2009), the GIS-based inference engine (Giordano and Liersch, 2012), and GIS-based
    neuro-fuzzy inference (Dang et al., 2019) were the most critically significant.
    However, GIS-based spatial analysis is highly sensitive and needs a higher level
    of real-time data and simulations to provide efficient and trustworthy results.
    Combining fuzzy meta-heuristic simulations and fuzzy big data with GIS can lead
    to effective results. 4.1.2. Production techniques After the green revolution
    started in agriculture, the production rates in most agri-based countries massively
    increased. Automated agri-machinery started being essential replacements for mass
    human resources-driven heavy agri-operations. Moreover, the requirement for precise
    controllers started in the food storage and processing industries. The first use
    of fuzzy logic in developing an automated temperature and humidity controller
    was done by Zhang et al. (1994). Following them, different fuzzy PD and PID-based
    controllers, such as a CO2 emissions controller for artificial banana ripening
    (SEO et al., 1995) and a temperature controller for cold storage (Gates et al.,
    1998), started being developed. The development of operation-specific agri-machineries
    also started with Mattiazzo et al. (1995), who proposed a low-cost grasping unit
    for asparagus harvesting. Following them, different fuzzy-based task-specific
    agri-machineries and robots started getting developed. A multi-tasking agri-robot
    using an adaptive fuzzy controller (Collewet et al., 1998, Abid and Sayadi, 2006),
    a navigation-based agri-robot for performing precise row mapping (Toda et al.,
    1999), and a type 2 fuzzy PID controller-based navigation robot (Kayacan et al.,
    2015) made significant contributions. These automated machineries made agri-operations
    more efficient. However, those studies failed to provide production security and
    sustainability. To increase the security and sustainability of crops and vegetables,
    the continuous monitoring of harvesting land was necessary (Tan et al., 2017).
    To eliminate this problem, Urena et al. (2001) developed a seed monitoring model
    using fuzzy image processing. Following this study, different researchers developed
    online and real-time production monitoring models. A fresh tomato monitoring model
    using fuzzy image processing (Jahns et al., 2001), an online real-time plant monitoring
    model (Kim et al., 2008), a fuzzy image classification-based sugarcane and citrus
    crop inspection model (da Silva et al., 2015), and a fuzzy c-means clustering-based
    weed detection model (Anter et al., 2019) were the most significant contributions.
    These methods were very efficient but still not very precise. The textures of
    crops and vegetables change very randomly with climatic factors, such as the temperature,
    rainfall, and irrigation. Artificial intelligence, the genetic algorithm, and
    neuro-fuzzy collaboration with image processing-based classifiers can result in
    effective solutions. 4.1.3. Irrigation Irrigation and water management depends
    upon two central pillars: precise rainfall forecasting, and proper pump and tube
    well locations. Early on, irrigation was done using traditional knowledge, which
    failed to incorporate different soil conditions and climatic parameters. The first
    efficient model in irrigation planning was done by SINHA et al. (1988) who developed
    a tube well location problem using a fuzzy goal programming approach considering
    both climatic and socio-economic constraints. Following them, several researchers
    developed different methods using fuzzy controllers and decision-making (Sutardi
    et al., 1995) approaches. A water management controller using a fuzzy rule base
    (Chikush, 1998) and an irrigation decision model (Montazara et al., 2013) using
    a fuzzy rule-base considering the water stress index (Al-Faraj et al., 2001) were
    the most critically significant. However, these models failed to incorporate parameters
    such as crops’ different water consumption patterns, the varying humidity and
    water-storing capacity of the soil, and precise rainfall and snowfall predictions.
    To develop an information-based integrated model, Nasr and Bruen (2007) first
    developed a neuro-fuzzy-based rainfall forecasting and irrigation decision model.
    Later, a fuzzy GIS-based irrigation decision framework (Chen and Paydar, 2012),
    a fuzzy inference engine-based real-time irrigation decision-making model (Touati
    et al., 2013; Ierna and Mauromicale, 2012), and a fuzzy GIS-based real-time speed
    varying irrigation model (Mendes et al., 2019) enriched this domain. These models
    are useful, but they are still not very precise. The lack of efficient rainfall
    forecasting and the inability to capture the continuously varying soil humidity
    lead to impreciseness. Integrating type 2 fuzzy, adaptive neuro-fuzzy-based forecasting
    with GIS-based real-time decision-making models can lead to a more effective solution.
    4.1.4. Cold storage deficiencies One of the most significant post-harvesting problems
    is the proper storage of agri-products. Early on, farmers used their traditional
    techniques to store products for a few days. The first cold storage in India was
    made in 1892. The structure of the first fuzzy controller-based fully automated
    cold storage was proposed by MORIMOTO et al. (1997). Later, Gottschalk et al.
    (2001) proposed ventilation and temperature-controlled potato storage and automatic
    inlet and outlet controlled bulk storage. In most of the mass agri-producing countries,
    the problem of food wastage remained unsolved. Lin et al. (2007) proposed a fuzzy
    MCDM-based cold storage location problem to provide proper distribution planning.
    However, this study failed to incorporate integrated information about the production
    and traditional storage methods of farmers and retailers. Embedded fuzzy GIS-based
    long-term capacitated cold storage location planning with real-time production
    information can lead to a more precise model than farmers’ and retailers’ traditional
    storage methods. 4.1.5. Transportation With the globalization of the agri-market,
    the transportation of perishable agri-products has been a significant issue for
    the supply chain. This issue considers the critical importance of both transportation
    costs and time. The first fuzzy-based study of the transportation of perishable
    agri-products was done by Miller et al. (1997). They developed an optimal distribution
    and scheduling method for fresh tomato considering the minimization of the package
    time, harvest time, and storage time. Following them, different researchers developed
    fuzzy-based optimal transportation and distribution problems, among which the
    optimal distribution policy using fuzzy multi-objective linear programming (Paksoy
    et al., 2012) has the most critical significance. These models served to improve
    global transportation. Ghasemkhani et al. (2019) proposed an optimal distribution
    model for integrated production fuzzy inventory routing and balancing of perishable
    agri-products to strengthen the local transportation. However, these transportation
    models are not very time efficient due to being NP-hard problems. Proper heuristic
    and meta-heuristic models such as the genetic algorithm using GIS-based real-time
    data and incorporating socio-economic and sustainability constraints can lead
    to a more effective solution. 4.1.6. Waste management The study of waste management
    in agri-supply came later. Early on, agri-effluents were disposed of by releasing
    them into the water, burying them underground, and burning them in open air. Later,
    proper waste disposal policies led to efficient waste treatment planning. The
    first fuzzy-based study was done by Xu et al. (2010), who proposed chance constraint
    programming-based agri-water quality evaluation and proper disposal planning of
    effluents. Following them, different researchers developed agri-waste management
    models. Fuzzy linear programming based-water pollution control (Liu et al., 2013),
    Fuzzy linear programming model for optimizing carbon management network based
    on direct and indirect biomass co-firing (Aviso et al.,2020), a fuzzy AHP model
    for limiting waste from harvesting land and developing proper disposal planning
    (Sharma et al., 2018), and fuzzy bi-level multi-objective programming for optimal
    non-point source pollution management (Cai et al., 2018) were the most critically
    significant. However, there are limited studies on the proper location of waste
    treatment plants and the classification of bio-degradable and non-biodegradable
    waste. Real-time fuzzy waste management planning that incorporates socio-economic
    parameters (Cappelletti et al., 2017) can lead to a more efficient model. 4.1.7.
    Environmental and sustainability issues Environmental and sustainability issues
    mainly focus on malpractices such as improper fertilizer and pesticide use, excessive
    nitrogen doping, and high energy consumption. Primarily, the mathematical models
    for the proper identification and control of different climatic factors associated
    with agri-sustainability were deficient. The first fuzzy-based method was developed
    by SAYLAN et al. (1998). They identified and classified the meteorological factors
    behind evapotranspiration. Following them, different researchers developed models
    to capture the effects of malpractices on air quality. The fuzzy multi-objective
    linear programming-based carbon emissions optimization model (Jana and Chattopadhay,
    2005) and the fuzzy knowledge-based system for the impact of biogas emissions
    due to improper fertilization (Djatkov et al., 2014) made significant contributions.
    The first fuzzy-based study to identify the impact of improper fertilization on
    land and water was done by Roussel et al. (2000). They developed a fuzzy expert
    system-based model for the classification of harvested land in terms of pesticide
    use. Later, different models such as the fuzzy goal programming-based sustainable
    fertilizer policy for the nutrient management of land (Sharma and Jana, 2009Khoshnevisan
    et al., 2014a) and the inexact fuzzy bounded programming for water quality management
    via a proper fertilization policy (Zhang et al., 2014) made significant contributions.
    The first fuzzy-based sustainable energy consumption model was developed by Houshyar
    et al. (2012) who developed a fuzzy DEA model to optimize energy usage in the
    corn industry. Following them, Maurya and Jain (2016), Khiari et al. (2010) developed
    fuzzy logic-based network control to optimize the energy consumption in the agri-industry.
    There are an adequate number of studies in the environmental and sustainability
    domain. However, limited research has considered real-time models using time effective
    and precise heuristic algorithms (Mwalupaso et al., 2019). Although very few exist,
    such as the fuzzy GIS AHP-based sustainability measurement of rice production
    (Amini et al., 2019), they highlighted the social, economic, and biophysical aspects
    more than the environmental aspects. More fuzzy GIS-based heuristic models can
    lead to efficient and precise solutions. 4.1.8. Drought management Droughts have
    significant and long-time impacts on the agri-supply chain by diminishing production
    for a vast region. However, due to being driven by very complex parameters (Antón
    et al., 2013), the study of drought management came much later. The first fuzzy-based
    study on drought management was done by Marakoglu and Carman (2010), who proposed
    a prediction model for soil loosening and its effects on droughts. However, this
    study failed to incorporate all critical factors of droughts and properly assess
    them. Chen and Yang (2011) further developed a fuzzy ANP-based model to compute
    the indices of the critical factors of drought management and assess their performance
    in different scenarios. However, due to adopting a qualitative method, this study
    failed to incorporate the uncertainty caused by the essential factors of droughts.
    Peng et al. (2019) proposed a fuzzy GIS-based gamma model for determining the
    factors of maize droughts in croplands and assessing maize drought hazards. However,
    this model is product-specific, and thus, it fails to establish a strong relationship
    between drought hazards and yield losses for different crop growth stages. Overall,
    there are limited fuzzy-based studies that precisely predict droughts and their
    effects considering all the climatic and social factors in real-time scenarios.
    More applications using GIS, adaptive neuro-fuzzy, and type 2 fuzzy methods can
    lead to effective solutions. The details of the review are summarized in appendix
    B section in a tabular format. Interested researchers can read the table to improve
    their knowledge. 4.2. Review Analytics In this section, the analytical level of
    the papers is analysed. The analytical level includes the types of algorithms
    used in the paper and the analytical models used depending upon the data and application.
    Therefore, here, two different views of the paper are established. These views
    are described as follows. 4.2.1. Analytical algorithms The algorithm of a paper
    represents the methodology developed to solve the issue. Since this review is
    focused on fuzzy-based applications in the agri-supply chain domain, the method
    includes only type 1 or type 2 fuzzy-based algorithms. • Type 1 fuzzy: A type
    1 fuzzy set deals with degree one uncertainties since the type 1 fuzzy set is
    always represented using only a primary membership function. Most of the real-life
    fuzzy applications are type 1 algorithms. • Type 2 fuzzy: A type 2 fuzzy sets
    deals with degree two uncertainties. Unlike type 1 fuzzy sets, which have a single
    membership function, type 2 fuzzy sets have one primary membership function and
    one secondary membership function associated with each primary membership function
    value. Other uncertain sets such as the rough set, grey set, intuitionistic set,
    and interval set can also be combined with a fuzzy algorithm and work as a hybrid
    type 1 or type 2 fuzzy algorithm. In this study, a minimal number of papers used
    type 2 fuzzy-based methodology. Most of the papers used type 1 fuzzy-based methodology
    to solve agri-supply chain issues. Fig. 9 compares the type 1 and type 2 fuzzy
    methodologies used in the agri-supply chain domain using a pie chart. Download

    Comparison of the algorithms used in the agri-supply chain domain. 4.2.2. Analytical
    models The review articles are divided into three sub-categories, i.e., prescriptive,
    predictive, and descriptive, depending upon the analytical approaches used. •
    Prescriptive model: As the name suggests, prescriptive models usually prescribe
    a solution to real-time problems, and they have existed in the world for a long
    time. The papers that indicate any type of mathematical modelling along with a
    case study with real-time data collected using a field survey at a problem location
    can be treated as prescriptive models. Usually, these models provide the optimal
    solution to problems, however, lack flexibility due to high in quantitative and
    low in qualitative. • Predictive model: This model mainly deals with the question
    ‘What to happen?’ Predictive models usually use mathematical models to conduct
    predictions and estimations. Statistical and forecasting techniques fall under
    this category. Most of the time, this model predicts a solution to real-life problems.
    • Descriptive Model: A descriptive model either discusses the related issues or
    develops a model for a specific problem. Most of the time, this type of model
    summarizes the behaviour of a particular problem using its past data. This type
    of model includes designing automated machinery such as an on-off controller rather
    than using optimization and statistical tools. All of the three analytical models
    were covered in the reviewed articles. However, the application of each model
    is different and distinct. Fig. 10 shows a comparative analysis of the usage of
    these models separately for each of the agri-supply chain issues. Download : Download

    trends and findings The study of the current trends and findings are divided into
    two different views. The first one is based on issues. This view analyses the
    year-wise trends and compares the fuzzy-based studies for each of the issues separately.
    The second one is based on methodologies. This view analyses the year-wise trends
    and compares the different fuzzy-based methods used to handle those issues. 5.1.
    Current trends of agri-supply chain issues Since the first paper addressing the
    fuzzy-based agri-supply chain issue was published in 1988, the research did not
    follow a uniform pattern. There are issues such as irrigation, production techniques,
    and land selectivity that appeared in the field starting in the 1990s and have
    continued to this date. Issues such as environmental and sustainability issues
    and waste management appeared later. A year-wise trend is shown in Fig. 11, which
    depicts the current trends of the agri-supply chain issues. Download : Download

    patterns of the agri-supply issues. 5.2. Current trends of methodologies Different
    fuzzy-based methods have been used for years to eliminate agri-supply chain issues.
    Some of them such as the fuzzy logic controller, the fuzzy rule base, and the
    fuzzy MCDM appeared earlier and are still being applied since they are so productive.
    Fuzzy GIS, big data, and spatial analysis-based approaches were rarely used in
    the past, but now they are widely used. Fig. 12 shows a year-wise pattern of the
    methodologies to explain the current trend. Download : Download high-res image

    used in the agri-supply chain domain. 5.3. Findings regarding agri-supply chain
    issues Agri-supply chain issues have always been very important from the researchers’
    perspective. There are various research works regarding the issues mentioned above.
    Nevertheless, not all agri-supply chain issues have been given equal importance
    by researchers. Thus, there is a large imbalance in the numbers of research papers
    published regarding those issues. A comparative study is done regarding the issues,
    and the results are shown in percentages using a pie chart in Fig. 13. Download

    Pie chart showing the relative statistics for agri-supply chain issues. From this
    chart, it is quite clear that production techniques, land suitability, and irrigation
    have been studied for years, and various fuzzy-based methods have already been
    developed to eliminate the shortcomings related to them. In the same way, it is
    also found that transportation, cold storage deficiencies, waste management, and
    drought management have not been adequately studied by researchers in the context
    of developing a fuzzy-based model to eliminate the shortcomings. These issues
    should be immediately addressed. 5.4. Findings as per methodologies As every agricultural
    issue is different and distinct, and thus researchers have applied different fuzzy
    methods to address the agri-supply chain issues. Table 1 presents a detailed description
    of the methods used as per the issues. Table 1. Methodologies used as per different

    solution approaches are the same, even if the issues are different. Some of the
    well-known methodologies have been applied to various issues by changing the objectives,
    factors, and constraints. Fig. 14 depicts the most popular methods found in the

    chain research. 6. Gaps and future scopes This section discusses the gaps and
    future scopes for each issue separately. The summary is given in the first one
    or two sentences, and then the gaps and future scopes are presented. A tabular
    representation is also done at the end of this section to improve the understanding.
    6.1. Land suitability There are two major limiting factors for proper land quality
    assessment. The classification of the soil depending upon the soil nutrient content
    and pH factor requires more precise scientific measurement, which is very costly
    and time-consuming (Zhu et al., 2010). In various cases, farmers’ traditional
    knowledge about soil textures can help to form efficient vegetation mapping (Sicat
    et al., 2005). Farmers’ knowledge-based modelling using fuzzy big data can help
    to represent the farmer’s traditional knowledge and lead to an efficient model.
    The smooth classification of soil depending upon its content is sometimes challenging
    because of the continuous variation of the soil content and complex relation of
    it with the soil fertility (Rodríguez et al. 2016). Fuzzy GIS-based spatial analysis
    can model the soil content’s continuous and complex behaviour (Giordano and Liersch,
    2012). However, due to being very sensitive, fuzzy GIS sometimes leads to imprecise
    results (Qi et al., 2006). Combining fuzzy meta-heuristic simulation with big
    data can help to get efficient results. 6.2. Production techniques Fuzzy PD, PID
    controller, and inference-based advanced machinery and task-specific agri-robots
    have effectively reduced the human resource requirements and increased the efficiency
    and precision in agri-operations. However, the major limiting factor in both agri-machinery
    and online harvested land, crop, and vegetable monitoring is the deficiency of
    effective real-time models. Different fuzzy-based task-specific automated agri-robots
    and machinery perform well in terms of their time consumption (Kayacan et al.
    (2012). However, they lack precision due to the deficiency of real-time online
    models (Desousa et al., 2013). Applications of type 2 fuzzy sets, artificial neural
    network and sliding mode control in automated agri-robots and machinery can further
    enhance the precision (Kayacan et al., 2015). Different fuzzy image processing-based
    online field monitoring models (Khoshnevisan et al., 2014a) can achieve efficient
    results (Yang et al., 2003). However, the models failed to incorporate different
    textures, and colour difference appear due to different climatic zones, irrigation,
    and other agri-parameters (da Silva et al., 2015). Artificial intelligence, neuro-fuzzy,
    and genetic algorithm-based simulations in fuzzy image processing can lead to
    a more precise model (Anter et al., 2019). 6.3. Irrigation Irrigation mainly faces
    two major challenges, inefficient rainfall forecasting (Nasr and Bruen, 2007)
    and incorporating various complex climatic parameters, such as crops’ different
    water consumption, soil humidity and water storage capacities with varying climate
    and soil content and effective rainfall and snowfall in the model (Zhang and Guo,
    2016). Different fuzzy-based rainfall forecasting models and fuzzy GIS-based drip
    irrigation models can lead to an effective solution, but they still fail to incorporate
    the uncertainties created by the imprecise measurement of continuously varying
    parameters such as the soil moisture content and plants’ water consumption rate
    (Ren et al. (2017). Integrating type 2 fuzzy, adaptive neuro-fuzzy-based forecasting
    (Nasr and Bruen, 2007) with GIS-based real-time decision-making models (Mendes
    et al., 2019) can lead to a more effective solution. 6.4. Cold storage deficiencies
    Different fuzzy inference and controller-based models that seek to improve the
    quality and sustainability of cold storage have been studied (Gottschalk et al.,
    2001). However, there are deficiencies in the warehouse and cold storage location
    problems. GIS-based fuzzy capacitated cold storage location model considering
    the real-time information of regional production, estimated market demand data,
    and farmers’ and retailers’ traditional storage methods could lead to a more precise
    model. An upgrade of new methodologies such as warehouse sharing and subcontracting
    in the model can lead to more effectiveness (Lin et al., 2007). 6.5. Transportation
    Transportation and logistics in the agri-supply chain are mainly considered from
    the cost optimization point of view. However, the wrong distribution pattern and
    having less integrated information regarding perishable agri-production, market
    demand, and inventory leads to mass food wastage (Paksoy et al., 2012). Proper
    heuristic and meta-heuristic models such as the genetic algorithm using GIS-based
    real-time data and incorporating socio-economic and sustainability constraints
    can lead to a more effective solution (Ghasemkhani et al., 2019). 6.6. Waste management
    Fuzzy linear programming and MCDM-based models for assessing waste management
    parameters and checking and controlling the quality of sustainability factors
    have significant impacts on agri-waste management. However, there is a deficiency
    of prediction models for the waste of a treatment plant and proper identification
    and classification models for waste (Cai et al., 2018). A real-time prediction
    model considering socio-economic parameters (Xu et al., 2010) and fuzzy image
    processing and fuzzy cognitive mapping-based models for identifying and classifying
    agri-waste for separate waste treatment plants can lead to more developed models
    (Liu et al., 2013). 6.7. Environmental and sustainability issues Fuzzy linear
    programming, rule base, and different MCDM approaches (Lin et al., 2013) that
    assess the quality of the sustainable parameters for agriculture and prescribe
    optimal chemical usage make significant contributions to environmental and sustainable
    issues. However, most of the studies failed to incorporate the impacts on air
    sustainability due to malpractices such as improper fertilization (Jana and Chattopadhyay,
    2005), excessive nitrogen doping (Papadopoulos et al., 2011) and stubble burning.
    To capture these scenarios, real-time models are essential (Amini et al., 2019).
    Moreover, a limited heuristic and meta-heuristic algorithm can lead to inefficient
    and time-consuming methodology (Turan et al., 2019). Fuzzy GIS and big data-based
    real-time heuristic and meta-heuristic pollutant optimization models considering
    socio-economical parameters can further address this issue (Amini et al., 2019).
    Currently, need for sustainability in global agri-supply chain has become highly
    significant due to random demands, frequent change of international trade policy
    etc. Complex supply chain modelling considering mixed uncertainty like, fuzzy
    stochastic supply chain (Yu and Solvang, 2020), and robust fuzzy stochastic programming
    (Farrokh et al., 2018) can also leads to an effective and efficient solution.
    6.8. Drought management There are minimal fuzzy models for drought management,
    amongst which the fuzzy MCDM-based approaches for finding the critical factors
    of droughts have made significant contributions to this issue (Marakoglu and Carman,
    2010). Minimal models are available that predict and assess the main driving factors
    of droughts, such as the soil type, soil content, rainfall, soil moisture content,
    temperature, and relative humidity (Chen and Yang, 2011). More real-time fuzzy
    GIS applications with highly uncertain type 2 fuzzy and adaptive neuro-fuzzy-based
    simulation models for the prediction and assessment of droughts considering the
    complex driving factors of droughts can improve drought management. The detailed
    findings and corresponding gaps and future scopes regarding each issue of the
    agri-supply chain are summarized in tabular format in Table 2. Table 2. Contemporary
    agri-supply chain issues and their remedies. Issue Gaps Future scope Land suitability

    of drought, considering its complex driving factors. 7. Conclusion Focusing on
    the traditional issues of the agri-supply chain, this paper contributed to assessing
    the effectiveness of fuzzy applications in this uncertain domain. This study performed
    a systematic literature review of 157 articles related to contemporary agri-supply
    chain issues to understand the current research trend and research gaps. After
    systematically capturing the significant contributions from active databases such
    as ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar, this review classified the selected
    papers according to the eight most relevant agri-supply chain issues, namely,
    land suitability, production techniques, irrigation control, cold storage deficiencies,
    transportation, waste management, environmental and sustainability issues, and
    drought management. After a detailed analysis from an aerial, methodological,
    and analytical angle, the authors noticed that fuzzy applications in the field
    of agriculture are trending throughout the world. Some of the agri-supply chain
    issues such as land suitability, production techniques, environmental and sustainability
    issues, and irrigation are highly enriched with fuzzy applications. Issues such
    as cold storage deficiencies, transportation, waste management, and drought management
    have fewer fuzzy applications. However, the survey claims that the technological
    development and collaboration of new methodologies for real-time applications
    such as GIS and big data are not used widely in the overall agri-supply chain
    domain. Land suitability, which lacks a cost-effective and precise land quality
    assessment model, can use fuzzy GIS and big data to develop precise farmers’ knowledge-based
    models to get an effective solution. Production techniques, where online crop
    quality inspections using agri-robots is inefficient, can use fuzzy GIS-based
    real-time online heuristic and meta-heuristic simulation models to get an effective
    solution. Irrigation, which lacks efficient rainfall forecasting models due to
    the imprecise measurement of complex climatic parameters, needs type 2 and adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy-based real-time forecasting models to incorporate climatic parameters
    efficiently. Cold storage deficiencies need long-term fuzzy-based capacitated
    cold storage location models considering subcontracting and warehouse sharing
    using regional real-time production and demand to eliminate the uncertainties
    created by imprecise production information. Transportation, which lacks an efficient
    model for perishable agri-product transport, should incorporate heuristic and
    meta-heuristic algorithms to develop a GIS-based real-time perishable agri-transportation
    model considering socio-economic factors. For proper waste treatment planning,
    waste management needs real-time heuristic models for the prediction, identification,
    and classification of bio-degradable and non-biodegradable wastes using fuzzy
    image processing and fuzzy cognitive mapping. Environmental and sustainability
    issues need real-time models to identify the impacts on the air of malpractices
    such as stubble burning and excessive nitrogen doping considering socio-economic
    factors. Drought management lacks the efficient prediction and assessment of the
    main driving factors of droughts, such as the soil type, soil content, rainfall,
    soil moisture content, temperature, and relative humidity. Type 2 fuzzy and adaptive
    neuro-fuzzy based real-time simulation models can incorporate these issues efficiently.
    Overall, fuzzy logic combined with new methodologies such as GIS, big data, type
    2 fuzzy, and adaptive-neuro fuzzy methods, will be very popular due to their effectiveness.
    Moreover, the advancement of the degree of simulation algorithms using the GA
    and PSO can develop more efficient models in the agri-supply chain. There are
    a few limitations to this work. These limitations are as follows. • This review
    is limited to the agri-supply chain domain except for the trading and marketing
    of agri-products. • This review is focused solely on fuzzy applications in the
    agri-supply chain. Hence, this study does not address any non-fuzzy-based applications
    or the mathematical modelling of the agri-supply chain. • This review is based
    on papers available in the Scopus database from journals having an impact factor>1.
    • This review considers the keywords mentioned in section 4.1. Papers containing
    the keywords in the body other than just the title and abstract are also considered.
    Nevertheless, some relevant papers that did not use the keywords may have not
    been considered. Based on the exhaustive review on ‘Fuzzy applications in the
    agri-supply chain’, it is concluded that there is a need for effective and efficient
    agri-supply chain models to capture the high uncertainties associated with agriculture.
    Type 2 fuzzy-based methodologies can provide a better method than the existing
    agri-supply chain model by eliminating the current issues and meeting the future
    demand of the food supply chain. Declaration of competing interest The authors

  description: Optimum cropping pattern increases productivity where input resources
    are limited. An optimized cropping pattern was developed for a region in Moghan
    Plain, located in the northwestern Iran, to help water supplier in pre-season
    decision making on water and land allocation. AquaCrop simulation model was calibrated
    and executed for yield predictions for 11 different crops and 13 diverse soil
    types. Evaluation of AquaCrop model showed great robustness for a broad range
    of crops, even for the crops like canola and alfalfa that were undefined for the
    model. The precise generated crop water functions revealed the ideal conditions
    for water allocation by considering the impact of the existing limitation in monthly
    water availability on optimum cropping pattern without imposing any manipulation.
    Optimum cropping pattern based on water productivity (OCPWP) was identified by
    LINGO software. Integrating AquaCrop model and LINGO optimization problem solver
    created a Decision Support System (DSS) for technical analysis at the regional
    level. The created DSS is able to support the OCPWP in terms of the complex regional
    crop-mixture acreage. The ecological considerations introduced diverse winter
    crops to benefit from autumn precipitations. This strategy decreases irrigation
    requirement and saves some water for spring/summer high water-demanding crops
    like alfalfa and cotton, which generally enhances the system resiliency. The generated
    DSS revealed that 8,762 m3 water ha-1 was required for optimum cropping pattern,
    which is 8% lower than the maximum and 3% more than the average available water.

    water allocation; mechanism; integrative management; effectiveness 1. Introduction
    Precision irrigation can be defined as an efficient collaboration and precise
    application of water to meet specific requirements of individual plants or management
    units and minimize related adverse environmental impacts. As a holistic coordinated
    performance, precision irrigation not only enables the emergence of more flexible
    and reactive operational systems, but also involves the optimal management and
    best operation of agricultural irrigation systems; therefore, it has been employed
    in response to the growing problem of water scarcity and the need for more effective
    irrigation management. Precision irrigation comprises a wide range of participant
    component systems, both at on-farm plot and scheme levels, corresponding to different
    management and monitoring realities, and having the potential to be applied as
    an effective water-allocation support tool for cropping patterns in an irrigated
    area and irrigation scheduling [1]. Direct benefits of the water allocation mechanism
    and integrative management effectiveness of precision irrigation are expected
    in the following. (1) Irrigation collaboration. Advanced design methods and optimization
    tools of irrigation equipment enable the development of water allocation with
    both physical and virtual prototyping for the optimum collaboration of irrigation
    systems, which are capable of representing spatial and temporal water allocation
    variations within the agricultural field at a compatible resolution with farming
    management activities [2]. (2) Water resource supply. Water resources immediately
    transmitted to the whole supply chain of precision irrigation enable a constant
    synchronization between advanced water allocation control and mechanism adaptation
    to unforeseen environmental changes, giving farmers higher precision and flexibility
    in water allocation and scheduling implementation in practice. (3) Irrigation
    implementation. Using stage irrigation objectives as elements of water allocation
    allows instantaneous collection of data about influential factors related to the
    agricultural production system [3]. It is possible to adjust the corroborative
    behavior of the irrigation system under unusual cultivation conditions or environmental
    condition changes, which helps to determine the optimal timing of irrigation when
    planning water allocation schemes. This article provides a throughout overview
    of the research developments in water allocation mechanism and integrative management
    effectiveness, and explains how they contribute to the sustainability and stability
    of irrigated agriculture. In the past several years, the water allocation mechanism
    of precision irrigation makes remarkable contributions to the appropriate redistribution
    of water resources in the irrigated soil. Moreover, the integrative management
    effectiveness in irrigation practices becomes a decisive benchmark for accurate
    calibration of irrigated agriculture, especially in typical application cases
    such as moisture infiltration measurement, adaptive irrigation scheduling, and
    dynamic groundwater distribution. However, it is regretful that such important
    topics have rarely been focused on and discussed before, even if no previous research
    has provided such an important and flashed out the review on water allocation
    mechanism and integrative management effectiveness, which presents a major obstacle
    to the increase of irrigation efficiency and promotion of irrigation techniques
    during agricultural crop production. Therefore, it is an urgent need to propose
    a comprehensive review of these key topics to demonstrate their uniqueness and
    originality for precision irrigation. According to this conditional requirement,
    firstly, a systematic overview focusing on the water allocation mechanism is presented,
    followed by a set of concentrated comparisons of the performance properties of
    water allocation techniques in regards to the factors influencing irrigation environment;
    secondly, the integrative management effectiveness of precision irrigation is
    outlined; thirdly, with the future development prospects of precision irrigation
    being discussed, this paper makes conclusion eventually. 2. Water Allocation Mechanism
    of Precision Irrigation High-efficient water allocation mechanism can be defined
    as the accurate and efficient distribution strategies of water resources to increase
    agricultural productivity and increase crop yield in practical irrigation applications.
    Appropriate irrigation water allocation can reduce water losses, overcome topographic
    constraints, avoid uncontrolled water/soil withdrawals, and be used to accurately
    measure the exact amount of water consumed [4]. As shown in Figure 1, the research
    progress and equipment developments in the water allocation mechanism produced
    significant advantages including higher water use efficiency (WUE), lower energy
    requirements, higher field yields, and better quality of harvested crops. Environmental
    maintenance and resource recyclings are necessary irrigation parametric coefficients
    or influential process factors, that lead to the environment-oriented water allocation
    monitoring and information management abilities to attain environmental maintenance
    and resource recycling. The water allocation mechanism facilitates the soil/water
    balance, and determines optimal irrigation schedule and cropping pattern in irrigated
    agriculture. Given a large amount of generic and pervasive research on this topic,
    three major problems arise. (1) Determining how to build a generic and effective
    water allocation scheme that enables the increase of WUE and acceleration of moisture
    infiltration in field soil for their performance benchmarking. The inner architecture
    and inherent principles of water allocation mechanism should be investigated further
    to standardize and facilitate their wide application, which appears to be currently
    important. (2) Determining the optimal method to integrate the necessary elements
    of water allocation in a given precision irrigation system. As irrigation efficiency
    should be monitored closely and enhanced significantly, the schedule principle
    and control architecture in water allocation need to be simultaneously synchronized.
    The instantaneous investigation of irrigation turn duration, based on the coordinated
    behavior of the water allocation system or the adaptive control of moisture infiltration,
    makes the task more challenging as it requires the water resource allocation responsible
    for the irrigation scenario management to be omniscient. (3) Defining a full set
    of water allocation scenarios that are representative of the diversity of irrigation
    requirements encountered and resource allocation objectives expected. Currently,
    the applicable research on this topic is still too limited and the studies do
    not cover the whole scope of the water allocation mechanism. Figure 1. Research
    progress and equipment development in the water allocation mechanism. As defined
    in the water research literature, the technical adaptivity of precision irrigation
    is the capacity of the water allocation system to collaboratively work with other
    facility parts, which is related to the physical connections of different components
    in irrigation systems. Considering the adaptivity, as the efficiency and uniformity
    of precision irrigation can be maintained from the complex and diverse schedule-based
    systems by considering weather, soil, water, and crop data, a decision support
    system (DSS) model was designed to acquire real-time water/soil and environmental
    data using a wireless sensor network [5,6]. Motivated by this technological tendency,
    a radial basis function type of neural network was used to predict the hourly
    requirement of soil moisture content (MC) as well as the required soil evapotranspiration
    using the Penman–Monteith method or the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
    model. Similarly, a fuzzy-logic-based weather-dependent irrigation control mechanism
    was developed and integrated with an interoperable decision support system (DSS)
    to generate adequate water allocation notifications by interfacing with Global
    System for Mobile communications (GSM) modem. Some researches [7,8,9] indicated
    that precision irrigation performance could be determined using the amount of
    supplied water, water delivery infrastructure, use of groundwater, water allocation
    method, infrastructure size, and the price paid for irrigation resource consumption.
    Therefore, the practical irrigation systems with high energy demands should only
    be used when they permit reductions in the irregularity of water supply and shortage
    of risks in water resource allocation. To quantify the constructive influence
    of indoor water allocation mechanism on crop productivity and grain yield, a greenhouse
    irrigation experiment conducted revealed that thin shallow moist dry irrigation
    (TSMDI) had significantly higher water productivity [10], and the irrigation water
    consumption could be reduced remarkably, indicating that local data information
    on root growth patterns is crucial to understanding cultivar adaptations to ensure
    precise deficit irrigation [11]. Similarly, the ratio of irrigation water need
    to groundwater recharge (IGR ratio) was assessed based on the distributed water
    balance model mGROWA, a deterministic distributed water balance model developed
    at the Forschungszentrum Jülich on behalf of the Ministry for the Environment,
    Energy and Climate Protection of Lower Saxony, German, in cooperation with the
    State Agency for Mining, Energy and Geology, it has been developed to determine
    water balance variables, including groundwater recharge in large areas under present
    and possible future climate conditions, which showed that the delineated vulnerable
    areas coincide with the field regions for which high irrigation quantities from
    groundwater resources had been previously documented [12]. Regarding the performance
    of effective water allocation in surface irrigation, there is an investigation
    on the soil texture, plot size, and farmers’ practices significantly affect water
    allocation efficiency and surface irrigation performance [13]. Reference [14]
    indicated that variable alternate furrow irrigation (VAFI) reduces the winter
    wheat grain yield, dry matter, and grain number per spike. Fu et al. used chaos
    theory to analyze the water resource allocation mechanism behind the response
    of irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE) to precipitation in specific agricultural
    irrigation districts [15]. By analyzing the factors influencing water allocation
    mechanism, Liang et al. studied the concentration prediction of irrigation effectiveness
    and the four-dimensional fuzzy correlation in water allocation [16,17]. Table
    1 lists several key factors influencing irrigation water allocation and summarizes
    the latest investigations on this subject, including the following: (1) More precise
    allocation method of irrigation water resource allocation under different precipitation
    conditions and uncertain water supply; (2) providing sufficient and efficient
    compensation for the losses due to moisture evaporation, and developing water-saving
    irrigation technologies during the process of precision irrigation; (3) installing
    moisture-monitoring probes in soil fields and enhancing the supervision system
    of water allocation for better adapting to the actual irrigation environment;
    and (4) studying the consumptive elements of irrigation water and investigating
    the transfer of non-consumptive water allocation factors. Table 1. Key influential
    factors for water allocation mechanism in precision irrigation. Since irrigated
    agriculture requires high-performance reliability from water delivery networks
    and high flows to satisfy various technological demands at seasonal peak times,
    the use of satellite imagery to aid with precise water allocation has become a
    hot topic [38]. The monitoring of crop water consumption, also known as actual
    evapotranspiration (ETa), through the use of satellite imagery and remote-sensing-based
    monitoring algorithms is crucial for constructing prudent allocation strategies
    using limited freshwater resources [39]. Inspired by this situation, Trezza et
    al. completed a crop estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) using satellite images
    to obtain the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) for precise water
    allocation [40]. Since the dynamics of maize, alfalfa, fruit trees, and poplars
    can be analyzed using greenness and wetness extracted from satellite remote sensing
    data [41], Zhang et al. proposed an intelligent water allocation method for farmland
    irrigation and drainage system based on domestic high-resolution satellite images,
    which considered both spectral features and geometry features of farmland irrigation
    and drainage system [42,43]. Their experimental analysis demonstrated that the
    accuracy of satellite imagery satisfies the water allocation need for large-scale
    and rapid extraction for precise irrigation and drainage systems [44]. Similarly,
    Araya et al. successfully mapped the seasonal cultivated area based on satellite
    images, and combined water allocation information from multiple bands to characterize
    the land surface in terms of spectral indices, such as NDVI and surface temperature
    (Ts) [45]. The capability of crop water stress index (CWSI), based on satellite
    thermal infrared data for estimating water stress and irrigation scheduling, was
    evaluated [46]. They found that water allocation schedules can be monitored using
    satellite imagery without any need for ground ancillary data. In the past several
    years, relevant water allocation tests were undertaken for crop cultivation by
    applying the Penman–Monteith method [47], e.g., the disaggregation based on physical
    and theoretical scale change (DISPATCH) algorithm was proposed to downscale soil
    moisture satellite data by combining the low-resolution Soil Moisture Ocean Salinity
    (SMOS) satellite soil moisture data with the high-resolution NDVI and land surface
    temperature (LST) datasets [48]. Satellite imagery could also be used to determine
    and compare the water allocation variations; some investigations assessed the
    risk of land degradation and water allocation changes using Landsat Thematic Mapper
    (TM) and Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA) [49,50]. Others confirmed that the efficacy
    of high-resolution remote sensing images and the maximum likelihood method in
    estimating water allocation [51]. Inspired by this method, Laura et al., presented
    HidroMap as a geographic water allocation information system (GIS) organized in
    two different modules, desktop-GIS and web-GIS, with complementary functions based
    on the PostgreSQL/ PostGIS database [52]. Saraiva et al. detected the center pivot
    irrigation systems to a constellation of planet scope images, which provides an
    important support tool for water/soil management and water allocation decision
    making [53]. Corbari et al. and Ali et al. found that satellite-driven image models
    and meteorological forecasts could provide support for smart water allocation
    systems [54,55]. Correspondingly, Knipper et al. investigated the utility of satellite-derived
    maps of evapotranspiration (ET) and the ratio of actual-to-reference ET (fRET)
    based on the remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) imagery [56]. Tan
    et al. also reported the potential of the ET strategy using satellite-based imagery
    monitoring of water consumption dynamics [3]. All these investigations confirmed
    the potential of using satellite imagery to aid in precise water allocation. These
    theoretical and technical investigations formed a consistent vision of the water
    allocation mechanism for precision irrigation system, providing a solid basis
    for analysis in this systematic review. 3. Integrative Management Effectiveness
    of Precision Irrigation The integrative management effectiveness of precision
    irrigation can be regarded as the operational effect or maintenance influence
    when all the components of the irrigation system are used together to achieve
    the objective of optimal agricultural irrigation. The implementation of integrative
    irrigation management requires a harmonized application of management tools, including
    the schedule models, on-site monitoring systems, remote sensing, etc., ultimately
    leading to the collaborative development of crop cultivation based on practical
    meteorological conditions and current soil/plant water need. To guarantee the
    optimal performance of a precision irrigation system, three major steps are required:
    (1) Generic model definition for integrative management effectiveness. The existing
    irrigation methods based upon specific flow models are poorly coupled with generic
    management approaches. Therefore, it is necessary to define the generic management
    effectiveness of both the working principle and the collaborative behavior of
    irrigation system to enable accurate verification for system collaboration; (2)
    model-driven integrative management effectiveness. This task is dedicated to proving
    the validity of integrative management effectiveness by generating a fully-functional
    irrigation schedule conforming to previous management models. This task should
    be supported by irrigation expertise in the field of resource distribution model
    transformations; (3) formal verification of integrative management effectiveness.
    This task is meant to evaluate the feasibility of applying formal verification
    to integrative management effectiveness to prove the unique properties of an irrigation
    system that are valuable for agricultural productivity control. Given the expected
    management results, information feedback from the water/soil resource management
    might be required to refine the proposed control methods to achieve irrigation
    management objectives. From the above-mentioned analysis, based on the generic
    model definition step for integrative management effectiveness, a novel model
    of Linked Simulation Optimization (LSO) matched to the Clonal Selection Algorithm
    (CSA) was formulated for conjunctive irrigation management [57]. Ghumman et al.
    investigated the operations of an upstream control irrigation system with respect
    to management effectiveness [58]; the results indicated that excess supply of
    water to the irrigation system could be saved. From their demonstrations, the
    management effectiveness would help improve irrigation operations where satisfactory
    irrigation conditions are available. Based on the investigation step of model-driven
    integrative management effectiveness, the current on-farm irrigation management
    methods for maize, water equity, and crop productivity can be enhanced using genetic
    algorithms in the Doroodzan network of agricultural irrigation [59]. Similarly,
    there are some researches suggested that integrative irrigation treatments, namely
    full drip (DT), full border (BT), deficit drip (DDT), and deficit border (DBT)
    irrigation treatments, tended to increase WUE and field yield, which confirmed
    their satisfactory effects on crop returns [60,61,62]. To assess the integrative
    management effectiveness of irrigation density, Mangalassery et al. indicated
    that in areas with limited facilities for field irrigation, appropriate management
    of water resources can considerably increase the fruit yield and net income [63].
    Goldhamer et al. provided a set of management information that could be used in
    irrigation decision-making conditions, including how to evaluate the risks and
    rewards of seeking/acquiring additional water supplies in an unsatisfactory environment
    [64]. Zema et al. strategically analyzed irrigation water delivery to determine
    whether the optimal integrative management effectiveness of precision irrigation
    is possible by implementing measurement at a lower cost compared to structural
    irrigation works [65]. An effectiveness simulation compares traditional irrigation
    with the integrative managed water supply, and illustrated the notion of integrated
    resource management effectiveness for complex irrigation communities [66]. Soil
    salinization is a key issue in irrigated areas as it substantially impacts crop
    productivity. It is a widespread problem and a major abiotic constraint affecting
    global food production and threatening food security. Morshed et al. attempted
    to detect soil salinity using remote sensing and geographic information system
    [67]. Current investigations have focused on effective methods to prevent soil
    salinization through effective management of irrigation applications. For instance,
    Li et al. evaluated the utility of field-derived spectra of saline soils and related
    vegetation for characterizing and mapping the spatial distribution of irrigation-induced
    soil salinization [68]. Navarro et al. focused on the mutual relationship between
    saline water evaporation from soil surfaces and water table depths [69,70]. Macroscopic
    numerical simulations demonstrated that higher soil concentrations of salinity
    in deeper water tables are attributed to less evaporation [23]. Groundwater level
    is the main factor affecting the distribution of soil salinity, but the response
    relationship between the spatial distribution of soil salt and the groundwater
    level remains unclear [71]. To clarify the patterns of soil salinization responding
    to precision irrigation, Liang et al. [16,17] and Singh et al. [72] contributed
    excellent achievements in the domain of quantitative calibration domain of irrigation
    effect. Since partial root drying irrigation (PRD) is a representative water-saving
    technique and is performed as a control measure of groundwater nitrogen contamination,
    Barzegari et al. evaluated the interaction effect of ordinary furrow irrigation
    (OFI), PRD irrigation as the variable alternate furrow irrigation (VAFI), and
    fixed alternate furrow irrigation (FAFI), with different nitrogen application
    rates on yield quality, drainage water, nitrogen leaching, nitrogen uptake, and
    nitrogen efficiency indices through the application of integrative management
    of precise root drying irrigation [73]. The amount of N fertilizer should be reduced
    in proportion to the amount of water available under VAFI. In support of this
    conclusion, probability distribution functions (PDF) were used to control the
    applied water depth by high-efficiency management of irrigation equipment [74].
    The management analysis provided an important effectiveness reference for water
    resource distribution under irrigation conditions. As decision making is one fundamental
    intelligent property for integrative irrigation management, it can be derived
    as choice and ranking composed of irrigation conditional preparation, soil parametric
    monitoring, irrigation logic triggering, design of operational decisions, irrigation
    effectiveness evaluation, and application of irrigation decisions, which are recursive
    and can be implemented in different layers of management architectures. Since
    an eco-hydrological model, called the soil and water assessment tool (SWAT), is
    used worldwide for simulating hydrology and water quality of agricultural catchments,
    Maier et al. experimented with the application of SWAT for constructing appropriate
    irrigation management strategies [75]. Their integrative managed results showed
    that by using deficit control strategies and intelligent decision-making, the
    water consumption could be remarkably reduced with only a moderate decrease in
    crop yield, verifying the promising and positive influence of integrative irrigation
    management on crop water use. As integrative irrigation management is generally
    based on the coordinated measurement and instantaneous control of soil water content
    or meteorological parameters for modeling evapotranspiration, Alghory and Yazar
    evaluated the crop water stress index (CWSI) according to the conventional irrigation
    management strategies [76]. The obtained relationships could be employed for predicting
    the yield response to water stress. The efficient use of irrigation water remains
    a major concern because of increasing competition for water resources and the
    pressing need to enhance crop productivity worldwide. A decision-making tool for
    irrigation management was therefore developed to enhance water use with reference
    to the proposed soil water balance and crop water satisfaction models [77]. However,
    subjectively establishing irrigation management schemes often result in excessive
    water use and significant fertilizer leaching [78]. Using stem psychrometers to
    directly measure plant water status (PWS), the relationship between water stress,
    prevailing environmental conditions, and species-specific stress-tolerance thresholds
    can be characterized to enable high-efficiency integrative management effectiveness.
    Table 2 describes the key influential factors for integrative irrigation management.
    More innovative achievements in effectiveness verification and performance assessment
    can be referenced from the literature [79,80,81,82]. (1) The basic goal of precision
    irrigation to increase agricultural yield with minimum water input and reduced
    environmental pollution. This is required in developing countries and small-scale
    farms. However, the high-tech nature of the precision irrigation developed in
    advanced countries poses challenges for small-scale farmers, ordinary agricultural
    enterprises, and technical engineers when finding suitable irrigation technologies
    in developing countries such as China, Brazil, and India. The challenges include
    the technology level, the real-time data processing capability, and the cost of
    implementing and maintaining irrigation applications [41]. As small-scale farms
    are responsible for about 80% of irrigated agriculture in developing countries
    and their importance in contributing to the global agricultural production chain
    is expected to increase in the future [3,39], it is necessary to design simple,
    low-cost, and data-effective measures for water allocation and their integrative
    management to assist socio-economic development. Precision irrigation embraces
    the concept of sustainable intensification of agricultural production by reducing
    water inputs by achieving a precise soil/moisture equilibrium. An irrigation application
    mechanism is required that allows visualization and compilation of the data measured
    by moisture and pH sensors used in a smart agriculture system. This application
    minimizes the users’ direct interaction with the irrigation control system while
    improving convenience and the control of the irrigation process when required.
    Using this irrigation application mechanism, the farmer can monitor, collect,
    and process soil and irrigation information at a low cost. (2) The application
    of balanced precision irrigation technologies is expected based on the specific
    socio-economic conditions in developing countries and small-scale farms. Here,
    precision irrigation mainly depends on the parametric calibration of crop cultivation
    and soil management based on fuzzy decision-making rather than on empirical and
    visual analyses. Motivated by this tendency, construction and maintenance technology
    for precision irrigation and drainage works should be appropriate for developing
    countries. (3) Encourage small-scale farmers/users in developing countries to
    use the Internet to obtain free information on the soil and water properties of
    agricultural farms using irrigation. Geographic information system (GIS) has been
    used to support agricultural irrigation. In the interest of farmers and agricultural
    enterprises, internet control and related intelligent techniques have been incorporated
    into the irrigation apparatus; thus, the costs of systems managers could be markedly
    reduced, so high-speed data/information connectivity systems (computers/Internet)
    need to be developed in rural areas. This system could be used to automatically
    identify which areas are suitable for arable land and to determine the best crop
    for a particular region. (4) Appropriate irrigation solutions enable small-scale
    farmers to become agricultural experts by using modern farming concepts and advanced
    irrigation equipment, or service provider entrepreneurs selling irrigation technologies
    in the rural areas in developing countries. A planned number of irrigation tests
    and data analyses are required after the application of precision irrigation.
    Future strategies for the adoption of precision irrigation should consider the
    problems of land fragmentation, the lack of highly sophisticated technical centers,
    specific software for precision irrigation, and the poor economic condition, in
    general, of farmers in the developing world. (5) Though integrating all these
    newly-proposed techniques into precision irrigation applications, more benefits
    than costs are generated for practical agricultural production conditions. The
    precision irrigation practices currently being implemented provide opportunities
    for alternative practices to increase agricultural irrigation effectiveness in
    those developing countries while minimizing the negative impacts on the working
    environment. To realize this, close collaborative efforts are needed among farmers,
    agricultural enterprises, farm associations, community groups, machinery manufacturers,
    research and extension agencies, and other public and private agencies, to effectively
    reduce the agricultural production costs and make the improved precision irrigation
    technique more suitable for the practical requirements of farmers and users in
    the developing world. Table 2. Key influential factors in integrative management
    effectiveness in precision irrigation. To determine unique irrigation properties
    and verify the effectiveness and reliability of integrative management, Saini
    et al., carried out a field experiment using different planting methods and irrigation
    schemes [96]. The best applicable irrigation parameters that lead to significant
    reductions in total water use and characterize soil moisture spread along furrow
    were determined [72]. The rate of water discharge and the cut-off length of furrow
    should be considered to increase IWUE for improving management effectiveness.
    The impacts of irrigation management strategies on soil and plant water status
    and fluxes in photosynthesis and chamber transpiration were studied [97]. Their
    effectiveness verification results showed that, with the exception of the regulated
    deficit irrigation (RDI) treatment, water stress increase reduces the physiological
    parameters of an irrigation system due to stomatal and non-stomatal limiting factors.
    Motivated by this finding, Laurenson et al. monitored the soil–water dynamics
    with a center-pivot irrigation system on rolling lands [98]; they found the irrigator
    should check excess water consumption and reduce the infiltration rate and wetting
    soil depth of precision irrigation to increase water productivity. Similarly,
    Wu et al. proposed a risk management analysis model for quantifying the risk of
    crop production due to the variation in moisture infiltration and cultivation
    area or uncertainty of agro-climate factors, such as the total precipitation,
    average temperature, total sunshine, and average solar radiation, which reflect
    climate change, irrigation water quality, surface water, and groundwater level,
    respectively [71]. Some other existing problems could be addressed, such as management
    effectiveness comparisons and dynamic integrative coordination between irrigation
    components, subject to various agricultural production conditions. Based on the
    objectives and the implementation framework of modern integrated water resources
    management (IWRM), Pan et al. estimated the effect of the human organization on
    the management performance of water resources [99]. To increase irrigation production,
    they found that public participation must be developed, administration ability
    must be improved, and sufficient financial support must be provided for irrigation
    management organization. Rouge et al. identified key water resource vulnerabilities
    by considering the stability of human organization [100]. Based on this idea,
    agricultural management organizations should propose effective measures for irrigation
    promotion according to the actual irrigation situation [33,101]. Shindo et al.
    tried to increase the working efficiency of management organizations, by eliminating
    excess water intake and reducing the number of water conflicts [102]. Considerable
    evidence show that irrigation infrastructure is playing an increasingly important
    role in promoting the technical developments of precision irrigation, while irrigation
    infrastructure is improving the measurement accuracy of water allocation, robustly
    maintaining the equilibrium of agricultural water provision [103]. Wang et al.
    investigated the role of local irrigation infrastructure in improving farmers’
    ability to respond to drought [104]. Together with its infiltration effectiveness
    in mitigating the drought risk during agricultural crop production, they found
    that irrigation infrastructure contributes to enhancing farm production capacity
    in adapting to drought, simultaneously increasing mean yield and reducing risk
    exposure in crop cultivation. Watts et al. demonstrated that the adaptive management
    of irrigation infrastructure helps to improve infiltration effectiveness through
    effective organization collaboration and the timely provision of irrigation monitoring
    results [105]. Suhardiman and Diana urged the development of several effective
    water management organizations for farmers, and regarded infrastructure—oriented
    development as the basic foundation for effectiveness promotion [106]. Paranage
    et al. also concluded that the construction of water infrastructure influences
    the degree of irrigation users’ dependence on each other [107]. So, based on these
    descriptions, the constructive effects of real-time irrigation water resources,
    irrigation infrastructure, and management organizations on the water allocation
    mechanism and integrative management of precision irrigation, could be clearly
    determined. As a brief summary, Figure 2 explains the aspects concerning the integrative
    management effectiveness of precision irrigation, which cover the majority of
    agricultural irrigation applications, including its importance and necessity,
    application characteristics, optimization design, allocation mechanism, intelligent
    controlling, and allocation influence. All these aspects contribute to the systematic
    investigation of integrative management effectiveness of precision irrigation
    from unique perspectives. Figure 2. The inclusive subjects discussed in integrative
    management effectiveness of precision irrigation. 4. Future Development Prospects
    The rapid development of precision irrigation techniques, together with their
    constructive applications and comprehensive influences, already covers most of
    the agricultural and horticultural domains. They presented systematic irrigation
    investigations into new areas of environment correlation and cultivation effectiveness.
    In this review, we use literature bibliometrics diagrams to describe the research
    advances in precision irrigation in water allocation and integrative management.
    These diagrams use hierarchical data to display the influence of key research
    subjects and logical correlations within the irrigation domain, demonstrating
    the influence structure and citation relationships. Within literature bibliometrics,
    the fundamental assumption is that the frequency with which a set of research
    papers being referenced is a measure of the impact or influence of research subjects,
    by counting the real-time publications and citations within influential irrigation
    journals. Using this method, scientific precision irrigation results can be communicated
    visually through diagrams, visualizations, and photographs. The combination of
    an investigation subject, development level, and constructive influence provide
    a unified framework for research analysis. Using the newly-developed bibliographic
    citation analysis data ranging from soil quality to moisture infiltration rates,
    we classified more than 700 published irrigation papers into approximately 30
    separate fields and several research levels. Literature bibliometrics searches
    for a large number of documents to classify the figures, organize the results
    and conclusions into a cloud-hosted database, and finally drive distinct applications
    to support bibliometric analysis and information retrieval. Herein, the fields
    of water supply and soil moisture equilibrium were found to have the highest citation
    influence in the past several years. A figure processing mechanism was used to
    classify different investigation topics and to study the resulting patterns of
    data information in relation to technological impact. A significant correlation
    between scientific impact and data information was identified. Therefore, we used
    these bibliometric results to articulate the organization and presentation of
    irrigation investigation. Figure 3 depicts a literature bibliometrics diagram
    drafted by VOSviewer (Developed by the Research Centre for Science and Technology
    Studies, Leiden University, PO Box 9500, 2300 RA Leiden, The Netherlands), which
    is a software useful tool for constructing and visualizing bibliometric radial
    networks that were used for precision irrigation investigation in this review.
    These informative networks extract data from journals, researchers, or individual
    publications, and they can be constructed based on co-citation, bibliographic
    coupling, or co-authorship relationships. VOSviewer also offers a text-mining
    functionality that can be employed to construct and illustrate co-occurrence networks
    of important terms searched from the scientific literature. From the text mining,
    in the label view of VOSviewer, different research items are highlighted by colored
    circles. Its font and circle sizes depend on the weight of the subject item and
    hierarchical data structure. VOSviewer shows that in the water allocation mechanism
    of precision irrigation, the subjects of recent focus can be roughly categorized
    into the following four groups: (1) Water allocation schedule and resource arrangement
    mechanism, demonstrating that some important subjects, especially water allocation
    procedure, water quality, infiltration rate, irrigation interval, arrangement
    complication, and water saline, have strong connections with actual applications
    of water allocation schedules or are considerably influenced by the resource arrangement
    mechanism; (2) water allocation performance index, demonstrating that some important
    subjects, especially moisture concentration, water quality, infiltration uniformity,
    the water use coefficient, crop species, and water resource filter, have contributed
    to the optimization of water allocation performance; (3) resource allocation policy
    and adaptive water supply mechanism, demonstrating that some important aspects,
    especially agricultural production policy, dynamic irrigation simulation, environmental
    water supply, irrigation net-benefit, mechanism optimization, adaptive water supply
    calibration, and actual irrigation climate, have strong connections with the actual
    application of agricultural resource allocation policy or are strongly influenced
    by adaptive water supply mechanism; (4) field productivity and yield statistics,
    demonstrating that some important factors, especially tillage science, fertilizer
    distribution, soil condition, crop yield, field big-data, water drainage, annual
    harvest emission, actual farm income, and water use efficiency, showed a close
    relationship with field productivity or could be accurately analyzed using yield
    statistics. Figure 3. Bibliometrics diagram concerning the most-relevant keywords
    in the water allocation mechanism of precision irrigation, the focused topics
    and their mutual correlations investigated from 1999−2019 can be described and
    highlighted. Correspondingly, Figure 4 is a literature bibliometrics diagram drafted
    by VOSviewer. In the domain of integrative management effectiveness of precision
    irrigation, its recently-focused subjects can be roughly categorized into the
    following five groups: (1) Management strategy and effectiveness assessment, demonstrating
    that some important areas, especially irrigation quality, water-use protocol,
    field moisture evaporation, water-saving strategies, soil surface characteristics,
    and the threshold value of irrigation decision-making, have strong connections
    with actual irrigation management or are clearly affected by irrigation effectiveness
    assessment; (2) resource management effect and field productivity, demonstrating
    that some important aspects, especially water resource balance, water distribution
    competition, crop productivity, agriculture growth stage, air humidity, and management
    limitation, have contributed to the integrative investigation of resource management
    effect and field productivity; (3) management network and promotion capability,
    demonstrating that some aspects, especially irrigation control, moisture infiltration
    volume, irrigation sensor network, irrigation control capability, productivity
    prediction reliability, environmental moisture, irrigation monitoring operation,
    and simulation software for precision irrigation, connect with the management
    network and facilitate promotion capability during precision irrigation processes;
    (4) irrigation parametric coefficient and management limitation, demonstrating
    that some important areas, especially remote sensing of irrigation parameters,
    actual water demand, irrigation field mapping, moisture infiltration coefficient,
    and greenhouse productivity, showed a close relationship with irrigation parametric
    coefficient, or limit irrigation management; and (5) resource supply and management
    scenarios, demonstrating that some important subjects, especially data calculation
    for resource management, environmental water status, crop canopy, water potential
    capability, air temperature, supply indicator for water resource, soil moisture
    ratio, and soil source management, have strong connections with the actual applications
    of agricultural resource supply or are demonstrated in management scenarios. Figure
    4. Bibliometrics diagram concerning integrative management effectiveness of precision
    irrigation. From the aforementioned analysis, the contributions of water allocation
    mechanism and appropriate integrative management effectiveness to precision irrigation
    can be summarized as follows: (1) Optimal water resource allocation toward connected,
    autonomous and, decentralized decision support for precision irrigation systems,
    (2) dynamic water resource allocation coordination toward adaptability and improved
    real-time control capabilities in complex irrigation processes, (3) data-oriented
    irrigation monitoring architecture toward big data analysis and distributed intelligence
    networks throughout the whole irrigation operation, (4) product-centric control
    approach for precision irrigation process toward integrative management effectiveness
    and irrigation data adaptivity, (5) web-oriented irrigation management principles
    toward service orientation and secure communication between different components
    of an intelligent irrigation system, and ensure their optimal coordination, (6)
    synthesis of integrative management effectiveness to meet precision irrigation
    requirements in actual agricultural production conditions. As studies on these
    topics have rapidly increased, several major theoretical and technical subjects
    should be investigated. (1) Water allocation improvement. The currently-used irrigation
    methods are mainly based on inappropriate water allocation. Specific water concentration
    is rarely the focus, and generic moisture infiltration has been poorly analyzed.
    It is, therefore, necessary to design and use accurate models of water allocation
    to enable the accurate prediction of water infiltration to improve irrigation
    effectiveness. This task is dedicated to validating the water allocation mechanism
    by generating a fully functioned irrigation scheme that conforms to previous water
    resource allocation models. (2) Formal verification of moisture infiltration and
    water resource allocation efficiency to evaluate the feasibility of applying operational
    verification to the irrigation scheduling models defined previously to verify
    the environmental adaptivity of irrigation approaches that are valuable for the
    temporal monitoring of crop cultivation. Considering agricultural productivity,
    feedback loops in water allocation models might be necessary to refine irrigation
    efficiency and schedule reliability to reach the predetermined target of field
    productivity. (3) Environment-oriented decision making. The increase in monitoring
    information connectivity between irrigation systems and environmental conditions,
    enabling highly-efficient crop cultivation through the integrative irrigation
    management network. Integrative irrigation management synchronizes the sprinkling
    precipitation of representative crop cultivation sites. This objective poses a
    challenge as the adaptive response time of irrigation decision-making networks
    is incompatible with those needed for agricultural production control. An innovative
    water irrigation monitoring approach integrating multi-level schedule applications
    and implementing novel irrigation services for multi-objective irrigation optimization
    would help realize intelligent irrigation. (4) Irrigation process virtualization—promoting
    integrative management effectiveness. The management features of aggregation and
    autonomy inherent to precision irrigation systems are of concern for the novel
    design and effective operation of adaptive management strategies. The virtualization
    of integrative management effectiveness should be defined and the collaborative
    irrigation process between the decision-making stage and the irrigation implementation
    stage should be studied to demonstrate the effectiveness of integrative management
    and make it available for other process virtualizations of precision irrigation.
    (5) Sustainability—resource efficiency. Resource management through the notion
    of intelligent irrigation requires massively distributed, scalable, and coordinated
    control, for which a comprehensive perspective will be relevant. Control of precision
    irrigation activity for crop cultivation or agricultural production will also
    be affected by the availability of resource consumption from the soil, field,
    or irrigation water. This final direction is largely based on the connectivity
    of irrigation resources using efficiency, which provides accurate access to the
    instant and planned resource consumption needed for irrigation scheduling, intelligent
    decision-making, and high-efficiency precision irrigation implementation afterward.
    The most-cited development tendencies and expanding application areas of irrigation
    models, together with their influential factor contributions, are illustrated
    in Table 3. Based on this description, it analyzes the technique advantages, development
    prospects, and representative application cases, of irrigation models in actual
    agricultural production. Table 3 indicates that such typical models and irrigation
    techniques as DSSAT, ACO/LIDM, AquaGIS, SWAP, AquaCrop, etc., were employed in
    deficit irrigation, pressurized irrigation, and dynamic water allocation, for
    small farmers in developing countries, including India, Turkey, Brazil, and China.
    With the help of these models and techniques, the focused irrigation topics could
    be determined conveniently. Table 3. The advantages and development prospects
    of representative irrigation models. Eventually, according to the latest developments
    of these theoretical models and irrigation techniques, they could be applied conveniently
    into different cases of real-life irrigated agriculture, such as the impact evaluation
    of advanced irrigated agriculture on groundwater-recharge salinity [108,109],
    performance analysis of irrigated agricultural strategies [110], collaborative
    management of water resources distribution [111], and quantitative assessment
    on the water availability for practical irrigated agriculture [112], etc. Although
    the optimal water allocation policies for sustainable irrigated agriculture are
    still being studied [113], more endeavours have recently been made in the water-resource
    management of irrigated agriculture [114,115], risk assessment of drought impacts
    [116], and environmental irrigation adaption [117], and analyze the effects of
    urbanization and agricultural activities on groundwater levels and salinity [118].
    In their research, Odeh et al. proposed an original conceptual model, which indicated
    that groundwater and its rate of abstraction is important to supply the increased
    number of inhabitants and their activities. With the help of these novel investigations
    and practical tests in real-life irrigated agriculture, all the computation models
    and theoretical methods proposed, including the decision-support systems and mathematical
    algorithms, which related to water resource allocation and performance management
    of irrigation systems, could be employed effectively in actual irrigated agriculture,
    which returns productive profits and facilitates knowledge promotion in precision
    irrigation cases. 5. Conclusions Precision irrigation represents an important
    shift in agricultural production. Water allocation mechanism and integrative management
    effectiveness are representative water theoretical/technical domains that emphasize
    agricultural irrigation quality. Based on the comprehensive discussions of water
    allocation mechanism and integrative management effectiveness, we underline several
    research directions in precision irrigation that could lead to the following new
    developments: Data-oriented irrigation management integrating Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) functions and big data. Distributed learning could be integrated into a precision
    irrigation process to increase field productivity and environmental adaptability;
    performance-proven water allocation mechanism capable of constructing accurate
    and instantaneous irrigation scheduling schemes while guaranteeing a high quality
    of water resource allocation service; cloud-based management systems for precision
    irrigation, implementing irrigation scheduling and effectiveness prediction for
    multi-objective service operations by considering environmental information exchanges;
    sustainable precision irrigation able to adaptively control the water consumption
    and moisture infiltration in the soil field, while fully considering actual integrative
    management requirements. Investigating these representative research directions
    helps to build sustainable, integrative, and evolutionary irrigation systems that
    could provide the higher quality and efficiency needed for the full application
    of precision irrigation. We provided a comprehensive outline of the latest research
    on the collaborative management of irrigation systems, the application characteristics,
    and the mechanism influences of precision irrigation. This review provides a theoretical
    and technical reference; the working principles of irrigation water allocation
    and the inherent mechanism of integrative management were fully revealed and clearly
    illustrated. Frontier topics such as data-oriented irrigation management, performance-proven
    water allocation, and cloud-based irrigation control are among the most critical
    areas to be further explored in the future development of precision irrigation.

  description: This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches to determine
    crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the FAO56 method.
    The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline concepts namely
    standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc approaches. Requirements
    for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and calibration are introduced.
    The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches is discussed before the
    review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop evapotranspiration and
    related soil water balance. A brief review on transient state models is also included.
    Baseline information is concluded with a discussion on yields prediction and performance

    the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling approaches are analyzed through
    a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc, mainly for derivation of basal
    and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach to relay intercrop cultivation,
    assessing alternative planting dates, determining beneficial and non-beneficial
    uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing the groundwater contribution
    to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table. The review finally discusses
    the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time irrigation scheduling, particularly
    the new modeling approaches for large scale multi-users application, use of cloud
    computing and adopting the internet of things (IoT), as well as an improved wireless
    association of modeling with soil and plant sensors. Further challenges refer
    to the use of remote sensing energy balance and vegetation indices to map Kc,
    ET and crop water and irrigation requirements. Trends are expected to change research
    issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional models mainly used for research
    while new, fast-responding and multi-users models based on cloud and IoT technologies
    will develop into applications to the farm practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue
    to be used, with ETo from gridded networks, re-analysis and other sources, and
    Kc data available in real time from large databases and remote sensing.

    Get rights and content Highlights • The base concepts of soil water balance (SWB)
    models using the dual Kc approach are discussed. • The use of SWB, transient state,
    and crop growth and yield models is discussed. • The SIMDualKc model is taken
    as example and various extensions of the dual Kc are presented. • Trends for real
    time irrigation are discussed, including remote and proximal sensing data assimilation.
    • Future trends are analysed from the perspective of using remote sensing and
    cloud data. Abstract This study reviews soil water balance (SWB) model approaches
    to determine crop irrigation requirements and scheduling irrigation adopting the
    FAO56 method. The Kc-ETo approach is discussed with consideration of baseline
    concepts namely standard vs. actual Kc concepts, as well as single and dual Kc
    approaches. Requirements for accurate SWB and appropriate parameterization and
    calibration are introduced. The one-step vs. the two-step computational approaches
    is discussed before the review of the FAO56 method to compute and partition crop
    evapotranspiration and related soil water balance. A brief review on transient
    state models is also included. Baseline information is concluded with a discussion
    on yields prediction and performance indicators related to water productivity.
    The study is continued with an overview on models development and use after publication
    of FAO24, essentially single Kc models, followed by a review on models following
    FAO56, particularly adopting the dual Kc approach. Features of dual Kc modeling
    approaches are analyzed through a few applications of the SWB model SIMDualKc,
    mainly for derivation of basal and single Kc, extending the basal Kc approach
    to relay intercrop cultivation, assessing alternative planting dates, determining
    beneficial and non-beneficial uses of water by an irrigated crop, and assessing
    the groundwater contribution to crop ET in the presence of a shallow water table.
    The review finally discusses the challenges placed to SWB modeling for real time
    irrigation scheduling, particularly the new modeling approaches for large scale
    multi-users application, use of cloud computing and adopting the internet of things
    (IoT), as well as an improved wireless association of modeling with soil and plant
    sensors. Further challenges refer to the use of remote sensing energy balance
    and vegetation indices to map Kc, ET and crop water and irrigation requirements.
    Trends are expected to change research issues relative to SWB modeling, with traditional
    models mainly used for research while new, fast-responding and multi-users models
    based on cloud and IoT technologies will develop into applications to the farm
    practice. Likely, the Kc-ETo will continue to be used, with ETo from gridded networks,

    use assessmentSIMDualKc model 1. Introduction The current imbalance between water
    demand and supply in agriculture has driven the search for new equilibria through
    adopting modern technologies and management tools to optimize irrigation water
    use (Pereira et al., 2009; Pereira, 2017; Jovanovic et al., 2020). The successful
    use of these tools depends, however, upon their adaptation to prevailing social,
    economic, institutional, climatic, soil and other environmental conditions. Reducing
    the vulnerability of agriculture to climate change, and ultimately decreasing
    the risks associated to food security, requires integrated and sustainable water
    management, including the adaptation of cropping systems and management practices
    adopting an efficient use of both rainfall and irrigation water. The need for
    such sustainable water management practices is particularly critical considering
    the steady increase of global population and the limitations on availability of
    natural resources, particularly in vulnerable agricultural areas where water scarcity
    is of great importance (Smith, 2000; Pereira, 2017). Sustainable water management
    at farm level assumes an enormous relevance, namely in terms of adopting adequate
    irrigation schedules, that should lead to optimal yields and agricultural and
    irrigation practices that allow reducing but optimizing water use, particularly
    non-beneficial ones (Pereira et al., 2009, 2012; Jovanovic et al., 2020). Numerous
    irrigation scheduling simulation models have been produced and made available
    to support irrigation decision-making since the 80’s as reported in various international
    conferences (ASAE, 1981, 1985, 1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995;
    Ragab et al., 1996; Smith et al., 1996). The reported irrigation scheduling models
    were often based upon crop evapotranspiration and yield-water relations proposed
    in FAO manuals 24 and 33 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977; Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979).
    Reported soil water balance (SWB) models include steady state and transient state
    models. Steady state models solve the law of conservation of mass within a selected
    time step, generally a day, while transient state models contain the time variable
    explicitly and computations refer to the fluxes of water within and through the
    boundaries of the control volume of soil. The latter, highly exigent in terms
    of data and using mechanistic approaches to simulate soil water processes, often
    include mechanistic sub-models to simulate plant growth, predict crop yields as
    influenced by various environmental factors, and to assess the transport of salt,
    chemicals and pollutants that impact farm water use and sustainability. Steady
    state SWB models are less exigent in terms of parameterization and, when properly
    calibrated, are very accurate and easier to use for irrigation scheduling, as
    well as to assess the impact of changing environmental conditions on crops evapotranspiration
    and yield, which may be predicted when the model is associated to, or incorporates
    yield-water functions. A variety of tools, namely using hyperspectral reflectance
    data (Melton et al., 2012; Campos et al., 2017; Pôças et al., 2017; Saadi et al.,
    2018), can be used to support improved irrigation scheduling. More commonly, remote
    sensing vegetation indices may be used in combination with ground data after integration
    in current SWB model approaches (Olioso et al., 2005; Er-Raki et al., 2007; Santos
    et al., 2008; Vazifedoust et al., 2009; Pôças et al., 2015; Thorp et al., 2015;
    Corbari et al., 2019), although adopting a variety of data and integrative solutions.
    The current paper is focusing on steady state SWB simulation models having a known
    software and, mainly, when adopting the FAO56 method to determine ETc from the
    reference ETo and a crop coefficient. Particular attention is given to models
    that adopt the dual Kc approach due to the relevance of determining transpiration
    and soil evaporation, the former consisting of the beneficial consumptive use
    of water. Considering the vast panoply of innovation tools that support sustainable
    water use on farms, the overarching aim of this paper is to provide a review of
    the advances gained in modelling with the FAO56 method in the past two decades.
    The specific objectives of this paper are: (a) to discuss simple approaches to
    steady state water balance modelling in contrast with transient state, mechanistic
    soil water, crop growth and yield models; (b) to provide for an overview on models/software
    used to improve irrigation scheduling and management, with focus on dual Kc modelling
    with consideration of water scarcity and saving; c) to show examples of model
    applications and water use assessment based on the SIMDualKc model; and d) to
    analyze current trends and opportunities, focusing particularly on real time irrigation
    scheduling using modern information technologies. This article consists of various
    Sections. After the current Introduction, Section 2 refers to main concepts and
    calculation approaches of the FAO56 method and includes discussions on the one-step
    approach, transient state modeling, crop growth and yield prediction, and water
    use indicators. Section 3 presents an overview of SWB models aimed at improving
    irrigation scheduling and management, and Section 4 focuses on the dual Kc approaches
    taking the SIMDualKc model as an example for adopting and extending the use of
    the FAO56 dual Kc approach. Section 5 discusses real time irrigation scheduling
    and latest developments, namely related to the applications of remote sensing
    and internet platforms aimed at multi-users, while Section 6 presents the main
    conclusions and future trends. 2. Reference concepts 2.1. Crop evapotranspiration,
    crop water requirements and irrigation requirements The FAO56 method (Allen et
    al., 1998) uses the simple Kc-ETo approach to determine crop evapotranspiration
    as the product of a crop coefficient (Kc) and the grass reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) computed with the FAO Penman-Monteith equation (PM-ETo). The PM-ETo equation
    is derived from the Penman-Monteith (PM) combination equation (Monteith, 1965)
    when it was parameterized for the standard grass reference crop (Allen et al.,
    1994a,b, 1998). As analyzed in the next Section, the PM equation is often used
    for direct calculation of crop ET. The FAO56 method adopted the concept of standard,
    optimal crop conditions as the basis for tabularizing the Kc values, which consisted
    of a main difference to the previous FAO24 method (Pereira et al., 2015a). Thus,
    Kc and ETc in FAO56 refer to potential crop ET rates under optimal, well-watered
    crop production conditions, which often differ from the field and common practice
    where crop conditions are often not optimal due to insufficient or non-uniform
    irrigation, low crop density, less adequate soil and agronomic management and/or
    salinity. The tabulated Kc values in FAO56 or in the review papers (Jensen and
    Allen, 2016; Pereira et al., 2020a,b,d) refer to the standard climate and need
    to be adjusted to the local climate (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). The potential ETc
    as computed from standard Kc values is then replaced by the actual crop ET, ETc
    act, and the standard Kc are replaced by the actual Kc act values, with Kc act
    =Ks Kc where Ks is a stress coefficient due to water deficiency or salinity effects,
    and that can be extended to other cultivation stresses. The concept of dual Kc
    was also adopted in addition to the traditional single one. The single Kc represents
    averaged soil evaporation (Es) and crop transpiration (Tc) from a cropped surface
    for typical frequencies of wetting. However, as noted by in the review by Pereira
    et al. (2015a), the single Kc only represents typical conditions that can vary
    with the wetting frequency by precipitation and irrigation, with the type of irrigation
    practiced and with crop management, namely the inter-row management in row crops.
    Adopting the concept of dual crop coefficient, Kc= Kcb+ Ke, where Kcb is the basal
    crop coefficient representing primarily plant transpiration and Ke is the evaporation
    coefficient that represents the contribution of evaporation from soil to total
    ET, the variation of both Es and Tc are considered independently. In view of this,
    the partition of ETc or ETc act into both these components as proposed by FAO56
    (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a) allows to better represent field and management issues
    when acting differently on Es and Tc. The two stage evaporation model of Ritchie
    (1972) is adopted for the calculation of Ke, which implies performing an independent
    water balance of the evaporation top layer of the soil. The FAO56 method is dealt
    in detail with the very recent reviews and updates of the single and basal crop
    coefficients (Pereira et al., 2020a through d). These reviews also focused on
    the accuracy of diverse ET measurement methods, namely the measurement of changes
    of soil water, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio energy balance, sap-flow, and remote
    sensing vegetation indices (Allen et al., 2011b; Pereira et al., 2020a,b). Crop
    water requirements (CWR, mm) consist of the seasonal amount of water required
    by a crop to achieve its potential production under a given environment. CWR correspond
    to the seasonal potential crop ET (ETc, mm) and added the seasonal leaching requirement
    (LR, mm) required to control effects of soil and water salinity in case of cropping
    in saline soils or when using salty water (including treated wastewater). LR is
    herein considered as part of the CWR given the importance for the crop yield and
    the soil environment to adopt appropriate salinity control. Salinity effects and
    related water management control measures were recently reviewed and discussed
    by Minhas et al. (2020). The net irrigation requirements (NIR, mm) consist of
    the amount of water that needs to be applied to the crop to fully satisfy its
    CWR when the water available through precipitation (P, mm), capillary rise (CR,
    mm) and soil water storage variation (SWvar, mm) are insufficient. NIR relative
    to the crop season, or to any selected time period, is given by the soil water
    balance as: (1) NIR = CWR – (P + SWvar + CR) + DP + RO where, in addition to variables
    previously defined, DP is deep percolation from the soil root zone (mm) and RO
    is runoff (mm), with all variables referring to the time period considered for
    the computation. The gross irrigation requirements (GIR, mm) for any time step
    is given as: (2) where BWUF is the beneficial water use fraction of the applied
    irrigation water (Pereira et al., 2012). BWUF is commonly referred as application
    efficiency when referring to the field, or combined conveyance, distribution and
    application efficiency when considering the operational losses in the conveyance
    and distribution canal and/or conduits systems in addition to application on the
    farm (Burt et al., 1997; Bos et al., 2005; Heermann and Solomon, 2007). 2.2. Computing
    the crop evapotranspiration: the one-step vs. the two-step approaches The Penman-Monteith
    combination equation (Monteith, 1965) may be used for computing crop ET as a one-step
    approach contrarily to the FAO56 method that adopts the two-step Kc-ETo product
    referred above. With the Penman-Monteith combination equation (PM-eq), crop ET
    is computed using the aerodynamic and bulk surface resistances of the crop; differently,
    with the FAO method crop ET is given as the product of the grass reference ET
    (ETo) by the crop coefficient (Kc). Kc represents the integrated differences between
    the considered crop and the reference crop in terms of aerodynamic and bulk surface
    resistances. ETo is derived from the PM combination equation parameterized for
    the grass reference crop. The Penman-Monteith combination equation (Monteith,
    1965) is generally written as (3) where λ is the latent heat of vaporization [MJ
    kg −1], Rn-G is the net balance of energy available at the surface [MJ m-2 d-1],
    (es-ea) represents the vapor pressure deficit (VPD) of air at the reference (weather
    measurement) height [kPa], ρ is mean air density [kg m-3], cp is specific heat
    of air at constant pressure [MJ kg-1 °C-1], Δ represents the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature relationship at mean air temperature [kPa °C-1], γ
    is the psychometric constant [kPa °C-1], rs is the bulk surface resistance [s
    m-1], and ra is the aerodynamic resistance [s m-1]. The transfer of heat and vapor
    from the evaporative surface into the air in the turbulent layer above a canopy
    is determined by the aerodynamic resistance ra between the surface and the reference
    level above the canopy. That transfer is determined by the wind speed, the height
    of wind speed, air temperature and air humidity measurements, as well as crop
    height and canopy architecture (Perrier, 1982). The surface resistance rs for
    full-cover canopies is often expressed as a function of the stomatal resistance
    of a well-illuminated leaf (rl) and of the effective leaf area index (LAIeff).
    The use of the PM-eq for prediction of crop water requirements is difficult because
    crop height and canopy architecture change throughout the crop cycle, thus changing
    the framework for computing ra and rs, which also changes with rl, thus with leaf
    age and water availability conditions, as well as with LAIeff. In addition, for
    the same crop, ra and rs are influenced by differences among varieties, and crop
    management and irrigation practices. Moreover, resistances rl and rs are influenced
    by the climate and water availability, with rs increasing when soil water availability
    limits ET, the VPD increases and ra is higher; rs decreases when the energy available
    at the surface increases. According to Alves et al. (1998) and Alves and Pereira
    (2000), rs may be expressed as dependent of ra and of the weather variables as
    (4) where β is the Bowen ratio (the ratio between the sensible and latent heat
    fluxes). In this equation β plays the role of a water-stress indicator. This equation
    illustrates that the weather variables interact and their influences are inter-dependent,
    which adds to the difficulties in appropriately selecting rs, thus creating challenges
    in applying the PM-eq or “multi-layer” resistance equations such as the two-source
    Shuttleworth and Wallace (SW) equation (Shuttleworth and Wallace, 1985). Various
    applications of the PM-eq (Eq. 3) are reported in the literature and they show
    that the SWB is not required to consider water stress impacts since the parameterization
    of Eq. 3 takes into account the water stress, e.g. through the consideration of
    stomatal conductance or predawn leaf water potential (Rana et al., 1997, 2001;
    Zhang et al., 2011). However, Ortega-Farias et al. (2004, 2006) performed the
    adjustment to water stress using a normalized soil water factor, similar to the
    stress coefficient Ks described in the next Section, which computation requires
    a simple SWB. A few studies compared the PM-eq with the Kc-ETo approach (Lovelli
    et al., 2008; Irmak and Mutiibwa, 2009). The accuracy of ET estimates depends
    upon the parameterization of the PM-eq. The one-step PM and SW equations are excellent
    for ET simulation but they are basically used in research, while the two-step
    Kc-ETo is used both in research and to support field practice as per the recent
    reviews by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo et al. (2020). The PM-eq (Eq. 3)
    is the base for the PM-ETo equation (Allen et al., 1994a,b, 1998), which for daily
    time steps computation takes the form (5) where, in addition to variables defined
    for Eq. (3), T is mean daily air temperature [°C] and u2 is wind speed [m s−1],
    with measurements at 2 m height. This represents a hypothetical crop with an assumed
    height of 0.12 m having a surface resistance of 70 s m−1 and an albedo of 0.23,
    closely resembling an extensive surface of green grass of uniform height, actively
    growing and adequately watered. This equation is also parameterized for hourly
    time steps (Allen et al., 2006). Kc represents an integration of the effects of
    three primary characteristics that distinguish the crop from the reference: crop
    height (affecting roughness and aerodynamic resistance); crop-soil surface resistance
    (related to leaf area, fraction of ground covered by vegetation, leaf age and
    condition, degree of stomatal control, and soil surface wetness); and albedo of
    the crop-soil surface (influenced by the fraction of ground covered by vegetation
    and soil surface wetness). It is defined through the ratio between potential crop
    evapotranspiration (ETc) and the reference ETo, thus (6) Kc = ETc/ETo The challenge,
    therefore, has been to summarize all referred differences relative to the PM-eq
    (Eq. 3) between the considered crop and the reference crop to just one parameter,
    Kc. Although, it was demonstrated (Pereira et al., 1999) that Kc values relate
    intimately with the ratios between ra and rs of the considered crop and the reference
    crop, which makes Kc a non-purely empirical parameter but a deterministic one.
    Though when using the two-step approach to compute crop ET, it is possible to
    achieve highly accurate estimation of crop ET, close to the accuracy obtained
    with the one-step PM-eq, despite the high requirements of the latter in terms
    of parameterization (Ortega-Farias et al., 2006; Lovelli et al., 2008; Irmak and
    Mutiibwa, 2009). 2.3. Soil water balance: the FAO56 method With the objective
    of managing irrigation in the day to day practice, instead of Eq. 1, the daily
    soil water balance applied to the entire root zone (Allen et al., 1998, 2007)
    may be expressed through computing the soil water depletion at the end of every
    day (Dr,i, mm), which is given as: (7) where Dr,i-1 is the root zone depletion
    at the end of previous day i-1 (mm), Pi is precipitation (mm), ROi is runoff (mm),
    Ii is the net irrigation depth that infiltrates the soil (mm), CRi is capillary
    rise from the shallow groundwater table (mm), ETc act,i is the actual crop evapotranspiration
    (mm), and DPi is deep percolation through the bottom of the root zone (mm), with
    all terms referring to day i. ETc act refers to both optimal and suboptimal crop
    and irrigation conditions, i.e., under full or deficit irrigation and/or diverse
    cropping practices. Solving the water balance equation (Eq. 7) requires soil water
    content observations (or their estimation from observed soil matric potential),
    which allow to estimate the root zone depletion Dr. A computational algorithm
    is required to perform a daily SWB, which is based upon the knowledge of soil
    hydraulic properties, the field capacity and wilting point ( FC and θWP, m3 m−3)
    of various soil layers down to the bottom of the root zone. To estimate runoff,
    deep percolation and capillary rise, appropriate algorithms are required as discussed
    by Liu et al. (2006) and Allen et al. (2007). RO, DP and CR cannot be just estimated
    when an accurate SWB is to be performed, thus appropriate computational approaches
    are required, including simple spreadsheet applications to just support irrigation
    scheduling. ETc act is computed as: (8) ETc act=Ks Kc ETo = (Ks Kcb + Ke) ETo
    which requires knowing the standard values of Kc and/or Kcb and the daily estimation
    of the stress coefficient Ks, as well as the adjustment to climate of standard
    Kc mid, Kc end, Kcb mid and Kcb end values (eqs. 62 and 65 of FAO56). Kc ini and
    Kcb ini values have to be determined as recommended by Allen et al. (1998, 2005a,2005b).
    Indicative Kc and Kcb values are tabulated by Allen et al. (1998), Allen and Pereira
    (2009), Jensen and Allen (2016) and updated by Pereira et al. (2020a,b) and Rallo
    et al. (2020). FAO56 expressed Ks as a linear function of root zone depletion
    Dr when depletion exceeds the readily available water, RAW (mm), in the root zone,
    thus: (9a) (9b) where TAW and RAW are, respectively, the total and readily available
    soil water (mm), and p is the soil water depletion fraction for no stress (Allen
    et al., 1998). TAW is defined as the available soil water stored in the root zone
    with depth zr (m), thus computed as 1000 (θFC - θWP) zr, and RAW corresponds to
    the readily available portion of TAW, thus RAW = p TAW. Updated values for the
    p fractions for vegetable and field crops are tabulated by Pereira et al. (2020a,
    b). The value for Ks due to salinity stress is discussed in FAO56 (Allen et al.,
    1998) and in the review paper by Minhas et al. (2020). Referring to Eq. 9, it
    may be deduced that when no water stress occurs (Ks = 1.0) then θ≥θp, i.e. the
    soil water content is not below the threshold θp, which corresponds to the soil
    water content when the soil water depletion equals the depletion fraction p for
    no stress [0 - 1]. Therefore, θp is assumed as the soil water content threshold
    for no-stress or full irrigation: (10a) A management allowed depletion (MAD) larger
    than p is selected when deficit irrigation is adopted, i.e., when the depletion
    fraction exceeds p. The respective soil water threshold is then θMAD < θp: (10b)
    Examples on using these thresholds are given in Section 4.4. When adopting the
    dual Kc approach, it is required to separately compute Kcb and Ke and two SWB
    are required, the one relative to the root zone for computing transpiration, the
    other relative to the top soil layer, from where evaporation occurs, to compute
    soil evaporation. A spreadsheet calculator was provided in Annex 8 of FAO56 (Allen
    et al., 1998). The computation of Ke is based upon the assumption that evaporation
    from the soil is governed by the amount of water available in the upper soil layer
    from where water evaporates, and the amount of energy available at the soil surface.
    The latter depends upon the portion of wetted ground surface exposed to radiation
    and the portion of total energy consumed by transpiration. Ke is then calculated
    as: (11) where Kr is the evaporation reduction coefficient [0-1], few is the fraction
    of soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation, Kcb is the basal crop coefficient
    representing transpiration, and Kc max is the maximum value for Kc following rain
    or irrigation (Allen et al., 1998, 2005a). Kc max depends upon mid-season climate,
    through the wind speed u2 (m s−1) and the minimum relative humidity RHmin (%),
    and upon crop height h (m): (12) where u2 = 2 m s−1 and RHmin = 45 % characterize
    the standard climate (Allen et al., 1998). The depth of water depleted from the
    few fraction of soil wetted and exposed (De, mm), is computed from the daily water
    balance of the upper 0.10 to 0.15 m of the soil as (13) where the subscript i
    refers to the day of estimation, Pi is the precipitation [mm], ROi is runoff [mm],
    Ii is the net irrigation depth [mm] that infiltrates the soil in the wetted fraction
    fw, (Ke ETo/few)i is the evaporation from the few fraction of the exposed soil
    surface [mm], and Ts i is the transpiration from the fw fraction of the evaporating
    soil layer [mm]. When De exceeds the readily evaporable water (REW), the evaporation
    rate decreases in proportion to the remaining water. Therefore, Kr (Eq. 11) is
    calculated as: (14a) (14b) where REW and TEW are respectively the readily and
    total evaporable water in the soil evaporation layer of depth ze (m), which depend
    upon the soil textural and hydraulic characteristics of that soil layer. Further
    details on the water balance of the evaporation layer are discussed by Allen et
    al. (1998, 2005a) and Rosa et al. (2012a, b). When the complete soil surface is
    fully wetted by precipitation or irrigation, the fraction few consists of the
    fraction of ground non-shaded by the vegetation (1-fc), thus few p = 1-fc, where
    fc is the average fraction covered by vegetation [0 – 1.0]. When only a fraction
    of the soil surface is wetted by irrigation, few i = min (1-fc, fw). These differences
    in few, thus in few Kc max (Eq. 11), evidence that it is required to compute separately
    Ke for the cases when rainfall and irrigation fully wet the ground, or when irrigation
    only partially wets the soil, e.g. under drip or furrow irrigation. Different
    few fractions then occur. A weighing coefficient for partitioning the energy available
    for soil evaporation depending upon fc and fw (Allen et al., 2005a, b; Rosa et
    al., 2012a) eases the daily Ke computation. The fraction fc should be observed
    in the field as reviewed by Pereira et al. (2020c); otherwise, it may be estimated
    according to Allen et al. (1998) as: (15) where Kc min is the minimum Kc for dry,
    bare soil, generally 0.15. The exponent \"1 + 0.5 h\" represents the effect of
    plant height on shading the soil and increasing the Kcb given a specific value
    for fc. (Kcb - Kc min) ≥ 0.01 for numerical stability. Eq. 11 is the base for
    partitioning ET. On the one hand, it shows that when the crop develops, from the
    initial to the mid-season stage, Kcb increases and the difference Kc max-Kcb therefore
    decreases, as well as the fraction few since fc also increases. Therefore, Ke
    decreases as much as Kcb and fc increase. Contrarily, during the late season Ke
    increases because Kcb and fc decrease. The rates of Kcb and fc variation, thus
    of Ke decrease or increase, change from a crop to another and with the management
    practices, with Kcb varying also with water and salinity stress (Ks, Eq. 9). On
    the other hand, Ke varies with the water amount available for evaporation, which
    depends upon Kr with the irrigation method and frequency of irrigation. The advantage
    of the adopted approach results from combining the variation of Kcb and Ke and
    adopting Kc max as the upper limit for Kcb+Ke. Therefore, there is the need for
    performing daily the water balance of the soil evaporation layer in addition to
    the root zone water balance, which increases the accuracy of computations. A discussion
    comparing the ET partition using the FAO56 dual Kc approach with that used in
    the popular AquaCrop model has been presented by Pereira et al. (2015b), which
    highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the FAO56 dual Kc approach. As referred
    by DeJonge and Thorp (2017), reported results with maize and cotton have shown
    that crop coefficient simulations with the dual “ETo-Kcb method better mimicked
    theoretical behavior, including spikes in the soil evaporation coefficient (Ke)
    due to irrigation and rainfall events and basal crop coefficient response as associated
    with simulated crop growth.” Consequently, the FAO56 approach has been implemented
    with the DSSAT Crop System Model (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017). 2.4. Soil water balance:
    transient state models Mechanistic approaches to the SWB commonly compute variably-saturated
    water flow as described by Richards’ equation: (16) where θ is the volumetric
    soil water content [L3 L−3], t is time [T], z is the vertical space coordinate
    [L], h is the pressure head [L], K is the hydraulic conductivity [L T−1], and
    S is the sink term accounting for water uptake by plant roots [L3 L−3 T−1]. The
    unsaturated soil hydraulic properties are often described with the van Genuchten-Mualem
    functional relationships (van Genuchten, 1980). These relationships require appropriate
    calibration. The sink term, S, may be calculated using the Feddes et al. (1978)
    approach where the potential transpiration rate, Tp [L T−1], is distributed over
    the root zone using the normalized root density distribution function, β(z,t)
    [L−1], and multiplied by the dimensionless stress response function, α(h, hϕ,
    z, t), that accounts for water and osmotic stresses. In HYDRUS-1D (Šimünek and
    Hopmans, 2009; Ramos et al., 2011) we have: (17) where Sp(z,t) and S(h, hϕ, z,
    t) are the potential and actual volumes of water removed from unit volume of soil
    per unit of time [L3 L−3 T−1], respectively, and α(h, hϕ, z, t) is a prescribed
    dimensionless function of the soil water (h) and osmotic (hϕ) pressure heads (0≤α≤1).
    The actual transpiration rate, Ta [L T-1], is obtained by integrating Eq. (13)
    over the root domain LR: (18) It is generally assumed that the potential root
    water uptake is reduced when water stress occurs due to deficit irrigation and/or
    osmotic potential resulting from soil salinity or the use of saline irrigation
    waters. While the Richards’ equation is commonly adopted in a variety of models,
    the sink term may be different from a model to another. For solving the Richards’
    equation, the formulation of the boundary conditions may be diverse. In SWAP (Vazifedoust
    et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2013), the upper boundary condition is determined by
    the fluxes of potential evapotranspiration computed with the PM-eq (Eq. 3). The
    model does not use the FAO56 method but it allows computing the actual Kc (Xu
    et al., 2013). Differently, with HYDRUS, the Kc-ETo approach is often used to
    define the potential ET flux at the upper boundary (Ramos et al., 2011); alternatively,
    Ramos et al. (2012) used the sum Kcb-ETo and Ke-ETo with Kcb and Ke obtained with
    a dual Kc partition tool. Transient state models may be calibrated purposefully
    for scheduling irrigation under selected conditions, e.g. the model SWB-2D for
    drip irrigated hedgerow orchards (Annandale et al., 2003). Transient state models
    usually perform the partition of ETc act with reference to the crop leaf area
    index (LAI), particularly when knowing its maximum values, LAImax. Because transient
    state models focus on the accurate simulation of water fluxes within and through
    the boundaries of the soil root zone, these models accurately compute DP and CR
    and, often also RO. When applied to rice, they can also simulate water depth in
    the paddies (Bhadra et al., 2013). These models may be used to parameterize steady
    state SWB models, e.g. the WAVE model was used to define the parametric DP and
    CR equations adopted in the model ISAREG (Liu et al., 2006) and later in SIMDualKc.
    Transient state models, since they are mechanistic models that accurately simulate
    the dynamics of transpiration, are commonly integrated with crop growth and yield
    models, e.g. SWACROP (Kabat et al., 1992) and SWATRER-SUCROS (Xevi and Feyen,
    1992). Currently, coupling of transient state and crop growth and yield models
    is commonly adopted, e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and
    EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). The advantage of transient state models is that soil water
    processes can be accurately described mechanistically, e.g. infiltration and water
    redistribution, root water uptake, deep percolation and capillary rise. However,
    the inputs of soil hydraulic properties, such as the soil water retention and
    permeability curves (respectively θ(h) and K(h) curves), are much more exigent
    than for simpler SWB models in terms of data acquisition and θ(h) and K(h) calibration.
    Often, the inverse model simulation needs to be adopted for their calibration
    before application. In addition, the vegetation parameters needed are much more
    complex than for FAO56-based SWB models. Therefore, these models are hard to parameterize
    and calibrate resulting more suitable for agronomic and irrigation research, and
    when assessing nitrates, chemicals and salinity dynamics in relation to crop growth
    and yield. Differently, the SWB models adopting the FAO56 methods are easier to
    use and appropriate to support practical irrigation scheduling and planning, as
    well as to assess the performance of irrigation management options. Along this
    line, the crop simulation models DSSAT-CSM, which basically require an accurate
    prediction of transpiration to predict biomass and yield accurately, recently
    adopted the FAO56 approaches (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017), namely the grass reference
    ETo and the FAO56 dual Kc approach. 2.5. Crop yields prediction and performance
    indicators for irrigation scheduling Knowledge of yield responses to water is
    required to construct irrigation scheduling models, namely aiming at developing
    appropriate irrigation schedules that cope with the variability of climatic conditions,
    water availability limitations, and the need to improve yields and economic returns.
    Crop growth models may then be used to predict biomass and yields in combination
    with predicted or assessed crop and irrigation management practices. The DSSAT-CSM
    models are often used for assessing yields when comparing irrigation management
    options (DeJonge et al., 2012; Thorp et al., 2014). By recently adopting the FAO56
    Kcb-ETo approach (Thorp et al., 2017), their use for assessing irrigation management
    options resulted easier to interpret. The crop growth and yield SWB AquaCrop (Raes
    et al., 2016) is also commonly used but, contrarily to the DSSAT models, its approach
    to calculating ET diverges from the FAO56 method. Another approach consists of
    coupling a crop model with a transient state model. e.g. WOFOST and HYDRUS-1D
    (Zhou et al., 2012) or SWAP and EPIC (Xu et al., 2013). These models may be very
    demanding in terms of parameterization and input data, but they are suitable when
    dealing with complex hydrologic and water quality conditions. Simple yield prediction
    approaches, such as the one by Jensen (1968), consist of a multiplicative parametric
    function that combines the effects of limited soil water on yield at various crop
    growth stages. Hanks (1974) developed the model PLANTGRO assuming that total dry
    matter production is directly proportional to the seasonal transpiration. For
    grain yield predictions, Hanks (1974) adapted the Jensen (1968) model and developed
    a multi-stage model (Hanks and Hill, 1980), while Stewart et al. (1977) assumed
    a linear dependence of the relative yield deficit from the relative evapotranspiration
    deficit, which is described as: (19) where Ky is the yield response factor, Ya
    and Ym are, respectively, the actual and maximum (potential) yields (kg ha−1),
    and ETc act and ETc are, respectively, the actual and potential crop evapotranspiration
    (mm) corresponding to the yields Ya and Ym. Ym may be observed or estimated. ETc
    act and ETc may be observed or computed with a SWB model. Ky values are tabulated
    for a wide range of crops (Doorenbos and Kassam, 1979) and they were updated recently
    (Minhas et al., 2020). Stewart et al. (1977) also proposed a multiple linear phasic
    model to account for the effects of water deficit during the vegetative, flowering
    and maturation stages using specific yield response factors (βi) for each stage
    i, which were tabulated by Doorenbos and Kassam (1979). Considering that transpiration
    is the ET component directly responsible for yield formation, and that various
    models perform the partition of ET, hence estimating transpiration, a modified
    version of Stewart’s model (Paredes et al., 2014) may be used to estimate Ya:
    (20) where Tc act and Tc are, respectively, the seasonal actual and potential
    crop transpiration (mm), thus replacing ET in Eq. (19). Research has shown that
    both Stewart’s global and phasic models predict yields with appropriate accuracy
    for evaluating irrigation schedules, namely when using Eq. (20) with Tc act data
    computed with the SIMDualKc model. Fig. 1a shows that maize yield predictions
    with Eq. (20) match well the yields observed in experiments carried out in both
    Portugal and Uruguay (Paredes et al., 2014; Giménez et al., 2016), and Fig. 1b
    shows a similar match of soybean yields relative to experiments developed in China
    and Uruguay (Wei et al., 2015; Giménez et al., 2017). Download : Download high-res

    (b0 - regression coefficient of a linear regression forced to the origin; R2 –
    coefficient of determination of the ordinary least squares regression, RMSE –
    root mean square error, NRMSE – normalized root mean square error). Water scarcity
    and global change lead irrigation water use to essentially aim at increased water
    productivity, water conservation and water saving. Water conservation refers to
    every policy, managerial measure, or user practice that aims at conserving or
    preserving the water resources and combating its degradation, namely focusing
    on its quality, while water saving aims at limiting or controlling the water demand
    and use, thus avoiding wastes and the misuse of water (Pereira et al., 2012; Pereira,
    2017). A comprehensive analysis on water conservation and saving measures and
    practices for a variety of agricultural uses was presented by Pereira et al. (2009,
    2012) and Jovanovic et al. (2020). Water productivity in agriculture (WP, kg m−3),
    also known as water use efficiency, may be generically defined as the ratio between
    the actual crop yield achieved (Ya) and the corresponding water use, which may
    refer to the total water use (TWU), hence including rainfall, to the irrigation
    water use (IWU), to the consumptive use (ETc act), or just to crop transpiration
    (Tc act). Therefore, different indicators result to assess diverse irrigation
    scheduling scenarios: (21) (22) (23) (24) where P is rainfall, CR is capillary
    rise or groundwater contribution, ΔSW is the variation in soil water storage in
    the root zone from planting to harvesting, I is the amount of irrigation, ETc
    act is the actual crop evapotranspiration, and Tc act is the actual crop transpiration,
    all expressed in m3 and referring to the crop season. Ya in Eqs. (21) through
    (24) may be observed, or may be estimated with a crop growth and yield model or
    with a simple water-yield parametric function as reported above. The meaning of
    indicators in Eqs. (21), (22), (23), (24) is necessarily different and indicators
    should be selected considering the actual farming objectives, the respective implications
    in terms of resource, environment and climate change, and the data availability.
    An application of similar WP concepts to olive orchards, including a related economic
    analysis, was recently discussed by Fernández et al. (2020). Improving WP could
    lead to water saving in irrigation but it requires the consideration of various
    factors. WP may be increased by minimizing the non-beneficial water uses such
    as percolation through the bottom of the root zone, runoff out of the irrigated
    fields, and losses by evaporation and wind drift in sprinkling. A high WP could
    be attained when increasing yields but, often, a higher WP is obtained when the
    crop is deliberately under-irrigated, thus when water stress is allowed in some
    less-sensitive crop stages; nevertheless, a yield reduction will then occur. 3.
    Overview of models aimed at improved irrigation scheduling 3.1. Soil water balance
    simulation models from FAO24 to FAO56 Many models have been proposed since the
    early 1980’s following the publication of FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    which has been the landmark in the domain of crop water requirements and irrigation
    scheduling. Model papers considered herein limit to those having an identified
    software, adequate reference to calibration and/or validation, and not referring
    to single uses only. In addition, since the objectives of the current review refer
    to FAO56 with focusing on the dual Kc approach and considering that transient
    state models are dealt in Section 2.4, the reviewed SWB refer to models using
    a Kc approach, mainly referring to FAO24 and to FAO56. Numerous SWB models have
    been developed since the 1980’s as early reviewed by Lascano (1991). Related articles
    were often presented in research reports or to scientific conferences (ASAE, 1981,
    1990; Feyen, 1987; Pereira et al., 1992, 1995; Smith et al., 1996; Ragab et al.,
    1996). These articles show a great variety of approaches, using the FAO Kc-ETo
    and/or transient state models, which received the preference of researchers by
    that time (Belmans et al., 1983). Developments also included landscape and turf
    grass irrigation. ETo equations were diverse because FAO24 (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977) proposed various alternative equations. Howell et al. (1990) presented a
    first application of the Penman-Monteith grass reference equation proposed by
    Allen et al. (1989) when a commonly used ETo equation was the Penman equation.
    Without a common ETo definition and equation, standard Kc values could not be
    defined despite a consolidated set of Kc values was presented in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977) for numerous field, vegetable and woody crops. These authors
    proposed the well-known segmented FAO Kc curve but various curvilinear approaches
    were in use (e.g., Wright, 1982; HiIl, 1991). However, the segmented Kc curve
    was adopted by several authors (Howell et al., 1990; Combre and Kamieniarz, 1992;
    Teixeira and Pereira, 1992). Single Kc models of the 80’s and 90’s were often
    developed for application at farm level and evolved to support farm irrigators’
    communities. A first model has been developed with CIMIS, the California Irrigation
    Management Information System (Snyder, 1986), which keeps evolving nowadays and
    is based on a large grid of weather stations and a very large number of users
    (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/ accessed on 27 May 2020) and partners. Among the
    latter is the Satellite Irrigation Management Support framework (SIMS, Melton
    et al., 2012, 2020). The model CROPWAT (Smith, 1988, 1992) is paradigmatic since
    it consisted of a database built from FAO24 data (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977),
    a supplementary CLIMWAT weather database, a reference ET calculator and a water
    balance computational tool able to propose an irrigation scheduling calendar for
    the selected crop, soil and field. The model was updated after the FAO experts
    consultation on crop water requirements (Smith et al., 1991) and the publication
    of FAO 56, and has been successively upgraded. The version CROPWAT 8.0 has been
    recently released. BIdriCo (Danuso et al., 1995) is updated and is operating with
    real time weather data to support irrigation farmers of the Friuli Venezia Giulia
    region, Italy. IRRICANNE is an irrigation scheduling simulation model (Combre
    and Kamieniarz, 1992) designed to support sugarcane producers and was used for
    many years in the Island of Reunion. The model RENANA (Giannerini, 1995) was applied
    to support farmers irrigation scheduling in the Emilia-Romagna Region and evolved
    to a large-scale web based DSS, IRRINET, in use by farmers of various regions
    of Italy (Mannini et al., 2013), as well as to support irrigation water delivery
    (Genovesi et al., 2019). Three models early reported - IRSIS (de Goes Calmon et
    al., 1992), ISAREG (Teixeira and Pereira, 1992) and PILOTE (Mailhol et al., 1996)
    - were designed for both research and application in the field practice. IRSIS
    (Raes et al., 1988) was modified to produce BUDGET (Raes et al., 2006) that was
    further developed with extensions for improved water balance and yield assessment
    (Shrestha et al., 2010), then becoming the SWB basis of the crop model AquaCrop
    (Raes et al., 2016). ISAREG adopted the PM-ETo equation following the FAO Expert
    Consultation that decided its adoption (Smith et al., 1991). ISAREG was first
    modified to support real time farmers advising with the development of RELREG
    (Teixeira et al., 1995), later turning into a web based DSS, WEBISAREG (Branco
    et al., 2005), and developing GIS facilities, HYDROGEST (Mateus et al., 2007).
    However, since the Irrigation Associations did not develop local support to farmers,
    the model was used essentially for research after adoption of computational tools
    relative to DP, CR and salinity (Pereira et al., 2007, 2009). It is currently
    used in several countries, e.g. Brazil (Saraiva et al., 2017), Bulgaria (Popova
    et al., 2014) and China (Zheng et al., 2014). Meanwhile, ISAREG was the base of
    SIMDualKc (Rosa et al., 2012a), described in the next Section. PILOTE software
    has been continuously improved and it became a crop model with various capabilities
    including irrigation and crop management (Mailhol et al., 2004, 2018). CADSM (Walker
    et al., 1995) was the first distributed SWB model aimed at computing the aggregated
    irrigation demand at the command area of a collective irrigation system using
    the Kc-ETo approach. It was also one of the first models using the PM-ETo equation
    after it was proposed to a wide audience (Allen et al., 1994a,b). Similarly, the
    combined use of the ISAREG model and the paddy basins simulation model IRRICEP
    (Paulo et al., 1995) was adopted to simulate the demand hydrographs at the sector
    level in a collective irrigation system using the FAO methods (Teixeira et al.,
    1996). Buchleiter (1995) presented the model SCHED for scheduling irrigations
    with a center-pivot system. However, this type of approach is currently replaced
    by precision irrigation software, namely variable rate scheduling with support
    of wireless sensors (e.g. O’Shaughnessy et al., 2012). Hess (1996) reported on
    a microcomputer irrigation-scheduling model to be available for farmers since
    they were progressively adopting such computing facilities; however, with changes
    in hardware the approach was abandoned. The SIMDSS (Malano et al., 1996) was developed
    for practical irrigation scheduling and improved surface irrigation practices
    aimed at an integrated real-time management for pastures in SE Australia. MARKVAND
    was a DSS system for farmers use in Denmark, which software provides information
    on timing and volumes of irrigation as well as on the expected economic returns
    (Plauborg et al., 1996). Changes in technologies led to abandon these type of
    models. Models including the partitioning of ET into transpiration and soil evaporation
    were rare. The first was reported by Wright (1982) but his pioneer approach aimed
    at deriving Kcb when soil water evaporation could be considered nil, i.e. the
    soil surface was dry but transpiration was near optimal. The approach applied
    well to infrequent water applications but not to highly frequent wettings; however,
    data reported by this author have been fundamental in developing the FAO56 dual
    Kc approach (Allen et al., 1998). Tuzet et al. (1992) developed an approach where
    ET partition was supported by the observed LAI. Many researchers lately followed
    a LAI approach for partitioning ET. Further developments in using a dual Kc were
    initiated after publication of FAO56, mainly using its spreadsheet for calculation
    of Kcb and Ke, which still is used at present. A first SWB model relative to paddy
    rice using the Kc-ETo approach, the IRRICEP model, was reported by Paulo et al.
    (1995). The model required not only the calibration of Kc values but the calibration
    of soil hydraulic properties determining the computation of percolation adopting
    a Darcy approach, as well as lateral seepage to downstream paddies and drainage
    ditches. That model was later used by Mao et al. (2004) adopting the PM-ETo equation.
    Singh et al. (2001) modified the model SAWAH to adopt the Kc-ETo approach and
    a partition of actual crop ET based upon an empirical exponential function of
    LAI. Agrawal et al. (2004) developed a Visual Basic SWB model where the Kc-ETo
    is used, seepage is computed with the Dupuit approach and percolation is determined
    with a soil water simulation using partial differential equations distinguishing
    water ponded conditions and unsaturated conditions when intermittent irrigation
    is used. Transient state approaches for the ponded and the unsaturated conditions
    were also used by Khepar et al. (2000) when modeling intermittent paddy irrigation.
    A different approach is reported by Jeon et al. (2005), who developed PADDIMOD.
    In this model, surface drainage and percolation are estimated with parametric
    equations, which require parameters calibration. These referred models, despite
    posterior to the publication of FAO56, did not adopt the PM-ETo equation but FAO24
    equations. 3.2. Soil water balance simulation models after FAO56 This review focused
    only on SWB simulation models using the FAO56 Kc-ETo approach and which calibration
    and validation procedures are recognizable. Many other publications on SWB models
    not using the Kc-ETo method and not adopting the PM-ETo equation were not considered.
    The selected SWB models are presented in Table 1 for those using the single time
    averaged Kc, while Table 2 refers to the SWB models using the FAO56 dual Kc approach
    (see Section 2.3 above) or a similar approach where LAI replaces fc. Table 1.

    are used: Csalt – Salt concentration in the soil solution; ECe – Electrical conductivity
    of the soil saturation extract; ETsalt – Actual crop evapotranspiration affected
    by salinity; Ksat – Soil hydraulic conductivity at saturation. Abbreviations:
    n/r – not reported; seep – seepage. Single Kc models in Table 1 are diverse in
    terms of the target crops; these can be single annual crops, e.g. maize, wheat,
    cotton or paddy rice, or various annuals and/or perennials. They have in common
    the use of the FAO56 PM-ETo equation, in some cases also considering alternative
    temperature based methods, and the use of the stress coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including
    modifications for paddies water balance. Models have a variety of base input parameters.
    Soil base parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, but θsat and Ksat may also
    be included when deep percolation and capillary rise are among the model outputs.
    Only one model (ISAREG) uses the input of electrical conductivity of the soil
    saturation extract (ECe, dS m−1) to compute the ET reduction due to salinity (ETsalt)
    as described in FAO56 and by Minhas et al. (2020). All reported models were calibrated
    and validated, generally using SWC data, a few using ETc act or Tc act (Consoli
    et al., 2016; Mancosu et al., 2016), and the ponded water depths in case of paddy
    rice (de Silva and Rushton, 2008; Inthavong et al., 2011). The model outputs are
    diverse but all models, in addition to ET, provide DP estimates. Several models
    also compute RO but CR is only provided by few models (Pereira et al., 2003; Shang
    and Mao, 2006; Chopart et al., 2007; Boegh et al., 2009; Consoli et al., 2016).
    Paddy water models outputs refer to the ponded water and to DP, seepage and drainage.
    References to the possible use of remote sensing data are very limited. SWB models
    using the dual Kc approach are referred in Table 2. As for single Kc models, they
    are diverse in terms of the target crops but most of them can be used with both
    annual and perennial crops. A few refer to annuals or only to specific crops (wheat,
    maize, groundnuts and paddy rice). All use the PM-ETo equation and the stress
    coefficient Ks (Eq. 9), including those modified for paddies. Models have a variety
    of base soil input parameters. Soil parameters commonly include θFC and θWP, a
    few θsat and Ksat, and some models (Annandale et al., 1999; Ragab, 2002) also
    have a transient state approach and require θ(h) and K(θ). Salinity base data
    on ECe are used in the AQUACROP and SIMDualKc models, while SALTMED and “SWB”
    use the salt concentration in the soil water. Models are calibrated and validated
    with SWC data but some models may be calibrated with ETc act or Tc act data (Rosa
    et al., 2012a, b; Campos et al., 2016); when they also predict actual yields,
    Ya data may also be used for calibration (Ragab, 2002; Raes et al., 2012). Model
    outputs are diverse but all models, in addition to ETc act and Tc act, provide
    for DP while a few also compute RO. The computation of CR is only available from
    the models SALTMED, AquaCrop, SIMDualKc and the model reported by Han et al. (2018).
    The paddy rice model RiceWCA (Yang et al., 2012) outputs are different from those
    referred before and include the predicted applied water, DP, seepage, and tail
    water runoff. A few models refer to the possibility of using remote sensing-retrieved
    data. This review recognized that few models are able to compute groundwater contribution
    from a water table as well as impacts of salinity. DSSAT crop models using Kc-ETo
    with the dual Kc approach (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) could be added in Table 2
    but they are very different from the listed models and rarely used for irrigation
    scheduling. Farmers’ information models commonly using Kcb values derived from
    remote sensing vegetation indices, such as SIMS (Melton et al., 2012, 2020; Cahn
    and Johnson, 2017), consist also of a peculiar group of dual Kc models that require
    mention. For selecting the best crop irrigation schedules, the SWB models adopt
    user-friendly software that helps the users to handle data and, often, to compute
    indicators such as those referred in Section 2.5. Performance scenarios may be
    the object of ranking, e.g. when DSS approaches adopt multi-criteria analysis
    as discussed by Darouich et al. (2014, 2017), namely when the selection of irrigation
    schedules is tied to the performance of the irrigation method. However, the use
    of multi-criteria analysis is rare in irrigation scheduling and, commonly, only
    simple comparisons of indicators are used (Paredes et al., 2014, 2017a,b; Pereira
    et al., 2015b). 4. The dual Kc soil water balance approach using the model SIMDualKc
    4.1. Brief presentation of the model SIMDualKc is a quite unique software model
    that performs a daily soil water balance at the field scale (Rosa et al., 2012a,b)
    adopting the dual Kc approach to compute and partition crop ET into Tc and Es.
    Data inputs and model outcomes are described in Fig. 2 where the flowchart of
    the model is presented. In general, compulsory data inputs are common to other
    SWB models that adopt the FAO56 dual Kc approach, although requirements may change
    with the type of algorithms used in computations. Facultative data differ depending
    upon the specific objectives of the simulation. This is the case for data used
    to compute runoff, deep percolation, groundwater contribution, as well as effects
    of mulches and no-till planting, active ground cover, intercropping, and soil
    and water salinity. Naturally, model outcomes also differ depending on the modelling
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (919KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Simplified flowchart of SIMDualKc model (modified from Rosa et al.,
    2012a). Model calibration consists of adjusting the influential model parameters
    within their reasonable ranges so that the model results are consistent with available
    observed data, thus estimation errors are minimized. The process of validation
    permits the verification of the goodness of fitting when the model is used with
    the set of calibrated parameters but with different, independent data sets, without
    tuning such parameters. Calibration and validation of models and appropriate goodness-of-fit
    indicators are a must for every model as discussed by several authors (e.g., Moriasi
    et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012) and by Pereira et al. (2015b) relative to SIMDualKc.
    The calibration parameters of SIMDualKc consist of: Kcb and p relative to the
    various crop growth stages; Ze, TEW and REW characterizing the soil evaporation
    layer; the parameter CN relative to the runoff algorithm; and the parameters relative
    to the DP and CR parametric functions. Initial sets of these parameters are inputs
    to the model, which are improved through calibration. Soil water content observations
    are the most commonly used for calibration, e.g. Fandiño et al. (2012, 2015) for
    a vineyard and for hop for industry, Zhao et al. (2013) for maize and wheat, Wu
    et al. (2016) for a groundwater dependent grassland, and Paredes et al. (2017a)
    relative to pea for industry. Calibration may also be performed by comparing observed
    eddy covariance ET with model computed ETc act for field crops (Zhang et al.,
    2013; Tian et al., 2016) and citrus orchards (Peddinti and Kambhammettu, 2019),
    or by comparing observed sap-flow transpiration data with simulated Tc act (Paço
    et al., 2012, 2019; Qiu et al., 2015). Descriptions of the calibration and validation
    processes are provided in the cited applications. Various methods may be used
    to estimate accurately actual crop ET as reviewed by Allen et al. (2011b) and
    Pereira et al. (2020a,b). Methods include the measurement of the soil water content
    for deriving ET from the SWB, the measurement of ETc act using eddy covariance
    (EC) or Bowen ratio energy balance (BREB) systems, as well as the measurement
    of Tc act with sap-flow systems. All these methods are potentially very accurate
    as point measurements, and the EC and BREB are used in such a way that their footprint
    may span a relatively large area representative of the vegetation. EC is receiving
    the preference of many ET users, but measurements of the soil water content (SWC)
    and sap-flow continue to be largely used. Fig. 3a shows the comparisons of simulated
    and observed seasonal SWC data of a wheat crop used to calibrate SIMDualKc, and
    Fig. 3b shows a similar comparison of simulated wheat ETc act with EC observed
    data, both obtained at the same location in North China plain (Zhang et al., 2013;
    Zhao et al., 2013). The goodness-of-fit indicators resulted similar, i.e. there
    was no advantage of one calibration over the other, which means that a user may
    select the most convenient approach to calibrate a model if measurements of SWC,
    ETc act or Tc act are accurately performed. Download : Download high-res image

    the calibration of SIMDualKc for winter wheat in North China plain: (a) simulated
    vs. observed soil water content (adapted from Zhao et al., 2013) and (b) simulated
    vs. observed ETc act (adapted from Zhang et al., 2013). 4.2. Deriving crop coefficients
    Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB simulations is a main capability of SWB models, e.g.
    SALTMED (Silva et al., 2012), which is quite common for vegetable and field crops
    as reported in recent reviews (Pereira et al., 2020a,b); however, it is uncommon
    for fruit trees and vines. In the case of evergreen trees and vines, a full crop
    coefficient curve requires that, in addition to the Kc and Kcb for the initial,
    mid-season and end-season, the Kc and Kcb values for the non-growing period are
    also known. Moreover, due to climate differences between the growing and non-growing
    seasons, the Kc and Kcb curves may be substantially different. Nevertheless, there
    are various examples of derivation of Kc and Kcb for orchards (e.g., Peddinti
    and Kambhammettu, 2019). As an example for evergreen woody crops, a study performed
    with irrigated olives in southern Portugal (Paço et al., 2019) is analyzed. Crop
    transpiration was measured with the sap-flow Granier method, which data provided
    for calibrating SIMDualKc, thus obtaining the best Kcb values for the initial,
    mid-season, end-season and non-growing periods. A few observations of ETc act
    with an EC system were also used for testing. The Kcb curve (Fig. 4) resulted
    in a FAO segmented curve with higher Kcb during the growing season, spring and
    summer, when irrigation was applied, and smaller Kcb in the non-growing period,
    when transpiration is naturally low. Differently, because it depends on soil evaporation,
    the time averaged Kc (=Kcb+Ke) resulted smaller during the active growing period,
    when Es and Ke were low because precipitation was reduced and drip lines were
    located directly in line with the crop and shaded by the crop canopy, thus irrigation
    was applied under trees’ shadow. Contrarily, Kc was larger in fall and winter,
    when rainfall occurred (Fig. 4). A segmented Kc curve resulted with low values
    by the mid-season and a Kcb curve with a higher value during the mid-season. The
    Kc curve changed with rainfall, with Kc mid and Kc in the non-growing season,
    which is higher when rainfall was larger (Fig. 4a) and smaller under dry conditions.
    Contrarily, the standard Kcb values did not change. When considering the daily
    Kcb act, changes occurred depending on the water stress of the olive crop. The
    daily Kc act changed a lot, causing the referred changes in the Kc curve. Download

    Standard and actual basal and single crop coefficient and soil evaporation coefficient
    curves for a super-intensive olive orchard in two contrasting rainfall years:
    a) wet year and b) dry year (Paço et al., 2019). Deriving Kcb and Kc from SWB
    simulations is also uncommon for forage crops managed with cuttings. The FAO56
    approach for Kcb and Kc of forages managed with cuttings consists of adopting
    a segmented curve for each cut (Allen et al., 1998). SIMDualKc has proved appropriate
    to support the derivation of Kcb and Kc under these conditions in an application
    to Tifton 85 bermudagrass in Santa Maria, Brazil (Paredes et al., 2018b). The
    cutting treatments were spaced according to selected cumulative growth degree
    days (CGDD), which varied among treatments. With this approach, shorter time spans
    between cuttings resulted in summer and longer ones in winter. Results for Kcb
    and Kc with cuttings at CGDD of 248 °C, which refer to six forage cuttings, and
    372 °C, with only four cuttings, are presented in Fig. 5a and 5b respectively.
    The computed time average Kc before the cuttings are 0.96 for the CGDD 248 °C
    and 0.97 for CGDD 372 °C while the Kc after cuttings, when the forage crop is
    shorter, decreased to 0.92 and 0.95, respectively. Reported time averaged Kc before
    and after cuttings are close due to abundant precipitation during the crop season.
    The standard Kcb before the cuttings are 0.93 for the treatment with CGDD of 248 °C
    and 0.94 for CGDD of 372 °C while Kcb values after cuttings were respectively
    0.83 and 0.84. Values for the standard Kcb would be more distinct if the forage
    height would be smaller after cuttings. Results show that the approach proposed
    in FAO56 for Kc and Kcb curves for forages managed with cuttings was applicable
    with SIMDualKc. Download : Download high-res image (381KB) Download : Download

    where cuttings were performed for cumulative growth degree days of (a) 248 °C
    and (b) 372 °C (adapted from Paredes et al., 2018b). 4.3. ET and crop coefficients
    of relay inter-cropping An approach based on light/shadow effects was used to
    estimate ETc act and its partition for crops cultivated in a relay inter-cropping
    system. The mutual effects of shading by the crops combined in an inter-crop system
    were estimated by considering the height of both crops and the fraction of ground
    covered by each crop throughout the crop season (Miao et al., 2016). This principle
    is based upon the approach of Allen and Pereira (2009) to compute Kcb for a fruit
    crop cultivated with active ground cover. Naming the first planted crop as dominant
    and the second as the subordinate crop, and considering their interaction, the
    Kcb of the intercrop (Kcb inter) may be estimated daily as (Miao et al., 2016):
    (25) where Kcb dom and Kcb sub are, respectively, the Kcb values of the dominant
    and subordinate crops when mono-cropped, and Kd dom and Kd sub are the density
    coefficients of the dominant and subordinate crops. Kd are computed as: (26a)
    (26b) where fsc dom and fsc sub are the fractions of the soil surface cropped
    with the dominant and the subordinate crops, respectively, and hdom and hsub are
    the heights of the dominant and subordinate crops, respectively. The max function
    in Eqs. (25) and (26) aims at considering that the conditions observed at earlier
    stages, Kcb dom > Kcb sub and h dom >h sub, may change with the growth of the
    subordinate crop, thus making Kcb sub > Kcb dom and h sub > h dom. For example,
    this is the case of the wheat-sunflower intercrop, where sunflower develops taller
    than wheat when the latter matures, thus Kcb sunf > Kcb wheat and hsunf > hwheat.
    The application of this methodology to a winter wheat-sunflower relay inter-cropping
    in Hetao, China, is illustrated in Figs. 6a and b, which show the Kcb, Kcb act
    and Ke relative to wheat and sunflower mono-cropped, while Fig. 6c shows Kcb,
    Kcb act and Ke for the inter-cropping of both. Fig. 6a shows that a small stress
    occurred for wheat while Fig. 6b evidences that sunflower was largely stressed
    during the mid- and late-season stages, thus indicating that a large irrigation
    should have been given early in the mid-season. The resulting potential Kcb of
    the inter-cropping system (Fig. 6c) was smaller than that of the crops when single-cropped,
    with Kcb act following the trends evidenced for both crops when cropped alone.
    The Ke values also followed the Ke curves of both crops but they were different
    because basin irrigation was used and water was applied to the entire field, including
    when the second crop was not sowed yet, thus producing high evaporation in the
    non-cropped parts of the field. Fig. 6c shows that four irrigations were applied
    to the intercrop, however too early for sunflower that, contrarily to wheat, exhibited
    large water stress during mid- and late seasons. This is a consequence of avoiding
    irrigation by the end-season of wheat. The example shows that the use of a calibrated
    model helps interpreting and evaluating the irrigation schedules of intercropped
    crops. Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    Miao et al., 2016). 4.4. Assessing alternative planting dates An important issue
    in developing irrigation calendars is assessing the impacts of changing planting
    dates. Such changes may be desired when anticipating planting dates may increase
    the probability of rainfall early in the season, or to avoid hot waves in the
    late season. This search of better planting dates may be performed with irrigation
    scheduling models and using a statistical analysis of weather time series, namely
    when supplemental irrigation is practiced, such as with small grains and grain
    legumes in the Mediterranean area. However, few examples are available in the
    literature and they mostly refer to the impacts on crop yields rather than on
    water requirements. Abi-Saab et al. (2014) provided a good example relative to
    sunflower and soybean cropped in Lebanon, while Montoya and Otero (2019) reported
    an application to soybean in Uruguay, in both cases using the AquaCrop model.
    A different approach, using BUDGET, consisted of performing an analysis of risk
    relative to maize planting dates (Kipkorir et al., 2007). Various supplemental
    irrigation schedules for malting barley for industry were assessed for two contrasting
    rainfall years (Pereira et al., 2015b; Paredes et al., 2017b) using a cultivar
    that adjusts to a wide planting period, from November to January. Center-pivot
    irrigation was used with depths of 8 mm per event and ceasing 25 days before harvest
    to prevent water-related diseases that could affect malt grain quality. Based
    upon the observed sowing dates, the following alternatives were considered: 16th
    and 30th of December, and 6th and 16th of January. These sowing dates were assessed
    in terms of impacts on the total water use (TWU), forecasted yields (Ya), and
    water productivity (WPtotal, Eq. 21) defined in Section 2.5. They were also assessed
    considering two contrasting rainfall years - wet (2013) and dry (2012) – and various
    supplemental irrigation scenarios: Sc. 1: Full irrigation as practiced by the
    farmer (MAD = p); Sc. 2: Very mild water deficit during the entire season (MAD = 1.10
    p, Eq. 10); Sc. 3: Moderate water deficit during most of the crop season (MAD = 1.20
    p), but very mild (MAD = 1.10 p) during flowering/grain filling; Sc. 4: Moderate
    water stress during the entire season (MAD = 1.20 p); Sc. 5: Rainfed. Fig. 7 shows
    the predicted TWU, yield and WP indicators for the four sowing dates and five
    irrigation management scenarios. The adoption of early sowing leads to a smaller
    TWU than late sowing, particularly in the wet year. In the dry year, differences
    in TWU among irrigation management scenarios are larger than those due to planting
    dates. Yields show to increase for the last two planting dates but, again, differences
    in yields are greater among irrigation scenarios. Under dry conditions, the use
    of supplemental irrigation to meet barley water requirements is essential since
    yields are much lower under rainfed conditions. Differences in water productivity
    are larger among planting dates and quite small among irrigation management scenarios.
    Combining information relative to these three indicators, it was identified that
    the best sowing dates are likely those around the first days of January. The mid-January
    date is discouraged because the crop cycle enters in a period of high water demand
    by the late season, which increases TWU and decreases WP. The consideration of
    economic criteria would also be beneficial. This example shows the usefulness
    of a SWB model in recommending best planting dates to help farmers’ decisions.
    This can also be based on weather forecasts that provide for anticipating crop
    growth conditions. Download : Download high-res image (347KB) Download : Download

    various sowing dates and alternative irrigation schedules relative to two contrasting
    rainfall years (adapted from Paredes et al., 2017b). 4.5. Assessing beneficial
    and non-beneficial water uses The analysis of the water use by a crop allows to
    perform the field water balances and assess the time dynamics of its input and
    output terms, thus determining which are the consumptive and non-consumptive uses
    of water and, likely more important, which uses and consumptions are beneficial
    or, contrarily, consist of water waste and losses (Pereira et al., 2012). Molden
    and Sakthivadivel (2011) applied similar water use concepts at the basin scale,
    and Lecina et al. (2010) used this type of assessment to evaluate improvements
    of surface and sprinkler irrigation at the project scale. An application at field
    scale aimed at maximizing beneficial water use and controlling the non-beneficial
    one using the DSSAT-maize model is reported by Jiang et al. (2016). An application
    of the SIMDualKc model to a malt barley cropped under center-pivot irrigation
    in Central Portugal (Pereira et al., 2015b) is used herein as example of assessing
    beneficial and non-beneficial water uses throughout the crop cycle. The model
    was calibrated using field data of the dry year 2012 and was validated with data
    of the wet year 2013. The various SWB terms for both years and four crop growth
    stages are presented in Table 3. Groundwater contribution was not included in
    the balance because the water table was below 10 m deep. Irrigation water application
    depths averaging 7 mm per event were adopted to prevent high water stress. Table

    DP – deep percolation, ETc - crop evapotranspiration, ETc act - actual crop evapotranspiration,
    Tc act - actual crop transpiration, Es – soil evaporation. The non-consumptive
    water use terms, runoff (RO) and deep percolation (DP), were about nil in the
    dry year. RO was 10.5 % of the seasonal precipitation (P) in the wet year while
    DP, a potentially recoverable resource providing for vadose zone and aquifer recharge,
    represented nearly 30 % of P. The consumptive use terms, Tc act and Es, respectively
    beneficial and non-beneficial, showed a similar partition in both years, with
    transpiration representing 77 % of ETc act in the wet year and 79 % in the dry
    year. Es was smaller in the dry year because there was insufficient water supply
    during the late season, with ETc act representing only 64 % of the potential ETc.
    This fact occurred due to irrigation cutoff 25 days before harvesting in both
    years, with stored soil water supplying the crop in the wet year but not in the
    dry year. Otherwise, differences in consumptive water use in both years are small
    and are due to the higher climatic demand in the dry year, when ETc was larger
    by 56 mm relative to the wet year. Performing water use assessment adopting this
    approach is uncommon but could be helpful when considering issues for water conservation.
    4.6. Assessing the groundwater contribution from a shallow watertable The assessment
    of groundwater contribution (GC) to crop water needs in the presence of a shallow
    water table is often performed with a transient state modeling approach (e.g.
    Ragab, 2002; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Acharya and Mylavarapu, 2015). Empirical
    functions are used by others, such as Yang et al. (2007), who computed GC as a
    function of the depth of the water table, the soil water storage and crop ET,
    which consists of a modification of the empirical approach proposed in FAO24 (Doorenbos
    and Pruitt, 1977). Differently, Liu et al. (2006) developed a parametric function
    for use in ISAREG and, later, with SIMDualKc, which parameters are calibrated
    during the process of model calibration (e.g., Cholpankulov et al., 2008). With
    this approach, GC is a function of the actual water table depth, the actual soil
    water storage in the root zone, crop evapotranspiration and potential (maximum)
    capillary rise, which depends upon the soil hydraulic characteristics that regulate
    the intensity of upward fluxes. Liu et al. (2006) proposed sets of default parameters
    relative to soil textural and hydraulic properties and that are improved through
    model calibration. The use of SIMDualKc to assess consumptive and non-consumptive
    water use by a groundwater dependent Leymus chinensis grassland in eastern Inner
    Mongolia, China (Wu et al., 2016) is selected as an example of groundwater contribution
    assessment in a wet landscape. The analysis focused on the wet year of 2008 and
    the dry year of 2009. The daily dynamics of P, Tc act, Es and GC (all in mm) during
    the growth season is presented in Fig. 8, which clearly shows that the upward
    fluxes from the shallow water table were the main fraction of the water supply
    to the studied grassland. GC is essential to meet the water requirements of this
    crop. GC was small when there was enough soil water for extraction by the grassland
    but increased when crop water demand was high and the SWC decreased. Comparing
    both years (Fig. 8), it is evident that Tc act was similar in both years because
    GC supplemented rainfall, thus becoming much higher in the dry year, when rainfall
    was insufficient. Considering that ground cover by the grassland was very large,
    Es depended on precipitation only, thus being higher in the wet year. Download

    contribution from a shallow water table (adapted from Wu et al., 2016). Results
    in Table 4 show that, despite rainfall in the wet year was nearly 3 times that
    of the dry year, ETc act were not very different in both years, and Tc act were
    quite similar because GC effectively supplemented the lack of rainfall. The ratios
    between GC and the total water supply (TWS, mm) were very distinct, with GC/TWS = 33
    % in the wet year and 59 % in the dry year. These ratios quantified well the relative
    importance of GC for the water supply of the considered grassland. The ratios
    between GC and actual transpiration also showed the role of GC in meeting the
    grassland water requirements since GC/Tc act increased from 46 to 63 % from the
    wet to the dry year. Table 4. The terms of the water balance of a groundwater

    irrigation scheduling Real time irrigation scheduling aims at optimizing the timing
    and amount of water applied in the day-to-day irrigation management. It requires
    combining a model with data streaming from diverse sources such as weather forecasts,
    soil and plant sensors, or remote sensing data. Models referred in Table 1, Table
    2 may be adopted for this purpose but they are generally used to support research.
    In the past, several attempts to adapt and use SWB for supporting real time irrigation
    have been performed. Teixeira et al. (1995) developed and tested RELREG, a model
    derived from ISAREG, that could be updated every day, and used weather data predicted
    around three days in advance. Other models were developed and in use at farm level,
    e.g. SCHED for center-pivot irrigation (Buchleiter, 1995) and, for application
    at large scale, models such as RENANA (Giannerini, 1995). The latter has been
    continuously updated and gave origin to IRRIFRAME and IRRINET, widely used in
    Italy (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015), which enter in the
    era of the cloud data models. In South Africa, a review of irrigation scheduling
    atmospheric-based computer models was published by Annandale et al. (2011). Computerized
    real-time irrigation scheduling revolved around a number of historic models such
    as BEWAB (pre-plant seasonal irrigation schedules based on target yields; Bennie
    et al., 1988), “SWB” (providing daily water schedules based on calculated ETc
    act; Annandale et al., 1999), PUTU (De Jager et al., 2001), and various specialized
    models for irrigation management of sugarcane (Singels, 2007). The adoption of
    scientific irrigation scheduling was investigated in a technical project by Stevens
    et al. (2005). The outcomes were that the uptake of scientific irrigation scheduling
    by farmers is low, it is highly dependent on many other day-to-day farming and
    business operations, and there is generally need for engaging dedicated managers,
    extensionists or consultants to run a scientifically-based irrigation scheduling
    program on commercial farms. There are several web-based tools that were purposefully
    designed for supporting farmers in real-time irrigation decision-making such as
    IRRINET (Mannini et al., 2013; Giannerini and Genovesi, 2015) in Emilia Romagna
    Italy, the California Irrigation Management System (CIMIS, https://cimis.water.ca.gov/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), the Arkansas Irrigation Scheduler (AIS, https://irrigweb.uaex.edu/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), or the Mississippi irrigation scheduling tool (MIST).
    The SAPWAT model, originally developed by Crosby and Crosby (1999) with several
    improved versions (van Heerden and Walker, 2016), is used to determine crop water
    requirements and water allocations in South African water management areas. Other
    models with diverse workflows and computational procedures are applied for supporting
    farmers decision making, namely integrating SWB models, but they are rarely the
    object of scientific publications or information about calibration. Examples are
    the IRRIGA SYSTEM© (https://www.irrigasystem.com/, accessed on 25 May 2020) used
    both in South America and in Europe, IrrigaSys (http://irrigasys.maretec.org/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) used in Vale do Sorraia, Portugal, and Irristrat™ (http://www.hidrosoph.com/EN/index.html,
    accessed on 27 May 2020) also applied in Portugal for both orchards and annual
    crops. The developing field of information and communication technology (ICT)
    opened up a variety of opportunities for smart agriculture in general, and irrigation
    scheduling in particular, by making use of Internet of Things (IoT), satellites
    and drones, robotics and artificial intelligence to improve farming operations,
    management of irrigation schedules and fertigation, and to achieve better yields,
    quality of products and profits. Tzounis et al. (2017) provided a review of potential
    applications of IoT technologies in agriculture. The drivers for these technologies
    are large volumes of data that are generated in space and time, and commonly referred
    to as Big Data. Big Data can be defined as huge datasets (commonly in the order
    of magnitude of TB) originating from a diversity of sources that makes them difficult
    to be collected, stored and analysed by conventional tools and techniques (Chen
    and Zhang, 2014; Ylijoki and Porras, 2016). They can be categorized into structured
    data that can be easily stored in tabular format (e.g. soil and plant measurements,
    remote sensing georeferenced data), unstructured data (e.g. text, video, audio
    and images) or semi-structured data (e.g. emails and XML files) that are usually
    inconsistent to store and process in customary databases (Lee, 2017). In order
    to extract usable information from the variety of sources of information to the
    benefit of researchers, practitioners and farm managers, these data need to be
    processed through systems, such as machine learning, and packaged into tools that
    facilitate interpretation and decision-making. Systems of heterogeneous sensors
    and networks for collection and communication of data are commonly referred to
    as Internet of Things (IoT). Given the vast amount of information and storage
    space that is often required, the processing, storage and analyses of these data
    can be done via Internet servers and infrastructure that are specifically designed
    for this purpose (e.g. Cloud Computing) (Tzounis et al., 2017). Ultimately, data
    need to be packaged into information tools, prescriptive/predictive models and
    decision-support systems that can aid decision-making on farms. Depending on data
    volume and computing requirements, irrigation scheduling tools can reside on cloud-based
    platforms (Bartlett et al., 2015). This is particularly the case when the tools/apps
    require information from large databases, e.g. soil properties, climate, satellite-derived
    observations. In other instances, soil input and climatic data can be obtained
    from localized sources, e.g. soil measurements and weather forecasts, and all
    calculations can be performed in reasonable time with algorithms running in the
    background (e.g. Internet apps). Several examples of these IoT applications for
    irrigation scheduling were reported in the literature and described below. The
    IoT infrastructure provides the opportunity to replace models, such as the above-mentioned
    SCHED, with automation-model systems applied to lateral moving systems coupled
    with sensors that provide for variable rate irrigation and nutrients applications,
    thus moving from the simple water scheduling to precision agriculture (Han et
    al., 2009). A review on variable rate issues for sprinkler systems, including
    an analysis of sensor systems usable for such purposes, was recently proposed
    by O’Shaughnessy et al. (2016). Similar approaches are used with drip-irrigated
    horticultural crops (Perea et al., 2017) and woody crops (Fernández, 2017). Payero
    et al. (2017) developed a communication system for transferring wireless soil
    water sensors data to an open-sources platform (https://thingspeak.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020), where data are hosted and visualized in the form of usable information
    to support decision-making. However, SWB models remain popular tools for supporting
    irrigation scheduling. For operational irrigation schedules, using real-time models
    requires daily updated actual weather data, which may not be fully available.
    Thus, alternative sources of climatic data have been tested showing good accuracy,
    such as the use of re-analysis data for estimating PM-ETo (e.g. Paredes et al.,
    2018a), or satellite derived climatic products as referred by Paredes et al. (2020b).
    Since weather forecasts generally provide for incomplete data sets (precipitation
    and temperature), computing ETo requires simplified approaches using temperature
    data only, namely the Penman-Monteith temperature (PMT) and the Hargreaves and
    Samani equation (HS-eq) (Paredes and Pereira, 2019; Paredes et al., 2020a). Thus,
    a main challenge in using models for supporting irrigation scheduling is to use
    short-term weather forecasts that could support real-time irrigation scheduling
    and, considering larger range forecasts, to plan irrigation in advance (Kusunose
    and Mahmood, 2016; Klemm and McPherson, 2017). Studies on the use of short-term
    weather forecasts to support irrigation scheduling focus more on precipitation
    than on climatic demand (ETo). The study by Cai et al. (2009) focused on the use
    of short-term weather forecast messages provided by the National Meteorological
    Institute of China for estimating ETo and supporting irrigation scheduling, showing
    the good adequacy particularly for estimation of crop ET using a SWB model. A
    similar but updated approach is reported by Zhang et al. (2018). Lorite et al.
    (2015) developed a methodology based on the use of weather forecast data from
    freely and easily accessible online information for determining irrigation scheduling,
    reporting good accuracy for ETo estimations. Other studies focus on evaluating
    the use of short-term forecasts for real-time decision support for irrigation
    scheduling in terms of net profit and water savings. Cai et al. (2011) assessed
    the use of rainfall short-term forecasts provided by the National Oceanic and
    Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Despite the imperfect forecasts, results showed
    net profit of up to 8.5 % as well as high water savings ranging from 11.0 to 26.9
    % when compared to modelled soil moisture information. The study by Hejazi et
    al. (2014) focused on the use of reanalysis-based short-term weather forecasts
    relative to rainfall and ETo for supporting irrigation decision-making, reporting
    on average an expected profit of up to 3 % and a water saving ranging from 4 to
    6 %. Jamal et al. (2018), using the Soil Water Atmosphere Plant (SWAP) model,
    reported an overall good performance of using probabilistic seasonal weather forecasts
    to support chickpea real-time irrigation scheduling. Differently, Linker et al.
    (2018), using the AquaCrop model for irrigation scheduling and yield predictions
    coupled with 4 to 6-day weather forecasts, reported an overall inadequacy of the
    forecasts for several locations (Denmark, Greece, Italy and Portugal) and crops
    (potato, cotton, tomato and maize); in addition, these authors also outlined that
    there was no considerable advantage of using those forecasts relative to historical
    average data. Overall, the use of short-term weather forecasts keeps being a bottleneck
    due to their uncertainty/inaccuracy. Combining SWB model predictions with plant
    indicators (Ferreira, 2017) and/or soil sensors, is also an option that has been
    investigated, e.g. Cancela et al. (2015) used SIMDualKc with an automatic control
    irrigation system supported by a low cost wireless soil moisture sensors network.
    Thus, these tools rely less on weather data, and more on soil and plant sensors,
    which calls for new approaches in using the FAO56 method. An example of such new
    approaches is the model reported by Schwartz et al. (2020) aimed at actual Kc
    for maize when deficit irrigation is used and non-uniform soils also affect the
    crop and the available soil water. The use of soil water sensors is recognized
    as having a great importance for the accuracy of modern SWB modeling approaches
    (El-Naggar et al., 2020). The use of canopy temperature sensors is also recognized
    as contributing to improved accuracy (Han et al., 2018). Remote sensing data provide
    the opportunity to model at large scale and they typically fall in the domain
    of Big Data. This includes both data originating from unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV, Ortega-Farias et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2019) and satellites. Two main
    approaches may be considered: energy balance models and vegetation indices. Models
    such as SEBAL (Surface Energy Balance Algorithm of Land), TSEB (Two-Source Energy
    Balance) and METRIC (Mapping Evapotranspiration with Internalized Calibration)
    are quite accurate in assessing crop evapotranspiration from the energy balance
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2011a; French et al., 2015; Dhungel
    et al., 2016). ET from remote sensing may also be used to derive Kc or Kcb values.
    Vegetation indices, mainly the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and
    the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), are often used to estimate Kc and Kcb
    values (Johnson and Trout, 2012; Pôças et al., 2015; Campos et al., 2017). Satellite
    Kc data are then assimilated into SWB models. Another issue is the assessment
    of crop stress indicators from remote sensing (Pôças et al., 2017), namely using
    UAV. The use of optical/thermal satellite imagery at farm level would also allow
    drawing water requirement maps and implementing precise irrigation (Hendrickx
    et al., 2016). Melton et al. (2012, 2020) described the SIMS framework that combines
    NASA’s Terrestrial Observation and Prediction System (TOPS), Landsat and MODIS
    satellite imagery, and a surface sensors network to map indicators of crop irrigation
    demand and to develop information products to support irrigation management and
    other water use decisions. Li et al. (2018) described and tested a new method
    for sequential data assimilation that allows integrating soil water content measurements
    into the Community Land Model (CLM) aiming to improve irrigation scheduling. Evaluation
    of the method was performed on several citrus orchards allowing to save on average
    24 % of water relative to the farmers’ irrigation schedules while the use of the
    irrigation schedules based upon the FAO56 SWB provided for similar average water
    savings of 22 %. The development of mobile and on-line applications (apps) has
    also been investigated, with support of cloud computing and IoT. This kind of
    tools allows to provide to farmers easy-to-use information (Car et al., 2012),
    particularly when the information is conveyed using text messaging service (SMS).
    Todorovic et al. (2016) described and evaluated an automatized decision support
    system (Hydro-Tech) available as an app; Hydro-Tech integrates FAO56 methods,
    including the SWB, with continuous soil sensor-based monitoring, short-term weather
    forecasts, remote monitoring of the water supply network, diverse tools for data-cloud
    processing, and an economic and eco-efficiency assessment tool for optimizing
    irrigation scheduling. Evaluations performed in farmers’ fields with diverse crops
    (vegetables and fruit orchards) in the Apulia region, Italy, showed potential
    water savings ranging from 5 % to 20 % relative to the schedules used by farmers.
    Goap et al. (2018) presented an IoT-based smart irrigation management system,
    available as an app, using machine learning technology to predict crop irrigation
    requirements when combining sensing soil moisture along with the forecasts of
    precipitation, air temperature and humidity. Good accuracy of soil moisture predictions
    was reported thus allowing improving irrigation scheduling. An irrigation scheduling
    app (Bluleaf®) was evaluated by Abi-Saab et al. (2019) using field observations
    and showing its accuracy for estimations of soil moisture content and leaf water
    potential along the wheat season. In addition, the tool was able to enhance water
    savings by almost 26 % relative to the farmer’s traditional schedule. The progression
    of the satellite-based SEBAL model into an operational tool for irrigation scheduling
    is of particular interest. The private venture eLEAF (https://eleaf.com, accessed
    on 25 May 2020) developed a number of applications of interest to irrigation scheduling,
    namely PiMapping®7 (Pixel Intelligence Mapping), CropLook for field crops, as
    well as GrapeLook and FruitLook for grapes and fruit trees in the Western Cape,
    South Africa. The applications are based on satellite information to produce evapotranspiration
    maps and data that farmers and practitioners can access through a web portal (https://www.fruitlook.co.za/,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). A similar service providing information that can be
    accessed with different devices is IrriSat (https://www.irrisat.com/en/home-2,
    accessed on 25 May 2020). The Portuguese Association of Horticulture also makes
    available to farmers an app for real-time irrigation advice, Manna Irrigation
    Intelligence (https://aphorticultura.pt/2020/01/13/manna-irrigation-intelligence-tecnologia-de-deteccao-remota/,
    accessed on 27 May 2020), which bases upon a SWB model, remote sensing data and
    weather forecasts. Advances in ICT provide great opportunities to make use of
    large volumes of data and sources (sensors, models, remote sensing, images, tweets,
    farmers’ knowledge and experience, etc.). For using the Kc-ETo approach, ETo may
    be estimated with reduced datasets using the PMT and HS-eq approaches which require,
    among other, ground observed data, gridded and reanalysis data, and/or Meteosat
    Second Generation products, as well as forecasted weather data (Allen et al.,
    2020; Paredes et al., 2020a, b). Kc data sets refer to the updated tabulated standard
    Kc and Kcb values (Pereira et al., 2020a,b) and to the use of the A&P approach
    to compute Kcb and Kc from fc and height (Allen and Pereira, 2009; Pereira et
    al., 2020c,d). The challenge is to streamline these diversely structured data
    into usable and reliable information. Although major advances have been documented
    in the literature, the level of uptake is still not widespread mainly due to the
    need to own devices, applications, costs of services, etc. Maintenance of these
    systems can also be expensive in terms of hardware (e.g. sensors exposed in the
    field), securing a steady power supply, network and software stability, data storage
    infrastructure, security and access control. Nevertheless, given the volume of
    usable information that can potentially be produced to optimize farming production,
    it can be expected that IoT will become a more and more prominent feature in smart
    farming. 6. Conclusions and recommendations The current review has shown that
    SWB models have an enormous potential for irrigation scheduling including the
    assessment of alternative crop management practices, as well as biophysical and
    economic indicators of crop water productivity. The FAO56 methodology adopted
    in SWB is very accurate with moderate data requirements; simpler SWB models have
    been adopted for supporting irrigation scheduling but likely at a greater risk
    of water balance inaccuracies, namely when deep percolation and capillary rise
    are not properly taken into consideration and when Kc estimation is less appropriate.
    Research users may also prefer to adopt mechanistic, high-input intensive models
    having capabilities to simulate crop growth and yield as depending not only on
    water, but also on nutrients and other practices. Trends for future also refer
    to the adoption of crop growth and yield models for irrigation scheduling, at
    least for research purposes; the adoption of the FAO56 method in the DSSAT models
    already performed (DeJonge and Thorp, 2017) consists of an excellent foundation
    for this purpose. Easy to parameterize and calibrate, field and crop-focused SWB
    models will likely continue to be used by farmers and farm advisers as well as
    using the cloud data facilities at the large scale. However, trends for IoT and
    cloud computing seem to lean towards simple crop ET computations, likely using
    the Kc-ETo approach. Then, ETo is likely estimated from temperature using the
    FAO56 recommended approaches (PMT and HS-eq), or is derived from reanalysis products,
    gridded data or Meteosat Second Generation products, as well as using forecasted
    weather data. Future trends are also envisaged with farmers using models with
    ready to use information through mobile phones and smartphone apps. This approach
    is easier to apply with IoT or cloud data. In fact, simpler models provide acceptable
    to good indicative information to support basic irrigation decisions while more
    complex models are difficult to be deployed for the variety of users in terms
    of crops and cropping practices and management. It is therefore recommended that
    IoT models use the FAO56 method, including the updated FAO56 temperature based
    ETo, and the updated data sets of Kc and Kcb, or with application of the A&P approach
    to estimate Kcb and Kc from the fraction of ground cover and crop height, that
    are well proved and tested at various locations. Innovation in cloud data and
    IoT models needs to enlarge the present focus on solving data acquisition and
    sensors management to the quality of crop and ET computations, since this approach
    may support attaining better water productivity and water saving, which are definitely
    relevant in terms of facing climate change. A main opportunity for future is the
    use of remote sensing and the integration of remotely-sensed data into the SWB
    and crop growth models. Two main approaches may be considered (energy balance
    models and vegetation indices) as well as diverse sources of information (satellite
    imagery, imagery obtained from drones and infrared thermometry measurements on
    the ground). The dual Kc approach is already used in remote sensing applications
    for estimating ETc of various crops, which compared well with the Kcb estimated
    using the SIMDualKc model for many crops. Thus, results show that for real-time
    irrigation management the Kcb derived from remotely sensed vegetation indices
    may be used to adjust SIMDualKc and similar models’ simulations in near real-time,
    particularly when using sensors from satellites with high revisiting frequency.
    An effective exchange between research and practice represents a great challenge
    in SWB models use and development. Research uses models to better and more accurately
    understand the processes relative to soil water fluxes and transport in the soil-plant-atmosphere
    continuum. Irrigators need that a SWB model responds to their need for knowing
    when and how much water to apply to a crop in a given environment and in a defined
    development stage. The users require timely and simple responses, very easy to
    interpret. SWB models for research and practice already are, and will keep being
    distinct. The question is therefore how and which information created from research
    shall pass into practice and which type of SWB will facilitate both new knowledge
    and its transfer to practice. Likely this requires that research considers transferability
    as a main option, but that freedom of research is not affected by the need for
    transferability of results. Is the development of more and more sophisticated
    models a need? Is scrutiny of field data quality a priority? Is the consideration
    of the energy balance, namely through crop coefficients, an essential approach
    in research? Is empirical research, with a minimal use of models to be continued?
    Would it be advantageous to bring into research the models used in practice? These
    are questions that future research should debate and substantiate. Declaration

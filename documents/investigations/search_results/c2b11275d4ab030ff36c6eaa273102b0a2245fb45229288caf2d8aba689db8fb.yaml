    are already at the core of next generation wireless networks, including 5G, cognitive
    radio and future Internet. There is a huge consilience that the majority of Internet
    devices will become sensors and actuators equipped over ordinary “things”. As
    a consequence, the radio environment will increasingly become crowded with thousands
    of low-cost devices sharing the unlicensed frequency bands. This paper is regarding
    a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of
    IoT. It proposes an embedded and low cost cooperative spectrum sensing solution,
    which has been experimentally implemented. Furthermore, we present a distributed
    software-controlled sector aware spectrum sensing architecture to store and analyze
    the spectrum usage information. Finally, the proposed approach has been integrated
    to a future Internet architecture called NovaGenesis. A proof-of-concept has been
    experimentally performed, demonstrating for the first time the convergence of
    IoT, future Internet and cognitive radio. Graphical abstract Download : Download

    internetInternet of ThingsNovaGenesisSoftware-defined 1. Introduction The Internet
    of Things (IoT) has been challenging all existing information and communication
    technology (ICT) architectures in the last years, mainly due to the exponential
    growth in the number of connected devices, the diversity of possible technology
    stacks (heterogeneous networks) and devices connectivity issues [1], [2]. The
    new scenario becomes even more challenging since many traditional networks had
    not been originally designed to offer adequate security and privacy for IoT [3],
    [4]. Moreover, a significant portion of mobile IoT devices will require rebinding
    of devices’ locators [2] and hundreds or even thousands of them will share the
    same radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic spectrum. The IoT requirements play
    an important role in the context of the next generation wireless networks, including
    5G [5], cognitive radio [6] and future Internet [2]. For instance, Michailow et
    al. [5] have considered low power consumption and delay tolerant requirements
    of machine-to-machine communications in the context of 5G networks. Cognitive
    radios networks (CRNs) have been proposed as a key solution to define rules and
    techniques for using underutilized licensed RF bands [7]. One of its benefits
    is allowing users of congested unlicensed bands to offload their traffic to other
    parts of the RF spectrum, even the licensed ones. A CRN is able to identify when
    the legal owner of some RF spectrum portion, who is called primary user, is not
    making use of its licensed RF band. Cognitive networks may orientate secondary
    (opportunistic) users to make use of this part of the RF spectrum without interfering
    in the primary user communication [6]. As a consequence, a cognitive radio (CR)
    must identify – or sense – when the licensed RF band is unused and distribute
    this information for the secondary users that may be interested in establishing
    communication over this part of the RF spectrum. The tsunami of devices expected
    in IoT will push radio frequency spectrum control and management towards more
    opportunistic approaches, creating a straightforward link between IoT and CRN
    [1]. The latest piece of this puzzle is the strong relation between the IoT requirements
    and future Internet (FI) research [8]. The term future Internet was adopted in
    the first initiatives with the aim of rethinking the Internet, including the future
    Internet design (FIND) initiative [9] and the European future Internet assembly
    (FIA) initiative [8]. By FI, we mean any Internet-like network that could emerge
    in the future. This includes evolutionary approaches, in which the fundamental
    protocols of the current Internet are maintained and new ideas are incrementally
    introduced; or revolutionary approaches, in which the architecture is redesigned
    from scratch (also named “clean slate” proposals). Examples of evolutionary FI
    architectures (FIAs) that encompass IoT scope are: FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and
    SmartSantander [12]. FIWARE provides a platform to integrate computer programs
    (or generic enablers – GE) via the next generation service interfaces (NGSIs).
    The NGSI-9/NGSI-10 is based on RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs)
    [10], as a consequence, it is dependent on the current Internet technologies.
    SENSEI is focused on the wireless sensor and actuator networks interoperation,
    creating a market for the sensed data also employing RESTful interfaces. Finally,
    SmartSantander is based on a platform for the smart city services integration
    using RESTful APIs. To the best of our knowledge, those projects do not explore
    CRN approach to opportunistically perform spectrum control and management, by
    using a spectrum sensing technique. They also lack on supporting some FIA ingredients,
    such as: information-centric networking (ICN) [13], service-oriented architecture
    (SOA) [14], service-centric networking (SCN) [15], software-defined networking
    (SDN) [16], network function virtualization (NFV) [17], self-verifying naming
    (SVN) [4], identifier/locator (ID/Loc) splitting [2] and network caching. Up to
    the current moment, we can conclude that none of the mentioned revolutionary approaches
    have being proper explored in the IoT state-of-the-art. In this sense, we idealized
    and developed a new FIA called NovaGenesis (NG) [18], which considers IoT and
    CRN as key players for future Internet. In this paper, we explore for the first
    time the convergence of IoT, CRN, and FI technologies, by means of three main
    contributions. Firstly, we report a successful implementation of a novel approach
    for cognitive radio in IoT scenarios based on a software-controlled, low-cost
    and an embedded cooperative spectrum sensing. Secondly, we present the concept
    and an experimental demonstration of a distributed, software-controlled and sector
    aware spectrum sensing architecture that employs current Internet protocols to
    store and analyze spectrum usage information. Thirdly, we extend NG with novel
    services to interoperate with the proposed CRN approach based on energy detection
    from spatially-distributed remote radio units by taking advantage of the NG FIA
    ingredients. The remainder of this article will introduce our CRN based on energy
    detection from spatially-distributed remote radio units in Section 2. The proposed
    system is implemented using a low-cost hardware and GNU Radio as a processing
    platform. Section 3 presents NovaGenesis, including its fundamental concepts,
    implementation and two novel FI services to interoperate with our CR solution.
    Experimental results are reported in Section 4, including a proof-of-concept of
    the new NG services together with the embedded spectrum sensing. Finally, we conclude
    the paper in Section 5, giving direction for future works. 2. Cognitive radio
    network proposal: embedded low-cost cooperative sensing The employment of a RF
    spectrum sensing technique is convenient, independently of the way that the unused
    RF band is going to be allocated by a secondary user, for this reason is considered
    one of the CR most important features [19]. CR may be placed alone in a non-cooperative
    environment or being part of a cooperative network, in which a channel allocation
    decision is based on the information collected by diverse CRs. In the ISM bands,
    there is no licensed user, so the primary user is not formally present, but the
    benefits of the spectrum sensing and CR techniques are still valid. Regulation
    agencies stipulate that radios must implement some specific channel access techniques
    for certain RF bands, such as frequency hopping spreading spectrum (FHSS) or direct
    sequence spreading spectrum (DSSS). By applying FHSS, a radio pair keeps changing
    the communication channel frequency over time, spreading the transmitting power
    over a wider bandwidth. In a point to point communication, FHSS is very reliable
    and have been used for a long time. IoT applications, wireless sensor networks
    (WSN) and smart grid solutions typically demand low power consumption in order
    to enable communication among hundreds or even thousands of devices. 2.1. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The proposed cooperative cognitive radio network is presented
    in Fig. 1a. It is composed by the following blocks: sensing cell (SC); sensing
    cell controller (SCC); sensing information storage and analysis (SISA). The SC
    is responsible to acquire RF information, whereas the SCC detects users in the
    RF spectrum and SISA acts as a fusion center with the ability of collecting and
    aggregating information from many SCCs. The proposed approach provides higher
    level of RF spectrum usage information, with the purpose of allowing a dynamic
    spectrum allocation. Download : Download high-res image (225KB) Download : Download

    flow from sensing cell (SC) to sensing information storage and analysis (SISA);
    (b) radio interference scenario with three sensing cell controllers (SCCs). 2.1.1.
    Sensing cell (SC) The RF spectrum may be sensed by more than one sensing cell
    (SC), which includes a RF receiver, an antenna and a computational processing
    board. The SC hardware has been developed using a low-cost commercial hardware
    based on Raspberry PI 2 processing board and a digital video broadcasting-terrestrial
    (DVB-T) receiver acting as a RF receiver. The latter one has becoming popular
    in software-defined radio (SDR) applications [20]. SCs may be deployed over different
    locations in order to cover a wide geographic area, characterizing a cooperative
    network scenario. More than one source of spectrum sensing information may be
    used to provide information for a real-time RF spectrum allocation. The proposed
    cooperative network reduces the hidden node problem effect, providing information
    to discover distinct sectors, then improving the RF spectrum usage efficiency
    [21]. Traditional CR implementations define a radio capable to sense the spectrum,
    while performing its usual communication functionality [6]. Since the objective
    is to employ low resource devices that may not have enough processing capacity
    to run a spectrum sensing algorithm, the SCs may be used as a support system to
    existent fixed frequency systems. For this reason, in the proposed system, the
    SCs are sensing-only devices. It is feasible to implement the sensing algorithm
    over more powerful IoT devices. In context of IoT, a network commonly has its
    own border router or gateway that acts as a network coordinator and interface
    to the Internet. The SC acquires samples from RF spectrum for demodulating them
    to a baseband digital signal. The digital signal is delivered to the processing
    board, which encapsulates the RF information into TCP/IP packets to be sent to
    a SCC. 2.1.2. Sensing cell controller (SCC) The sensing cell controller (SCC)
    has two important roles in the proposed system: (i) it configures the SC receiver
    parameters; (ii) it performs the energy detector computation to be sent to SISA.
    The SCC runs on a standard desktop computer and all energy detection algorithm
    is performed by applying previously-developed GNU Radio framework, which is a
    free software tool that provides a set of processing blocks with focus on SDR
    usage. By controlling the SC parameters, such as radio central frequency and radio
    bandwidth, becomes possible to sense a wide RF spectrum, typically divided into
    RF channels. This functionality is very important, since the low-cost receiver
    has only 2 MHz bandwidth. The computed RF spectrum energy information is then
    sent to the SISA block. 2.1.3. Sensing information storage and analysis (SISA)
    The SISA block relies on a specific algorithm responsible to collect data from
    many SCCs and store this information in a database. The SISA information may be
    based on a specific region, or a specific RF spectrum band or even some calendar
    range. SISA provides a database information on the RF spectrum utilization divided
    in hours of a day, based on each SCC connected to it. The SISA has an API that
    allows some CR interested on its sensing information to put queries on spectrum
    information usage statistics. 2.1.4. Spectrum sensing based on energy detection
    Energy detection is considered the most simple spectrum sensing technique. It
    has been chosen to enable the use of low-cost components and, also, because it
    is the most appropriate technique when the transmitted signal is unknown [22].
    The energy for N received RF signals (X) may be calculated as follows: (1) where
    the resultant value defines the test statistic variable T. The noise power variance
    must be known in order to define an optimal test statistic variable T′ given by:
    (2) The need of obtaining T′ is a drawback of the energy detection technique,
    since the system must measure or estimate the channel noise. From this estimate,
    it is possible to define a detection threshold λ that allows to evaluate the channel
    availability. The acquired T′ samples are compared to λ and stored in a detection
    vector Dv: (3) The percentage of samples with value greater than the threshold
    is counted and this information is forwarded to the SISA, as a detection information,
    indicating a quantitative presence of a RF signal in the sensing band: (4) 3.
    NovaGenesis architecture NovaGenesis (NG) is a research project that started in
    2008, with the goal of answering the following question: “Imagine if there is
    no Internet architecture, how could we design it using the best contemporary technologies?”
    NovaGenesis scope includes not only data exchanging (like any other networking
    technology), but also data processing and storage (including cloud computing and
    networking cache). NG design considered a set of state-of-the-art ingredients,
    focusing on synergistically integrating them. 3.1. Motivation and advantages Cooperative
    spectrum sensing, spatial and temporal spectrum usage profiling, as well as dynamic
    resource allocation require the transfer and storage of the sensible information.
    The unrestricted access to spectrum samples can reveal private behavior, network
    infrastructure and weak performance points. Attackers can explore these weaknesses
    to cause unwanted interference, reducing the network throughput. False spectrum
    samples could create chaos in the resource managers. Collaborative spectrum sensing
    and dynamic resource allocation require more than performance. The provenance
    of spectrum samples should be guaranteed, creating a trustable network of sensing
    devices. Software control requires trust, privacy, provenance and integrity of
    control data. An illegitimate software controller can cause deliberate stopping
    of software-defined radios (SDRs). Software controllers and SDRs should establish
    a trustable network, working according to previously defined service level agreements
    (SLAs). Many Internet technologies were designed in the 70s. Despite of data integrity
    importance, it is still missing in the majority of TCP/IP networks today. A legacy
    of a time when security was not a big deal. According to Jacobson et al. [23],
    “trust in content is easily misplaced, relying on untrustworthy location and connection
    information”. Data security depends mainly on the available connection security,
    e.g. IPsec or security socket layer (SSL). Neither data, nor services are protected
    by their own names. Novel techniques such as self-verifying names (SVNes) can
    improve entities security and trust. Ghodsi et al. [4] contend on the security
    and privacy advantages of SVNes compared to the current Internet naming. In addition,
    data provenance is limited to the guarantees offered by the domain name service
    (DNS). However, DNSSEC standard is still in the early days of deployment and typically
    not available at low level domains, like the one presented in Fig. 1. Related
    works on IoT proposals, such as FIWARE [10], SENSEI [11] and SmartSantander [12]
    do not employ contract-based coordination of controllers and SDRs. NG “clean slate”
    design aims at fulfilling these gaps, bringing the following benefits to the scenario
    presented in Fig. 1: Unlimited namespaces: Not only natural language, but also
    SVNes can be employed to create as many namespaces as desired. Data, services,
    hardware and any other entity can be individually named, allowing persistent identification
    independently of location. This provides provenance, improving trustable operation
    [4], [13], [23], [24]. For this reason, we have redesigned the scenario of Fig.
    1 with SVNes and other NovaGenesis ingredients (Section 3.2). Flexible name resolution:
    Current DNS can resolve a limited set of names [25]. However, emerging scenarios
    require extending these capabilities to other entities, such as data objects [13],
    [23], [24] and services [15]. NovaGenesis name resolution is generic to accommodate
    this requirement (Section 3.3). On the other hand, the scenario of Fig. 1 is dependent
    on the available DNS deployment at sensing cells and SISA domains. Service-oriented
    design (SOD): The role of software is becoming increasingly important in modern
    ICT. Contemporary software engineering like service-oriented design should be
    employed. FIWARE, SENSEI and SmartSantander employ RESTful APIs, but they lack
    on implementing the entire service life-cycle, which includes negotiation and
    contracting. Our approach implements service life-cycling not only for SDR services,
    but also for software-controllers. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is
    the first work to experimentally demonstrate SOD application in a convergent CRN,
    IoT, and future Internet proposal. In contrast, Fig. 1 architecture does not employ
    SOD. Software-controlled radio: SDR capabilities and allowed configurations are
    exposed to services during dynamic service composition. NG software-controllers
    can negotiate the available resources, capabilities and configurations with the
    dynamic resource managers, with the purpose of forming a trustable network. If
    the services agree to work together, SDRs are configured under the “umbrella”
    of the established SLAs. As far as we know, this feature has never been reported
    in literature up to the moment. NovaGenesis combines these emerging ingredients
    towards more flexible and trustable ICT environments. As a first conclusion, NovaGenesis
    can be applied to integrate IoT, CRN, FI, smart cities, next generation mobile
    networks, among other contemporary ICT environments. 3.2. Fundamental concepts
    NovaGenesis is based on a set of fundamental concepts that are required to better
    understand its design and contributions, namely: Naming: Names are symbols used
    to denote one or more individual entities, like pieces of digital contents, computers
    and ordinary things. In our case, denoting stands for representing something by
    “signals”. By definition, names denote meaning and sense. Natural language names
    (NLNes) are those used in the human language, such as “Node 1” or “Domain A”.
    However, there are names that have no meaning, for example, the self-verifying
    names1 (SVNes) generated from the output of a mathematical hash function [4].
    For instance, a 32 bits name generated by NG using murmurhash 3 is “28FD4420”.
    SVNes are self-verifiable, because at any time the binary words used to generate
    them can be hashed again and get exactly the same output (name). Using SVNes as
    an alternative to NLNes [13], [24] makes possible to check the relationship between
    the named entity and its name at any time. According to Ghodsi et al. [4], SVNes
    provide better security, scalability, and flexibility than NLNes. Thus, the current
    paper proposes, for the first time, the use of SVNes in a joint IoT and cognitive
    radio scenario. Name binding: Our approach employs an unlimited number of namespaces
    that are linked by means of name bindings. A name binding (NB) is a mapping among
    two or more names, typically implemented as a vector in the form: < key; value(s)
    >. A NB can relate a name to an object or a name to other names. Fig. 2 illustrates
    a name binding scheme. The edges are NBs, whereas the vertices are NLNes or SVNes.
    For example, Domain 1 name is bound to Router 1 and Gateway 2. Obverse that NBs
    can represent entities relationships, i.e. “semantic operators” among entities,
    like is contained or contains. In the previous example, one can use the NB < Domain
    1; Gateway 2 > to represent that Domain 1 contains a Gateway 2. Download : Download
    high-res image (143KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Graph of names
    and their bindings representing entities relationships. Colors are used to classify
    different types of physical and virtual entities. Name resolution: In context
    of Fig. 2, name resolution consists of resolving a name to other bound names,
    i.e. to determine the values behind a certain key. For example, the name Router
    1 is bound to the names OS 6, while OS 6 can be resolved to Process 10 and Process
    11. NG provides a distributed, hierarchical, name resolution service (NRS) that
    resolves NLNes or SVNes (keys) in one or more NLNes or SVNes (values). Identification
    and localization: An identifier unambiguously separates an entity from others
    in a certain scope. Considering Fig. 2, a scope can be denoted by the name Domain
    1 and all the names of entities inhabiting this domain can belong to the same
    scope. In this context, the names Process 12 and 280273AA uniquely separate this
    entity from others. However, the name Process 12 could not be unique globally.
    In this scenario, SVNes can be used. Note also that Domain 1 can denote the location
    of the Gateway 2 in the network. Services and contracts: A service is a virtual
    entity responsible for processing, exchanging and storing information. According
    to this definition, a computer program is a service. NG follows SOA principles
    [14], in which services are dynamically composed. In SOA, services life-cycling
    is contract-based. It means that after peer services discovery, a contract is
    formulated and negotiated. Therefore, a contract can be defined as a piece of
    information that sets the limits, responsibilities and clauses to be respected,
    as well as criteria for the completion and punishment of services that were poorly
    executed. Proxies, gateways and controllers: A proxy is an attorney that represents
    other components in a network for any purpose. As an example, consider a Wi-Fi
    access point that is represented by a proxy service that “sells” its forwarding
    capacities. This proxy can negotiate the Wi-Fi capabilities to potential clients.
    Another important concept is a gateway, which translates or encapsulates messages
    of a certain input protocol to the desired output protocol. Finally, we define
    a controller as a service that makes the decision regarding devices or services
    configurations. The controlled device can be physical or virtual. 3.3. The NovaGenesis
    current implementation The NG web of names (i.e. name bindings graph shown in
    Fig. 2) is implemented in a distributed way. NBs are published and subscribed
    by services and stored on hash table data structures hosted by one or more operating
    system (OS). We have adopted an object oriented design (OOD) approach to implement
    NG components. Every service has several internal objects, called blocks, with
    specific functionalities. Two blocks are instantiated in all services: gateway
    (GW) and hash table (HT), as illustrated in Fig. 3. GW provides a bus for block
    communication inside a service or at different services. It uses SVNes in the
    message headers to decide how to forward/route messages. The HT block is a hash
    multimap data structure employed to stored NBs. The current implementation is
    based in four services: Download : Download high-res image (176KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 3. Example of NovaGenesis one hop link scenario
    formed by two PGCS processes encapsulating NG messages over underlying hardware.
    PSS, GIRS and HTS encompass NovaGenesis name resolution services, which are used
    by two applications (APP1 and APP2) to communicate based on publish/subscribe
    model. Publish/subscribe service (PSS): NBs are published by any services through
    sending a message to an instance of a PSS. PSS provides the rendezvous between
    the publisher and subscriber services, allowing secure and private access to NBs.
    PSS implements the main NG application API that has six primitives: (i) publish
    NB (with associated data, if any); (ii) publish NB/data and notify other services
    about a publication; (iii) subscribe a NB/data; (iv) subscribe a NB/data and notify
    other services about a subscription; (v) deliver a subscribed NB/data; and (vi)
    revoke a NB/data publication. PSS can be seen as a distributed API, accessed via
    its names. Additionally, we have generalized PSS to allow pub/sub of contents
    associated to NBs, adding to this NRS a network cache functionality. Generic indirection
    resolution service (GIRS): PSS does not store bindings or data published, since
    it forwards them to a GIRS instance, which selects a proper hash table service
    (HTS) where they will be stored. The published NB/data are forwarded by GIRS to
    an HTS instance, where they are stored behind a hash table data structure. Therefore,
    GIRS is an intermediate service among PSS and HTS instances. Hash table system
    (HTS): HTS stores bindings and their associated contents, in case they exist.
    Consider for example the content named Sample 1 at Mote 3 of Fig. 2. This content
    will be stored as a file in a folder of an HTS instance. A name binding < 291074AA,
    Sample 1 > can relate the SVN of the content to its NLN. Proxy/gateway/controller
    service (PGCS): The component PGCS provides the following functions: (i) message
    encapsulation over already established networking technologies, such Ethernet
    or Wi-Fi; (ii) a proxy service to represent other NG services inside an OS; (iii)
    bootstrapping functionalities to initialize a domain; (iv) software-control of
    hardware or other computer programs outside NG environment. PGCS enables PSS,
    GIRS, and HTS to discover one another during initialization. Since an address
    is a name that denotes the position to where an existence can inhabit or be attached,
    PGCS relays on its local HT block or the domain HTS to store NBs among already
    established address formats (e.g. a real world or an emulated MAC Ethernet) and/or
    NG addresses. Independently of the address format used to connect PGCSes, inside
    NG all the communication is SVN-oriented. Additionally to the gateway service,
    PGCS publishes NBs about other NG services inside an OS to other PGCSes in the
    same domain, therefore propagating new services for their peers. NovaGenesis messages
    are implemented as information objects and serialized to ASCII character arrays
    with two portions: command lines (streamed from CommandLine objects) and payload
    (streamed from a file system archive). There is a bank line separating both. The
    command lines portion is composed by several textual lines, which can be dynamically
    expanded according to the need. The command lines are formatted as: ng -command
    –alternative version [ < n type E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En > ] where -command is the action
    to be done. -alternative selects among alternatives in the action to be done.
    version selects the desired version of implementation. [ ] indicates one or more
    vectorial arguments. n is the number of elements in an argument. type is the type
    of the elements in an argument. E1 E2 E3 E4 ... En are the elements of an argument.
    3.4. Representing a spectrum cell controller in NovaGenesis In this Subsection,
    we describe two new services developed for NovaGenesis to interoperate and manage
    the low-cost collaborative sensing approach presented in Section 2. Our main goal
    is enabling the convergence between the spectrum sensing approach for IoT with
    the NG “clean slate” FIA. This work represents an extension of our previous work
    on CRN with NovaGenesis [18]. 3.4.1. Spectrum sensing service The spectrum sensing
    service (SSS) has been developed to expose dedicated spectrum sensing hardware
    or a software-defined radio (SDR) to NG services. It exposes the device features,
    capabilities and configurations, as well details of the available spectrum sampling
    procedures. Other NG services can discover, negotiate and contract spectrum sensing
    functionality via their SSS representatives. This service is also a gateway for:
    (i) dedicated spectrum sensing hardware or SDR, translating NG command lines to

    of TCP/IP and NG stacks, as illustrated in Fig. 4. Messages from SCC are encapsulated
    over TCP/IP using ZeroMQ2 (ZMQ) push/pull sockets and delivered to SSS. Inside
    NovaGenesis, SSS changes to publish/subscribe (pub/sub) model instead of ZMQ’s
    push/pull, publishing and subscribing NBs and information objects (like SLAs or
    spectrum samples) to/from name resolution service (NRS).3 Download : Download

    for NovaGenesis interoperability with SCC. SSS provides the interconnection between
    TCP/IP and NG stacks. SCC sends spectrum samples to SSS using ZMQ with TCP/IP/Ethernet.
    Inside NG, the communication model employs pub/sub of NG messages directly over
    Ethernet, meanwhile other link layer technologies can be used. In Fig. 4, SSS
    communicates with SCC through three ZMQ push/pull socket connections, which form
    two communication channels, one for data and another for software-control settings.
    The data channel carries the spectral sensing information obtained by the components
    SC (Section 2.1.1) and SCC (Section 2.1.2). The setup channel is formed by the
    second and third connections and it is used by NG to obtain and send settings
    for SC and SCC. The information exchanged between SSS and SCC are structured in
    strings using JSON format. It is encoded in key/value pairs, in which the key
    field identifies the name of a parameter or command, tied to its value. The configuration
    channel to NovaGenesis can perform two operations: the commands get_info and set_config.
    get_info : The get_info JSON command is sent by SSS to SCC in order to request
    the spectral sensing available functionalities, identifying information of the
    sensing cell and the parameters of the current configuration of spectral sensing.
    The answer contains: (i) the sensing capabilities of the SCC in the key capacities;
    (ii) the cell identification information in the key cell_info; and (iii) the current
    spectrum sensing configuration. set_config : This command is sent from SSS to
    SCC to adjust spectrum sensing parameters according to a resource management service
    (RMS), which will be presented in Section 3.4.2. They are the start and end sampling
    frequencies in Hz. Also, the sampling bandwidth can be configured. data: The spectrum
    energy data is continuously transmitted from SCC to SSS. Fig. 5 illustrates the
    format of this data. The key scc_id uniquely identifies the SCC that generated
    the data. The key msgid provides a message sequence number, while the key date
    carries a timestamp of the sample. Last but not least, the key sensor contains
    the estimated probability that the related channel is busy. Download : Download

    format from SCC to SSS. The information collected by SSS is forwarded to a peer
    resource management service (RMS), whose responsibility includes data aggregation
    and correlation in a similar way to SISA. A SLA proposal describes the sampling
    features of spectrum sensing or SDR equipment it represents, such as rates, resolution,
    output format, among many others. 3.4.2. Resource management service (RMS) RMS
    implements a name-based, contract-oriented, dynamic orchestration of substrate
    resources exposed by SSS (other NG services are being developed, but they are
    out of the scope of this paper). RMS mediates the relationship among user applications
    and the SSS instances, inside NG cloud/networking (without TCP/IP). When a SSS
    discovers a RMS, it proposes a SLA with a description of the service to be provided.
    RMS accepts the contract and starts being notified of the SSSes’ publications
    to become aware of the situation of the radio spectrum opportunities in the ISM
    bands. 3.4.3. Sequence diagram of interoperability solution Fig. 6a and b provide
    a sequence diagram of the actions implemented to transport SCC spectrum samples
    to the NG RMS. In message a, both SSS and RMS publish their NBs to the PSS/GIRS/HTS
    (hereafter, called NRS for short). In message b, they subscribe possible peer
    keywords, e.g. “resource”, “manager”, “sensing”. NRS returns bindings containing
    the subscribed keywords in message c. These NBs, have in the value portion SVNes
    of services candidate to be a peer. Table 1 summarizes the messages exchanged
    among these components, giving details on technologies and message''s content.

    are published to SSS (l,m,n) and delivered to SCC (o). Table 1. Summary of messages

    During SSS initialization, it sends a get_info message to the SCC. When the answer
    returns in message d, SSS is able to make a service offer to RMS, specifying the
    possible configurations at SCC. SSS publishes the offer to the NRS, notifying
    the candidate RMS in message e. RMS subscribes the service offer object as illustrated
    in message f. In the current prototype, RMS just accepts this offer publishing
    a service acceptance object (message g). In future versions, we plan to add negotiation
    actions between them. Observe that these offer and acceptance objects are transferred
    using SVNes in the header of NG messages. Also, the keys used to subscribe these
    objects are used to verify their integrity. To the best of our knowledge, NG is
    the first FIA that checks integrity and provenance of data objects. In message
    h, SSS subscribes the service acceptance object published by the RMS and notified
    by the NRS. Then, when SCC publishes a data JSON like in message i, SSS publishes
    and notifies the peer RMS (message j). RMS then subscribes the data, as illustrated
    in message k. Finally, RMS can request SSS to change some configuration on SCC.
    In this case, it publishes a software-configuration object (message l) that is
    notified to the peer SSS. The SSS component subscribes the object (message m),
    which is delivered by NRS in message n. SSS translates the configuration object
    to the JSON format as expected by the SCC and forwards to SCC (message o). SCC
    then changes the configuration at the GNU Radio, which reflects the change on
    the hardware. 3.5. Comparison to our previous approach without NG Fig. 7 illustrates
    the TCP/IP over Ethernet stack as used to implement the scenario of Section 2.
    The SISA component has the following internal blocks: (i) input/output (IO) control;
    (ii) data access object (DAO), which is an interface to a MongoDB data base; (iii)
    information analysis, which provides algorithms to analyze data stored on the
    data base; and (iv) the data base itself. The communication between IO (and IA)
    to DAO uses ZMQ. From DAO to MongoDB a Linux system call is employed to invoke
    a TCP socket. Download : Download high-res image (190KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. Stack for cooperative spectrum sensing using TCP/IP and ZeroMQ push/pull.
    A comparison of Fig. 4 with Fig. 7 indicates that Section 2 components (SC, SCC,
    SISA) employ TCP/IP over Ethernet as its communication stack, whereas NovaGenesis
    components (SSS, NRS, PGCS, and RMS) run NG directly over Ethernet without TCP/IP.
    SSS works as a gateway between the two stacks. In the Section 2 scenario, not
    only push/pull, but also client/server communication models are employed. On the
    other hand, NG employs only pub/sub due to its security, privacy and asynchronous
    communication features. We can summarize some of the differences between these
    scenarios as: Naming: Content and services are accessed using their self-verifying
    names (SVNes). Message forwarding/routing also employs SVNes. In contrast, ZMQ
    and TCP/IP only allows structured natural language names, which do not have the
    intrinsic security characteristics of SVNes [4]. Name resolution: In current Internet
    the name resolution is provided by DNS. In NovaGenesis, NRS does a similar role,
    but using pub/sub of domain name records. Limited service-orientation: In ZMQ/Internet,
    the service-oriented design (SOD) is employed only on the WWW, whereas in NovaGenesis
    it is for all services, including networking ones. Life-cycling: It encompasses
    the dynamic composition of services and their contents. In the Internet architecture
    it is present only at WWW. In NovaGenesis, life-cycling is intrinsic to any entity:
    content, services, operating systems (OSs), hosts, etc. The same pattern happens
    for contract-based operation. Deployment in hosts: Internet protocols are implemented
    at the core of operating systems. NovaGenesis protocols in hosts are implemented
    as services that follow SOD paradigm. 3.6. Next steps and open challenges We plan
    to implement the complete Fig. 1 scenario in NovaGenesis, with the aim at extending
    NG services to control Wi-Fi access points based on RMS decisions. We are also
    extending our NRS to hierarchical domains, as an alternative to DNS. In addition,
    we have already started implementing NG message encapsulation to other IoT technologies,
    such as IEEE 802.15.4. Furthermore, we have been developing an embedded proxy/gateway
    service (EPGS) to run inside energy constrained devices. Considering project activities
    up to now, we can summarize some open challenges for NG (and other FIAs) evolution
    as: Scalability and elasticity evaluation: Emerging architectures need to prove
    unprecedented levels of scalability and elasticity, especially due to the growths
    on the number of devices and services expected for IoT [2]. An open problem is
    how to evaluate “clean slate” proposals if experimentation technologies are dependent
    on TCP/IP? Testing revolutionary architectures require raw socket/link layer solutions
    or even interfaces for physical layer. Appropriate methodologies for comparison:
    New architectures such as NovaGenesis, expressive Internet architecture (XIA)
    [24] and network of information (NetInf) [13] employ novel ingredients, combined
    in a unique way. It is not trivial to determine the common and fair aspects to
    be compared, since it does not exist a standard benchmark methodology for FIA
    comparison. New methodologies for large-scale architectures comparison are required.
    Diversity of scenarios: Another hurdle is the diversity of scenarios that should
    be evaluated. Our contemporary Internet is huge and full of protocols. Therefore,
    new tools are required to automate experiments and results analysis. SmartSantander
    [12] and FIWARE [10] are examples of experimentation architectures for smart cities.
    However, as previously stated, many of their tools require TCP/IP and spectrum
    sensing capabilities are not available. Tools and experiments reproducibility:
    tcpdump is a famous tool for monitoring and evaluating TCP connections. Despite
    developing new architectures, researchers also need to develop tools for experimentation
    and performance evaluation of their proposals. 4. Results and analysis We divided
    this section in two parts. Firstly, we analyze the effects of an interfering radio
    in the quality of communication between two IoT nodes in the 915 MHz ISM band.
    Our low-cost cooperative sensing approach is used to determine the best channel
    for the pair of IoT communicating devices. Secondly, we demonstrate a convergent
    solution of future Internet and cognitive radio in the context of IoT. A complete
    life-cycle of spectrum management services is performed, from service exposition
    and discovery up to service contracting and trustable transfer of spectrum data
    to a resource management service. 4.1. Low cost cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio The implementation scenario of the low-cost cooperative cognitive radio
    for IoT applications was reported in Fig. 1b from Section 2. A pair of radios
    M1 and M2 have been used as IoT devices establishing a communication link; their
    hardware are composed by two Texas Instruments reference designs based on RF transceiver
    CC1120. The experiments have been realized from 902 to 928 MHz, which is a frequency
    range reserved for unlicensed ISM applications. The radios have been configured
    to continuously transmit packets with 50 bytes length at a fixed data rate of
    150 Kbps using 2-GFSK modulation. The radios are placed away from each other in
    such a position that a communication between them is possible when no interference
    is present. Near each radio a SC was placed so M1 and M2 may be sensed by SC1
    and SC2, respectively. Another radio Mint that acts as an interference source
    by means of generating random RF spectrum utilization was placed close to the
    SC1. Mint behaves such as a communication device that does not belongs to this
    IoT network, characterizing a multi-user RF environment. In a practical environment,
    a perfect isolation of RF boundaries is not possible, so the SCs will also sense
    some signal from neighbor radio as well the interfering source. Table 2 summarizes
    the adopted experimental parameters. Table 2. Experimental parameters. Parameters
    Actual values Variable parameters M1 and M2 frequencies 921 and 924  MHz Mint
    transmit probability 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80% RF transmission power –21, –17 and
    –14  dBm Measured RSSI –95, –91 and –87  dBm Fixed parameters Sensed spectrum
    range 902 to 927  MHz Mint frequency 921  MHz Digital modulation 2-GFSK Channel
    bandwidth 200  kHz Bit rate 150 kbps Data transport Packet Packet size 50 Bytes
    PER test 5000 Packets per test The experiments have been carried out for different
    values of receiver signal strength indication (RSSI) by changing the M2 transmission
    power. The probability of the radio Mint be transmitting have been modified to
    evaluate its influence over the link communication. Fig. 8 reports the experimental
    results where the packet error rate (PER) parameter has been used as a performance
    figure of merit. Five thousand packets have been sent in and the amount of successfully
    received packets were recorded. Initially, it was considered that the radios M1
    and M2 does not have information about RF spectrum usage, so the 921  MHz channel
    was selected, the same being used by Mint. During the experiment the interfering
    radio Mint randomly transmit messages that are not demodulated by M1 or M2 but
    interferes on link communication increasing the PER. Posteriorly, an additional
    test has been carried out by means of using the SISA information reported in Fig.
    9, for setting radios M1 and M2. As a centralized source of information, SISA
    indicates the channel 921  MHz is in use and the channel 924  MHz is available.
    The hidden node problem is present as SC2 does not sense Mint signal as shown
    in Fig. 9b. Note that the vertical axis in this figure corresponds to Eq. 4 Detection
    values. When SC1 information Mint is detected (Fig. 9a) the usage of the 921  MHz
    channel is avoided. The PER measurement have been conduced again with radios using
    the 924  MHz channel. It has been kept lower than 5%. Download : Download high-res

    not related to the context of this work. 4.2. Interoperation with NovaGenesis
    Fig. 10 presents our concept of a convergent solution of future Internet and cognitive
    radio in the context of Internet of Things. The computer on the left side runs
    SCC using GNU Radio, whereas the one in the middle runs five NovaGenesis services,
    including SSS for interoperability with SCC and PSS to provide a distributed API
    for NG pub/sub service, and a PGCS that encapsulates NovaGenesis messages over
    Ethernet/Wi-Fi. The computer on the right runs a PGCS and a RMS. RMS is the target
    of the spectrum samples collected at SCC, forwarded to SSS, published to PSS,
    and finally subscribed by RMS. Download : Download high-res image (534KB) Download

    discovery Fig. 11 contains a partial reproduction of the log of an SSS exposition
    message published to the PSS. The first command line with the command ng -m –cl
    is used by NovaGenesis to route the message to the destination. NG employs a name-based
    routing approach based on tuples of self-verifying names. The argument [ < 4 s
    0BD95286 ED12F3ED 342DD4C5 B8101939 > ] contains a tuple that identify/locate
    the source of the message (SSS) and the argument [ < 4 s 0BD95286 ED12F3ED 449B0B0C
    6FDF0A76 > ] provides the ID/Loc for the PSS. The command line ng -p –b is used
    to publish name bindings, therefore exposing keywords related to the SSS, e.g.
    the key 19656CF3 is the hash of the word “Wi-Fi”. This log is exactly an example
    of the message a from Fig. 6a. In the discovery process, the RMS subscribes keywords
    from the PSS that represent a possible peer (message b). Download : Download high-res

    is performed by SSS to SCC. The answer is used by SSS to prepare a service offer
    to the candidate peer RMS. Fig. 12 reproduces the message that carries a Service_Offer_2026721035.txt
    object (message e in Fig. 6a). The pub/notify command line (ng -p –notify) contains
    the name binding < 1 s 3182F342 > < 1 s Service_Offer_2026721035.txt >, which
    links the SVN 3182F342 to the .txt file. A service acceptance object is published
    by RMS and notified to SSS as previously described. Download : Download high-res

    presents a NG message captured using Wireshark tool that is transporting spectrum
    sensing samples inside a SSSFile_5818.txt. Fig. 14a depicts a plot generated from
    15 h of spectrum sampling over NovaGenesis. It demonstrates that the approach
    with NovaGenesis generated a result similar to the previous ones obtained over
    TCP/IP. Finally, in Fig. 14b it is plotted the mean round trip time (RTT) spend
    by the RMS to subscribe spectrum sensing objects from PSS/GIRS/HTS. In the first
    9 h, the RTT remained linear about 5.2 ms. After, it suffered a small increase
    probably due to the large amount of sample files stored at the HTS. All the samples
    have been stored. As a conclusion, we have successfully demonstrated a straightforward
    and innovative convergence of IoT, FI and cognitive radio. Download : Download

    presented, for the first time, a successful convergence of cognitive radio network
    (CRN), Internet of Things (IoT) and a future Internet architecture (FIA) called
    NovaGenesis. We first report a low-cost embedded cooperative sensing and cognitive
    radio architecture for IoT. In this solution software-control is provided using
    current Internet technology. Moreover, we have experimentally demonstrated the
    use of cooperative spectrum sensing based on energy detection to overcome the
    hidden node problem, which for sure will be present in IoT. We measured PER as
    a function of RSSI to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed CRN. We have
    also extended NovaGenesis with two novel services to interoperate with the aforementioned
    CRN: spectrum sensing service (SSS) and resource management service (RMS). SSS
    interoperates with a sensing cell controller, which has a GNU Radio implementation
    for determining energy level at channels. The SCC spectrum samples are sent to
    SSS using TCP/IP. SSS translates the data objects from JSON to NovaGenesis and
    publishes them to the RMS (without TCP/IP). RMS subscribes the data objects according
    to their self-verifying names (SVNes), checking provenance and integrity. The
    novelties we demonstrated are typically found only in FIA research: exposition
    and discovery of services; contract-based operation; distributed name resolution
    using keywords and SVNes; and name-based routing of messages among services. These
    features allow the convergence among IoT, CRN and FIAs. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time spectrum sensing for IoT have been combined with a FIA.
    Future works include the evaluation with different radios, sensing cells, interference
    sources arrangements and spectral sensing algorithms. Finally, we also plan to
    extend NovaGenesis services to have the same software-control architecture (including
    SISA). In this way, we will be able to compare the performance and scalability
    of both current Internet and FIA approaches. Acknowledgments This work was partially

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: In recent years,
    Internet of Things (IoT) has attained considerable attention by the research community.
    IoT is an interconnected network of smart devices capable of sensing and communicating
    ubiquitously. Cognitive radio networks (CRN''s) are recommended to increase capacity
    for next generation wireless networks for IoT applications. To prolong battery
    life of these unattended smart devices, energy harvesting is an obvious solution.
    RF Wireless energy harvesting (RFWEH), in which freely available ambient energy
    from RF sources is utilized to increase battery life, has gained much attention
    recently. In this paper, we propose a hybrid source switch-based RFWEH technique
    which adaptively switches between high-power RF sources, in contrast to previous
    works, in which low power sources are preferred. We show that high-power RF sources,
    such as TV and radio, are preferred over low power sources such as cell phones,
    Wi-Fi etc. Our simulation results show that RFWEH from radio antennas outperform
    RFWEH from TV antennas even though the former operates at a much lower transmit
    power. Furthermore, switch-based RFWEH gives better performance compared with
    single source RFWEH. Published in: 2017 IEEE 86th Vehicular Technology Conference

    IEEE Conference Location: Toronto, ON, Canada I. Introduction With the advent
    of Machine Type Communications (MTC) for loT devices, it is expected that over
    50 billion users will be connected wirelessly by the end of this decade [1]. Cognitive
    Radio Networks offer a solution to the capacity issues arising due to the widespread
    deployment of loT devices. The lifetime of an loT device depends on the average
    energy consumption of the constituents sensor nodes, which is a function of operations
    such as sensing, processing, and communications. As these devices are expected
    to serve unattended for years and require back up in terms of battery life, RF
    wireless energy harvesting provides a solution to this issue [2]. Sign in to Continue

    content Abstract For an effective, low latency, and ultra reliable pervasive connectivity
    among next-generation wireless networks such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    machine-to-machine (M2M) communication, and wireless sensor network (WSN), the
    users play intelligent strategies which enable them to take crucial decisions
    in order to obtain the optimal solutions. Game theory, a mathematical tool helps
    in solving various problems of wireless communication related to security, resource
    allocation, power management, energy harvesting, spectrum usage, coverage, connectivity,
    capacity, reliability, efficiency, optimum bandwidth, rewards and punishments
    of wireless nodes, and balancing of various trade-offs. This paper presents a
    comprehensive review, potential benefits of applying game theory (GT) in wireless
    communication (WC). For this purpose, a detailed overview of GT including cooperative
    and non-cooperative games, Q-learning, and reinforcement learning for different
    applications like cellular communication, multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO),
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, cognitive
    radio (CR), device-to-device (D2D), wireless sensor networks (WSN) and many other
    applications that are pertinent to wireless networks is presented. In addition,
    various important design and optimization challenges are addressed. Two GT-based
    case studies related to physical layer security and resource allocation are also
    presented. In a nutshell, GT models enhanced by various learning algorithms has
    the potential to optimize the configuration parameters of any wireless network.
    Finally, we reflect the future directions and the challenges based on GT to improvise
    the performance of the wireless systems in the 5G technology and beyond. Previous

    allocationSecurityWireless communication 1. Introduction Game Theory (GT) is a
    field of mathematics that addresses conflict and cooperation among intelligent
    decision makers [1]. It is very prominent in Social Sciences, Auctions, Humanities,
    Economics, Natural Sciences, Engineering, Biology, etc [2], [3]. The players are
    decision-makers or agents and strategy is a specification of decision that is
    paid off in terms of reward or punishment. Players decide their strategies on
    the basis of available information which may be complete or incomplete in nature.
    The game may be represented by matrix or a tree, where the matrix does not include
    the time feature while the tree or graph includes the time feature similar to
    a sequential process. In recent years, wireless communication (WC) has replaced
    wired communication, providing Anytime, Anywhere, and Always connectivity in a
    cost effective manner. This not only connects people but also improvises their
    lifestyle through internet banking, online shopping, online studies, traffic monitoring,
    disaster management, health services, etc. The various key parameters of wireless
    networks are efficiency [4], spectrum allocation [5], profit [6], security [7],
    [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21],
    [22], [23], [24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [34],
    secrecy outage probability (SOP) [35], and energy harvesting from the radio frequency
    (RF) source, etc [36], [37], [38], [39], [40], [41], [42], [43]. This fastest-growing
    technology needs to be robust with the feature of maximum security, maximum efficiency,
    timely connectivity, and minimum operating power [44]. This prompted us to implicate
    GT in WC which is similar to conciliate the connection among the nodes in spite
    of their rational behaviors for optimizing spectrum, power, and available resources.
    GT models are proliferated in many areas of WC like interference management and
    signal processing [45], for making intelligent decisions in order to provide desired
    secrecy, optimum price decisions, resource and spectrum allocation with the constraints
    of power [46] and energy. The concept of Nash equilibrium (NE) or Stackelberg
    equilibrium (SE) is applied for optimization of any network. This review emphasizes
    on the diversified applications of GT in WC like unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)
    [47], [48], [49], [50], non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks [51], cyber–physical
    systems (CPS) [52], mmWave [53], vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANET) [22], [27],
    [54], anti-jamming [55], multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) [56], fifth-generation
    (5G) [57], [58], cloud computing [24], [25] and so on. The learning behavior of
    the players or nodes through Q-learning [59], deep learning [60], and reinforcement
    learning [61] further improvises the performance of GT based WC. GT is used to
    resolve various issues related to security, energy harvesting (EH), resource allocation,
    price sharing, reliability, and efficiency of a wireless network. Various techniques
    of WC such as frequency hopping (FH) [62], [63], power controlling [64], cooperative
    anti-jamming, friendly relaying, and jamming [65] combined with the GT framework
    to resolve and analyze the security issues of WC. It is used in applications like
    internet of things (IoT) [21], [23], [32], [59], MIMO [66], [67], cooperative
    communication [68], [69], [70], [71], [72], [73], [74], [75], [76], cellular communication
    [77], [78], [79], [80], UAV [81], [82], [83], wireless sensor networks (WSN) [28],
    [29], cognitive radio network (CRN) [84], CPS [52], [85], mmWave [86], vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V) [31], internet of vehicles (IoV) [22], federated learning (FL) in IoV [33],

    of future generation wireless communication. Likewise, wireless nodes require
    energy to operate and this energy demand becomes insatiable with an increase in
    the number of nodes. So, EH by nodes from the nearby RF sources is used to overcome
    this problem. Simultaneously, the intermediate nodes provide security in addition
    to EH. To get optimum results in both domains, the GT models are used in applications
    like CRN [91], [92], [93], WSN [30], [94], [95], [96], [97], cooperative communication
    [98], [99], [100], IoT [101], NOMA [102], multiple-input-multiple-output orthogonal
    frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) [103], [104], CPS [105], device-to-device
    (D2D) [106], secret-key generation [107], V2V [108], etc. The nodes in WC are
    rational in nature, i.e. no one participates in the system without any incentive.
    The optimal prices borne by the nodes are determined by various GT models in different
    applications like cooperative communication [109], [110], cellular communication
    [111], UAV [112], CRN [113], V2V [114], [115], wireless ad hoc networks [116],
    CPS [117], IoT [118], 5G [119], etc. There is a scarcity of available spectrum
    however, seamless and secured transmission is required to support spectrum sharing.
    GT proves to be a pivotal tool in various applications such as CRN [120], [121],
    RF/free space optical communication (FSO) hybrid communication [122], cellular
    communication [123], machine-to-machine (M2M) [124], D2D [125], Fog radio access
    network (RAN) [126], [127], mmWave [53], IoT [128], 5G [129], peer to peer networks
    [130] etc. Ultra-dense networks (UDNs) have been used to address the critical
    issues of coverage and capacity in 5G and 6G wireless networks. As a result, building
    a realistic mathematical model for optimizing the 6G UDNs is critical. In order
    to enhance the UDN performance, Bui et al. in [131] properly explored issues and
    challenges that were raised while implementing UDNs. Furthermore, the joint optimum
    strategy of real-time optimization and game theory (ROG) is proposed which is
    a powerful tool for solving large-scale UDN optimization problems with low complexity.
    Moreover, the GT models are also used in various applications related to dynamic
    or decentralized power allocation [49], [127], [132], [133], [134], [135], [136].
    The Reliability of the WC system depends on its outage probability. Further, the
    efficiency determines the system’s performance to obtain the desired output with
    the given input. Both of these parameters are appropriately handled by GT in various
    domains like MIMO [137], wireless charging V2V [138], NOMA based Mobile edge computing
    (MEC) [6], WSNs [139], D2D [140], and wireless ad hoc networks [141]. The GT models
    are used to provide the most appropriate coverage area within limited resources
    used in applications such as cellular communication [142], D2D communication [143],
    IoT [144], and MIMO [145]. With the increase in the number of subscribers, the
    interference increases and hence, the quality of service (QoS) of the network
    decreases. Sawyer et al. [146] proved that the implementation of the GT framework
    provides promising results to resolve the above mentioned issue. Although the
    existing wireless networks support features such as automation, programmability,
    modularity, and network slicing. However, mobile devices are progressively being
    modified to support critical machine-type communication (MTC) and massive MTC.
    The massive MTC leverages smart buildings, logistics tracking and fleet management,
    smart meters, smart agriculture, capillary network etc. The critical MTC leverages
    traffic safety control, remote manufacturing, surgery, wearable sensors, industrial
    application, and control. The IoT ecosystem with broadband and media provides
    everywhere and anytime services, smart vehicles transport and infrastructure,
    and critical control of remote devices. This key technology imbibed with artificial
    intelligence (AI) can smartly manage the huge volume of devices with ultra reliability,
    low latency, and fully connected real-time communication [147], [148]. For instance,
    these features are incorporated in home enterprises, combined mobile interfaces,
    wireless and fixed services, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The AI techniques
    like machine learning, deep learning, and Q-learning combined with GT framework
    make the device intelligent enough to take the right decisions in order to obtain
    optimized power with minimum delay. The combined approaches of GT with Q-learning
    techniques to support future generation networks are demonstrated in Refs. [55],
    [59], [60], [61], [123], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153]. Furthermore, the GT
    can be efficiently applied in future generation networks as illustrated in Fig.
    1. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents a comprehensive survey of
    GT based WC which addresses the important features of WC like security, EH, profit,
    reliability, efficiency, interference, and network coverage which has not been
    reported in the literature. These features are addressed and discussed for the
    latest wireless technologies UAV, MIMO, IoT, mmWave, NOMA, V2V, V2I, CR, WSN etc.
    It provides the directions to the researchers for enabling the deployment of IoT
    ecosystem, intelligent transportation, smart healthcare, smart and secure infrastructure
    with optimized power, energy, and resources with better QoS in a cost-effective
    manner. Besides this, we also enlist the future implications and challenges of
    GT based WC. In brief, the contribution of this paper are stated below: • It provides
    a comprehensive literature review of the GT in the regime of WC especially in
    upcoming areas like UAV, NOMA, V2V, M2M, IoT ecosystem, federated learning, blockchain,
    etc. • Discusses several games like stochastic, mean-field, Stackelberg, Bayesian,
    Bertrand, Zero-sum, Bimatrix, and potential game. • A Comprehensive tabulation
    of various games is formulated in the literature for modeling WC in addition to
    their findings and lessons learned. • Game theory strategies when applied with
    the deep leaning or reinforcement learning can improve the efficiency of any wireless
    system, which is discussed in detail. • Solutions to various multi-objective problems
    using GT in wireless networks are presented. • The recent paper related to dynamic
    or decentralized power and resource allocation which is the demand of upcoming
    wireless technologies are discussed briefly. • A very significant parameter of
    incomplete channel state information (CSI) in WC is obtained by Bayesian and stochastic
    GT models. • GT-based case studies based on physical layer security and resource
    allocation problem in WC is analyzed and simulated. • The participation of multiple
    nodes for price sharing is addressed. Moreover, payoff schemes are also presented
    to encourage nodes for their participation in assisting legitimate node activities
    such as the transmission of information or jamming of eavesdropper. The organization
    of the paper is portrayed in Fig. 2. Section 1 addresses the introduction with
    motivation and contribution. Section 2 discusses a brief overview and background
    of GT with fundamental concepts. Section 3 discusses and presents the applications
    of GT in WC considering privacy and security, EH, price sharing and profit maximization,
    resource management with dynamic power allocation, reliability and efficiency,
    interference management, and network coverage issues. The simulation is presented
    in Section 4. Thereafter, the future implications of GT in WC is then presented
    in Section 5. Finally, the conclusion of the paper is presented in Section 6.

    games formulated in wireless networks. Every game is associated with the number
    of players, their strategies, payoffs, and final decisions for the equilibrium
    state as shown in Fig. 2. The payoff associated with the players depends not only
    on its own strategy but also influenced by the other player’s strategy. Hence
    in every game, the strategies, payoffs, and the output are mutually dependent.
    The games are classified as cooperative or non-cooperative, static or dynamic,
    complete information or incomplete information game, and zero sum or non-zero
    sum games. Based on various situations, the game is chosen by the players or any
    entity having decision making capability to handle different situations with alternative
    strategies in order to maximize the reward or punishment. Download : Download

    of review work. 2.1. Games associated with wireless communication The Mathematical
    model based on game theory can be formulated, where the agents’ discord and cooperation
    are considered. An agent is rational and the probabilistic assignment which may
    be subjective or objective over the events in the actions is taken to maximize
    the expected payoffs. Earlier game theory was mostly used in economics, political
    science, and human behavior. However, nowadays, it is also applied in computer
    science and wireless networks where the nodes are treated as players and the plan
    of actions is defined in order to increase their benefits. GT attains its application
    in wireless networks from the 1990s in internet services for the pricing policy
    then in a later year it was used in nanoeconomics, routing and resource allocation
    in order to improvise network traffic. Game theory improves network performance
    as well as the efficiency of wireless networks. For a better understanding, the
    subsequent section discuss various games applied in wireless communication and
    their classifications in detail. 2.1.1. Cooperative game The cooperative game
    requires mutual agreement among the players or agents. The agreement needs to
    be self-enforcing in nature. The joint action by the group results in collective
    payoffs. The cooperative games can be further categorized into bargaining game,
    repeated game, and coalition game. The Bargaining game A bargaining game is one
    in which two (or more) players play and they need the fraction of benefits. A
    deal is accomplished in the Nash Bargaining game, where on request, the resource
    (bandwidth or power) is granted according to the availability. It is widely used
    in multi-hop wireless body sensor networks (WBSN) for improving QoS and fairness
    of resource allocation. By using co-operative relaying, this game can maximize
    the performance of the utility function to achieve bargaining NE. Further, it
    can be used to obtain optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [47], [93], [116]. The
    Repeated game The repeated game is also called a stage game or iterated game.
    It involves the interaction between two individual players playing repeatedly.
    In each stage, the player’s action is noted to determine the subsequent action
    of the next player. Depending on the number of stages and rounds, the game is
    further subdivided into finite and infinite repetitive games. The finite repetitive
    game is played for particular duration and thereafter, it is solved by backward
    induction. However, the infinite repetitive game is played for infinite rounds
    and cannot be solved by backward induction. In every stage, the results are different
    and their subsequent strategies are also different [154]. The Coalition game According
    to the coalition game, the players in a group perform better as compared to the
    individual players. The objective is to maximize mutual outcome, where the mutual
    benefit is defined by coalition value. It helps in sharing the cost for the network
    design and the delay cost of queue for routing the traffic. Furthermore, it provides
    a solution for false alarms, energy conservation, early attack prediction, and
    selfish behavior detection [53], [124], [125], [143], [145]. 2.1.2. Non-cooperative
    game A non-cooperative game is a game where the competition occurs among individual
    players in the absence of any external authority. In addition, each player plays
    rationally in order to maximize its own payoff. It is sub-categorized into zero-sum
    game, Stackelberg game, Bertrand game, Bayesian game (BG), Evolutionary Game,
    etc. They are widely used to regulate security-related issues and resource allocation
    to improve the performance of any network [58], [64], [127]. The Zero-sum game
    The Zero-sum game is played between two players where one player maximizes its
    gain while the other minimizes its losses. The utility of one player in terms
    of profit or loss is balanced by the utility of other player’s loss or profit,
    respectively. The algebraic sum of the utility of both the players is zero. Here,
    the total utility factor remains constant during the game. The utility of zero-sum
    game is a combination of energy consumption, probability of malicious nodes, and
    probability of dropped packets. In addition to maximize the transmission capacity,
    it mitigates the action of jammer, helps in routing and security against external
    intruders [51], [59], [67], [151]. The Stackelberg game It is formulated between
    two or more than two players in a hierarchical manner. One player leads the game
    by choosing certain action and the second player follows the leader’s actions.
    This is widely used to mitigate eavesdropping and jamming attacks. In this game,
    the defender acts as a leader and attacker acts as a follower or vice-versa. The
    attacker aims to disrupt the transmitted data stream. The utility function of
    a legitimate player is maximized with the aim to increase its power and signal-to-interference-plus-noise
    ratio (SINR) with minimum transmission cost. The network optimization is obtained
    at the SE [21], [29], [32], [34], [44], [55], [61], [65], [69], [70], [72], [73],
    [74], [77], [78], [82], [83], [85], [91], [92], [96], [97], [102], [104], [108],
    [109], [111], [113], [114], [119], [121], [126], [129], [133], [134], [136], [146],
    [150], [155], [156]. The Stochastic game The stochastic game is one of the dynamic
    games that are played in a sequence of stages based on a probabilistic transition
    by one or more players. The state of the game is random and depends on the previous
    player’s actions. It is formulated between service providers and network operators
    to provide desirable QoS. The NE is determined by spectrum management and network
    operators [124], [137], [149], [157]. The Bayesian game In the Bayesian game,
    the players have incomplete information while executing their actions. Here, a
    player can estimate the other players’ payoffs to perform probabilistic based
    intrusion detection for wireless nodes [31], [55], [70], [82], [91]. The Evolutionary
    game This is fundamentally applied to biological networks in which the players
    combine pure and mixed strategies with rational behavior to enhance the population
    characteristics with the increase in the number of species. Evolutionary game
    theory helps in learning the adaption for survival. It is used to enhance the
    cooperation in static and mobile multi-class wireless nodes, where each class
    is managed by a different authority [26], [27], [144], [158]. The Mean field game
    Game theory which is applied to the analysis of differential games with infinite
    players is known as mean-field game (MFG). This term is coined from the mathematical
    physics which is based on the behavior of many identical particles. In this game,
    each player has a state, a set of actions, and a control policy. For a pre-defined
    time, the control policy maps every state into action. The MFG considers the collective
    behavior of all the players. Thus, at each step of the game, the mean-field is
    simply the fraction of players at every state in contrast to the traditional games.
    This technique is used by UAV-GCS (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-Ground Communication
    Systems) to overcome the cumulative interference from other link and determine
    the payoff function [47], [48], [142]. The Bertrand game The Bertrand game model
    helps in pricing decisions based on the interdependence of rivals or players in
    a game in an oligopoly market. Oligopoly is defined as the condition where only
    a few sellers (i.e., oligopolists) manage a special market. In the considered
    market, the sellers take part in competition independently in order to achieve
    their targets (i.e., maximize profit) by managing the performance or the price
    of the product in the competition. Each seller’s decision is impacted by the actions
    of other sellers. In a Bertrand game, the target of one seller is influenced by
    its competent sellers. In non-cooperative WC, nodes are selfish in nature, the
    intermediate nodes try to maximize their profits with the knowledge of the strategies
    of other sources using a Bertrand game [71], [110]. The Potential game The potential
    game describes the specific behavior of payoff functions using potential function.
    A potential function keeps track of changes in the reward when one of the players
    deviates. This games has recently got a lot of attention considering various variants
    including generalized ordinal, precise, and weighted potential games [49], [50],
    [65], [106], [112], [159], [160], [161]. 3. Application areas of GT in wireless
    communication This study reveals the applications of GT in various fields of WC
    as shown in Fig. 2. On the basis of a recent study, 41.6 billion IoT devices require
    internet connectivity which will generate 79.4 zetta bytes (ZB) of data by 2025
    [162]. However, it is difficult to support the huge volume of data through existing
    technology. Therefore, sixth-generation (6G) communication is the main focus of
    researchers nowadays [163], [164]. The review work summarizes various technologies
    based on 5G which adopted GT for their optimization. IoT ecosystem features the
    communication among different objects, devices, machines, humans or animals with
    internet facility. Due to this IoT ecosystem, there is an escalation in the data
    traffic which causes trade-off between capacity and available spectrum. The mmWave
    technology addresses a wide spectrum from 30 GHz to 300 GHz. Another paradigm
    of next-generation network is D2D or M2M communication where information is transmitted
    among devices or machines directly with or without RF signal. This increases the
    spectral efficiency, throughput, and reduces latency and energy consumption of
    the network [165]. MIMO is the spatial modulation technique utilizing the multiple
    antennas at different positions of transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). Due to
    this, multiple copies of the same signal are transmitted thereby, minimizing the
    fading probability and BER. Another important concept in this series is NOMA,
    multiple access scheme which shares time, frequency, and space of the spectrum.
    It uses superposition coding at the Tx and successive interference cancellation
    (SIC) technique for decoding the multiple signals at the Rx. To include fairness
    in transmission, the user with higher channel gain is allocated lesser power and
    the user with lower channel gain is allocated comparatively higher power. This
    multiple access RF technique provides higher spectral efficiency and massive connectivity
    with low latency [166], [167]. The UAV is a flying base station (BS) which supports
    ground BS to increase the coverage area, security, and efficiency of WC network
    [168], [169], [170], [171]. The V2V communication transmits information among
    vehicles, traffic signals, road side units (RSU) using multi-hop adhoc communication
    called VANET. It is feasible due to the GPS navigation system with road sensors
    which send information about traffic, road condition, and location to assist the
    traffic management and route optimization. It reduces traffic congestion and road
    accidents. Similarly, autonomous driving coined as Vehicle-to-everything (V2X)
    communication, provides high reliability and fast communication by the integration
    of V2V, vehicle to infrastructure (V2I), vehicle to people (V2P), and vehicle
    to network (V2N) communication. Blockchain is the trusted decentralization of
    the database which is now adopted in 5G for securing and managing the data. In
    this, the information of the network is stored in every computer to avoid breakdown
    or security breach, unlike the failures in a centralized system. The data remains
    available after proper authentication, validation, and consensus [172]. In order
    to improvise the system’s performance based on the above-mentioned technologies,
    we can effectively apply various game theory algorithms to address the different
    challenges discussed in the forthcoming sections in detail. 3.1. Privacy and security
    As WC is an open-air wide network which is more vulnerable to attacks and eavesdropping
    due to increase in the number of users. The following sub-sections discuss the
    physical layer security and privacy related issues in detail. Download : Download

    security using cooperative communication. 3.1.1. Physical layer security The invasion
    can be dare either by internal agents or external agents. Further, it can be active
    eavesdropper including jamming with wiretapping or passive eavesdropping due to
    wiretapping only. This security breach becomes more prominent in heterogeneous
    high-speed communication. So, security parameters like confidentiality, privacy,
    authentication etc. gain significant importance in high-speed WC. The secrecy
    capacity is an important parameter to evaluate the performance of any secured
    system. In the vicinity of an eavesdropper, secrecy capacity specifies the maximum
    rate of information transmitted between the source and legitimate user or destination.
    With the advancement in technology, the malicious eavesdropping node subterfuges
    the legitimate link and reduces the secrecy capacity of the system. Earlier, cryptographic
    techniques [173] with the key exchange were widely used but it increases the complexity
    and redundancy of system. In addition, they are more vulnerable to eavesdropping
    attacks especially, when the keys are not exchanged in real-time scenarios. So,
    physical layer security (PLS) introduced by Wyner [174] attains great importance.
    Wyner manifested that high secrecy capacity is obtained in a better channel condition
    between the legitimate links without using any keying techniques as compared to
    unauthorized access where link condition deteriorates by eavesdropping or jamming.
    The physical layer security using cooperative communication becomes the promising
    candidate due to its high efficiency, low power consumption, broad coverage area,
    high diversity gain, high reliability, high capacity, low latency, etc. Hence,
    cooperative communication becomes the addendum tool to the conventional encryption-based
    security system. A form of cooperative communication by relaying and jamming using
    artificial noise (AN) can be used to overcome the active eavesdropping as shown
    in Fig. 3. The selection of relays and jammers must be done with confidentiality,
    otherwise, the eavesdropper can use the coordinated beamforming to hamper the
    secured transmission of the system [7]. The different techniques adopted to overcome
    jamming are frequency hopping, power control, and reactive transmission [175].
    GT not only counteracts external intruders but also detects malicious nodes and
    selfish nodes. Jamming attacks now become smarter due to artificial intelligence
    (AI) which creates more of a problem to the existing wireless system. The issues
    with anti-jamming become more complicated due to adversarial characteristics,
    incomplete information constraints, dynamics, uncertainty, dense deployment, and
    heterogeneous feature of the wireless networks. The dynamic anti-jamming technique
    is used to improve the defense mechanism of the system [8]. The power control
    game with incomplete information and anti-jamming channel selection in dense wireless
    networks are adopted to increase the transmission rate [55]. The value of expected
    weighted aggregate interference and jamming (EWAIJ) decreases with the increase
    in number in order to address dynamic and incomplete information of the network
    randomly. The two resource sharing schemes proposed in [20] are security-oriented
    users (SeUs) and regular users (ReUs). These schemes address a mathematical program
    with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and equilibrium programs with equilibrium
    constraints (EPEC) for single and multiple leaders, respectively. In the existing
    literature, the issues of security are addressed with GT to combat the effect
    of eavesdropping in order to obtain the desired efficiency, payoff, and availability
    of the system. The subsequent subsections explain the brief overview of areas
    addressed by GT in WC, such as MIMO, UAV, NOMA, cognitive radio network (CRN),
    cooperative communication etc. Moreover, different games with their findings and
    issues related to physical layer security are listed in Tables 1(a), 1(b), and
    1(c). (a) Cooperative communication. In the wireless networks multi- objective
    problems arise due to anti-jamming in cooperative communication, as the source
    strives for maximizing its data rate and eavesdropper to maximize wiretapping.
    However, relays and jammers aim to benefit themselves by maximizing their profits
    against their services. The nodes/agents in WC sell or share their resources similar
    to trading in the game. The incentives for relay nodes are decided on the basis
    of games played and challenges associated with it. Ghose et al. [10] also proved
    that the proactive relay selection scheme is harmful to the system as it increases
    SOP without changing the diversity order. The SOP is reduced by using the jamming
    power estimation technique to confuse the eavesdropping node [68]. The full-duplex
    (FD) active eavesdropper performs wiretapping and jamming simultaneously. However,
    it requires complex hardware to perform both actions with high risk of self-exposure.
    The jammer is incentivized to mitigate the wiretapping by any malicious node in
    order to achieve the desired QoS. This low complex AN method works for multiple-input-single-output
    (MISO) systems [75]. Game theory is applied to optimize the ergodic secrecy capacity
    using NE by considering the minimum power allocation factor, jammer’s optimal
    position, and jamming power. Likewise, Huang et al. [64] proposed a two-player
    non-cooperative game to examine the power decision process between the transmitter
    and eavesdropper. From the utility function of both players and Karush-Kuhn–Tucker
    (KKT) condition, the best response power function is determined. Similarly in
    [69], the investigators discussed framework for SG for the FD active eavesdropper.
    Here, the eavesdropper is the leader and a legitimate user is the follower. The
    optimal transmission strategy and jamming strategy for single channel and multichannel
    cases, respectively are proposed. Furthermore, Fang et al. [74] considered a PLS
    of the system which consists of one transmitter, multiple relays, and one FD active
    eavesdropper. To increase the secrecy capacity, the authors proposed a three-stage
    SG model and determined SE. Likewise, in [70] the authors analyzed the utility
    for a three-stage SG, where users act as leaders, relays act as vice-leaders,
    and jammer acts as a follower, considering incomplete information and the observation
    error. Similarly, for the multi-users and multi-channel communication, the authors
    proposed the idea of “No Pains No Gains” for an anti-jamming problem [65]. The
    proposed model addresses the cooperative anti-jamming problem with multi-leaders
    and one-follower SG. The throughput for the multi-user and multi-channel is enhanced
    by using the channel bonding technique. Further, Wang et al. [71] used the strategy
    to select the jammer for broadcasting the AN and relay to re-transmit the source
    signal from intermediate nodes to improvise the secrecy capacity of the system.
    A new particle swarm with a simulated annealing optimization algorithm is employed
    to obtain the solution of pricing and node selection. Wu et al. [119] investigated
    the maximum secrecy capacity for the multiple-input-single-output multiple antenna-eavesdropper
    (MISOME) to wiretap the channel with randomly located multiple jammers to assist
    multi-antenna BS. In the presence of jammer, the maximum secrecy sum-rate achieved
    is about 5.29 dB higher than the case without any jammer’s assistance. Gao et
    al. [62] introduced the anti-jamming technique for wireless communication in the
    presence of a jammer using bimatrix and non-bimatrix games. Quadratic programming
    is implemented to represent the relationship between the NE solution and the global
    optimal solution. In this method, the legitimate link and the jammer employ a
    pseudo-random frequency hopping sequence for information transmission and interference,
    respectively. When the frequency bands of entities overlap, the jammer injects
    additive interference into the legitimate channel. Further, the optimal frequency
    hopping strategy affects the payoffs of the entities and thereby, improving the
    performance by offering better jamming resistance. For a separate jammer and eavesdropper
    in cooperative communication, Luo et al. [13] considered a scenario where Gaussian
    jammer and a friendly eavesdropper are used for a broadcast channel for two-receivers.
    In this scenario, the eavesdropper acts friendly and sends a jamming signal (Gaussian
    codebooks) using compress and forward (CF) technique to the receiver to reduce
    the jamming effect. Table 1(b). Physical layer security contd.. Application Author

    image Fig. 4. Internet of things. (b) IoT. Billions of physical devices can be
    connected through the internet in IoT as illustrated in Fig. 4. This smart system
    processes, controls, and makes intelligent decisions for the exchange of information
    globally. Hu et al. [19] investigated the security of the downlink transmission
    from the controller to the actuator for IoT communication using cooperative jamming.
    It reduces SOP with minimum secrecy rate. The four different attacking scenarios
    of an eavesdropper: silent attack, eavesdropping, jamming, and spoofing are considered
    in [59]. A power control strategy based on the Q-based learning technique is proposed
    showing significant results for the different attacking scenarios. The authors
    in [21] considered a decentralized IoT environment with peer legal devices, unauthorized
    devices (eavesdroppers), and selfish helper jamming devices (jammers), and present
    a unique incentive jamming-based safe routing mechanism using SG. The suggested
    routing method is individually rational, robust, decentralized, and computationally
    efficient. (c) Cellular communication. Cellular communication is based on the
    geographical coverage area, inter-cell, and intra-cell communication. The LTE
    network installs M2M communication and D2D communication used in telemedicine,
    IoT, VANET etc., as shown in Fig. 5, which reduces the latency, energy consumption,
    and traffic of the network. This system provides efficient spectrum usage and
    high throughput. This section addresses the application of GT in the area of security
    for cellular communication, M2M communication, and D2D communication. Download

    D2D/M2M communication. The two-level SG in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
    is presented by Wu et al. in [77]. The macro base station (MBS) makes use of small
    base station (SBS) to jam the eavesdropper’s operation. The secrecy performance
    of a multi-antenna cellular network is discussed by Wang et al. [78], where the
    eavesdropper acts smartly and adapts itself from passive to active based on its
    position from the BS. In the discussed framework, the independent Poisson point
    process is implicated with SG, where the eavesdropper and the BS become leader
    and follower, respectively. The secrecy transmission probability reduces by 56%
    due to the adaptive nature of eavesdroppers. In [14] the security of heterogeneous
    D2D cellular networks with multiple users and the multiple friendly jammers are
    used to combat the actions of the eavesdropper. Luo et al. [79] proposed the best
    response (BR)-based hierarchical power control algorithm and a robust learning
    method for D2D security in the presence of both perfect and imperfect information.
    To ensure the security of cellular networks Rudenko et al. [80] investigated a
    system resource allocation scheme using an extensive game-based algorithm with
    high efficiency and less overhead. Also, the secrecy capacity (SC) between cellular
    users (CUs) and D2D users (DUs) is obtained with optimized resource allocation.
    Further, the security of ad hoc D2D network using friendly jammer is determined
    by minimizing SOP and connection outage probability (COP) [15]. In order to improve
    the security of the cellular system without CSI, Zhang et al. [16] proposed cooperative
    jamming in two stages. In the first stage, the spherical location of the eavesdropper
    is considered by estimating the channel. Further in the second stage, a semi-definite
    relaxation (SDR) search method using semi-definite programming (SDP) is used to
    maximize the secrecy rate. It decomposes the primal problem into a ratio of interference
    from the eavesdropper to the legitimate user transmitted by jammers. In research
    paper [150], the observation and rationality factors are considered ranging from
    0 to 1. Likewise, for the fixed area with unknown CSI of the eavesdropper, Huang
    et al. [18] investigated security with a cooperative jammer and proposed a superimposed
    jamming scheme to minimize the synthetic jamming power to the intended receiver
    in addition to interference to the nearby users. In the vicinity of a co-channel
    interference, Li et al. [17] proposed techniques for multi-user environments where
    security and reliability (SRT) trade-off occurs in the presence of an eavesdropper.
    Further, the intercept and outage probability results reveal that the proposed
    technique i.e. joint optimal user and optimal jammer selection (JOU-OJS) outperforms
    the traditional multi-user scheduling (TMUS) scheme with and without the availability
    of CSI of an eavesdropper. Moreover, the secrecy outage probability (SOP) is derived
    in [7] using the exhaustive search method. The power allocation for the joint
    overlay and underlay cognitive radio is proposed in [177]. (d) Q-learning and
    reinforcement learning. The ‘Q’ in Q-learning stands for quality. It is a learning
    algorithm specifying an action or strategy to be taken in a particular environment.
    The payoff or reward is used to provide the reinforcement as shown in Fig. 6.
    The authors proposed a Q-learning based power allocation scheme against the eavesdropping
    and jamming attacks for the highly random and dynamic environment of WC [149].
    The findings show that even in the presence of multiple smart attackers, the achieved
    secrecy data rate reaches up to 1.7 b/s/Hz. Likewise, a learning scheme is also
    proposed by Li et al. [151]. Here, the number of antennas at the transmitter are
    used to combat the attacker’s action. Through smart tuning, the antennas are used
    for beamforming and filtering to mitigate the eavesdropper’s action at the Tx
    and Rx end. Download : Download high-res image (118KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Q-learning or reinforcement learning. Xiao et al. [60] proposed
    a reinforcement based Q-learning power allocation strategy for the UAV against
    a smart attacker. Here, the attack model and channel model both are considered
    unknown. For the case with a large number of channel states and attack modes,
    the authors implemented prospect theory (PT) based on the probability weighing
    and value function to model the subjective decision. Thereafter, Q-learning and
    deep learning are combined to accelerate the learning speed. Through this learning
    and trial-and-error, the optimal UAV power allocation strategy using a Markov
    decision process (MDP) is derived. Furthermore, a WoLF-PHC (Win or Learn Faster-Policy
    Hill Climbing) based power allocation algorithm has been used to target the uncertainties
    in the UAV transmission to mislead the smart attackers. To further accelerate
    the learning, a deep Q-network (DQN) based power allocation strategy is used.
    The results reveal that the safe rate of the DQN-based strategy is 93% that is
    7% and 11% higher than the WoLFPHC and Q-learning based schemes, respectively.
    A reinforcement learning method proposed in [61] analyzed closed-form expressions
    for both complete and incomplete information at the source. (e) MIMO. MIMO provides
    a high data rate due to spatial multiplexing (SM) as shown in Fig. 7. The multiple
    antennas with smart signal processing increase the spectral efficiency and throughput
    with reduced radiated power. Further, the diversity of the system is improved
    by beam steering. In order to overcome the effect of external eavesdropping in
    MIMO system, Siyari et al. [56] has proposed transmit-based friendly jamming (TxFJ)
    interference which restricts the eavesdropper by sending a misleading signal generated
    by the legitimate transmitter. In the considered system, each link acts as a player
    in the game and implements non-cooperative GT with a distributed method to maximize
    the sum of secrecy rates using robust friendly jamming control algorithm. Findings
    reveal that the robust friendly jamming approach is 25% better than the greedy
    approach. Download : Download high-res image (191KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 7. MIMO communication. Similarly, Abdalzaher et al. [66] discussed
    a framework for mitigating the effect of jamming in uplink massive MIMO using
    linear zero-forcing jamming suppression (ZFJS) and minimum mean-squared error
    based jamming suppression (MMSE-JS) estimator for channel training. Results show
    that by using these techniques the system becomes more robust against jamming
    attacks. The authors investigated security for the MIMO radar systems [67]. To
    improve the performance of radar system, polarization states (deceptive jamming
    suppression in the main lobe) of transmit waveforms are controlled. The researchers
    investigated security in wireless multi-casting for a relay aided MIMO system
    in [9] for passive adaptive eavesdropping. Among the group of relays, the best
    relay is selected to transmit the source information with and without the friendly
    jammer using Monte Carlo simulation. (f) Cyber physical system. The CPS is the
    embedded system formed by the integration of the digital controlling unit for
    physical devices. It provides real-time communication with smart computing techniques
    as shown in Fig. 8. To obtain the maximum utility from the source or sensor, the
    optimal strategy is determined via adjusting the sensor’s transmission power.
    To achieve the SE, a stochastic algorithm with feedback (SAF) and a renewed intelligent
    simulated annealing (RISA) algorithm is proposed by Wang et al. [85]. In this
    game, the sensors are leaders and the jammer is a follower. The authors investigated
    the problem to provide a secured transmission between sensors and controller through
    wireless networks in the presence of malicious eavesdropper and jammer in the
    CPS using SG. In [52] the considered system, after gaining the knowledge of the
    sensor’s transmission power, the jammer decides its optimal power strategy to
    hamper secured communication. Furthermore, to maximize the utility, the sensor
    adjusts its transmission power through the controlled feedback. Download : Download

    system. (g) UAV. UAV provides strong line-of-sight communication from the air
    to ground wireless link which is used for high-speed, cost-effective, wide-coverage,
    and high mobility data communication as shown in Fig. 9 [171]. However, it is
    more vulnerable to eavesdropping over a large area on the ground. Therefore, to
    ensure the confidentiality of UAV communications against malicious eavesdropping
    attacks, the authors proposed a cooperative scheme to control the trajectory and
    enhance the security of UAV communication [168]. In the presence of randomly deployed
    non-cooperative UAV eavesdroppers (UEDs), Tang et al. [169] investigated a piece-wise
    fitting model of the air to ground (ATG) link compared to the existing sigmoid
    fitting. In addition, the UAV jammer is used to combat the UEDs, where the secured
    connection probability (SCP) is determined on the basis of the jammer’s height
    and location. The SCP for the specified configuration can be increased by 75%
    by activating the UAV based jammer. The researchers also proposed [170] a low-complexity
    iterative algorithm to maximize the intercept probability security region (IPSR)
    similar to the three dimensional exhaustive search (3DES) technique with less
    computational overhead. Proposed scheme requires only 2.6% of the execution time
    as compared to 3DES. Xu et al. [82] investigated the anti-jamming transmission
    problem in the presence of co-channel interference. A Bayesian Stackelberg game,
    where UAVs (users) act as followers and the jammer as a leader is proposed. A
    sub-gradient based Bayesian Stackelberg iterative algorithm is implemented to
    obtain SE. Due to the imperfect CSI in the multiple-input-single-output multiple-eavesdropper
    (MISOME), Chen et al. [81] used a UAV enabled friendly jammer. Without interfering
    with legitimate receiver, the secrecy rate is maximized with AN beamforming. Download

    UAV communication. (h) mmWave. A high data rate and dense connectivity can be
    provided due to ample availability of the spectrum in mmWave. To reduce propagation
    losses, beamforming with large antenna arrays can be used as shown in Fig. 10.
    A GT framework is also used to analyze a passive eavesdropping attack in millimeter
    wave (mmWave) based wireless personal area networks (WPAN) [86]. A game is played
    among the devices behaving as defenders and attackers. The devices are equipped
    with directional antennas with perfect CSI. Based on the prior knowledge of probability,
    each player selects its strategy. The results of the proposed work reveal the
    effects of using directional antennas and the prior probability of transmitters
    for determining the NE. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download :

    overlay networks, continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) for dynamic spectrum access
    by SU and PU is developed by Yao et al. [83]. Due to the self-seeking behavior
    of players, a cooperative jamming approach is proposed. In addition, an artificial
    noise-based jamming scheme is proposed for secondary users. In this method, the
    information about CSI of the eavesdropper is necessary. When the primary user
    transmits data, then the secondary user switches to the AN based jammer. The selection
    combining (SC) and maximal ratio combining (MRC) diversity schemes are implemented
    by Chopra et al. [84]. According to the results shown, the MRC at the source–destination
    (SD) link and SC at the eavesdropper link provides the best performance. However,
    for higher secrecy rates, SC system performs better than the MRC system. It is
    also proved that the direct link between source and eavesdropper is more vital
    than the source and destination link. 3.1.2. Security and threats A security threat
    is a harmful act that seeks to corrupt or steal data by disrupting the communication.
    A security incident is an occurrence in which a company’s data or network is potentially
    exposed. Moreover, various games, their findings and issues related to security
    and threats are listed in Table 2. (a) IoV, IIoT, and IoT. As the RSU runs with
    static settings, an adversary assesses the RSU’s vulnerabilities and conduct strikes
    for threatening the IoV’s privacy. The attackers have a strong position in this
    asymmetrical situation, making it difficult to adequately defend. The authors
    in [22] used the moving target defence (MTD) to dynamically alter the RSU’s IP
    address based on the differential game strategy thereby, increasing the difficulty
    of the attacker. Authors in [23] proposed pragmatic and efficient power perturbation
    strategy to mitigate the threat of practical received signal strength (RSS)-based
    adversarial localization attack for the industrial internet of things (IIoT).
    The numerical results demonstrated that the learning process successfully improves
    the network throughput by the power perturbation approach. An IoT device is more
    susceptible to attacks as it operates in the public domain and is also less equipped
    with security devices due to its miniature size. So, Liu et al. [32] proposed
    resource constraint cyber security IoT system based on SG model. The open and
    closed loop NE for the optimal allocation of resources are determined. (b) Cloud
    computing and CE-IoV (Cloud enabled-Internet of vehicle). In today’s world, securing
    cloud data in a shared environment is a critical responsibility for IT companies.
    Hence, at the computational level, there is a need to improve cloud security and
    the security at virtual machine (VM) level. The authors in [90] demonstrated lack
    of VM placement for abating side channel attack (SCA). It is a survey on current
    SCA which proposed game theory to be the best fit and bin packing method for optimum
    placement of VM. Furthermore, an enhanced evolutionary game theory (EGT) model
    is proposed to address dynamic attack protection. The incentive coefficient was
    utilized in [26] to extend the framework of EGT, which not only examines the evolutionary
    stability of two players but also the strategy selection and game performance
    of many players. Stackelberg Bayesian game is used to defend against Bayesian
    inference threats and motivate rational users to share their data for public health
    in a multi-cloud secure data architecture for infectious-disease analysis [25].
    The suggested effort facilitates involvement while simultaneously forming a broad
    privacy group, ensuring that each user’s data is “hidden in the crowd”. Results
    reveal that the average privacy loss reduces up to 28% for a modest aggregate
    size of 20 users. In [24], the Leila et al. presented a location based privacy-preserving
    solution for cloud computing, vehicular networks and the IoTs. To avoid tracking
    by the malicious attacker, the strategy is formulated based on cooperation, obfuscation,
    and silence. Using the GT method, the authors investigated its performance and
    robustness. The modeled Global Passive Attacker (GPA) uses four eavesdropping
    and linking attacks including semantic, syntactic, observation, and mapping linking
    attacks. The simulation results show that the solution is robust and resilient
    to the threats listed with a privacy level of 90% on an average. (c) VANET. For
    VANET, an intelligent defense behavior based on evolutionary games is proposed
    in [27] to protect against DoS attacks causing disruption of services, Sybil attacks,
    and black hole attacks. Before the game begins, none of the participants are aware
    of their opponent’s selected approach. They select the best approach based on
    probability in order to maximize their utilities. (d) WSN. The security of WSN-based
    CR against the spectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack is addressed
    by Abdalzaher and Muta [29]. The attacker makes use of the interference signal
    to corrupt the delivery report sent by the sensor node (SN) to the fusion center
    (FC) to lead the game however, the attacker follows it. This maximizes the number
    of protected reports sent by the SNs to the FC which leads to an accurate decision
    of the spectrum status. A repeated game model in [28] is proposed to enhance clustered
    WSN-based IoT security against the selective forwarding (SF) attack. This model
    relies on the TDMA protocol to facilitate the detection process and to avoid collision
    between the delivered packets at the cluster head (CH). The proposed model aims
    to keep the transmission of packets: isotropic or non-isotropic form the cluster
    members (CMs) to the CH for maximizing the data transmission. (e) Blockchain.
    Blockchain, as shown in Fig. 11, is a decentralized technique, consisting of numerous
    blocks for data management. Using proper consensus, the various nodes exchange
    information by applying cryptographic algorithms. It is a trustworthy transaction
    which is widely adopted in IoT ecosystems. Khan et al. [30] proposed a double
    auction theory combined with blockchain technology to make the trading among transmitters,
    relays, and jammers. This technique is more transparent and trustworthy against
    the occurrence of any malicious activity in a WC system. They considered the player’s
    rationality, balancing of the budget, and trustworthiness in terms of payment
    and prices of the participant nodes in the network. The proposed work significantly
    mitigated various security attacks like replay, repudiation, brute force attacks
    etc. Table 2. Security and threats. Application Author & Year Game Algorithms/Methods

    Blockchain communication. A hierarchical game-based energy scheduling system was
    developed using cooperative wireless energy transfer mode to optimize the strategies
    of energy nodes, charging energy vehicles (EVs), and discharging EVs. To build
    a secure and efficient wireless charging based network, the authors combine blockchain
    technology and game theory. The cooperation and competition in vehicle energy
    networks (VENs) in motion is addressed in [34] by using dynamic wireless power
    transfer (DWPT) technology. Here, the energy capacity of energy storage devices
    (ESD) in every node varies from 100 to 250 kWh. The authors show that as the number
    of energy nodes increases the service cost reduces due to which the energy node
    lowers its bid price in order to win the auction, which is completed in less than
    4 ms in a competitive scenario. (f) V2V communication. Edge computing-based Internet
    of Vehicles (EC-IoV) is used for various activities like autonomous driving, augmented
    reality, and computational offloading. The SG is used to provide the incentive
    for EC-IoV, where RSUs act as leaders and the vehicles act as followers [31].
    The RSUs implanted in a hotspot region acts as the backbone for the network which
    handles packet forwarding and localized data processing between the service provider
    and mobile vehicles. The authors proposed a scheme for dummy traffic delivery
    of local vehicles to overcome the attacks at RSU hotspots. To encourage clients
    to participate in federated learning (FL) training, the system includes two game-theoretic
    techniques. Furthermore, the power of an antagonistic client is defined and limited,
    and data privacy is similarly ensured. Experiments on real-world data sets with
    different training models work effectively in the presence of adversarial clients
    [33]. The regional FL in IoV as the process of knowledge trading market based
    on smart contract for safety and efficiency has offered as an optimal competitive
    pricing approach based on non-cooperative game in [87] by Zou et al. The simulations
    demonstrate that reputation selection may enhance knowledge accuracy up to 18%.
    (g) MEC and multi-agent system. Edge nodes serving as workers in Lagrange coded
    computing (LCC) for private, secure, and robust distributed mobile edge computing
    (MEC) systems in [89] by Asheralieva et al. The relationships between multiple
    BSs (masters) and employees are analyzed using stochastic Bayesian games as a
    direct stochastic first-price-sealed-bid (FPSB) auction. Furthermore, due to privacy,
    security, and communication constraints, players’ payoff functions and actions
    become blind to each other in a reward-based learning dynamics for continuous
    potential games. Convergence to NE is guaranteed by the suggested payoff-based
    learning dynamics method in [178] by Tan et al. for multi-agent system. 3.2. Energy
    harvesting Due to the tremendous increase in number of users, the energy required
    to operate the nodes or associated devices is unquenchable. So, energy harvesting
    (EH) through RF sources in wireless communication plays a pivotal role in order
    to fulfill this demand. The energy harvested by the intervening nodes not only
    increases the diversity gain of the system but also boosts the life span of the
    system, especially for restrained WC networks. It also reduces the operational
    cost of the system. There are two ways of EH in RF communication: Simultaneous
    Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) and Wireless Powered Communication
    Networks (WPCN). In WPCN, the node harvests energy from the RF source and then
    uses this harvested energy for further transmission. However in SWIPT, either
    a time switching or power splitting technique is used to harvest energy and transmit
    the information to another node simultaneously, as shown in Fig. 12. Moradian
    et al. [40] investigated wireless energy harvesting (WEH), which switches to different
    modes in time, that are EH and data decoding (DD). In order to increase throughput
    and reduce transmission delay, the static and dynamic (delay-optimal and throughput-optimal
    dynamic policies) techniques are proposed. The relay harvests energy both from
    the source and other RF environmental resources. To analyze the system and switching
    between the two modes, the Markovian and quasi-birth–death (QBD) processes are
    proposed. Li et al. [96] describe energy harvesting by eavesdropper from the source
    and the information is decoded using a power splitting SWIPT technique. In this
    paper, the eavesdropper tries to optimize its power splitting ratio ( ) to attain
    a maximum eavesdropping rate, while the source node optimizes the transmit power
    to maximize its sum secrecy rate. Providing high data rate services with reliable
    communication during travel such as railways, airways etc., is a major challenge.
    The issue is addressed by providing green communication using EH and energy-efficient
    resource allocation in D2D communication by Dai et al. [106]. This enhances the
    spectrum efficiency, system capacity, and also reduces load on small base stations
    (SBSs) in railway carriages. Likewise, a jammer harvests energy from the power
    station which is termed as green energy [73]. It is observed that the proposed
    algorithm in [73] attains SE by achieving lower SOP. Also, it consumes less power
    from the power station compared to the benchmark algorithm. In the upcoming technologies,
    centralized and distributed online power control schemes are developed using deep
    neural network (DNN) [152]. Download : Download high-res image (228KB) Download

    The issue of security along with EH from power transfer stations (PTOs) have been
    addressed using multiple sensors and relays in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers
    addressed by Nguyen et al. [35]. When an eavesdropper attacks the base station
    (BS), then the selected relay from multiple relays acts as a jammer to combat
    this attack. The author determined SOP after selecting the best jammer and relay.
    The secrecy capacity of the above-mentioned scheme is better than both the best-relay-and-random-jammer
    scheme and the random-relay-and-best-jammer scheme. Similarly, Hoang et al. [41]
    discussed the SOP of the system, where the intermediate node adopted a time switched
    based relaying protocol (TSR) to harvest energy from the source signal. It is
    demonstrated that the security of the system deteriorates if the harvesting time
    is greater than the information processing time. However, with the increase in
    the number of intermediate nodes, the security and efficiency of the system increases.
    The system performance deteriorates if the fraction block time ( ) tends to zero
    or one. Similarly, Rezgui et al. [63] proposed the EH to overcome the jamming
    attack without enhancing the spatial resources as in the DSSS and FHSS. The results
    reveal that EH is better at low signal to interference ratio (SIR). However at
    high SIR, jamming is failed to be overcomed by EH. However, by tuning the EH and
    transmission power time, the jamming becomes nullified. The authors use the zero-sum
    game and attain the NE. The subsequent section discusses the applications of WC
    where GT models are implemented to harvest energy in addition to the security
    of the system. Moreover, different games, their findings and issues related to
    EH and security are tabulated in Tables 3(a) and 3(b). 3.2.1. Two-way relay The
    two-way relaying efficiently saves bandwidth in the era of high resource constraint
    transmission systems. In order to maximize the secrecy capacity of the system,
    Lee et al. [43] determines the optimum power splitting parameter ( ) and time
    switching parameter ( ) for power splitting based two way relaying protocol (PS-TWR)
    and time switching in two way relaying protocol (TS-TWR), respectively. Moreover,
    PS-TWR outperforms TS-TWR against eavesdropping. Likewise, similar results are
    obtained in [36] using convex optimization. In [37], the outage probability is
    determined by two-way relay cooperative communication in the Nakagami- fading
    environment. At lower SNR regime, the results proclaim that EH using Amplify and
    forward (AF) relaying achieves full diversity gain and outperforms the conventional
    AF relay system. Download : Download high-res image (183KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Wireless sensor network. 3.2.2. WSN Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSNs) consist of a lattice of sensors that monitor the environmental or physical
    parameters and send this information to the server node or base station. This
    information can be retrieved or sent to the end-users through the internet from
    the base station as shown in Fig. 13. It addresses a dynamic network, where new
    devices or sensors can be added easily and can be used in surveillance, industrial
    control, processing units, and health monitoring systems. The energy harvesting
    wireless sensor node (EH-WSN) consists of multiple power stations, multiple sensor
    nodes, base station, a friendly jammer, multiple passive eavesdroppers etc. The
    system works in two stages. In the first stage, the power station transfers RF
    energy to the source and in the second stage, the source nodes transmit information
    to their BS, while a friendly jammer jams multiple eavesdroppers. Nguyen et al.
    [38] derived the closed-form expressions for existence probability of secrecy
    capacity and SOP. In order to provide physical layer security, an optimal sensor
    scheduling method has been implemented which outperforms in comparison to the
    conventional round-robin scheduling technique. The theoretical results are supported
    by Monte Carlo simulations. Similarly, the non-cooperative GT model has been used
    to optimize the energy of EH-WSN [94]. The nodes considered are homogeneous and
    uniformly distributed and harvest energy from their surroundings. The neighboring
    node’s RSSI (Received signal strength indicator) is used to wake up the nodes.
    The utility of the nodes are broadcasted to effectively manage their waking time
    and network traffic. The authors investigated a GT-based dynamic behavior monitoring
    scheme to provide security and energy conservation in WSN [95]. It is widely used
    in a hostile environment to protect the sensor network from various attacks, especially
    in the routing process. This trust-based secured technique increases the lifespan
    of the network. A wireless-powered multiantenna-multicasting has been investigated
    by Chu et al. [104]. To provide reliable communication in the presence of multiple
    eavesdroppers, power is supplied by multiple power beacons (PBs) which is further
    harvested by the transmitter. An SG is formulated to provide monetary incentives
    to the PBs in order to achieve secured communication. Similarly, Sarma et al.
    [97] harvest energy from the power beacon of multi-sensor nodes. The equilibrium
    is evaluated analytically for a single sensor node and the equilibrium strategies
    for multiple sensor nodes. Table 3(a). Energy harvesting. Application Author &

    Nguyen et al. [39] proposed an EH for the nodes deployed in a moving vehicle.
    The capacity of the considered system is improved by implementing NOMA. The source
    and relay in the proposed system harvest energy from the power beacon. Successive
    interference cancellation technique is implemented in NOMA for two different destinations
    in addition to energy harvesting. The end-to-end delay is significantly reduced.
    Further, the outage probability and ergodic capacity for both the destinations
    are determined. Results reveal that there is a significant gain in the system’s
    capacity of about 1.2 bits/s/Hz. 3.2.4. Internet on vehicle (IoV) An intelligent
    energy-harvesting framework (IEAF) based on vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications
    is proposed by Wang et al. [101]. The authors implemented a three-stage SG to
    maximize the utilities of both roadside units (RSUs) and electric vehicles (EVs)
    in V2I communications. The RSUs are placed along the side of roads to determine
    a location in order to provide services for autonomous driving. However, the RSUs
    are often battery enabled devices therefore, energy is harvested from solar and
    wind energy to serve the EVs. This work mainly focuses on two energy consumption
    components in IoV systems, battery-enabled RSUs and EVs. The different research
    aspects discussed for energy saving during RSU scheduling are: (1) Reduction of
    energy consumption by turning on and turn off in a periodic manner (2) Sending
    RSUs in sleep mode in case of insufficient energy and harvest the same from solar
    and wind (3) Vehicle-grid technology based EV charging, where EV not only purchases
    energy from the power grid but also sells energy. In addition, particle swarm
    optimization is implemented to incur the benefits of EVs and power grid (4) Wireless
    power transfer for EV using induction coil to receive electric power from the
    electromagnetic field. 3.2.5. CRN SWIPT based EH technique is adopted for CRN,
    where the EH node behaves as a malicious attacker and decodes the signal of secondary
    transmitter (ST) during the process of energy harvesting thereby, reducing the
    secrecy capacity [91]. Further, the network’s average secrecy capacity increases
    by 0.391 b/s/Hz. In order to formulate the problem among the STs with limited
    CSI, a Bayesian Nash equilibrium (BNE) is determined. Further, performance of
    BNE is proven better than NE for limited CSI. Similarly, GT is also used where
    EH and information decoding of the source is simultaneously carried out by the
    eavesdropper using convex optimization to reach the SE [92]. The eavesdropper
    harvests energy from secondary base station (SBS). Moreover, SBS tries to maximize
    the secrecy rate and minimizes its interference at the primary receiver (PR).
    Similarly, ST harvests energy from the RF source in addition to the implementation
    of sequential bargaining mechanism for sharing of spectrum with primary transmitter
    (PT) [93]. 3.2.6. NOMA The EH and jamming of eavesdroppers using the null steering
    beamforming technique for downlink NOMA communication system is demonstrated by
    Alsaba et al. [102]. The results of secrecy capacity show that this technique
    outperforms the AN technique as beamforming affects the targetted node in the
    desired direction only. Similarly, for the downlink NOMA system in [51], the two
    techniques: superposition coding (SC) for the base station and successive interference
    cancellation (SIC) for the strong users are implemented. This system consists
    of multi-antenna BS with two users per transmission slot, where the strong user
    wiretaps and decodes the information of the weak user. To overcome this problem,
    the weak user can introduce some AN to confuse the eavesdropper. The authors formulate
    a non-cooperative zero-sum game between the strong and weak user to obtain secrecy
    capacity. Further, to avoid eavesdropping, a pure and mixed-strategy NE is proposed.
    The AN aided security scheme enhances the secrecy performance of NOMA in comparison
    to the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) system. Moreover, imperfect
    or partial CSI scenarios by introducing robust secured algorithms are proposed
    as the future work. 3.2.7. Cooperative communication The authors discussed Nash
    BG of EH for wireless powered relay networks with one relay and multiple source–destination
    pairs [99]. The EH from a relay is divided into three sub-problems: energy transmission
    power optimization, power control for data transmission, and time-division between
    energy transmission and data transmission. The sub-optimal solution is obtained
    using alternating power control and time division algorithm. The wireless energy
    transfer (WET) in cooperative communication consists of one source and multiple
    relay–destination (RD) pairs. However, Leng and Yener [108] proposed an asymmetric
    WET (AWET) for a relay-centric two-hop network. Relays receive source signals
    sequentially however, the nodes that wait longer accumulate more energy by harvesting
    from previous signals. The SG is formulated between RD pairs (leaders) and SD
    pairs (followers). Relays harvest energy from the signals intended from previous
    relays during their waiting times. The results reveal that the proposed AWET outperforms
    the symmetric WET, broadcast WET, and independent WET in terms of system utility
    and energy efficiency. The Baidas et al. [98] discussed the physical layer security
    for both regular users (REUs) and security oriented users (SEUs). The equilibrium
    techniques are discussed in wireless security with EH. The two considered multi-relay
    scenarios are constrained selection (CS) and unconstrained selection (US). The
    relay harvests energy which is known by the source using non-Bayesian learning
    (NBL) algorithm. The Best Response (BR) recursive algorithm with CS outperforms
    the US. The source nodes takes multi-relay selection decisions to guarantee perfect
    NE. 3.2.8. MIMO-OFDM The Bannour et al. [103] investigated an EH-powered cooperative
    MIMO-OFDM transmission using algebraic space–time coding (ASTC) with a coalitional
    game-based relay selection. The players are EH-powered relay nodes. On the basis
    of the amount of EH and the channel condition, the relay node cooperates with
    the BS. The relay dynamically configures virtual MIMO network for transmitting
    to destination at each epoch. The suggested approach has a better goodput gain
    at SNRs greater than 15 dB than [179]. However, the gain reduces at lower values
    of SNRs, specifically below 15 dB due to the formation of coalition after the
    negotiations. The findings show that at SNR 30 dB, the gain is 5.3%. However,
    at 40 dB and 10 dB, the gains achieved are 12% and 6.6%, respectively. 3.3. Price
    sharing and profit maximization Intermediate nodes help the legitimate node in
    transmitting information and hence the capacity is improved. As the nodes are
    rational in nature, their participation can be encouraged by price sharing and
    payoff schemes. The various application areas where GT models are used for the
    price sharing and profit maximization are summarized in Table 4 including different
    games, findings and related issues. Table 4. Price sharing and profit maximization.

    Chopra et al. [109] investigated the performance of networks with and without
    the direct link between SE and SD. In this paper, the price and power of relays
    are controlled by SG, where the relay and the source play the roles of leader
    and follower, respectively. The intercept probability of the threshold-based DF
    relay is determined with MRC. Using convex optimization, closed-form optimal solutions
    for price and power are obtained. In [110] the jammer strives to attain maximum
    profit for combating the action of eavesdropping. This problem is modeled using
    Bertrand game to obtain the optimal pricing scheme for a friendly jammer. 3.3.2.
    CRN Games played between multiple PUs and SUs are classified in upper and lower
    sub-games. The users compete with each other to maximize their utilities and revenues
    using GT. The non-cooperative game is formulated to maximize the utilities in
    terms of global interference and outage constraints by Yang et al. [113]. 3.3.3.
    Cellular communication The SG is formulated between the spectrum provider (SP)
    as leader and BS as follower to maximize profit and improvise the spectrum usage
    in off-peak hours. The different selling prices of bandwidth are considered to
    address on-demand services. Furthermore, closed form expressions of Stackelberg
    equilibrium are determined for both single user and multi user scenarios. This
    game realized greater profit for both BS as well as SP. The pricing of statistical
    request delay information (RDI) closely matches with the non-causal RDI in Huang
    et al. [111]. For the delay constraint of 2, the utility gains of the spectrum
    provider (SP) with non-causal RDI and statistical RDI improves by 90.8% and 39.1%,
    respectively, when compared to the system without RDI. 3.3.4. V2V communication
    To avoid collision and provide seamless traffic on roads, information about the
    speed and position of the vehicles are exchanged in vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication
    networks as shown in Fig. 14. Yang et al. [114] discussed V2V data offloading
    network to transmit the data using vehicle-to-vehicle in a single hop or multi-hop
    network. The SG based pricing scheme for data offloading in software defined network
    (SDN) based VANETs is presented. In this game, the client follows the action of
    the leader. The NE is determined to select a service provider according to the
    lowest unit price by reducing the downloading time. Download : Download high-res
    image (135KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 14. Vehicle to vehicle
    communication. Zhang et al. [115] investigated the V2X for ultra reliable low
    latency communication (uRLLC), where the MBS set the interference price for transmitting
    power to VUEs. The SG is formulated between MBS and VUEs to get the optimal price
    for MBS services. The MBS maximizes its gain from interference revenue cost consideration
    and VUEs maximize their gains per unit of power consumption. The SG shows the
    trade-off between profit and power saving. The authors plan to address location-based
    resource allocation for realistic vehicle traffic in the near future. For a wireless
    ad-hoc network and WSN, incentive-based techniques are generally used for stimulating
    nodes to cooperate in the network [116]. 3.3.5. UAV The Unmanned aerial vehicle
    or drone is an aerial base station which improves the efficiency and coverage
    of wireless communication systems. The line of sight (LoS) communication by UAV
    can be properly adjusted by its height. Ni et al. [112] proposed a modified binary
    log-linear learning algorithm (BLLL) for multiple UAVs in a cooperative search
    problem using potential game theory. This is an effective and feasible model that
    converges at less time in both simple and complex environments. 3.3.6. Cyber physical
    systems In a cyber physical system there exists a price competition among service
    organizers (SOs), entities and users to obtain better services. According to the
    available services, the SO dynamically increases or reduces its price. To decide
    the price, Liu et al. [117] proposed a game based service price decision (GSPD)
    using the rule of “survival of the fittest” considering the diversity and complexity
    of the CPS system. 3.3.7. IoT Rawat et al. [118] proposed a three-layered game,
    where wireless network virtualization is studied through the slicing of wireless
    infrastructure into Wireless Infrastructure Providers (WIPs), Mobile Virtual Network
    Operators (MVNOs), and IoT devices (or end-users). The players play sequentially
    to determine their optimal strategies. With the help of a controller, WIPs divide
    and reconfigure their RF bands to sublease frequency slices to MVNOs based on
    their service-level-agreement (SLA). This game presented a unique optimal solution
    to facilitate the trade-off between QoS of end-users, payoffs of MVNOs, and the
    payoff of WIPs. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed approach is evaluated
    using numerical results which reveal that the payoffs of WIPs and MVNOs can be
    maximized by offering a competitive price for the subleased RF spectrum. 3.4.
    Resource management Resource management including power and spectral allocation
    is the major challenge for any efficient wireless network. The resource allocation
    problem is portrayed using SG for CRN in [181] by Chowdhury et al. Further, the
    subsequent sections presented GT for resource allocation in various applications
    like cooperative communication [76], IoT [159], edge computing [155], [156], [160],
    [161], shared spectrum [180] UAV [48], [50]. Further, distributed power allocation
    is addressed in different applications including MEC [132], [133], UAV [49], [134],
    satellite network [135], cooperative communication [136], and F-RAN [127]. Table

    hierarchical federated learning. 3.4.1. Spectrum allocation Spectrum is the bandwidth
    assigned to the cellular device to provide desired services. It is a payable quantity
    and also limited in nature. Therefore, spectrum sharing becomes important to support
    numerous internet applications and devices. Tables 5(a) and 5(b) brief the GT
    models and their findings for resource allocation and efficient utilization of
    spectrum. (a) CPS and IoT. To overcome the challenges of efficient allocation
    of limited resources to selfish users in a network, a distributed resource allocation
    scheme is presented for CPS and IoT systems [128]. A technique of dynamic competitive
    spectrum allocation is proposed for IoT devices in [182] based on a two-level
    (upper level and lower level) game. The optimal control problem is modeled by
    the upper level however, the lower level game is formulated by the Colonel Blotto
    game. The two service providers (SPs) possessing different spectrum are consider
    to serve the users. The SPs auction the spectrum for each time slot. The users
    independently and opportunistically choose a SP to maximize their utility. Further,
    SP competes to achieve maximum access for the users in order to lift its profit.
    To evaluate the optimal strategy for each time slot, the SPs adopt a decentralized
    non-cooperative repeated game. Using a sequential game method, Mughal et al. in
    [76] presented distributed resource allocation to efficiently assign channels
    from diverse frequency bands to relay nodes in order to improve total transmission
    time, effective throughput, and relay node efficiency for IoT system. (b) MEC.
    The non-polynomial computing complexity is solved in edge resource allocation
    (ERA) in [159] using a decentralized algorithm to discover the NE solution that
    maximizes the total quality of experience (QoE) by Li et al. Results reveal significant
    performance and scalability in the large-scale distributed edge computing scenario,
    making it suitable in real time systems. Learning for computation offloading and
    resource allocation (L6C) problems are addressed by Liu et al. in [160]. The authors
    used machine learning for resource management in wireless networks using multi-agent
    deep reinforcement learning. The proposed technique leads by 63.3%, 24.06%, and
    34.45% in terms of average edge reward, average user reward, and edge resource
    utilization ratio, respectively. Furthermore, Xia et al. in [161] proposed a two-phase
    game-theoretic decentralized method for problem named data, user, and power allocation
    (DUPA), which is characterized as a potential game with at least one Nash equilibrium.
    DUPA game outperforms centralized algorithm for cache placement (CACP) by 116.63%,
    data rate greedy (DRG) by 119.37%, and user coverage greedy (UCG) by 104.57% in
    the overall data rate. Javanmardi et al. in [180] defined a distributed dynamic
    rate and channel selection in a multi-user network as a multi-player multi-armed
    bandit problem. A decentralized learning algorithm is proposed that achieves near-optimal
    exploration of the transmission rates to learn quickly in time. The results reveal
    that accuracy of the proposed algorithm is 10% to 40% higher than other algorithms
    and vice-versa for a time slot. Xiao et al. [183] used the minority game and different
    reinforcement learning (RL) methods for MEC servers. It provides an energy-efficient
    and effective distributed resource allocation for the efficient utilization of
    available resources. Moreover, Chen et al. [184] adopted a non-cooperative game,
    real-time update computation offloading (RUCO), and multi-user probabilistic offloading
    decision (MPOD) algorithms to determine the offloading strategy with minimum cost
    for dense distribution of edge servers. Further, Ding et al. [185] used a non-cooperative
    game for offloading the distributed network for D2D communication. Messous et
    al. [186] explored the data offloading for UAVs considering the constraints related
    to energy, cost, and time. The NE exists and the GT-based offloading results outperform
    to the local computing. (c) Blockchain. For mining, a mobile blockchain application
    with edge cloud support is used in [155] by Liang et al. Miners, mobile devices,
    and the cloud collaboratively mined mobile devices and edge cloud operators (ECO)
    in order to authenticate the device. Because of tremendous computational capabilities,
    the edge cloud is explored for computational offloading. As a result, it is suitable
    for outsourcing mining workloads rather than regular cloud. The interactions among
    them constitute a multi-leader multi-follower SG that ensures profit maximization
    for all participants. (d) UAV. Chen et al. in [48] presented a mean-field game
    using deep reinforcement learning techniques for effective interaction between
    multiple objectives and numerous UAVs. The proposed GT framework maximizes communication
    efficiency while assuring fair communication range and network connectivity. The
    approach is also scalable and adaptable. The proposed approach uses seven UAVs
    to train a model and scaled up to ten UAVs. The results show that the suggested
    technique is more effective, resilient, and superior to the centralized control
    method. Gao et al. in [50] optimize multiple UAVs’ trajectory optimization with
    offloading delay, energy efficiency, and obstacle avoidance by formulating mixed-integer
    non-linear problem (MINP). Moreover, trajectory optimization and obstacle avoidance
    are addressed by the reinforcement learning method and the service assignment
    is solved by potential game. It lowers computational complexity and communication
    overhead, where the offloading task completes within 212 s by multi-agent deep
    deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) compared to 232 s by DDPG. The UAVs are
    capable of determining their ideal 3-D deployment intelligently in order to optimize
    the MIMO system’s channel capacity [49] by Gao et al. With regard to the rank
    function, the optimization issue may be separated into numerous optimization sub-problems
    using the potential game. The results imply that when the SNR increases from 0
    to 10 dB, the channel capacity also increases by 13 bits/s/Hz and for the SNR
    ranging between 10 to 20 dB, the channel capacity improves by 20 bits/s/Hz. (e)
    Fog radio access network (F-RAN). F-RAN is a multi-layered structure including
    small sites with low transmission power like relay stations, picocell sites, and
    home base stations with advantages of low latency, high spectrum utilization,
    flexible networking, strong coverage etc. For effective resource utilization,
    a two-level game is formulated between traditional network operators (TNOs) and
    virtual network operators (VNOs). A spectrum pricing and resource allocation scheme
    (SPAS) is proposed to improve operator’s revenue and reduce wastage of resources
    [126]. (f) M2M. Soorki et al. [124] investigated a stochastic coalition game which
    reduces the average fail ratio and energy consumption as compared to non-cooperative
    cluster-based distribution of machine type devices (MTDs). Results reveal that
    for the uniform and cluster-based distributions, the performance difference between
    the proposed method and the optimal solution is 20.5% and 13.5%, respectively.
    However, the complexity and signaling overhead of proposed method are significantly
    reduced. Likewise, a coalition game is proposed by Chen et al. [125] for mmWave
    and D2D users. The system’s sum-rate is maximized in a statistical average sense
    compared to other practical schemes such as, full mmWave Communication (FMC),
    random communication (RC), cellular coalition game (CCG), and full cellular communication
    (FCC). (g) Massive MIMO and peer to peer network. Due to the time-varying nature
    of the wireless channel, the estimation of a channel becomes very difficult. However,
    the pilot symbols are used but the overhead increases correspondingly. To address
    these challenges, Khan et al. [5] proposed a novel scheme for an efficient CSI
    acquisition with reduced pilot overhead in multi-user (MU) massive MIMO systems.
    The virtual angular domain is used to split the channel matrix using spatial correlation.
    In addition, compressed sensing is used to estimate the CSI matrix. This technique
    effectively estimates the channel at both high and low SNRs with less number of
    pilot symbols. In peer-to-peer networks, there is no central server and each peer
    acts both as a client and a server. The resource allocation scheme for a peer
    to peer network using two non-cooperative games, demand game, and reputation game
    is analyzed by Goswami et al. [130]. In the discussed server selection policy,
    the requested node chooses the server with high local reputation. The NE of the
    two games jointly push the system towards a steady-state. (h) Cognitive radio
    network. Quantum GT can be used in the MAC layer to avoid collision with effective
    spectrum sharing [120]. A multiple-user multiple-choice quantum minority game
    is proposed for resource allocation in CRN. The cognitive radio ad-hoc network
    (CRAHN) combines CR technology with an ad-hoc network to maximize the utilization
    of resources by minimizing the mutual interference. Reward and punishment mechanisms
    are discussed by Liu et al. [121] to reduce the selfish behavior of SUs while
    relaying. The SG is played between the PU (leader) and SUs (followers) to resolve
    the resource allocation problem. Furthermore, selfish behavior of SUs can be minimized
    by offering certain incentives, which result in the significant improvement in
    the system’s capacity. (i) RF FSO hybrid communication. The optical wireless channel
    (OWC) including both FSO and visible light communication (VLC) makes very high
    data rate systems but the significant transmission occurs only in line of sight
    communication. Mixed RF FSO discussed in [187], [188], [189], [190] proves to
    be the promising end-to-end solution. A spectrum trading game for RF/FSO hybrid
    communication is discussed [122]. FSO links are more susceptible to scattering
    due to fog and turbulence-induced scintillation however, RF links above 10 GHz
    are more susceptible to rain conditions. In order to get seamless services, hybrid
    RF/FSO communication systems are used. In case of strong turbulence/fog, the FSO
    link fails and the source transmits through available RF link. Market-equilibrium
    based pricing is applied to allow the source (buyer) and RF nodes (sellers) to
    play a spectrum trading game. For the number of RF surrounding small cells to
    be 5, the above specified system’s availability increases up to 99.996% and 99.9997%,
    for the traffic load of 10 and 1, respectively. (j) Cellular communication. In
    order to address the problem of under utilization of resources in any network,
    Sanguanpuak et al. [123] implemented a many-to-one stable matching game. The authors
    formulated the social welfare optimization problem for optimum spectrum sharing
    by multiple operators. They proposed a stochastic geometrical approach and a generic
    Markov Chain Monte Carlo method for resource allocation. To avoid redundant backhaul
    transmission in 5G networks, the authors proposed an efficient edge caching scheme
    and formulated SG for service provider (leader) and numerous edge nodes (followers).
    The two formulated games are storage allocation game (SAG) and user allocation
    game (UAG) [129]. The results show that this network can easily be scaled to the
    large scale caching problem with lesser resources. (k) mmWave. In the mmWave wireless
    backhaul network, the effective full duplex (FD) scheduling flow mechanism is
    presented by Jiang et al. [53]. The proposed FD concurrent scheduling algorithm
    based on coalition game (FDCG) outperforms the TDMA, STDMA, and SFD in terms of
    throughput and resource utilization efficiency. 3.4.2. Power allocation Power
    allocation refers to efficiently modify and manage the power from MS/BS in both
    directions (uplink/downlink). Interference plays a crucial role in defining system’s
    capacity and voice quality of any system. Interference on the uplink is more significant
    than on the downlink because of non-coherent detection at BS. As a result, uplink
    power regulation is considerably more important. For any link gain, a centralized
    power control (CPC) strategy needs a central controller and global information.
    As a result, implementing distributed power control (DPC) by utilizing only local
    data to take decisions is comparatively simpler. Dynamic power management at the
    uplink is beneficial as it increases system capacity, battery life, and talk time.
    Isnawati et al. in [191] analyzed CPC and DPC used for cognitive femtocell network
    (CFN). Results signify that CPC can produce SINR values that are higher than the
    SINR targets, but DPC the maximum value can reach up to target SINR. However,
    the power consumed by the CPC is greater than that of DPC thereby, DPC proves
    to be more power efficient than CPC. In that series, Tsiropoulou et al. in [192]
    proposed a game-theoretic framework using convex pricing compared to linear pricing
    of users’ transmission power for effective distributed power regulation in the
    uplink of CDMA wireless networks. This suggested framework succeeded in producing
    more revenue for the system by compelling users to engage in social behavior at
    large. Table 5(c) briefs the GT models and their findings for dynamic or decentralized
    power allocation used in various application related to wireless communication.

    Ning et al. in [132] explored MEC-enabled 5G in-home health monitoring for IoMT
    which is categorized into intra-WBANs and beyond-WBANs, thereby implementing the
    bargaining game and the potential game for bandwidth scheduling and cost minimizing,
    respectively. The decentralized algorithm saves 78% of an average time as compared
    to the centralized algorithm. In addition, with the increase in the number of
    patients, number of slots increases correspondingly. For offloading the decisions,
    decentralized approximation algorithms with SG are used to decrease the completion
    times for edge computing [156] by Josilo et al. The results conveyed that a cost-cutting
    resource allocation policy requires less completion times than the time-based
    allocation method. Using a decentralized computation offloading technique, Wang
    et al. in [133] suggested a multi-agent imitation learning-based compute offloading
    approach with stochastic GT to reduce the average task completion time for each
    device. It also uses generalized adversarial imitation learning in a multi-agent
    context. Further, the mixed-integer and non-convex (MINC) NP-hard problem of combined
    scheduling and power allocation with the aim of optimizing the average weighted
    sum-rate (WSR) of the 5G network is addressed in [58] by Sheemar et al. To solve
    this problem, the authors decoupled the problem by allocating power first using
    a low-complexity, greedy, and decentralized method and then by scheduling the
    mode via a game between cells. Results signify that for the cross-interference
    management factor of 0.3, both simplified-payoff and approximated-payoff are selected
    and higher average weighted sum rates are obtained as compared to that of static
    TDD. (b) Cooperative communication. The power allocation problem is solved using
    a model price incentive mechanism based on SG, which tries to gain active participation
    support from relays and reduces system signaling overhead in [136] by Xu et al.
    The destination node buys the relay’s collaborative power and the relay reports
    the unit power price according to the destination’s requirements. The dynamic
    power allocation approach based on SG can quickly determine the optimal allocation
    for the new locations. (c) Satellites. Based on the computational power of LEO
    satellites, a dynamic power allocation strategy for the inter-satellite link of
    Low Earth Orbit (LEO)/Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) satellites is proposed in [135]
    by Zhang et al. The inter-satellite link distance is projected using the spherical
    geometric relationship between the LEO/MEO satellites based on the initial orbit
    characteristics of the satellite and the satellite’s operational duration. The
    penalty factor is controlled by the MEO satellite thereby improving the overall
    network’s utility. The suggested distance prediction-based non-cooperative power
    game (DPNPG) strategy has lesser influence on battery life cycle loss than the
    non-cooperative power game with non-cost (NPG-NC). (d) NOMA and F-RAN. NOMA and
    fog computing radio access network (F-RAN) provide robust support for augmented/virtual
    reality (AR/VR) applications, automotive networking, intelligent medical applications,
    and so on. For this type of novel time-varying network, Qiu et al. in [127] proposed
    a non-cooperative game for resource optimization to reduce complexity while decoupling
    the dynamic optimization issue from sub-channel assignment and power allocation.
    Results reveal the potency in terms of the utility performance of the network.
    (e) UAV. The work in [134] addresses a user-centric UAV swarm with device-to-device
    user equipment (DUE) and proposed an hierarchical SG to create distinct profit
    functions for different game players by Zhang et al. The simulation results demonstrate
    that the power allocation algorithm of the two-level Stackelberg game (PAOTLSG)
    method successfully boosts throughput by 4.65 percent when compared to the pricing-based
    Stackelberg game (PSG) algorithm. Edge Intelligence is the result of convergence
    of AI and edge computing supported by the FL based heterogeneous network. The
    hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework has been developed to mitigate
    the node failures by Lim et al. in [193]. The evolutionary game theory is chosen
    to serve the model owner at the upper level, whereas model owners must compete
    for the cluster heads’ services. As a result, to determine the value of each cluster
    head’s services, the author in [158], [193] proposed a deep learning-based auction
    process. The results demonstrate the originality and stability of the proposed
    evolutionary game and revenue maximization. (f) VANET. To know the position, speed
    and acceleration of other vehicles, Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) known as beacons
    are periodically broadcasted in the Vehicular Adhoc NETworks (VANETs) [54]. The
    authors proposed a distributed beacon transmission power control algorithm for
    proper channel usage which controls traffic congestion. By this technique, every
    vehicle can transmit with optimum power and fair and proper bandwidth utilization.

    the important parameters when determining the performance of a system in terms
    of probability of failure and ratio of desired output to input, respectively.
    In order to combat the eavesdropping effect, a coordinated beamforming design
    with AN in the downlink of Macrocell base station (MBS) and femtocell base stations
    (FBSs) are used. Table 6 shows the reliability and efficiency issues addressed
    in various applications of wireless communication using game theory. 3.5.1. MIMO
    The researchers in [137] illustrate the improvement in reliability and the data
    rate of MIMO systems using GT. A non-cooperative game is used to explore the optimization
    problem of energy efficiency (EE) in a multi-user cognitive MIMO system [194].
    The NE of the system is determined in the proposed distributed iterative energy-efficient
    optimization algorithm (DIEEOA) for the multi-user (MU) cognitive MIMO interference
    channel (IC). Competition occurs among the SUs to get access to the MIMO interference
    channel using a transmission covariance matrix. With each iteration, this matrix
    is updated in order to maximize energy efficiency. The updated information is
    not shared among SUs which indirectly supports the practical implementation of
    the system. A higher EE is achieved in the proposed algorithm compared to the
    spectral efficiency algorithm for MU-MIMO cognitive IC system. 3.5.2. Wireless
    charging vehicles (WCVs) Lin et al. [138] proposed a unique approach to address
    the issues related to the collaborative charging in large-scale WRSNs with multiple
    WCVs using Game Theoretical Collaborative Charging Scheduling (GTCCS) scheme.
    The payoff function is designed rationally to improve the energy efficiency and
    reduces the number of dead nodes. In addition, the charging conflicts are resolved
    among WCVs. The experimental and simulation results of [138] show significant
    improvement of energy efficiency of up to 20% and 15% than that of PushWait and
    Hierarchical schemes, respectively. 3.5.3. NOMA based MEC A novel NOMA-based MEC
    network is proposed by Xu et al. [6] to improve the energy efficiency during task
    offloading process with minimum energy consumption. Moreover, it improves the
    spectral efficiency and reduces the network pressure from the computing-intensive
    and latency-sensitive applications in future wireless networks. Additionally,
    a matching-coalition approach coupled with computing resource allocation and power
    control to find the optimal solution has been proposed. The average derivation
    between the suggested approach and exhaustive search for total energy consumption
    is approximately 7.72%. 3.5.4. Wireless ad hoc network The independent Poisson
    point process (PPP) is investigated for two conditions by Kwon et al. [141]. The
    authors considered that the source and eavesdropper are randomly located in the
    network. The two situations are discussed, and an alternating optimizing scheme
    is presented where the eavesdropper triggers all the nodes in order to wiretap
    maximum information from the source and in another, the eavesdropper triggers
    few nodes near to the source to maximize its secrecy energy efficiency (EE). After
    few iterations, the best response dynamics converges to the NE. The secrecy EE
    improves by approximately 50% compared to the secrecy spectral efficiency (SE)
    at 25% reduction in price. 3.6. Network coverage Network coverage is the geographical
    area covered by the BS or service providers (SPs). Table 7 illustrates different
    GT models and their applications to mitigate the interference and for improving
    the network coverage. This section deals with the GT concepts used in different
    applications of WC. Table 7. Network coverage and interference management. Application

    contamination in MIMO system. 3.6.1. Cellular communication An ultra-dense cellular
    network consists of a FD base station (BS) having a baseband unit (BBU) which
    is responsible for signal processing and BS control and a radio remote unit (RRU)
    is a radio transceiver which is closer to half-duplex (HD) UEs. The HD UE is served
    by the FD BS and correspondingly BBU periodically charges RRU. For this network,
    Ge et al. [142] model the energy efficiency and coverage optimization problem
    as a mean-field game. Furthermore, a case study of a bargaining game between two
    UAVs is presented in order to increase the coverage area in Mkiramweni et al.
    [47]. The utility of the player is defined where UAV encounters the mobile unit
    by sending beaconing signals. Moreover, an optimal beaconing period is determined
    by the UAV to get the maximum value of Nash Bargaining Solution (NBS) with different
    encounter rates. To minimize the errors in the channel estimation of MIMO system,
    Zhu et al. [145] proposed a pilot allocation algorithm based on coalitional GT.
    In the proposed algorithm, preference functions of users are used to obtain the
    stable state by forming a desirable coalition. To avoid pilot contamination by
    other coalitions, the users of a particular coalition share the same pilot signal
    in a distributed MIMO system. 3.6.2. IoT Yan et al. [144] presented a UAV assisted
    IoT communication network (U-ICN), where UAV performs access selection and BS
    allocates bandwidth with a hierarchical game framework to make a cost effective
    network. To overcome overloading due to tremendous IoT applications, UAV assisted
    communication networks are flexible solution for a large coverage area with less
    environmental restrictions. A dynamic evolutionary game is formulated among UAVs,
    where SG is implemented between UAVs and BSs and a non-cooperative game for BW
    allocation is formulated between BSs and UAVs. A stochastic geometry tool is used
    to model the positioning of network nodes and payoffs based on different network
    parameters. 3.6.3. D2D/M2M communication A new paradigm, D2D communication provides
    high speed communication with very low latency at eNodeB. Zhuoming et al. [143]
    used fuzzy logic to propose an architecture for achieving significant gains in
    average rate utility for a tree network. To incorporate these features with an
    uncertain relationship between the resource and UEs, the authors implemented fuzzy
    mathematics. The above discussed system improves utility in terms of rate and
    bit error rate (BER) and converges to a NE. By using coalitional GT, each UE self-organizes
    into a stable structure without the control of eNodeB. The arrangement of all
    UEs to eNodeB in star topology converges to a tree network, providing significant
    improvements up to 50% in average achieved rate utility. 3.7. Interference management
    RF interference is a major factor that affects the QoS of any network. In D2D
    communication, the dynamic SG is formulated between the BS and D2D pairs. The
    leader (BS) assists in reducing the interference among the D2D pairs (followers).
    The followers compete with each other for the optimum allocation of resources
    and power. Sawyer et al. in [146] categorized the D2D users into three classes
    according to their applications (casual, interactive, and streaming), each having
    a different utility function. This enhances the QoE (quality of experience) of
    D2D users. 4. Simulations The performance evaluation of the GT in WC is presented
    in this section. We assess the SG for physical layer security in the first scenario,
    and we determine the NE employed in resource allocation for the coexistence of
    5G and Wi-Fi networks in the second scenario. 4.1. Security problem We use GT
    to analyze a WC situation in which a legitimate link supplemented by a friendly
    jammer combats active eavesdropping. An active eavesdropper (E) is a malicious
    node that operates in full-duplex mode, performing both the operations: jamming
    and wiretapping the legitimate link between source (S) and destination (D) link.
    Further, the E’s link is disrupted by the friendly jammer (J). In this scenario,
    the J’s interference only affects the active eavesdropper in first case however
    in the second case, the jamming signal jams the active eavesdropper by negligibly
    affecting D. In the aforementioned scenarios, the active FD malicious eavesdropper
    is considered to be less prominent than the main channel in order to obtain a
    non-zero secrecy rate [195]. The friendly jammer is selfish therefore, charges
    price, , for combating E and assisting legitimate link. The S, J, and E send ,
    , and signals with power , , and , respectively. The SINR of the signal received
    and channel capacity at D in the presence of active eavesdropper, friendly jammer,
    and source can be written as (1) where and represent thermal noise at destination
    and eavesdropper, respectively. The channel gains of the links s d, s e, e d,
    e e, j e, and j d are , , , , , and , respectively. The variance of Additive White
    Gaussian Noise (AWGN) is specified by . The normal distribution with zero mean
    and variance characterizes the channel coefficient ( ) between nodes i and j.
    To simplify the expression, we substitute , , , , , and . Thereafter, the SINR
    and channel capacity for the active eavesdropper’s link can be written as (2)
    where is self interference coefficient. The achievable secrecy rate of the legitimate
    link S-D, can be written as , where specifies max (., 0). 4.1.1. Problem formulation
    To maximize the utility function of jammer stated as , the optimal price ( ) is
    required to obtain optimal interfering power ( ). The maximize is obtained by
    differentiating with respect to and equating to zero. When the is positive, the
    friendly jammer abates the effect of active eavesdropper. Otherwise, it pauses
    its aid to the legitimate link due to its selfish behavior. (3) The objective
    is to find the optimal cost that maximizes the Jammer’s utility. The interfering
    jammer broadcasts with power of at the cost of unit power from the source. In
    continuation, the utility of source becomes (4) On differentiating (4) with respect
    to and equating to zero, we obtain quartic equation, where the positive real root
    yields optimal jamming power ( ). Similarly, in the absence of gjd the positive
    root of quadratic equation obtained is (5) 4.1.2. Simulation results We consider
    that the active eavesdropper transmits with 0.1 W power per unit bandwidth of
    the channel. The channel gains between S-D and S-E links are presumed to be 5
    and 4, respectively. The channel gain of links E-D, J-E, and J-D are considered
    to be 2, 3, and 0.2, respectively. In Fig. 15, we observe for in watt: 0.3, 0.7,
    and 1 for specifically ranging between 0.3 to 0.7. The decreases with an increase
    in and increase in . This is due to the fact that the eavesdropper’s link is adversely
    affected by resulting in lower optimal cost thereby resulting in less . Further,
    the adverse impact of link on secrecy capacity is observed. The results reveal
    the fact that cost increases due to adverse effect of on secrecy capacity as additional
    loading occurs on the communication link. It is also inferred from the results
    that with the increase in , the , increases and per unit power price from the
    source decreases. After determining and , the utility of the source ( ) is tabulated
    in Table 8 for both the considered cases of . It is noted that utility of source
    outperforms in the absence of due to the fact that it has detrimental effect on
    main transmission which increases with the increases in . Table 8. Utility of

    Optimum cost of Jammer. The anti-eavesdropping mechanism for a full duplex active
    eavesdropper using a friendly but selfish jammer is the goal of this study. The
    jammer strives to earn as much profit as possible from its service in order to
    help legitimate transmissions. We cover both the scenarios when the jammer not
    only interferes with the malicious eavesdropper but also with the destination.
    For both the scenarios, the utility of source is established, and a closed form
    expression is obtained. 4.2. Resource allocation Based on the latest report on
    global mobile data, traffic is expected to exceed 77.5 exabytes (EB) per month
    by 2022 due to high-speed mobile data that has been fast expanding since the introduction
    of data-intensive applications [196]. Therefore, the actual deployment of 5G-unlicensed
    necessitates the development of algorithms that allow 5G to coexist with available
    Wi-Fi technology in a seamless manner. 5G and Wi-Fi share the unlicensed spectrum
    in a time-division fashion using CSAT (Carrier Sense Adaptive Transmission) [197].
    Due to this fact, cooperation among all nodes in the network is required, which
    is not possible when the nodes are owned by different operators. Therefore, the
    framework of GT is well suited to model for 5G and Wi-Fi technologies. Table 9.

    We posit a utility maximization problem where 5G base stations share the available
    Wi-Fi spectrum incorporating sufficient set of constraints. The objective is to
    maximize the sum utility of 5G BSs and WiFi access points (WAPs), where and denote
    allocated time for ‘n’ and ‘w’ number of 5G BSs and WAP, respectively. Further,
    their rates are specified by and , respectively. In this competitive environment,
    game-theoretic techniques are utilized to simulate various scenarios in which
    the optimum time ( ) is described in terms of constrained Nash equilibrium. According
    to the definition of best response, the NE for two 5G BSs is given by, (6) where
    is The pseudo code of the implemented algorithm is described as follows: Download

    results The considered scenario is equipped with three 5G based BSs and one WAP,
    where two BSs transmit with 30 Mbps data rate however, the data rate of third
    BS varies from 20–50 Mbps. The maximum data rate of Wi-Fi is considered to be
    10 Mbps. We have performed simulation for three cases, the coexistence of one
    5G BS with one WAP, two 5G BSs with one WAP, and three 5G BSs with one WAP. The
    optimal allocated time obtained after implementing NE in Algorithm 1 and stated
    in Table 9. In case of a single BS, increases to support high data rate. However,
    with the increase in number of BSs, reduces in order to support the Wi-Fi spectrum.
    As a result, GT enables an effective allocation of resources in a decentralized
    wireless communication system. We analyzed game-theoretic formulations to solve
    the problem of time-sharing of the unlicensed spectrum for the network of 5Gs
    and WAP. We are considered wireless communications scenario where GT is used to
    give a flexible way for studying nodes to interact and cooperate for resource
    allocation and profit. 5. Future implications of GT in WC The major challenge
    is to address a hybrid, multi-user, and multi-antenna system to provide seamless
    coverage, high throughput, low latency, large bandwidth, and high resolution with
    conflicting interest of nodes or agents due to their covetous and selfish nature.
    Security, infrastructure cost, deployment and coverage, device support etc., need
    attention for ultra-dense distributed and dynamic networks, where each node acts
    independently and capable of taking intelligent decisions based on the scenario
    and predetermined algorithms. In these diversified areas, GT is used as an effective
    tool for the interaction and rational decision among independent nodes to obtain
    optimal solutions for heterogeneous networks. Moreover, various applications,
    existing works, challenges, and future research directions are listed in Tables
    10(a) and 10(b). Table 10(a). Future implications of GT in WC. Application Existing

    channel, stochastic games can be formulated to optimize the utility function.
    • Ultra-dense wireless networks have various traffic demands and priorities due
    to diversified areas of applications. Therefore, designing a dynamic game model
    to ensure high quality services to the users is a challenging task. • The security
    of a heterogeneous network is a critical issue which can be addressed using game
    theory for future generation networks. • To combat intra and inter system interference
    in the case of full duplex eavesdropping, GT models can be considered. 6. Conclusion
    Game theory is a powerful mathematical tool that can be used to solve complicated
    problems of society (Economics, Biology, Communication, Finance, etc.) in order
    to achieve optimum results. More specifically, different games such as non-cooperative
    and cooperative with their derived Nash equilibrium/Bayesian Nash equilibrium/Stackelberg
    Equilibrium have been explored. This paper posits a brief summary of GT casting
    efficient solutions in different domains such as security, energy harvesting,
    resource allocation, profit maximization, reliability, efficiency, etc. In a real-time
    scenario, the nodes are proliferated by learning and adapting according to the
    random behavior of WC. Hence, Q-learning with GT potentially proves to be a good
    solution for improving the performance of the system. Besides this, to accelerate
    the team spirit among the nodes coalition games are used, where nodes work together
    and share the cost to maximize profit and reduce the latency in the network. In
    this framework, the existing game theoretical approaches, components, and future
    research directions are outlined. This review highlights various game-theoretical
    models applied in different future generation technologies such as mmWave, UAV,
    MIMO, NOMA, IoT ecosystem, CPS, Blockchain, WSN, VANET, V2I, Cooperative communication,
    etc. In addition, the state-of-the-art of games with their outcomes are tabulated
    and comprehensively discussed for different wireless applications. To help the
    readers, a systematic survey of GT is presented and classified according to different
    application areas. Moreover, the simulation results of resource allocation problem
    and physical layer security in wireless communication using game theory are presented.
    The open research challenges and issues are enlisted for further investigation
    by the researchers. CRediT authorship contribution statement Rajni Gupta: Conception

    \ many devices will communi-\ncate in the presence of the cellular network; the\
    \ chances of availability of spec-\ntrum will be very scary given the presence\
    \ of large numbers of mobile users\nand large amounts of applications. Spectrum\
    \ prediction is very encouraging for\nhigh trafﬁc next-generation wireless networks,\
    \ where devices/machines which\nare part of the Cognitive Radio Network (CRN)\
    \ can predict the spectrum state\nprior to transmission to save their limited\
    \ energy by avoiding unnecessarily sen-\nsing radio spectrum. Long short-term\
    \ memory (LSTM) is employed to simulta-\nneously predict the Radio Spectrum State\
    \ (RSS) for two-time slots, thereby\nallowing the secondary node to use the prediction\
    \ result to transmit its information\nto achieve lower waiting time hence, enhanced\
    \ performance capacity. A frame-\nwork of spectral transmission based on the LSTM\
    \ prediction is formulated, named\nas positive prediction and sensing-based spectrum\
    \ access. The proposed scheme\nprovides an average maximum waiting time gain of\
    \ 2.88 ms. The proposed\nscheme provides 0.096 bps more capacity than a conventional\

    \ static\nspectrum allocation policies can no longer provide substantial improvement\
    \ due to the inefﬁcient use of the\nwireless spectrum [1]. Federal Communication\

    \ channel states based on historical information [5].\nSpectrum prediction ﬁnds\
    \ many potential applications in future wireless networks such as Cooperative\
    \ Relay\nNetwork (CRN), smart grid, 5G network, and IoT devices. Spectrum prediction\
    \ techniques based on different\nmethods like Linear prediction Auto-Regressive\
    \ (AR), Moving Average(MA), Auto-Regressive Moving\nAverage(ARMA), Autoregressive\
    \ Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models [6–8], Markov models\nbased models\
    \ [9–12] have been carried out. However, the majority of the existing work is\
    \ based on\nconventional statistical techniques or shallow models to predict the\
    \ spectrum state. Deep Learning (DL), a\nbranch of machine learning inspired by\
    \ the human brain, fuelled by more available computing power, has\nshown excellent\
    \ performance in image classiﬁcation, target recognition [13], natural language\
    \ processing\n[14]. However, in DL, not all architecture is suitable for all applications.\n\
    Recurrent neural network (RNN) is one such architecture suitable for time series\
    \ data, which is, in this\ncase, for spectrum prediction. RNN suffers from vanishing\
    \ and exploding gradients. Therefore, Long Short\nTerm Memory (LSTM), an improved\
    \ version of RNN, was introduced to overcome the above-said\ndisadvantage. LSTM\
    \ has been employed in [15,16], to predict the spectrum state. The primary objective\n\
    of spectrum prediction is to enhance the throughput of SUs. Authors in [5] propose\
    \ a redesigned frame\nstructure that incorporates spectrum prediction, such that\
    \ they select only those channels for prediction,\nwhich are predicted to be free.\
    \ In [17], spectrum prediction and channel selection strategy based on\nonline\
    \ learning techniques are proposed. Authors in [18] propose a prediction and sensing-based\n\
    spectrum sharing model where cooperative spectrum prediction is employed. However,\
    \ it uses a\nconventional statistical method for signal and its arrival. It employs\
    \ Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which\nis unsuitable for historical dependencies\
    \ and ineffective for time series data. In [19], authors use LSTM\nfor prediction-based\
    \ spectrum access, optimal sensing interval, which is used as output length of\
    \ LSTM\nfor each channel is computed for each channel individually makes implementation\
    \ complex in real-time\ndue to random nature of radio spectrum. Authors in [20]\
    \ proposed a hybrid approach combining Bayesian\nand Exponential Weighted Moving\
    \ Average (EWMA) approaches for spectrum hole prediction, which is\nbased on the\
    \ classical approach. In [21], the authors conduct a detailed survey of spectrum\
    \ prediction in a\ncognitive radio network. There are few software-deﬁned radio-based\
    \ works for spectrum sharing [22–25].\nCNN architecture has been used recently\
    \ to solve object detection, identiﬁcation and classiﬁcations\n[26,27]. But LSTM\
    \ is used to solve the time series problem, which is utilized in this work. There\
    \ are few\nspectrum prediction works [28,29]. A deep neural network called Residual\
    \ network and Channel and\nSpatial attention modules (RCS) with Gated Recurrent\
    \ Unit network(RCS-GRU) is presented [28] for\ndetecting occupancy correlation\
    \ of different frequency channels by the PU. It also predicts the spectrum\noccupancy\
    \ of the future next time slot. A Hybrid Spectrum Access with Spectrum Prediction\
    \ and\nCooperation (HSA-SPC) is proposed [29] with spectrum prediction to improve\
    \ the throughput of\nCognitive users. The multiuser environment is considered\
    \ and closed-form expression for the throughputs\nderived. But there is no substantial\
    \ work on using spectrum prediction results to allow access to the\nspectrum based\
    \ on real-world data.\nContribution: We develop a framework, namely Positive Prediction\
    \ and Sensing Based Spectrum\nAccess (PPSBSA), by employing Encoder-Decoder LSTM\
    \ to predict for two-time slots simultaneously\nand use the prediction result\
    \ to help Secondary User (SU) achieve lower waiting time and hence higher\ncapacity.\n\
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2, the system\
    \ model describes the model\nas a physical entity that discusses the construction\
    \ of the data set, the frame structure for secondary users.\nSection 3 consists\
    \ of the proposed Positive Prediction and sensing-based spectrum access (PPSBSA)\n\
    framework. Section 4 discusses LSTM in a quite elaborate manner. Section 5 lists\
    \ the parameters used in\nthe evaluation. Finally, Section 6 has experimental\
    \ results in the form of graphs and tables, followed by a\nconclusion in Section\
    \ 7.\n2806\nIASC, 2023, vol.35, no.3\n2 System Model\nThe architecture consists\
    \ of a Secondary user transmitter node (SU-T), which acts as a device in a\ncognitive\
    \ radio network (CRN) based cellular network where devices work as the secondary\
    \ user (SU). In\ncontrast, cellular-based users are the primary user (PU). SU-T\
    \ can convey information with multiple\ndevices (SU-R1, SU-R2, SU-R3, and SU-R4).\
    \ Two support nodes, transmit node one and send node two,\nare assigned to SU-T\
    \ to help in the transmission of SU-T. In this work, the prediction of the spectrum\n\
    state is carried out for two-time slots; therefore, each node TN-1 and TN-2 will\
    \ transmit information to\ntwo receiver nodes. For example, TN-1 will transmit\
    \ to SU-R1 and SU-R2, whereas TN-2 will transmit\nto SU-R3 and SU-R4.\nIt is assumed\
    \ that SU-T distributes information to both nodes before its transmission to receiver\
    \ nodes\nvia some wired network. Both the nodes are allocated N numbers of spectrum\
    \ points, which are distinct to\navoid interference. Both nodes transmit in a\
    \ parallel fashion such that at (t + 1),the slot TN-1 transmit to SU-\nR1, TN-2\
    \ transmits to SU-R3, while at (t + 2),the slot TN-1 transmits to SU-R2 and TN-2\
    \ transmits to SU-R4.\nReceiver nodes are aware of the spectrum points allocated\
    \ to nodes through some information exchange.\nSpectrum prediction is to predict\
    \ the spectrum state in the next slot by mining the internal relationship of\n\
    historical spectrum data. That is given spectrum measurement data (in terms of\
    \ PSD) for current time slot t\nand previous time slots, Xt-4, Xt-3, Xt-2, Xt-1,\
    \ Xt is fed as input to Encoder-Decoder LSTM network which\nhas been trained to\
    \ discover the internal relationship. Then the output of Encoder-Decoder LSTM\
    \ is the\nprediction of PSD values for t + 1 and t + 2 slots. The Fig below shows\
    \ dataset construction for a single\nspectrum point.\nFrom Fig. 2, for each spectrum\
    \ point, both nodes are trained on 100 s of such input sequences (Ii) and\ncorresponding\
    \ label (Oi), where i = 1, 2, 3,…K, where K is a total number of sequences that\
    \ are fed to\nEncoder-Decoder LSTM to train and discover internal relationship\
    \ so that the network predicts the\nspectrum state for next two slots when fed\
    \ with any unseen sequence Iu where u ∉ K. Data set for each\nspectrum point for\
    \ which prediction is carried out is shufﬂed in advance and thereby divided into\
    \ training\nset and test placed to avoid sample distribution imbalance. Similarly,\
    \ both nodes are trained for all\ndistinct N spectrum points allocated to them.\n\
    Figure 1: Architecture of proposed framework\nIASC, 2023, vol.35, no.3\n2807\n\
    As shown in Fig. 1, the nodes have a single antenna such that it ﬁrst predicts\
    \ allocated spectrum points\nthen senses only that spectrum point, which is predicted\
    \ to be free (Positive), not for busy/occupied\n(Negative). At (t + 1),the slot\
    \ data is transmitted by TN-1 and TN-2 to SU-R1 and SU-R3, respectively.\nFor\
    \ a particular scenario, let the status of spectrum points as predicted and sensed\
    \ during 1st slot be given\nby Tab. 1.\nFrame structure corresponding to Tab.\
    \ 1 is given as shown below\nIn Tab. 1, SP 1.1682.4 denotes 1st time slot 1682.4\
    \ MHz spectral point. In general, SP i,k denotes ith time\nslot on k MHz spectrum\
    \ point. Fig. 3 Shows the frame structure of transmission for the scenario given\
    \ in\nTab. 1, where two transmission slots are not utilized for data transmissions\
    \ because, as for Tab. 1,\nprediction and sensing do not give positive results.\
    \ But the third spectral point in Tab. 1 provides both\nsensing and prediction\
    \ positive results. So that is utilized for data transmission.\nFigure 2: Dataset\
    \ construction for single spectrum point\nTable 1: Status of spectrum points during\
    \ 1st slot as predicted and sensed by TN-1 or TN-2\nSpectrum point (SP)\nPrediction\

    \ scenario given the Tab. 1\n2808\nIASC, 2023, vol.35, no.3\nFrom Tab. 1, we can\
    \ observe that sensing is carried out for 1682.4 SP as the prediction is Positive.\n\
    However, sensing is Negative; therefore, it moves ahead and senses 1688.6 MHz\
    \ SP. Since the forecast\nfor 1686.2 MHz is negative, both prediction and sensing\
    \ for 1688.6 MHz SP are Positive. Nodes perform\nprediction of SPs in chronological\
    \ order as allocated to them; sensing is only shown if the forecast is\nPositive\
    \ for the same. Nodes use the energy detection method to sense the spectrum where\
    \ PSD is\ncompared with the threshold to decide whether PU is present. In Tab.\
    \ 1, only the status of some spectrum\npoints is shown for the representation\
    \ purpose of the PPSBT framework and is not the actual number of\nspectrum points\
    \ allocated to nodes.\nSimilarly, at (t + 2),the slot data is transmitted by TN-1\
    \ and TN-2 to SU-R2 and SU-R4, respectively.\nConsidering a particular scenario,\
    \ let the status of spectrum points as given by the PPSBSA framework\nduring 2nd\
    \ slot be provided, as shown below.\nFrame structure corresponding to Tab. 2 is\
    \ given by, as shown below:\nFrom Tab. 2, 1686.2 MHz spectral points provide a\
    \ positive result for prediction as well as sensing, so\nimmediately, the spectral\
    \ point of the second frequency is used for data transmission, as shown in the\
    \ frame\nstructure in Fig. 4.\nHere since the prediction for 1682.4 MHz, SP is\
    \ negative; hence directly, 1686.2 MHz SP is sensed and\nfound to be positive.\n\
    3 Positive Prediction and Sensing Based Spectrum Access (PPSBSA) Framework\nFramework,\
    \ as described above in Fig. 5, uses spectrum prediction results for transmission.\
    \ For\nsimulation, spectrum prediction is performed on a testing sequence (I)\
    \ that is not part of the training set.\nThe input sequence (l) and the corresponding\
    \ label (O) used for the prediction can be visualized as a real-\ntime sequence.\
    \ When fed to the LSTM network trained with the training set, the testing sequence\
    \ I\nproduce a forecast for two slots ahead O’. In real-time, spectrum sensing\
    \ is performed to determine\nwhether the prediction is correct or not; however,\
    \ in simulation, we compare O’ with O to determine\nwhether the prediction was\
    \ accurate, where O is regarded as a sensed value.\nTable 2: Status of spectrum\

    \ the training set [Ii->Oi] is fed to train the Encoder-\nDecoder LSTM network\
    \ so that model is built\nH ¼ T½Ii ! Oi\x02; i ¼ 1; 2; 3; . . . K:\n(1)\nHere\
    \ T designates the training of the LSTM network with a total K sequence, and H\
    \ is the Encoder-\nDecoder LSTM network, which has been trained to discover internal\
    \ relationships and predict the\nspectrum state for the next two slots. During\
    \ step-2 the testing sequence I is fed to the trained Encoder-\nDecoder LSTM network\
    \ designated by H, which results in prediction values for two slots ahead given\
    \ by\nO0\nt ¼ H½I\x02; t ¼ 1; 2:\n(2)\nFinally, in step-3, the label corresponding\
    \ to the testing sequence (I), It is compared with the prediction\nresult Ot\n\
    ’. Moreover, t = 1, 2, is used to represent spectrum prediction for 1st and 2nd\
    \ slot. Based on the above,\nthere can be four cases.\nTab. 3 shows the possible\
    \ outcome after the LSTM network outcome in comparison with the actual\nspectrum\
    \ state Qt. If the predicted outcome O, t and actual outcome Qt is less than the\

    \ is greater than the threshold the\ncorresponding net outcome is declared as\
    \ negative “N”.\n4 LSTM Network for Spectrum Prediction\nA recurrent neural network\
    \ (RNN) is validated to solve time series problems. However, they fail to\nhandle\
    \ ‘long term dependencies,’ this problem was explored in detail by Hochreiter\
    \ (1991) and Bengio\net al. (1994). In 1997, Hochreiter & Schmidhuber introduced\
    \ long short term memory (LSTM), a special\nTable 3: Possible cases for predicted\

    \ key to LSTM is the cell state with\ninformation being added or removed from\
    \ the cell state through three gates, namely the input gate, forget\ngate, and\
    \ output gate.\nThe ﬁrst gate that we refer to is forgotten; it decides what information\
    \ will be discarded from the cell\nstate. The sigmoid layer determines by outputting\
    \ a number between 0 and 1. 1 means to retain the\ninformation entirely and 0\
    \ means to get off the information.\nft ¼ rðWf\nx : xt þ W f\ns : st\x031 þ bf\

    \ Architecture\nIn this work, encoder-decoder, LSTM, is used since the forecasting\
    \ of spectrum state is carried out for\ntwo-time steps into the future. Encoder-Decoder\
    \ LSTM as shown in Fig. 7 was developed for natural\nlanguage processing, particularly\
    \ in areas of text translation, where it has proven to be excellent.\nThe Encoder\
    \ layer consists of LSTM memory cells (as shown in Fig. 6) which takes PSD values\
    \ as\ninput; the cell state and hidden state of the last memory cell (M is the\
    \ total LSTM memory cells) in the\nencoder are fed as the initial cell state and\
    \ hidden state respectively to the ﬁrst memory cell in the\ndecoder LSTM network.\
    \ Each LSTM memory cell produces an output that is fed as input to the next\n\
    LSTM sequentially since the regression-based prediction is used; hence dense layer\
    \ is used in the\noutput layer.\nFigure 6: Structure of an LSTM cell memory\n\
    IASC, 2023, vol.35, no.3\n2811\n5 Evaluation Metrics\nHere in this section, different\
    \ metrics/parameters related to the experimental evaluation are discussed.\n5.1\
    \ Waiting Time\nWaiting time (WT) is deﬁned as the time elapsed between the beginning\
    \ of the timeslot and actual data\ntransmission. Mathematically waiting time for\
    \ 1st timeslot is given as follows:\nWTð1Þ ¼ Tp þ\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTs;i½SP1;i ¼ P\x02\
    \n(9)\nFor second slot WT is given by\nWTð1Þ ¼ Tp þ\nX\nN\ni¼1\nTs;i½SP2;i ¼ P\x02\
    \n(10)\nEqs. (9) and (10) are identical except single literal, which make waiting\
    \ time for either 1st or 2nd-time\nslot. Here i is the speciﬁc spectrum point\
    \ in chronological order as allocated to nodes. For example, from\nTab. 1, for\
    \ 1682.4 MHz, i is 1, and for 1686.2 MHz, i is two and so on. TP is the time required\
    \ to predict\nthe status of N spectrum points in a parallel manner. Ts,i Is sensing\
    \ time of the ith spectrum point and is\nequal to Ts when the prediction is positive\
    \ (condition inside square bracket) else it’s 0. Waiting time\ndepends on the\
    \ real-time availability of the radio spectrum. That is only if both prediction\
    \ and sensing are\npositive only then the user can access the given time slot;\
    \ however, if the forecast is favorable and\nsensing is negative, it will lead\
    \ to increased waiting time and reduced C and hence termed a false\nprediction\
    \ (FP).\nIf FP = j, it means j number of times (j < N) the prediction was found\
    \ to be positive while sensing was\nnegative, and node access the spectrum by\
    \ (j + 1)the time. Based on this, the generic formulae for waiting time\nis given\
    \ as:\nWT ¼ Tp þ Tsðj þ 1Þ\n(11)\nFigure 7: Encoder-Decoder LSTM architecture\n\
    2812\nIASC, 2023, vol.35, no.3\nFrom Eq. (11), it is evident that the time wasted\
    \ for unnecessarily spectrum sensing is,\nW ¼ Tsj\n(12)\n5.2 Classiﬁcation Accuracy\n\
    To evaluate the classiﬁcation accuracy, the PSD values are converted into binary\
    \ values. This conversion\ntakes place according to threshold levels if PSD values\
    \ are greater than threshold values, then the\ncorresponding PSD value is set\
    \ as 1 (indicating the presence of the primary user) else 0.\nCA ¼ 1\nN\nX\nN\n\
    t¼1\nðBtÞ\n(13)\nwhere Bt = 1, when the predicted channel state and real channel\
    \ state are the same (occupied or idle), else it is\n0.\n5.3 Capacity\nCombining\
    \ Eqs. (9), (10). Capacity is given as\nCAPACITY ðCÞ ¼ ðT \x03 WTÞ\nT\nlog2ð1\
    \ þ SNRÞ\n(14)\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio(SNR) is used to calculate the capacity.\n\
    6 Experimental Setup and Performance Analysis\nSpectrum data from the RWTH Aachen\
    \ University spectrum data measurement campaign [22] is used.\nCorrectly, the\
    \ band 1876–1886 MHz is used. The 10 MHz bands are intentionally selected since\
    \ it consists of\nspectrum points with different and unique occupational status\
    \ to emulate real-world scenarios.\nThe resolution bandwidth is set to 200 KHz.\
    \ 3-fold cross-validation for the 1st and 2nd-time slot for each\nspectrum point\
    \ is computed. The mean accuracy for the 1st and 2nd slot is shown in Fig. 8 and\
    \ Fig. 9\nrespectively.\nFigure 8: Mean accuracy for (t + 1) th slot\nIASC, 2023,\
    \ vol.35, no.3\n2813\nThe entire spectrums are grouped into ﬁve groups. In each\
    \ group, 5 spectral points are considered.\nAny transmitting node will be allocated\
    \ one spectrum point group on which the node may employ\nsensing and prediction\
    \ for data transmission.\nIt is quite evident that in both cases, the mean accuracy\
    \ of each SP is quite similar. The mean of ‘mean\naccuracy’ for 1st and 2nd-time\
    \ slots are 0.9177 and 0.9167, respectively. Each node (TN-1 and TN-2) is\nallocated\
    \ a particular Spectrum Point Group (SPG), which consists of 5 spectrum points.\
    \ In Tab. 4, in\neach group, ﬁve spectrum points are shown in proper chronological\
    \ order in terms of the order in which\nnodes access them.\nAs explained earlier,\
    \ spectrum points with different occupational patterns are considered to study\
    \ their\nimpact on waiting time. In the radio spectrum, the status of occupancy\
    \ of spectrum points at a given time in\nany band is dynamic. However, the occupancy\
    \ does depend on the historical occupational status to a large\nextent. Therefore,\
    \ the probability statistics of each spectrum point are essential to be computed.\n\
    Using Tab. 5 for each spectral point, the probability of occupancy and ideal can\
    \ be interpreted. Using\nthose probabilities, the transmitting node may check\
    \ the spectral point for use, which selects the spectrum\nwhich has the highest\
    \ probability of idle and lowest probability of occupancy. This probability-based\n\
    checking reduces the time for the selection of transmission frequency and improves\
    \ performance.\nFigure 9: Mean accuracy for (t + 2) th slot\nTable 4: Spectrum\

    \ no.3\nFrom the above Tab. 8, it is very evident that the proposed PPSBSA has\
    \ a waiting time lower energy\ndetection based on Conventional Sensing. Authors\
    \ in [5] considered energy detection-based spectrum\nsensing since it is efﬁcient\
    \ and faster than many spectrum sensing and therefore been considered to\ncompare\
    \ with the proposed framework. On average, the waiting time is lesser for the\
    \ PPSBSA framework\nby 0.1134 msec for 1st slot and by 2.887 msec for 2nd slot.\n\
    Speciﬁcally, when nodes are allocated those spectrum points which have a higher\
    \ probability of being\noccupied, the proposed PPSBSA framework is quite better\
    \ when to compared with conventional sensing, as\nevident from Tabs 6 and 7 (Looking\
    \ at spectrum point groups of 4 and 5). Therefore, this framework will be\nbeneﬁcial\
    \ for D2D, M2 M communication, wherein devices and machines are part of a secondary\
    \ network\nthat uses the spectrum of the primary user network (cellular network)\
    \ where more spectrum is occupied for\nthe most amount of time. Based on Tab.\
    \ 8, the achievable capacity was calculated.\n7 Conclusion\nOwing to new diverse\
    \ applications (like M2 M, V2Vcommunications) in next-generation wireless\nnetworks,\
    \ the availability of spectrum is slated to be scary since a large part of the\
    \ available spectrum\nwill be reserved for the cellular network-based user (primary\
    \ user). This work proposes Positive\nPrediction and Sensing Based Spectrum Access\
    \ (PPSBSA) to predict the Radio Spectrum State (RSS) for\ntwo-time slots, thereby\
    \ reducing the time required for sensing the spectrum. Results show nodes\nemploying\
    \ the proposed framework achieve lesser waiting time, especially when the spectrum\
    \ point has a\nhigher chance of being occupied, the margin is even higher. Therefore,\
    \ this proposed framework is\nsuitable for next-generation wireless networks wherein\
    \ diverse IoT applications can satisfy their need for\nspectrum. In future research\
    \ can be carried out on training LSTM, correlation of speciﬁc time, and\noccupancy.\n\

    are expected to support extremely high data rates and radically new applications,
    which require a new wireless radio technology paradigm. The challenge is that
    of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive learning and decision making, so
    that the diverse requirements of next-generation wireless networks can be satisfied.
    Machine learning is one of the most promising artificial intelligence tools, conceived
    to support smart radio terminals. Future smart 5G mobile terminals are expected
    to autonomously access the most meritorious spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated
    spectral efficiency learning and inference, in order to control the transmission
    power, while relying on energy efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously
    adjusting the transmission protocols with the aid of quality of service learning/inference.
    Hence we briefly review the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose
    their employment in the compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive
    radios, massive MIMOs, femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid,
    energy harvesting, device-todevice communications, and so on. Our goal is to assist
    the readers in refining the motivation, problem formulation, and methodology of
    powerful machine learning algorithms in the context of future networks in order
    to tap into hitherto unexplored applications and services. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Radical and sometime even un-orthodox next-generation
    networking concepts have received substantial attention both in the academic as
    well as industrial communities. One of their driving forces is that of providing
    unprecedented data rates for supporting radical new applications. Specifically,
    next-generation networks are expected to learn the diverse and colorful characteristics
    of both the users'' ambience as well as human behavior, in order to autonomously
    determine the optimal system configurations. These smart mobile terminals have
    to rely on sophisticated learning and decision-making. Machine learning, as one
    of the most powerful artificial intelligence tools, constitutes a promising solution
    [1]. As shown in Fig. 1, we may envision an intelligent radio that is capable
    of autonomously accessing the available spectrum with the aid of learning, altruistically
    controlling transmission power for the sake of conserving energy as well as adjusting
    the transmission protocols. Figure 1 Intelligent radio learning paradigm Sign

    SHARE Abstract The convenience of availing quality services at affordable costs
    anytime and anywhere makes mobile technology very popular among users. Due to
    this popularity, there has been a huge rise in mobile data volume, applications,
    types of services, and number of customers. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic,
    the worldwide lockdown has added fuel to this increase as most of our professional
    and commercial activities are being done online from home. This massive increase
    in demand for multi-class services has posed numerous challenges to wireless network
    frameworks. The services offered through wireless networks are required to support
    this huge volume of data and multiple types of traffic, such as real-time live
    streaming of videos, audios, text, images etc., at a very high bit rate with a
    negligible delay in transmission and permissible vehicular speed of the customers.
    Next-generation wireless networks (NGWNs, i.e. 5G networks and beyond) are being
    developed to accommodate the service qualities mentioned above and many more.
    However, achieving all the desired service qualities to be incorporated into the
    design of the 5G network infrastructure imposes large challenges for designers
    and engineers. It requires the analysis of a huge volume of network data (structured
    and unstructured) received or collected from heterogeneous devices, applications,
    services, and customers and the effective and dynamic management of network parameters
    based on this analysis in real time. In the ever-increasing network heterogeneity
    and complexity, machine learning (ML) techniques may become an efficient tool
    for effectively managing these issues. In recent days, the progress of artificial
    intelligence and ML techniques has grown interest in their application in the
    networking domain. This study discusses current wireless network research, brief
    discussions on ML methods that can be effectively applied to the wireless networking
    domain, some tools available to support and customise efficient mobile system
    design, and some unresolved issues for future research directions. 1 INTRODUCTION
    Currently, mobile phones and devices have become parts and parcels of our daily
    life. Our professional and commercial activities are mostly done by availing the
    online network services provided through mobile applications. Because of the enhancement
    of technologies, the number of mobile devices connected to the Internet, the number
    of services available through networks, the bit rate of data transfer, and the
    speed of connected mobile devices have increased by many fold. All these improvements
    have enhanced the comfort and convenience of mobile customers for availing network
    services, which in turn has sparked a large increase in data volume in mobile
    networks. 5G wireless networks (Figure 1) [2] are expected to support 10× more
    users and 1K times more traffic than 4G technology [3]. The worldwide COVID-19
    pandemic [4] enforced most of our activities through an online virtual mode, hence
    adding a huge extra volume of wireless traffic data to the network systems. It
    is necessary to understand the real wireless network (5G) traffic data characteristics
    through the analysis of operational datasets for upgrading the Quality of Services
    (QoS) [5] for the users. The methods of network resource management [6] must be
    improved in 5G networks by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    [7] to cope with customer demand, satisfaction, mobility speed etc. Otherwise,
    dealing with this massive volume of data with various dimensions and granularity
    will be difficult and inefficient [8]. The success of machine learning (ML) applications
    in allied areas of computer science, such as image processing [9] and natural
    language processing (NLP) [10, 11], has grown keen interest among network researchers
    about the applications of ML to intelligently optimise network resources in the
    next-generation wireless network (NGWN) [12, 13]. Data generated in mobile networks
    are from diverse device models in multiple formats and applications, and hence
    they are heterogeneous and complex [14]. Therefore, extracting desired facts from
    the huge volume of mobile data and establishing the statistical relationships
    among different network events are expected to become somewhat convenient with
    the help of AI/ML techniques [15]. Large heterogeneous structured/unstructured
    data (i.e. Big Data) can be effectively dealt with in the application of Deep
    learning (DL) (subset of ML) tools to address network management/control issues
    on a real-time basis (per millisecond or less) and with a high rate of accuracy
    [16]. Deep learning research is gaining momentum in next generation 5G wireless
    network systems yet not much progress has been reported in this field. Research
    outcomes are distributed in diverse areas of the wireless domain. This work presents
    a complete discussion of research progress in the overlapping fields of the NGWN
    and ML, emphasising DL. We have also presented brief notes and references related
    to different ML approaches and the necessity of choosing/customising a suitable
    learning framework to resolve wireless network issues for the best possible results.
    We have concluded this study by identifying the unresolved issues in this domain
    that are to be resolved by future researchers. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint 5G network architecture [1] 2 AI, MACHINE LEARNING AND 5G WIRELESS
    NETWORKS Self-organising networks were introduced in third generation partnership
    project (3GPP) Release 8 to improve the efficiency of operations and management
    as well as to reduce the operational costs of 4G and next-generation wireless
    technologies [Figure 1] by incorporating intelligence and dynamic adaptability
    into the systems [17]. Human interaction in network operation management should
    be reduced to a minimum level to incorporate dynamic adaptability. In the early
    days, methods such as genetic algorithms, Markov models, and fuzzy logic were
    adopted to bring intelligence into the systems. However, these arrangements could
    not reduce human involvement and hence could not be effective for present network
    systems. Innovations in AI and ML techniques [18] and their induction into wireless
    network management have come to the rescue of operators for dealing with a huge
    volume of heterogeneous traffic data. Machine learning techniques, especially
    DL methods [19], have achieved remarkable success in areas such as NLP and image
    processing [11, 14, 15]. Within a short period, DL is becoming one of the most
    popular emerging technologies to manage big data [12] from diverse, complex data
    sources. The faster enhancement of ML techniques has been possible due to rapid
    hardware growth in graphical processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units
    (TPUs) and the proliferation of open-source software tools by AI forums. Several
    features are included in 5G wireless systems to meet future requirements and enhance
    performance [20, 21]. An exclusive survey of 5G wireless networks and a new architecture
    for interfacing IoT and cloud computing were presented by Gupta et al. [22]. Excellent
    literature surveys are described in Ref. [7, 23] on earlier wireless network architectures,
    emerging 5G systems, and potential research issues. Imparting intelligence is
    essential in wireless network management and control. The limited progress in
    this area has been surveyed in several studies [24-28]. The potential of AI, ML,
    and their applications in addressing 5G wireless network issues have also been
    discussed and reported by the authors in Ref. [12, 27, 28]. The application of
    AI and ML techniques is imperative for extracting effective information efficiently
    from big data, and 5G network traffic data is a perfect candidate for this application
    [29, 30]. The performance and efficiency of the ML techniques are further improved
    by refining the learning process through DL. Deep learning is ideal for dealing
    with the huge heterogeneous volume of traffic data administered through 5G wireless
    networks. The principles of DL are gaining momentum to manage the massive heterogeneous
    data volume irrespective of the field of studies, and the field of wireless networks
    can be no exception [31-36]. Schmidhuber [37] presented a complete report on DL
    covering almost all the subject areas. The authors in Ref. [32, 34, 38] summarised
    the fundamental concept of DL models, their applications, and research applicabilities
    in some areas. A complete handbook on DL covering basic theories and their applications
    is written by Goodfello et al. [39]. Zheng et al. [12] and Alsheikh et al. [14]
    applied the principles of DL for proposing 5G frameworks for optimisation and
    performance enhancement. Fadlullah et al. highlighted the enhancement of DL methods
    and their scope of applications to wireless network research [18]. Zhong and his
    team applied DL to address network security issues and the associated research
    areas [40]. The applicability and suitability of DL have been studied in the fields
    of sensor networks, IoT, multimedia, and mobile wireless networks by different
    researchers [19, 41, 42]. All of the work discussed here focussed on DL applications
    for resolving specific issues in wireless networks but not on 5G wireless network
    issues. We have summarised the earlier studies in Table 1. This study is dedicated
    to discussing the issues of machine/DL for developing intelligent NGWNs. Machine
    learning, applications, and customisation will be briefly noted to resolve issues
    specific to 5G wireless networks. This work bridges the gap in research progress
    in the overlapping zone of machine/DL and 5G wireless systems. We think this will
    be unique and provide insight into 5G wireless network issues from a machine/DL
    perspective. TABLE 1. Summary of books, papers and surveys dealing with cellular

    OF MACHINE LEARNING (ML) The ML architecture used in wireless network analysis
    is mentioned and briefly discussed in this paper. Machine learning techniques
    are broadly categorised as supervised, semisupervised and unsupervised based on
    the learning process. The availability of data and the target goals determine
    the type of algorithm to be applied. When a goal is to be achieved with the help
    of ML, we have to realise the kind of data we can provide to the learning process
    and the volume of data we can supply for training to reach our goal. It is understood
    that different ML algorithms can be applied to target achieving different goals
    in wireless networks. To extract the required information, the choice of data,
    its volume, and its granularity are important. To avoid an unnecessary volume
    of text on an already popular subject, only brief notes on the topic''s context
    are provided here. Readers are requested to refer to Ref. [13, 15, 60] for further
    reading. 3.1 Supervised learning Labelled datasets (e.g. HTTP, FTP, TCP, spam
    etc.) are used to train the algorithms by examples in supervised learning. In
    this approach, a trainer trains the system to predict the output based on given
    inputs. It is the method of training through which a mathematical function converts
    an input dataset into output set as . The background of the function is an algorithm
    that predicts the value of on a given dataset. During training, the algorithm
    will try to match a specific label in the input data and map it with the output,
    and afterwards, the same mapping is performed on the new dataset. The prediction
    of the value of is done iteratively on the input dataset, and the iteration stops
    when an acceptable value of is achieved. Supervised learning is subdivided into
    classification and regression. The application and selection of a process depend
    on the goal and the available input dataset. For example, in the case of wireless
    networks, the classification method can be used to classify traffic on real-time
    traffic data [13, 15, 60]. 3.2 Unsupervised learning In this method, only input
    datasets are put into analysis for learning; no predefined algorithm is given.
    Through the statistical inference of the input data, the inherent structure or
    pattern of the data is learnt, the algorithm or correlation is established, and
    the output is derived accordingly. Here, the algorithm learns by itself from the
    input dataset. Clustering is one of the most commonly used methods for unsupervised
    learning. This method can be applied to study the behavioural patterns of mobile
    users, the mobility of devices, the distribution of services used, the sessional
    characteristics of the traffic etc., in 5G network systems [12, 13, 15, 39]. 3.3
    Semi-supervised learning Labelling training data for real-world applications is
    difficult, expensive, and time consuming in classical supervised learning since
    it involves the work of human annotators with domain expertise and training [61].
    Semi-supervised learning circumvents this fundamental limitation by enabling the
    model to train itself partially using a small collection of labelled data. It
    then utilises this trained section to identify and label the remainder of the
    unlabelled dataset. Numerous semi-supervised classification and clustering techniques
    are available in the literature [60, 62]. This process is suitable for a large
    input dataset where only a part of the data is labelled. This method can also
    be used to look at network data to find and classify security threats, intrusions,
    and other problems. 3.4 Deep learning The efficiency enhancement of ML appears
    in the form of DL [37]. It helps make decisions based on the input dataset by
    inferring an algorithm and continuously refining it until an acceptable degree
    of accuracy is achieved. Their interrelationship is presented in Figure 2. The
    core of DL principles is based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) [63]. The
    artificial neural network simulates the complex nature of the human brain and
    its learning process, imitating the biological cell concept of a neuron. The most
    fundamental operation is considered the primitive building block called a node
    or neuron. A collection of such neurons (nodes) constitutes a layer, and many
    such layers can be grouped to form the desired neural network [64]. Each layer
    may be considered a processing unit, and they are non-linear. In DL, the objective
    or goal is pursued from the input dataset through hierarchical interactions of
    these layers [39]. Text processing, image processing, social networking, medical
    diagnostics, and cybersecurity are domains where DL is actively used in predictions
    and decision making. With the help of DL, the involvement of human experts can
    be avoided. It can reach to decision or prediction by automatically extracting
    information from input data, self-learning, upgrading, and refining its learning
    with the availability of new datasets. The learning is carried out by gradient
    descent methods following backpropagation [63]. This is why DL is a promising
    technology for application in NGWNs and a potential research paradigm for designing
    intelligent NGWNs. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Relationship of artificial
    intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), Deep learning (DL) and scope of application
    in wireless networking Since its invention approximately 80 years ago, the progress
    of this technology has been restricted due to the limited processing capacity
    of hardware [63, 65]. After developing powerful GPUs, DL is emerging as the core
    technology for effective machine intelligence in different applications [66].
    To avoid the undesired volume of text on this popular subject, the readers are
    referred to Ref. [19, 39, 42] for a detailed reading of DL. Our focus is only
    to bridge the research gaps connecting machine/DL and NGWN. 4 MERITS AND DEMERITS
    OF DEEP LEARNING APPLICATIONS IN 5G NETWORKS Why is DL important for NGWN research?
    NGWNs support a huge volume of complex, unstructured, heterogeneous, multi-class
    traffic data generated from heterogeneous devices, software, customers, communication
    technologies, and network infrastructures [22]. Therefore, it is required that
    data generated from network events, which occur in milliseconds, be studied for
    effective resource planning, control, and management, as well as efficient functioning
    of the network systems. Statistical learning techniques are not suitable to deal
    with such a volume of data. It also needs all data stored in the first level of
    the processing memory that is not technologically available in such capacity [67].
    It is also observed that simple ML outcomes do not improve dynamically with the
    growing volume of traffic data. In contrast, DL outcomes grow continuously and
    dynamically with the ever-growing volume of data. It also required only a fractional
    part of the data at the learning stage of different layers and hence less memory
    [39]. DL tools are capable of automatically retrieving characteristics from input
    datasets without any predefined algorithm. Instead, it infers the underlying algorithm
    from the input dataset and continually updates the algorithm itself with new data
    into the existing dataset. Thus, it minimises human involvement in the learning
    process to simple ML, where learning methods are mainly human-defined [45]. Furthermore,
    considering the amount, nature, complexity, format, granularity, and structure
    of 5G traffic data, DL has enormous potential for designing a 5G wireless network
    system capable of intelligently operating, managing, and controlling [23, 25].
    Simple ML methods work well if input data is labelled in enough volume. As a result,
    these methods are unsuitable for 5G systems because the majority of their data
    is unlabelled, unstructured, and heterogeneous. DL processes, on the other hand,
    are well suited to dealing with this type of data and have been used successfully
    in a variety of applications, as discussed in Ref. [68-74]. In an ANN, a comprehensive
    analysis of the representation model can be used to achieve different goals for
    different events, and no separate event-specific training is needed [75]. The
    same intelligence acquired by the Neural Network from a single training can be
    applied in different tasks for targeted goals. It''s important for a system such
    as 5G wireless networks to have a learning model that can handle a lot of different
    types of data [76]. A 5G wireless system permits connectivity to mobile devices
    at a permissible high speed. The system must effectively handle geometric locations,
    topological information, access point metrics etc. All these multi-component variables
    can be represented with the help of graphical structures that contain many geometrical
    attributes. DL frameworks, such as graph convolutional neural networks [77] and
    PointNet++ [78], can effectively represent these geometrical data. The use of
    these frameworks to analyse geometrical data from 5G networks has numerous applications
    [79]. Table 2 presents an overview of many benefits that may be gained by using
    deep learning applications. Despite a bagful of opportunities and lots of interest,
    the application of DL will have some disadvantages for 5G wireless networks. These
    limitations are as follows (Figures 3 and 4): Black box characteristics: These
    are probably the most feared demerits of DL. Sometimes, it becomes difficult to
    understand the basis of unrealistic predictions made by the neural networks when
    it is relatively easy to decide through common human perceptions. For example,
    if a cat image is given as an object to the neural networks for recognition and
    then identified as a dog, it becomes difficult to understand what makes the system
    predict the wrong thing. At the same time, it is very simple for a human to interpret.
    Because of this black box attribute, finance and credit institutions are not confident
    enough to fully implement DL in their system automation. Because bank customers
    will ask for an explanation for a decision taken against them, a decision without
    proper interpretation of the prediction or outcome may not work for a certain
    domain where interpretability has higher priority than the prediction. Scientists
    and experts are researching this aspect of DL to overcome the problem [56, 80,
    81]. Adversarial ML is also a matter of great concern. Adversarial methods use
    AI algorithms to fool the ML process, leading to incorrect predictions [82]. Any
    such modification in the learning algorithm is difficult to identify, and DL is
    no exception. A convolution neural network (CNN) is particularly vulnerable to
    such exposure, and intruders may exploit these flaws to compromise the network
    security of 5G systems [83]. Designing secured 5G wireless networks with DL applications
    is a challenge to future research in the domains of ML as well as NGWN systems.
    The DL process is resource hungry. The learning of CNNs requires high-performance
    processors (GPUs) and may take several days depending upon the complexity, structure,
    and volume of data. Although advancements in embedded system design have enabled
    the development of high-power processors (GPUs), individual mobile devices'' storage
    and power limitations are still a matter of concern [84]. Therefore, research
    must go on to resolve these issues. The efficiency and effectiveness of DL depend
    mainly on the high volume of data [85]. So, even though it''s advantageous for
    the 5G wireless network, it could be a problem for other applications where getting
    so much data takes a long time and costs a lot [86]. CNNs contain many layers,
    and several parameters need to be configured for each layer [77]. Furthermore,
    with the complexity of the learning objective, the number of variables increases
    exponentially [78]. Therefore, finding an optimum number of variables for an objective
    learning model is difficult and costly. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    An example of the black box issue in deep learning FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint An example of the adversarial effect in machine learning 5 APPLYING
    DEEP LEARNING IN 5G WIRELESS NETWORK DESIGN To overcome these limitations in DL,
    some developments have occurred in software and system design technologies [57,
    87, 88]. We will shed light on these developments in this study. 5G wireless networks
    have been proposed to enhance customers'' quality of experience (QoE) through
    high performance and very low communication delay [7]. Imparting intelligence
    into it to achieve this quality of service (QoS) is costly, as it will require
    a high-power processor such as GPU and sophisticated software to train the system.
    Many innovative tools, such as distributed ML, high-performance computing, exclusive
    DL libraries, and faster optimisation algorithms, are coming to implement DL in
    the 5G system [89]. These tools can be organised in a hierarchical manner such
    that 5G system issues become manageable through DL applications [78] (Figure 5).
    We have presented a brief overview of each of these tools here. FIGURE 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Areas of machine learning applications in the NGWN
    5.1 Distributed machine learning Heterogeneous mobile wireless data is accumulated
    from diverse mobile devices at multiple geographical locations. Gathering all
    this huge volume of data into a single DL training and application centre is not
    practically feasible. Therefore, designing an all-intelligent network system essentially
    demands the distributed processing of ML algorithms concurrently on devices equipped
    with diverse interfaces at different geometric locations [57]. This arrangement
    will ensure low cost, low latency, high performance, and high QoE. However, the
    following challenges must be addressed: Effective communication infrastructure
    among intra- and inter-regional active network components for fast exchange of
    information. A higher degree of robustness to handle active component failures
    in multiregional, substantially distributed network systems. Data consistency
    in different distributed learning systems at diverse locations and different network
    components must be ensured. High-performance software (OS, programing tools etc.)
    supports and manages system resources in an environment guaranteeing high degrees
    of parallelism by GPUs/TPUs. State-of-the-art storage systems can store massive
    volumes of data collected from different equipment supporting variable interfaces
    and connected with different technological paradigms. Researchers have already
    achieved some remarkable progress in these areas. For example, Gaia, a distributed
    ML tool developed by Hsieh et al. [90], achieved higher ML efficiency in WAN supporting
    multiple interfaces. Kraska and his team developed MLbase, which makes the implementation
    of ML processes possible, even by non-experts, across multiple platforms [91].
    Xiao et al. [92] administered a disseminated graph architecture, called TUX2,
    for data structure optimisation and the exchange of information across network
    devices. Xing and his team designed a ML platform to reduce communication overhead
    in variable synchronisation and data parallelism in dealing with big data [93],
    and Chilimbi et al. developed ‘ADAM 3’, a portable and scalable model customised
    in DL training that successfully achieved fault tolerance and low latency across
    equipment [94]. Another reinforcement learning-based dynamic model, ‘Ray’, was
    built by Moritz et al. [95] and reported a higher fault tolerance and scalability
    level. 5.2 High-performance computing Imparting machine intelligence in 5G wireless
    network systems through DL requires processing huge volumes of complex, unstructured,
    heterogeneous data involving large-scale matrix operations. Training CNN involves
    multi-layer interactions, a larger and varying number of variables with several
    gradient amounts, and processing at very high speed. CPU-based hardware cannot
    meet the required level of parallelism and cannot fully harness the advantages
    of DL tools for providing fast, efficient 5G systems. With the emergence of GPUs
    [84] embedded with thousands of cores, neural network training processes involving
    large-scale matrix operations can be performed efficiently with very low latency
    [96]. Further speed enhancement in hardware processors is reported through TPUs
    [97]. Another optical technology-based development, termed diffractive deep neural
    networks, was recently reported to enhance learning efficiency and reduce learning
    time [98]. There are studies such as reinforcement learning-based training to
    neural networks over a combination of hardware [99] and hashing-based learning
    [100] that have sped up the prediction efficiency up to a substantial level. All
    these tools are available and need not be developed afresh; hence, 5G system designers
    can think of implementing ML as cost effective and feasible. 5.3 Exclusive deep
    learning libraries Developing DL frameworks is a complex task for 5G network designers.
    It involves several sophisticated issues, such as forwarding characteristics,
    gradient propagation, interlayer communications, and parallel programing for GPUs.
    However, with the enhancement of ML research and subsequent emerging technologies,
    many exclusive DL libraries have been developed that abolish the necessity of
    coding for GPUs, defining forward and gradient characteristics. Some of these
    libraries are mentioned here to provide a ready reference to the researchers working
    in these domains. The most useful ML library currently is TensorFlow [101]. Google
    developed this open-source ML framework, and it is very popular among researchers
    working in the field of imparting intelligence into digital systems. It supports
    implementing ML in diverse platforms designed for working with big data applications.
    It contains a comprehensive, flexible set of tools, libraries, and resources to
    develop and distribute need-based flexible updated intelligent applications anywhere.
    Researchers can explore this platform to build models, train systems with a specific
    objective, and deploy them across machines to accelerate experimental outcomes.
    The tools, libraries, and resources available with TensorFlow are almost sufficient
    for experimenting with ML in any domain, including hardware, software, and commonly
    used programing languages [102]. Theano, the Python library that was popular before
    TensorFlow, permits analysts and developers to use multi-dimensional arrays for
    defining, evaluating, and optimising system functions through mathematical expressions
    [103]. It is built on top of NumPy. Theano can perform big data-driven processing
    on CPU- or GPU-based multi-programed environments and customise modules to suit
    individual machines or platforms. It has a strong community and user base. It
    has become less popular because it is hard to learn, develop, implement, and deploy
    ML, and there is not enough support for the different development environments
    (programing languages). CoreML is another ML framework used to build machine models
    in applications. It was developed by Apple [104]. DeepLearningKit is a powerful
    ML platform specifically designed for Apple''s iOS. Caffe2, developed by Berkeley
    in 2017, is a lightweight modular platform capable of ML training and deployment
    with scaling support for all major hardware, software, and mobile devices [105].
    Now, it is merged with PyTorch [106]. PyTorch is also free licenced software for
    developing fast ML models, prototypes, and systems [106]. It has a rich set of
    robust tools and libraries for building ML models in a wide range of platforms
    [107]. Recently, it has been merged with Caffe2 to enhance its scalability, functionality,
    and portability across platforms and machines. Tools such as TorchServe and Open
    Neural Network Exchange and the APIs they support a lot help with the distributed
    implementation of ML across platforms such as iOS, Android, Cloud, and C++. These
    tools and APIs help make it easier to do this. It is becoming increasingly popular.
    Mobile AI Compute Engine [108], Apache Spark [Apache Inc. USA] [14], MXNet, Chainer
    [Preferred Infrastructure Inc. Japan], mlpack [109] etc., are frameworks that
    provide powerful, flexible, and unified analytics tools for big data analysis
    and processing for ML under different environments, interfaces, complexities,
    and device diversities. Therefore, researchers may explore these to meet their
    requirements depending upon the ease of use, cost of customisation, and deployment
    of their specific application. Among all these ML frameworks, TensorFlow can be
    a good option for researchers because of its ease of use, robustness, power and
    flexibility, scalability, and portability of its tools across platforms. Table
    3 shows a comparison of some popular deep learning libraries. 5.4 Rapid optimisation
    algorithms Deep learning algorithms involve a very large count of the objective
    function and are complex. With the increase in learning model layers, the traditional
    stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms [110] converge slowly and are unsuitable
    for delay intolerant 5G wireless networks. Several fast algorithms are designed
    to enhance the efficiency of the learning process for applications in 5G systems.
    Here, we have mentioned some of these rapid optimisation algorithms to present
    the current research progress in this domain. Table 4 presents a comparative study
    of various deep learning algorithms. Fixed training rate SGD algorithms: a modified
    version of the SGD algorithm, Adagrad, proposed by Suskever et al. [111] to estimate
    the gradient based on present velocity and reported rapid convergence rate. The
    conventional Adagrad algorithm was upgraded by introducing an adaptive training
    approach for variable modelling according to the rate of updating of the variables
    [112]. This algorithm is robust and can handle sparse input data efficiently [113].
    Dean et al. used Adagrad for training large-scale neural networks in Google [113].
    RMSProp is another unpublished optimisation algorithm for training neural networks
    proposed by Tieleman et al. [114]. This algorithm adopts the Rprop algorithm and
    is capable of efficiently dealing with the radically diminishing learning rate.
    In this algorithm, the learning is adjusted as per the root mean squared value
    of the gradient average. Adam is the first-order optimisation SGD algorithm based
    on adaptive estimation of lower-order moments proposed by Kingma et al. [115].
    It is one of the popular optimisation algorithms being used by many researchers
    in the ML domain. By combining the algorithms Adam and NAG, a faster algorithm,
    called NADAM, was proposed that included the momentum into the optimiser and reported
    rapid convergence [116]. A complete set of optimisers can be seen in Ref. [117].
    The requirement for distributed intelligence processing has fuelled research into
    transferring ML to mobile devices, indicating a paradigm shift away from central
    processing [118]. A low-powered ML processor was developed by Bang et al. for
    imparting machine intelligence on mobile equipment [119]. International Business
    Machines corporation developed the TrueNorth chip to be used in process-rich,
    low-powered mobile devices [120]. An energy-efficient, powerful tiny processor,
    called Neural Network neXt, was introduced by Gokhale et al. for deploying DL
    on mobile devices [121]. In 2007, Intel Movidius developed a neural compute software
    development tool kit (NCSDK) for fast prototyping and deployment of DL in portable
    mobile devices. This SDK is tested on Google''s TensorFlow ML platform. Snapdragon
    is another mobile platform capable of imparting ML training and deployment on
    edge devices in a customised manner. In 2017, Hisilicon introduced Kirin 970,
    a powerful mobile platform containing dedicated neural processing units, more
    GPUs, and flexible interfaces for ML applications in multiple environments. A
    specialised DL platform, named DeepSense, was developed by Yao et al. to process
    mobile sensor data with a wide range of smartphone and mobile device applications
    [122]. The discussion of the above tools, techniques, hardware, and frameworks
    represents the progress in research on the intersection of the two domains—ML
    and NGWNs. Next, we will address the ML aspects in functional areas of NGWN. 6
    INTELLIGENT NEXT-GENERATION WIRELESS NETWORKS Considering the demand and the proposed
    QoS, imparting intelligence into the next generation of wireless networks is inevitable.
    Therefore, ML inspired a vast scope of applications in the NGWN (Figure 6). The
    popularity of mobile services and the emergence of technologies have compelled
    wireless service providers to develop their networks and service infrastructures
    (from cloud to terminal systems) to meet the data requirement of the users (Table
    5). FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Artificial intelligence/machine
    learning applications in the NGWN TABLE 2. Merits of deep learning applications

    and dramatically transforms and improves mobile data analysis and decision making
    Dynamic learning Processing huge data generated from dynamically changing devices,
    formats, locations, services, and networks Improves the efficiency and accuracy
    of the network system A huge volume of data is generated either from the cameras,
    sensors, and apps installed at the users'' terminal equipment or from the network
    infrastructures. Suitable analysis of these data may bring into light the user''s
    behaviour, movement, interest, services being used, time of engagement, data rate
    needed etc., in rural as well as urban scenarios [48]. Such analysis may pose
    research challenges in multiple domains associated with technology, manufacturing,
    business etc., such as network management, optimisation, efficiency improvement,
    control, users'' provisioning, social activities assessment, public service management
    (such as transportation and finance services), and many more [85, 123]. Machine
    learning, particularly DL, is certainly the most suitable tool to deal with such
    a huge volume of heterogeneous data effectively and efficiently. These wireless
    data can be broadly categorised as App data and Network data [124]. The App data
    are generally collected by different apps installed at the terminal devices. TABLE

    In contrast, Network data are gathered at different collection centres throughout
    the network system. Network data maintain call detail records (CDRs) and represent
    a comprehensive view of network throughput, latency, jitter, packet drop, mobility
    etc. Network data can be analysed for mobility management, QoS [5] enhancement,
    infrastructure, bandwidth planning, improving security, network management and
    diagnosis, traffic planning etc. [125]. App data are collected from heterogeneous
    devices through sensors, cameras, GPS, and video recorders installed in portable
    mobile devices [85]. Analysis of App data can reveal useful information about
    users'' identity, preference, personality, mobility that may be used in targeted
    marketing, product manufacturing, service design etc. However, while mining all
    these data, respecting users'' privacy remains a challenge, and ML methods can
    face these challenges [14]. Here, we will discuss some wireless network areas
    and some important research progress in these areas. 6.1 Network data analysis
    Network data broadly means the data recorded at the service provider''s interfaces,
    and these data are mostly unstructured and heterogeneous. Machine learning methods
    can be employed to analyse these traffic data for optimising network configuration,
    control, management, and enhancing QoS through traffic classification, CDR extraction,
    network state forecasting, and radio signal analysis. For example, Pierucci et
    al. applied Multilayer perceptron (MLPs) to forecast QoS in terms of user average
    data consumption, the number of ongoing calls within a geographical cell, throughput,
    and signal quality with a high accuracy level [126]. Gwon et al. applied a semi-supervised
    ML technique to classify packets and flows in Wi-Fi network traffic [127]. In
    contrast, Nie and his team applied ML techniques to forecast the data demand pattern
    in wireless mesh networks [128-130]. Stacked auto encoder (AE) base frameworks
    and long short term memory (LSTM)s are used to find the spatiotemporal correlations
    in wireless traffic data by Wang et al. [79]. The authors in Ref. [131, 132] applied
    CNN and LSTM methods to extract spatiotemporal attributes to predict network traffic
    with a higher level of accuracy than conventional methods. Wang and his team used
    graph neural networks to understand the geospatial characteristics of wireless
    mobile traffic data and discuss possible applications in social activity predictions
    [118]. Zhang et al. developed a dedicated CNN (CNN), called the zipper network,
    to carry out the proposed mobile traffic super resolution method to forecast network
    data demand with a significant level of performance enhancement over traditional
    approaches [125]. Wang [133] adapted a deep neural network-based AE approach to
    recognise TCP traffic data with very high accuracy. The authors in Ref. [133-136]
    successfully applied different ML techniques to classify network traffic data
    based on different traffic parameters. Each of the studies has reported achieving
    better accuracy. Deep learning techniques can be effective in addressing network
    security issues, CDR mining etc. For example, malware traffic was identified using
    DL in Ref. [136], whereas forecasting mobile density in the city was done by Liang
    et al. [137] applying DL to CDR data. Similarly, CDR data has been used to forecast
    visitors'' future places of visit [138] and predict users'' gender and age [139].
    All these studies have collectively acknowledged that wireless network issues
    can be addressed better using ML techniques than traditional approaches, but they
    remain a challenge. 6.2 App data processing and analysis The availability of portable,
    smart, handy mobile equipment, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), at an
    affordable cost has propelled the growth in the number of sensors and application
    software installed on mobile devices. This development has made it possible to
    accumulate a huge volume of app data, and the application of ML techniques to
    retrieve desired information from this dataset can help network operators, equipment
    manufacturers, design engineers, software developers, and end customers [140-142].
    In NGWNs, mobile users'' speed and bit rate have increased, the delay and jitter
    of communications have been reduced, and the change of activities is very frequent
    due to the availability of options. In this operational environment, the data
    generated are multistructured and very complex. Therefore, ML techniques are becoming
    a suitable alternative to conventional methods for extracting desired information
    from network datasets in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness [143].
    Terminal device-based and cloud-based analyses are the two most popular approaches
    for app data analysis. In cloud-based analysis, the end terminal devices collect
    and send data through wireless access points at regular intervals to the cloud
    server. The cloud server performs ML training and data analysis and then stores
    and distributes the results as per the requirements of the applications/users.
    However, due to the regular transmission of traffic information with the central
    system, the communication overhead increases, network performance degrades, fault
    recovery becomes difficult, and network robustness is reduced. On the other hand,
    in the terminal device-based approach, pretrained modules of the learning framework
    are preloaded on the terminal devices, making decisions as per local interactions
    and sending the data to the cloud [142]. The pre-trained modules in the terminal
    devices are updated by the cloud server as and when necessary. This approach reduces
    network overhead and limits the number of intelligent operations depending upon
    the computational power and energy consumption of the terminal devices. Researchers
    are applying terminal device-based ML approaches effectively in network design
    for NLP, speech processing, medical services, pattern recognition etc. 6.3 Applications
    in medical services The application of digital technologies and portable medical
    diagnostic devices through wireless networks is increasing rapidly in the medical
    service sector. Deploying ML in these devices has started to give more accurate
    results in monitoring blood pressure, blood sugar, heart rate, and analysing glucose,
    cholesterol, haemoglobin etc., in the blood [144]. Liu et al. applied the CNN
    to develop an Android-based system called UbiEar to aid patients suffering from
    hearing issues [145]. In contrast, Hosseini et al. [146] applied the CNN to the
    terminal device to localise the origin of the epileptogenic process in the human
    brain. Miotto et al. applied CNN and RNN methods to classify the environmental
    and behavioural aspects of individuals [147]. An Android-based app to deal with
    Parkinson''s symptoms was developed by Stamate et al. and achieved better efficiency
    than that achieved through traditional approaches [148]. We will see more research
    studies in this domain soon. 6.4 Applications in pattern recognition Many features
    are incorporated into terminal mobile devices to inspire the development of applications
    based on image analysis. Accordingly, many researchers [55, 149-156] have applied
    ML techniques to images received from cameras installed on mobile devices to develop
    intelligent systems exploring different aspects of pattern recognition, such as
    security, visual surveillance, virtual reality, and emotion detection. Tobias
    et al. conducted experiments on GPUs, CPUs, and mobile terminals to check the
    effectiveness of using CNNs for image recognition [157]. A mobile image recognition
    framework called DeepCham was developed by Li et al. to generate a cooperative
    training pipeline [151]. A DL-based human expression identification platform was
    developed in Ref. [154]. Rao et al. [153] applied DL methods for identifying and
    processing natural image objects in external environments with a high level of
    accuracy and efficiency. Motion and human activity processing is another area
    where ML can be applied for processing motion pictures in mobile devices and frameworks
    in 5G networks [155, 156]. Human activities are identified from the dataset collected
    from terminal device sensors using deep AE techniques by Almaslukh et al. [152].
    Li et al. applied DL to data collected directly from radio frequency identification
    for human motion identification and achieved high performance [158]. A high-performance
    human activity identification framework is developed by gathering data from different
    sensors and processing them by integrating the approaches of LSTM and CNN [87].
    Another high-accuracy multiple human gesture recognition framework was built by
    Wang et al. [159] using radio signals received by mm-wave radars. Zhao et al.
    developed a four-dimensional DL platform for the recognition of human poses [160].
    Image processing and NLP are the two main domains where ML is successfully applied
    with a high level of accuracy. Now, the same is used to impart intelligence for
    speech recognition in battery-powered terminals and mobile devices by Google [161]
    and Apple [162]. An energy and space-efficient automatic speech recognition (ASR)
    system for mobile terminal equipment was developed by Prabhavalkar and his team
    [163] using the reinforcement neural network approach. In contrast, the CNN approach
    is applied in mobile terminals with multiple microphones for developing ASR platforms
    [164]. Georiev et al. experimented with DL applications and optimisation for embedded
    audio sensing in smart mobile devices [76]. Lu et al. proposed a video processing
    architecture for image identification and related queries [165]. The application
    of CNNs in capturing an image by mobile devices can largely enhance the quality
    of the image taken [166]. The ML technique was applied by Fang et al. [167] to
    identify modes of human movement by extracting different attributes from the accumulated
    traffic data from mobile terminal devices equipped with diverse sensors. Lee et
    al. demonstrated that ML could limit alert messages in smartwatches [168]. From
    these reviews, it is clear that app data are complex and heterogeneous, and therefore
    special care must be taken to deploy this processing at the low-powered terminals
    and mobile devices. Researchers should put effort into developing faster, more
    efficient algorithms and less power-hungry devices. 6.5 Applications in mobility
    assessment Considering the proposed QoS in 5G network systems, mobility is an
    important attribute that needs to be handled effectively. Assessment of the mobility
    pattern is directly associated with network infrastructure planning, network resource
    management and control, city planning, roads, transport, and other public service
    provisions [160]. Machine learning has the potential to play a crucial role in
    this area [43]. Mobility assessment requires positional information, and DL methods
    can extract locational attributes from mobile traffic data [169]. Liu et al. applied
    a CNN architecture to train their framework with customers'' usage data for forecasting
    the user''s movement direction [43]. The authors in Ref. [170] proposed a DL architecture
    for forecasting a user''s movement path based on mobile terminal data. Their model
    exhibited better prediction accuracy than LSTM and stacked RNN. Collective mobility
    patterns are studied in Ref. [171, 172] to predict the movements of a group of
    people or crowds. Jiang et al. applied the RNN for city mobility prediction from
    actual data collected from operational networks and achieved better accuracy than
    the Markovian model [51]. Lin et al. applied the hidden Markov model to wireless
    CDR data for user route profile generation to support urban transport assessment
    [172]. Step by step, multi-level heterogeneous mobility patterns of customers
    are analysed by Feng et al. [173]. In contrast, Jiang et al. [174] developed a
    24-h RNN-based movement prediction model by extracting patterns from the raw dataset.
    MLP is used to forecast the individual moves from the historical data in ad hoc
    wireless networks [59]. GPS data and road accident data are combined by Chen et
    al. [52] to correlate human movement with a road accident and predict the probability
    of an accident. Finally, Song et al. used GPS records to forecast human mobility
    in a natural disaster by applying deep belief network (DBN) [175]. From the above
    studies, it is clear that an individual or group of users is random, chaotic,
    complex, and heterogeneous. Hence, the traditional methods for analysing these
    large mobility datasets are not convenient. On the other hand, ML and its applications
    have enough potential for easy and convenient use in this field. 6.6 Applications
    in localisation Many wireless services are being introduced through network systems
    (route tracking, object positioning, tourist information dissemination etc.) that
    need specific positioning systems [176], and several technologies have been developed
    through innovative research [177]. Processing of large spatial data can be performed
    efficiently through DL with a high accuracy level [178]. A channel state information-based
    indoor positioning system, called DeepFi, was developed by Wang et al. [179].
    The authors then enhanced their studies for calibrated state information with
    device-sensitive and device-free localisation [180, 181]. An indoor localisation
    predictor was developed in Ref. [182] by extracting features from Wi-Fi radio
    signals. Kumar et al. [183] applied a CNN to vehicle localisation in parking areas.
    Research on this issue has much potential for applications in aviation, transport,
    tracking, surveillance etc. 6.7 Applications in network control Deep learning
    is the emerging technology for the deployment of network control functions over
    conventional methods due to its high power of optimisation and achieving a high
    level of accuracy [44, 184]. In this approach, heterogeneous network data are
    analysed using ML techniques, which automatically train the framework to take
    appropriate action for network control. We will address the three primary functional
    areas of network control: network optimisation, resource allocation, and routing.
    Network optimisation This is the area of dynamic management of network resources
    and behaviours for attaining targeted network performance. Several researchers
    have successfully employed DL in this domain. For example, Subramanian et al.
    developed a device health prediction model in M2M communications to optimise device
    health-based policy decisions [58]. Liu et al. applied DL in wireless networks
    to optimise energy consumption and link usage based on the predicted correlations
    between link use and flow demand [185]. The authors in Ref. [186, 187] applied
    DL methods for dealing with issues related to interference alignment, caching,
    and customer selection [186, 187]. Chen and fellow researchers employed deep reinforcement
    learning (DRL) for developing a platform to address the issue of scalability at
    the network data centre by interfacing different input/output devices with all
    terminal hosts [188]. Resource allocation Li and his team of researchers applied
    DL techniques to allocate resources in wireless mobile networks to optimise energy
    consumption and delay [189]. Ferreira and his colleagues applied DL to develop
    a resource allocation algorithm to reduce unnecessary processing for bad attributes
    in cognitive network systems [190]. A team of researchers employs the deep NN
    architecture in Ref. [188, 191] for training to optimise wireless network resource
    management. Mennes et al. designed an efficient neural network-based multiple
    frequency time division multiple access based medium access control scheduler
    for cellular wireless networks [192]. An LSTM (long short-term memory)-based traffic
    load forecasting architecture was designed by Zhou et al. for resource allocation
    in base stations to reduce packet loss and congestion [193]. The DRL approach
    is adopted by a team of researchers led by Li in Ref. [49] to design a power control
    framework to deal with the issue of spectrum sharing in cognitive networks by
    dynamically adjusting the power of the transmitted signal. A deep recurrent neural
    network-based framework for dynamic spectrum allocation in land mobile radio networks
    was proposed by Rutagemwa et al. [194]. Liu et al. adapted the DRL approach to
    address anti-jamming communications in unknown conditions by taking and analysing
    all spectrum information as input [195]. The DRL approach is also applied in cognitive
    radio-based blockchain networks for channel selection and reducing the transaction
    transmission cost [196]. Ferreira et al. used multi-objective DRL to choose from
    multiple available radio transmitter settings in satellite communications [197].
    The authors used two neural networks to build a strong ensembling framework for
    satellite channels that change dynamically. Scheduling Scheduling is another area
    of network control for improving the efficiency of network systems, and several
    studies have been reported that applied ML in this area. An energy-efficient scheduling
    scheme was developed by Zhang et al. using deep Q-learning [50]. The authors in
    Ref. [198] also applied deep Q-learning to design a scheduling framework for highway
    vehicular communication systems. They improved the scheduling efficiency in terms
    of latency, energy consumption, and busy lines. Wei et al. built a DRL architecture
    to cache and schedule data transmission in wireless mobile terminal infrastructures
    [199]. They employed an agent to decide whether to save or deliver the content
    to the cell controller. The authors developed a traffic scheduling algorithm for
    wireless networks in Ref. [200] using reinforcement learning. The simulation shows
    that the scheme can enhance data rates by dynamically adapting network traffic
    variations. Routing Routing is a crucial function of a network system, and the
    efficiency of the routing algorithms can be improved with the application of ML
    methods. A DBN was applied by Mao et al. to the open shortest path first routing
    algorithm to predict the next node and achieved high accuracy and throughput [201,
    202]. Lee and his team employed a DL framework to classify the degree of nodes
    when the detailed history of routing tables is available [203]. A graph-based
    neural network framework was proposed by Geyer et al. [204] for experimenting
    with distributed routing techniques in different network topologies. Pham et al.
    developed a reinforcement learning-based deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm
    that can effectively train the framework for traffic flow for better convergence
    [205]. Naparstek et al. integrated LSTM into deep multi-user reinforcement learning
    to address run-time channel assignment in cellular wireless systems [206]. Yu
    and the team address wireless multiple access control challenges through DRL application
    to achieve faster convergence [207]. A DRL framework, named DeepNap, was trained
    in Ref. [208] to power on/off base stations dynamically depending upon the traffic
    data in wireless networks and remarkably reduced the power consumption in base
    stations. Liu et al. employed the DRL approach to design a framework for energy-efficient
    automated aerial vehicular control for fair communications [209]. Challia et al.
    proposed a DRL algorithm for planning the route of an unmanned aerial vehicle
    [210]. Kim et al. applied DL in the IoT to propose a load balancing scheme [211].
    Xu et al. proposed a DRL framework for controlling data traffic flow [212]. The
    above discussion shows that the application of ML has enough potential to address
    the challenges of NGWNs and make it an efficient, user-friendly, adaptable system.
    6.8 Application in network security Vast penetration of wireless services in almost
    every sphere of our life has drawn high attention in safeguarding network customers''
    identity, data, devices from security threats such as data siphoning, bandwidth
    stealing, hacking, unwanted intrusion, unauthorised service access etc. Intrusion
    detection systems, firewalls, and anti-virus software are some of the currently
    available Internet service security systems to protect customers'' interests and
    devices [54]. With the incorporation of ML, all these platforms can protect the
    terminal devices, central servers, and communications channels by dynamic training
    about patterns, signatures, and rules responsible for security threats [213].
    Here, we will highlight research progress on ML applications in these areas, and
    we could not find a comprehensive retrospective study on this research. AE neural
    networks have tremendous learning capacity to recognise network activities such
    as traffic data leakage, unauthorised intrusions, and cyberattacks [214]. Aminanto
    et al. employed stacked AE for feature extraction, achieving high efficiency [215].
    In contrast, Thing applied stacked AE in wireless networks to study the characteristics
    of cyber threats and attacks, reporting a remarkable accuracy of approximately
    99% [216]. Feng et al. applied deep AE to detect anomalous channels in wireless
    networks [217]. Khan et al. used ANNs to detect distributed flood attacks in wireless
    mesh networks and reported high performance through simulation [218]. The authors
    in Ref. [219, 220] applied ML approaches to identify distributed attacks and denial
    of service attacks on IoT devices. Martin et al. proposed conditional variational
    AE for intrusion detection and feature recovery in IoT scenarios [221]. MLPs were
    applied for malicious attack detection using delayed feedback networks by Hamedani
    et al. and nearly 100% accuracy through simulated experiments were achieved [222].
    Personal data-stealing by ill-natured apps installed on terminals and mobile devices
    is another major security concern for 5G network system planners [223]. The methods
    of ML are becoming powerful, handy weapons against such security threats. Deep
    learning methods were adapted by Su et al. to understand the properties of malware
    in smartphones and to detect them [224]. Deep4MalDroid, a DL architecture, was
    developed by Hou et al. for malware detection [225]. By constructing graphs from
    Linux kernel system calls and analysing the graph by employing stack AE, the authors
    accurately detected intentional malware causing users'' security breaches. McLaughlin
    et al. applied a CNN to identify byte codes that possess malware attributes [226],
    whereas Martinelli et al. employed a CNN to establish a correlation between traffic
    traces and app types [227]. One of the most dangerous threats to cyber security
    in recent times is botnets, where malware-infected computers are under the complete
    control of cybercriminals, called ''bot herders'', who execute cybercrimes [228].
    Machine learning can also be applied to malicious botnet attacks in NGWN. Torres
    et al. applied LSTM to characterise botnets'' properties different from usual
    traffic in mobile networks [229]. Alauthaman et al. used the principles of decision
    trees and adaptive multi-layer neural networks for the development of a botnet
    detection scheme in peer-to-peer networks [46], whereas Eslahi et al. applied
    a retrospective pattern recognition technique to design a model for the detection
    of botnets in mobile networks [230]. Oulehla et al. employed the principles of
    NN to detect botnets in mobile networks [231]. Incorporating users'' input in
    ML and performance evaluation without exposing their personal information is crucial
    in the mobile environment [232]. Shokri et al. developed a privacy-preserving
    model in a neural network [233]. A DL model was developed by a team of researchers
    in Ref. [234] to protect users'' privacy and enhance efficiency in a mobile cloud
    environment. Abadi et al. used differential SGD of private data for training deep
    neural networks to preserve privacy at a modest performance cost [235]. Servia
    et al. applied deep neural network for training in distributed nodes while preserving
    the personal data locally, which enhanced protecting privacy [236]. A private
    and scalable personal data analytics model was developed by Osia et al. [237]
    using hybrid edge-cloud DL in which personal data are converted to abstract attributes
    locally before being sent to the cloud. Hitaj et al [238] showed that generative
    adversarial networks (GANs) can be trained with DL to lead to information leakage
    even from a system that is trained with the framework developed in Ref. [235].
    Maghrebi et al. used DL techniques to break cryptographic implementations and
    reported high performance in breaking protected as well as unprotected implementations
    [239]. Ning et al. established that users'' privacy can also be compromised with
    the help of the deep CNN and proposed a framework, DeepMag, to overcome this limitation
    [240]. The above research shows that new approaches to cyberattacks are evolving
    continuously, and hence innovative security techniques must be developed regularly.
    The new security techniques must be capable of importing existing knowledge and
    adapting to new learning. We could not find much research progress in these areas
    that have the potential for ML applications. There is a research gap in overcoming
    the limits of neural networks that are vulnerable to adversarial attacks. 7 EVOLVING
    MACHINE LEARNING RESEARCH APPLICATIONS IN 5G SYSTEMS Online services are being
    adapted to a large extent in e-commerce, marketing, business, entertainment, and
    many more domains. For example, the product-user correlation generation framework,
    Net2Vec, was proposed in Ref. [241] using ML for online product advertisement
    and targeted sales. Road safety is another significant area where ML applications
    can provide spectacular outcomes, given the high incidence of accident fatalities
    and their socioeconomic effect. Gulati et al. successfully applied DL to disseminate
    contextual data on the Internet of vehicles (IoV) [242]. However, the effective
    and efficient use of IoT technologies for distributed intelligence processing
    in 5G systems is still not up to the mark. Incorporating DL into IoT-enabled devices
    can enhance the collaborative processing ability of the system and can reduce
    latency, delay, and communication overhead and increase the bit rate [243]. ML
    applications are still in their infancy in user sensing [244], blockchain [245],
    mobile surveillance, and some other areas in 5G systems . It can be inferred from
    the earlier discussion that no single universal ML solution is available that
    can be used to address all issues in 5G networks [246]. Machine learning can be
    considered an important tool that facilitates fast, efficient, and accurate process
    automation. However, it has limitations in domains where a high level of interpretation
    of the decision and a negligible error rate are needed. This shows that there
    is ample scope of research in customising ML applications in mobile wireless networks.
    Here, some research progress in customisation is mentioned below: 5G systems promised
    a very low latency and very high bit rate. This can only be achieved if all components
    of the system perform efficiently at run time. Therefore, complex, process-heavy
    DL frameworks must be customised as per available hardware to meet these QoS requirements
    [53, 247, 248]. Iandola et al. developed a customised embedded CNN that performs
    faster and more accurately with fewer parameters and smaller model sizes [249].
    Zhang et al. developed ShuffleNet after customising the convolution processes
    on a mobile device and achieved a very efficient NN [47]. Cao et al. designed
    MobiRNN, an RNN model for reducing latency in GPU-installed mobile smartphone
    processes [250]. Huynh et al. developed DeepMon, a customised GPU DL model for
    vision applications, to optimise memory usage [251]. A customised optimisation
    approach is adopted by the researchers in Ref. [252, 253], and [254]. In addition
    to these methods, other performance improvement methods, such as pruning [255],
    code optimisation [256], parameter optimisation [257], process optimisation [258],
    and training optimisation [259], can play a vital role in designing intelligent
    mobile systems through ML applications. Many heterogeneous, mostly unstructured
    data traffic are produced through mobile networks all over the globe. All these
    data contain a raw strain of voices, videos, images, text and associated with
    local cultures, emotions, dialects, topology, sentiments etc. Ignoring these regional
    contexts of traffic data in designing intelligent 5G frameworks can reduce robustness,
    scalability, and regional portability. Therefore, context-free distributed processing
    of mobile traffic data is another major research area for NGWNs. Due to very high
    mobility, roaming, and bit rate, mobile traffic data distributions change rapidly
    in terms of the traffic class, apps used, data volume consumed, and time and region
    of high traffic. [260]. Therefore, an intelligent network system must adopt the
    newly introduced properties and the existing properties in mobile traffic data
    through a continuous learning process [261]. Embedding continuous learning features
    in 5G systems is a potential research domain for exploration [262, 263]. 8 POTENTIAL
    RESEARCH SCOPES We discussed various issues related to the NGWN and related research
    studies, and we used ML techniques to address those issues. Our discussion clearly
    shows that the applications of ML methods are gaining popularity among researchers.
    We will mention some of the future research issues that can be resolved using
    ML tools. Machine learning, especially DL, requires a huge volume of reliable
    actual mobile network traffic data to obtain good performance. Wireless mobile
    networks generate a huge volume of data that is perfect for training deep neural
    networks, but all data collected are kept confidential and reserved for privacy
    reasons. Data collection in some mobile network areas is prone to errors, noise,
    incorrect formatting, and inconsistency and hence is not suitable for training
    NNs. Therefore, considerable effort and research are required in mobile data collection
    in collaboration with industry players. Furthermore, region-specific analysis
    of mobile traffic data is becoming essential daily to ensure personal and regional
    security and maintain continuous visual surveillance through mobile sensors. This
    is a highly demanded research domain in 5G systems. It is also noted from the
    studies mentioned above that present ML implementations in wireless mobile networks
    are mostly based on supervised and reinforcement learning that performs well with
    labelled datasets. Wireless mobile networks send and collect a huge volume of
    heterogeneous unlabelled data, and labelling is expensive and requires domain
    experts. Unsupervised learning is suitable for analysing and mining information
    from such unlabelled raw traffic data to achieve the optimum efficiency of a network
    system [264]. However, commonly used unsupervised learning tools such as GAN,
    AE, and restricted boltzmann machine either suffer from high complexity or make
    assumptions about traffic distribution, objective function, or operating environment.
    Sometimes, such assumptions do not hold true. These methods require more research
    to explore their potential for dealing with the 5G network system efficiently.
    As an example, the application of DRL in Google''s data centres'' cooling bill
    reduction ignites hope of the ample potential of DRL for imparting intelligence
    in 5G network control. 9 CONCLUSION System automation is penetrating heavily in
    every sphere of our life, and ML plays a vital role in its implementation. Automation
    in wireless mobile network systems promises the availability of its services as
    efficient, robust, ubiquitous, affordable, and easily manageable in the areas
    of network and app-level data analysis, network security, network control, handoff
    management, resource management, and signal processing. In this article, we have
    presented an extensive summary of recent research that covers the diverse range
    of wireless networks and ML. The fundamental concepts of ML are briefly discussed
    as well as existing research studies related to its applications in various functional
    areas of wireless networks, such as traffic data, jitter, throughput, end-to-end
    delay, routing, security, privacy, system capacity management, device management,
    QoS, and user experience, session management, signal and power management, mobility
    management, multimedia traffic and their applications, software and hard disk.
    Analysis of app-level traffic data may present insights into user preferences,
    movement patterns, and social activities that can be exploited by marketing agencies
    and intruders. This may raise a serious concern about the privacy of an individual,
    which is a challege for future research. We have also mentioned the available
    ML tools and libraries (Table 3) and recent work related to the customisation
    of these tools for targeted research in NGWNs. The study has highlighted the research
    gap extracted from the comprehensive reviews of available articles, literature
    scattered and distributed covering these domains, and the research potential in
    the ML tools and the scope of their applications in the NGWN (Figure 5). This
    study is written with the expectation that it will provide a quick reference,
    definite guide, and a handy short note to planners, engineers, service providers,
    and researchers who are working to impart intelligence in NGWNs. TABLE 5. 5G implementing

    Metrics Abstract: Initial efforts on wireless power transfer (WPT) have concentrated
    toward long-distance transmission and high power applications. Nonetheless, the
    lower achievable transmission efficiency and potential health concerns arising
    due to high power applications, have caused limitations in their further developments.
    Due to tremendous energy consumption growth with ever-increasing connected devices,
    alternative wireless information and power transfer techniques have been important
    not only for theoretical research but also for the operational costs saving and
    for the sustainable growth of wireless communications. In this regard, radio frequency
    energy harvesting (RF-EH) for a wireless communications system presents a new
    paradigm that allows wireless nodes to recharge their batteries from the RF signals
    instead of fixed power grids and the traditional energy sources. In this approach,
    the RF energy is harvested from ambient electromagnetic sources or from the sources
    that directionally transmit RF energy for EH purposes. Notable research activities
    and major advances have occurred over the last decade in this direction. Thus,
    this paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state-of-art techniques, based
    on advances and open issues presented by simultaneous wireless information and
    power transfer (SWIPT) and WPT assisted technologies. More specifically, in contrast
    to the existing works, this paper identifies and provides a detailed description
    of various potential emerging technologies for the fifth generation communications
    with SWIPT/WPT. Moreover, we provide some interesting research challenges and
    recommendations with the objective of stimulating future research in this emerging
    domain. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials ( Volume: 20, Issue:

    The PS receiver divides the received signal into two power streams of different
    power levels with a certain PS ratio before signal processing is performed at
    the receiver. Afterwards, both power streams are sent to an information decoder
    and energy harvester to make possible simultaneous ID and EH , . Apart from the
    receiver circuit, no additional change is required in the power-splitting design
    of conventional communication systems . In each receiver antenna, the PS ratio
    can be optimized. Furthermore, by varying PS ratios, the information rate and
    the harvested energy can be balanced according to the system requirements. Overall
    performance also can be improved by optimizing the combination of the signal and
    the PS ratios. Let denote the power-splitting coefficient value for receivers.
    The amount of power harvested at the PS receiver from the source can be calculated
    as follows: If the power of signal processing noise is denoted by , the maximum
    ID rate of receiver decoded from the source can be written as Theoretically, it
    is recognized that power-splitting achieves the best trade-off between information
    rate and amount of RF energy transferred . This section provides a simple analysis
    of instantaneous interference in a two-user transmission scheme. A general two-user
    transmission link is shown in . We use symbol and to represent the symbols of
    user 01 and user 02 respectively. In this model, we use Binary Phase Shift Keys
    (BPSK) as the modulation technique for the simplicity, which leads to . Moreover,
    the noise at the receiver has been ignored and represents the interference channel
    and the lossless channel from the intended transmitter to the receiver. The received
    signal can be expressed with these basic parameters as follows : where represents
    the interference. In , two distinct cases of interference are shown, which have
    the same transmit power which is equal to one. The first case gives the destructive
    interference where and it gives according to . Moreover, destructive interference
    from user 2 has shifted the received symbol of user one towards decision threshold
    in BPSK constellation denoted by the dotted line in . Thus, the received power
    of user 01 has been reduced and this phenomenon affects the system performance.
    However, in the second case, interference from the user 02 is constructive , with
    . From the , we obtain . Now with the constructive interference, received power
    of user 01 has increased with the help of the interference from user 02. Thus
    symbol detection is tolerant with constructive interference rather than in the
    situation without interference. Low-frequency bearing signals offer less power
    transfer efficiency and ultimately affect the QoE of the user. As in , it is suggested
    that using lower frequencies provides an advantage. Nevertheless, this assumes
    a fixed antenna gain and thus, physically large antennas are needed for lower
    frequencies. However, the physical area of the transmitter and/or receiver is
    limited in hand-held devices and sensors in IoT applications. Therefore, assuming
    that the antenna size is larger than the wavelength, the aperture would be proportional
    to actual physical cross-sectional area . For example, the transmitter or receiver
    could be resonant antennas or antenna arrays. With the help of these assumptions,
    the received power can be given by where and represent transmitter power and received
    power, and represent area of the receiving and transmitting antennas, respectively.
    The wavelength denoted by and is the distance between transmitter and the receiver.
    This suggests that using higher frequencies with the size limitation in transmitter
    or receiver is beneficial. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Conclusion Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract:
    The ambitious high data-rate applications in the envisioned future beyond fifth-generation
    (B5G) wireless networks require new solutions, including the advent of more advanced
    architectures than the ones already used in 5G networks, and the coalition of
    different communications schemes and technologies to enable these applications
    requirements. Among the candidate communications schemes for future wireless networks
    are non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes that allow serving more than
    one user in the same resource block by multiplexing users in other domains than
    frequency or time. In this way, NOMA schemes tend to offer several advantages
    over orthogonal multiple access (OMA) schemes such as improved user fairness and
    spectral efficiency, higher cell-edge throughput, massive connectivity support,
    and low transmission latency. With these merits, NOMA-enabled transmission schemes
    are being increasingly looked at as promising multiple access schemes for future
    wireless networks. When the power domain is used to multiplex the users, it is
    referred to as the power domain NOMA (PD-NOMA). In this paper, we survey the integration
    of PD-NOMA with the enabling communications schemes and technologies that are
    expected to meet the various requirements of B5G networks. In particular, this
    paper surveys the different rate optimization scenarios studied in the literature
    when PD-NOMA is combined with one or more of the candidate schemes and technologies
    for B5G networks including multiple-input-single-output (MISO), multiple-input-multiple-output
    (MIMO), massive-MIMO (mMIMO), advanced antenna architectures, higher frequency
    millimeter-wave (mmWave) and terahertz (THz) communications, advanced coordinated
    multi-point (CoMP) transmission and reception schemes, cooperative communications,
    cognitive radio (CR), visible light communications (VLC), unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) assisted communications and others. The considered system models, the optimization

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: I. Introduction Future wireless networks such
    as beyond fifth-generation (B5G) or 6G networks are expected to support extremely
    high data rates (up to 1 Tbps) and a very large number of users or nodes (up to
    nodes per ) with a variety of applications and services [1]. However, multiple
    access schemes used in the past generations of cellular networks will not scale
    to meet these unprecedented demands for user density and network traffic. The
    multiple access schemes used to date in cellular networks include frequency division
    multiple access (FDMA) in 1G systems, time division multiple access (TDMA) in
    2G, code division multiple access (CDMA) in 3G, and orthogonal frequency division
    multiple access (OFDMA) in 4G networks. The common theme in all these multiple
    access schemes is “orthogonality” where, theoretically, the different users are
    allocated distinct frequency channels or time slots or signature codes or resource
    blocks so that they do not interfere with one another when they access the network
    resources. However, this insistence on orthogonality poses a limit on the number
    of users that can access the network resources and thereby reduces the overall
    spectral efficiency (SE). Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) schemes, on the
    other hand, allow multiple users to share the same resource (e.g., a time/frequency
    resource block) and separate the users in other domains with some additional receiver
    complexity [2]. When the power domain is used to separate the users, it is referred
    to as the power-domain NOMA (PD-NOMA) [3] scheme and is the focus of this survey
    paper. Alternatively, if the users are separated through non-orthogonal codes,
    it is referred to as code-domain NOMA (CD-NOMA) [4], [5]. PD-NOMA has also been
    studied in conjunction with CD-NOMA recently [6], where such combination is beyond
    the scope of this paper. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    networks have a substantial potential in terms of supporting a broad range of

    series: Internet of Things ((ITTCC)) 203 Accesses Abstract Cognitive radio is
    a promising technique for cellular Internet of Things including 4G/5G in next
    generation wireless systems. The challenges of the next generation wireless networks
    include reducing the overall latency of the cellular networks and enhancing the
    spectral efficiency without compromising reliability and computational complexity.
    The feasible solution is the existence of networks operating over different frequency
    bands. However, the major challenges are data bandwidth support and spectrum availability.
    Cognitive radio networks are the best option available to meet all these challenges
    for cellular IoT and 5G beyond networks. The main objective of cognitive radio
    is to sense the spectrum for empty slots. In this chapter, an algorithm based
    on spectrum sensing is presented. The algorithm senses the spectrum using multiple
    sequences of primary and secondary users and empty slots are filled. Cognitive
    radio technology is implemented for enhancing the detection probability of the
    target. Thus, overall spectral efficiency increases. Access provided by University

    Chapter © 2020 Keywords Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (IoT) Spectrum sharing
    Dynamic spectrum access Frequency bands 1 Introduction Spectrum is a natural source
    and there is very limited availability of spectrum. There is a fixed spectrum
    assignment and bandwidth is also found to be very expensive. Some frequency bands
    like radio and TV are unutilized while the other frequency bands are overutilized.
    This shows that there is inefficiency in the utilization of the spectrum. This
    necessitates to exploit the spectrum opportunistically; therefore, we need to
    dynamically utilize the spectrum, which is called dynamic spectrum access [1].
    To achieve this dynamic spectrum access, we need a clever radio or clever system.
    Such a clever system or radio is known as cognitive radio. It is an intelligent,
    adaptive, aware radio model that senses its functional surroundings and dynamically
    adapts its radio operating parameter to update systems like mitigating interference,
    facilitating interoperability, and maximizing throughput. Spectrum scarcity is
    one of the major problems as most of the spectrum is left unused leaving behind
    spectrum holes. So, cognitive radio makes use of their spectrum hole in an efficient
    manner, thus leaving very less spectrum holes. Recent studies show that in the
    integration of cognitive radios with IoT-based wireless communication technologies,
    multiantenna systems [1,2,3] offer better results in terms of data rates, efficiency,
    availability, complexity, robustness and solve the spectrum scarcity issues even
    in coming age of the Internet of Things [4,5,6,7]. Improved intelligent radio
    systems efficiently work with fifth generation wireless networks by employing
    the licensed spectrum with the primary user and unlicensed spectrum combined with
    different application bands [8]. As it is an effective tool to mitigate various
    issues wirelessly, its smart sensing technique regulates the ability of spectrum
    resources [9]. The predominant characteristics of cognitive radio are its capability
    and reconfigurability. The capability of the cognitive radio to sense its radio
    environment by noting down the variations is called cognitive capability whereas
    the ability of the cognitive radio to change the functional elements according
    to the need of the radio surroundings is called reconfigurability. Achieving these
    characteristics in cognitive radio can be well explained in the “cognitive cycle”
    as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Cognitive radio cycle Full size image The primary role
    of cognitive radio is spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum mobility. The process of detecting an unused part of the spectrum
    or spectrum hole, that is, detecting whether the primary user is present or absent.
    Occupying the efficient part of the spectrum to obtain the user’s requirement
    is spectrum management. In addition, the cognitive radio provides fair spectrum
    scheduling method among Cognitive radios users and distributes spectrum among
    the scheduled users is known as spectrum sharing. Further, spectrum mobility performs
    transition to a better spectrum, that is, to empty the channel, where the licensed
    user is identified. Further, this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2
    comprises the system model of the IoT-based cognitive radio network. Section 3
    comprises the spectrum sensing phenomenon and layer-wise structure of the cognitive
    radio cycle. Further, Sect. 4 illustrates the IoTs-based cognitive radio network
    structure. Section 5 presents the complete process of spectrum sensing using MATLAB.
    Section 6 comprises the simulation results and discussion followed by the conclusion
    in Sect. 7. 2 System Model for IoT-Based Cognitive Radio Considering an IoT-based
    cognitive radio network consisting of a primary IoT device (PD), primary access
    point (PAP), secondary IoT device (SD), and secondary access point (SAP) as shown
    in Fig. 2. It is assumed PD and SD transmit information to their respective access
    point. The spectrum has been divided into licensed primary IoT (P-IoT) and unlicensed
    secondary IoT (S-IoT). Assuming that primary access point (PAP) and the secondary
    access point (SAP) are unbuffered, thus there is no possibility of the combination
    of signals received from earlier transmissions. If an error occurs during the
    transmission, we adopt an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol to correct the
    error. When new information is generated at the PD or SD, while the primary IoT
    and secondary IoT users are busy in the current transmission, the PD and SD discard
    the current information and start to transmit new information or packet of data.
    Fig. 2 IoT-based cognitive radio network Full size image 3 Potentials of Cognitive
    Radio Cognitive radio is a dynamic spectrum access that improves spectrum utilization.
    It gives better interoperability and improved vertical handoff by selecting the
    best network. Link optimization is done with respect to modulation, power and
    topology, better usage of other resources, increased capacity and high data rates,
    improved coverage, service quality, and link reliability by intelligently identifying
    the channels for communication. In spectrum management, the use of radio frequency
    for efficient use and gain benefits of cognitive radio is regulated [10]. It has
    three processes such as cycle sensing, deciding, and acting. The measurements
    are taken in first process and spectrum sensing is performed, which is affected
    by various wireless limitations. Because the measurements may be uncertain in
    first process, a decision needs to be made by the secondary, which is knowledge
    based and observation. Eventually, in the last step of the cycle, because of the
    uncertainty, wrong actions are taken. So, it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty
    by sensing the spectrum optimally by making right decisions and taking correct
    action. Spectrum sensing is a very eminent method in cognitive radio system because
    it allows secondary users to acknowledge about the environment by finding the
    availability of primary user. It is formulated as follows: $$ y(k)=\Big\{{\displaystyle
    \begin{array}{c}{N}_0\kern7.5em {\mathrm{H}}_0\kern0.5em :\mathrm{PU}\kern2.375em
    \mathrm{Absent}\\ {}h\ast x(k)+{N}_0,\kern3.125em {\mathrm{H}}_1\kern0.78em :\mathrm{PU}\kern2.375em
    \mathrm{Present}\end{array}} $$ (1) where k = 1 …. K, K is the number of samples,
    y(k) is the SU received signal, x(k) is the PU signal, N0 is the additive white
    Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance 𝛿w2, and h is the complex channel
    gain of the sensing channel. H0 and H1 show the presence and absence of the PU
    signal. The PU signal detection is achieved using one of the spectrum sensing
    method to take decisions among the two hypotheses H0 and H1. At the receiver end,
    the test statistic (T), is then correlated to a threshold (γ) to sense the presence
    or absence of PU signal. The Hypothesis H1 and H0 refer to the presence and absence
    of the PU signal respectively and decided as follows: $$ \Big\{\kern0.5em {\displaystyle
    \begin{array}{c}\ T\ge \gamma, \kern6.75em {\mathrm{H}}_1\\ {}\ T<\gamma, \kern6.25em
    {\mathrm{H}}_0\end{array}} $$ (2) where 𝛾 denotes the sensing threshold. Absence
    of PU signals enables the SU to get access to the PU channel. 3.1 Generic Flow
    Diagram of Cognitive Radio The fundamental objective of cognitive radios is spectrum
    sensing, spectrum sharing, and spectrum access. They work in PHY and MAC layers
    [11]. Further, cognitive radios influence the functioning of upper protocol layer.
    For quality of services observation, learning and decision-making must also be
    performed at the network, transport, and application layers [12]. Figure 3, shows
    the generic flow diagram of cognitive system. Fig. 3 Generic cognitive radio flow
    diagram Full size image 4 IoT-Based Cognitive Radio 4.1 Need for Cognitive Radio
    in IoT The exponential growth of internet traffic, count of licensed users will
    increase accordingly. This will make an issue to the unlicensed users. Therefore,
    it is very difficult to manage the expenses of obtaining spectrum from these unauthorized
    users. Cognitive radio networks are the feasible choice to combat this issue.
    Second, the expanding of internet will increase the count of IoT tools connected
    to the network. This will cause interference in the network due to device-to-device
    communication. IoT-based cognitive radio can assign channels that are interference
    free. Huge payload of information generated by individual users will require enormous
    bandwidth for transmission. Efficient spectrum utilization using cognitive radio
    technology will cater to this challenge. 4.2 Cognitive Architecture for IoT The
    cognitive architecture structure for the cellular IoT is shown in Fig. 4 [13].
    The framework consists of three levels of enablers. Each layer consists of fabrics
    that are used for the mechanism of various functionalities. The virtual object
    (VO) levels create the virtual description of real-world and digital objects are
    used for the exchange of the information with the real-world object (RWO). Fig.
    4 Cognitive radio IoT-based architecture Full size image The VOs can be further
    used for the generation of composite virtual objects (CVOs). Thus, the combination
    of these layers and structure together will create a cognitive network which can
    be used for power optimization, energy efficiency, reduced computational time,
    and increased reliability. The service function includes translation of service
    request, real world knowledge, and request information down to the CVO level in
    order to create meaningful mashups to serve the request. The real-world knowledge
    will help us decision-making necessary for cognitive radio cycle [14]. 5 Flowchart
    for Spectrum Sensing in Cognitive Radio In this section, a brief flowchart for
    spectrum sensing in cognitive radio is discussed. We considered five different
    combinations for primary users with different transmission signal frequencies
    of 1 KHz, 2 KHz, 3 KHz, 4 KHz, and 5 KHz, respectively as shown in Fig. 5. Different
    cases have been considered describing various combinations of primary users. We
    calculate the sum of all primary users and plot the power versus frequency graph
    of the resultant signal. Further, the spectrum is checked for any empty slot and
    secondary user is supposed to occupy the empty slot. After the secondary user
    has entered in the spectrum, we calculate the sum of the primary user signal and
    secondary user signal and plot the power spectral density. The sampling frequency
    is chosen to be 12 KHz. The noise affects the spectrum sensing process; accordingly,
    we consider the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is equivalent to 15 dB in each case.
    Fig. 5 Flowchart for Spectrum Sensing Full size image 6 Results and Discussion
    This section covers all the results simulated in MATLAB software using efficient
    spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio. Figure 6 shows the presence of
    one primary user keeping channel capacity minimum and probability is less. Second,
    empty slots are occupied by secondary user as shown in Fig. 8, by improving channel
    capacity and deduction in probability. Secondary user fills the third and fourth
    slots in the iteration as shown in Figs. 10 and 12, respectively. Fig. 6 Only
    one primary user is present in spectrum Full size image In fifth iteration, due
    to the presence of one primary user, all slots are occupied as shown in Fig. 14,
    having maximum channel capacity and spectrum probability. Case 1: Figure 6 shows
    the power spectral density graph for the cognitive radio system when only one
    primary user is present. Only one slot is occupied, which is shown in graph by
    the spiky peaks on the both sides of 1 KHz frequency spectrum. The power in this
    frequency range is almost 1 dB, that is, most of the signal power is confined
    within this spectrum. Figure 7 shows the probability of detection of empty slots
    due to the presence of only primary user. The detection probability of vacant
    slot is maximum in this case. Fig. 7 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of one PU Full size image Case 2: Secondary user senses the spectrum and occupies
    the second slot. Now, two slots are present in the spectrum. This is shown in
    graph by two spiky peaks ranging between 1 and 2 KHz frequency spectrum. Power
    in these two bands is almost equal to 4 dB as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Secondary
    primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Figure 9 shows the probability
    detection of unoccupied slots when only two slots are in use. The detection probability
    of empty slots somehow decreases as compared to case 1, because one more slot
    gets occupied in this case. Fig. 9 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of second PU Full size image Case 3: In Fig. 10, secondary user again senses the
    spectrum and finds three empty slots, thereby, occupying the third slot. The spiky
    peaks at 1, 2, and 3 KHz band frequency demonstrate the occupancy of three slots.
    Again, the power at these frequency bands is 4 dB. Figure 11 shows the detection
    probability when three slots are occupied. Again, it can be seen that with the
    occupancy of one more slot, the detection probability of empty slot decreases.
    Fig. 10 Third primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Fig. 11 Detection
    Probability of holes in presence of third PU Full size image Case 4: Figure 12
    shows the power spectral density graph when four slots are occupied. This is shown
    with four spiky peaks at 1, 2, 3, and 4 KHz frequency bands. Figure 13, demonstrates
    the decrease in the detection probability of empty slots. Now, only one slot is
    left unoccupied. Fig. 12 Fourth primary user is present in spectrum Full size
    image Fig. 13 Detection Probability of holes in presence of fourth PU Full size
    image Case 5: Secondary user once again senses the spectrum in the fifth repetition
    and fills the fifth slot. Figure 14 shows the full spectrum with all slots being
    occupied. Now, there is no scope for any spectrum hole. The slots are occupied
    at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 KHz frequency bands. Most of the signal power is confined
    in the spectrum over these bands. The bandwidth requirement for the transmission
    of all primary users will be 4 KHz. In this way, efficient spectrum sensing is
    being done by the cognitive radio algorithm. Figure 15 shows the detection probability
    when all slots are occupied. The detection probability of empty slots is the least.
    Fig. 14 All five primary users present in the spectrum Full size image Fig. 15
    Detection Probability of holes in presence of fifth PU Full size image Table 1
    lists the detection probability (PD) of vacant slots versus probability of false
    alarm for different occupancy. The probability of false alarm (PF) has been taken
    as 0.1 for each case. Table 1 Detection Probability versus false alarm probability
    Full size table 7 Conclusion This chapter presents the insight and innovative
    ideas of cellular IoT-based cognitive radio networks. The need of cognitive radio
    in IoT and IoT-based cognitive radio architecture has been briefly discussed in
    this chapter. We also present efficient spectrum sensing algorithm depending on
    spectrum sensing. The algorithm takes five iterations to make the spectrum completely
    occupied. In each and every iteration, secondary user occupies the slot left vacate
    by the primary user. Thus, minimum resources are getting wasted and full occupancy
    of channel is obtained in the last iteration. The last iteration, that is, when
    all the slots get occupied are having highest detection probability and spectral
    efficiency. In this way, the channel goes from the worst to the best case. Simulation
    results validate our analysis. Cognitive radio can be used for 4G and 5G technology
    for better spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. References T. Alam, S.R. Thummaluru,

    802.11 based wireless local area networks (WLANs) has increased significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to provide increased mobility, flexibility,
    and ease of use, with reduced cost of installation and maintenance. This has resulted
    in massive WLAN deployment in geographically limited environments that encompass
    multiple overlapping basic service sets (OBSSs). In this article, we introduce
    IEEE 802.11ax, a new standard being developed by the IEEE 802.11 Working Group,
    which will enable efficient usage of spectrum along with an enhanced user experience.
    We expose advanced technological enhancements proposed to improve the efficiency
    within high density WLAN networks and explore the key challenges to the upcoming

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract: A growing trend
    for information technology is to not just react to changes, but anticipate them
    as much as possible. This paradigm made modern solutions, such as recommendation
    systems, a ubiquitous presence in today''s digital transactions. Anticipatory
    networking extends the idea to communication technologies by studying patterns
    and periodicity in human behavior and network dynamics to optimize network performance.
    This survey collects and analyzes recent papers leveraging context information
    to forecast the evolution of network conditions and, in turn, to improve network
    performance. In particular, we identify the main prediction and optimization tools
    adopted in this body of work and link them with objectives and constraints of
    the typical applications and scenarios. Finally, we consider open challenges and
    research directions to make anticipatory networking part of next generation networks.

    Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has recently been envisioned to offer unprecedented
    massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-like gains by deploying large-scale
    and low-cost passive reflection elements. By adjusting the reflection coefficients,
    the IRS can change the phase shifts on the impinging electromagnetic waves so
    that it can smartly reconfigure the signal propagation environment and enhance
    the power of the desired received signal or suppress the interference signal.
    In this paper, we consider downlink multigroup multicast communication systems
    assisted by an IRS. We aim for maximizing the sum rate of all the multicasting
    groups by the joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the base station (BS)
    and the reflection coefficients at the IRS under both the power and unit-modulus
    constraint. To tackle this non-convex problem, we propose two efficient algorithms
    under the majorization-minimization (MM) algorithm framework. Specifically, a
    concave lower bound surrogate objective function of each user''s rate has been
    derived firstly, based on which two sets of variables can be updated alternately
    by solving two corresponding second-order cone programming (SOCP) problems. Then,
    in order to reduce the computational complexity, we derive another concave lower
    bound function of each group''s rate for each set of variables at every iteration,
    and obtain the closed-form solutions under these loose surrogate objective functions.
    Finally, the simulation results demonstrate the benefits in terms of the spectral
    and energy efficiency of the introduced IRS and the effectiveness in terms of
    the convergence and complexity of our proposed algorithms. Published in: IEEE

    of 5G and Internet of Things by 2020, it is predicted that the network capacity
    will increase by 1000 folds to serve at least 50 billions devices through wireless
    communications [1] and the capacity is expected to be achieved with lower energy
    consumption. To meet those Quality of Service (QoS) requirements, intelligent
    reflecting surface (IRS), as a promising new technology, has been proposed recently
    to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency. It is an artificial passive radio
    array structure where the phase of each passive element on the surface can be
    adjusted continuously or discretely with low power consumption [2], [3], and then
    change the directions of the reflected signal into the specific receivers to enhance
    the received signal power [4]–[7] or suppress interference as well as enhance
    security/privacy [8], [9]. The IRS, as a new concept beyond conventional massive
    multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems, maintains all the advantages
    of massive MIMO systems, such as being capable of focusing large amounts of energy
    in three-dimensional space which paves the way for wireless charging, remote sensing
    and data transmissions. However, the differences between IRS and massive MIMO
    are also obvious. Firstly, the IRS can be densely deployed in indoor spaces, making
    it possible to provide high data rates for indoor devices in the way of near-field
    communications [10]. Secondly, in contrast to conventional active antenna array
    equipped with energy-consuming radio frequency chains and power amplifiers, the
    IRS with passive reflection elements is cost-effective and energy-efficient [4],
    which enables IRS to be a prospective energy-efficient technology in green communications.
    Thirdly, as the IRS just reflects the signal in a passive way, there is no thermal
    noise or self-interference imposed on the received signal as in conventional full-duplex
    relays. Due to these significant advantages, IRS has been investigated in various
    wireless communication systems. Specifically, the authors in [4] first formulated
    the joint active and passive beamforming design problem both in downlink single-user
    and multiple-users multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems assisted by the
    IRS, while the total transmit power of the base station (BS) is minimized based
    on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) [11] and alternating optimization (AO) techniques.
    In order to reduce the high computational complexity incurred by SDR, Yu et al.
    proposed low complexity algorithms based on MM (Majorization–Minimization or Minorization–Maximization)
    algorithm in [8] and manifold optimization in [12] to design reflection coefficients
    with the targets of maximizing the security capacity and spectral efficiency communications,
    respectively. Pan et al. considered the weighted sum rate maximization problems
    in multicell MIMO communications [5], simultaneous wireless information and power
    transfer (SWIPT) aided systems [6], artificial-noise-aided secure MIMO communications
    [9], all demonstrating the significant performance gains achieved by deploying
    an IRS in the networks. A deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm [7]
    and a mobile edge computing-based algorithm [13] were proposed to jointly design
    the active and passive beamformings in IRS-related systems. In cognitive radio
    (CR) communication systems, the high rate for the secondary user (SU) can be acheived
    with the assistance of the IRS [14]. However, all the above-mentioned contributions
    only investigated the performance benefits of deploying an IRS in unicast transmissions,
    where the BS sends an independent data stream to each user. However, unicast transmissions
    will cause severe interference and high system complexity when the number of users
    is large. To address this issue, the multicast transmission based on content reuse
    [15] (e.g., identical content may be requested by a group of users simultaneously)
    has attracted wide attention, especially for the application scenarios such as
    popular TV programme or video conference. From the perspective of operators, it
    can be envisioned that multicast transmission is capable of effectively alleviating
    the pressure of tremendous wireless data traffic and play a vital role in the
    next generation wireless networks. Therefore, it is necessary to explore the potential
    performance benefits brought by an IRS during the multigroup multicast transmission.
    In specifically, in multicast systems, the data rate of each group is limited
    by the user with the worst-channel gains. Hence, the IRS can be deployed to improve
    the channel conditions of the worst-case user, which can be significantly improve
    the system performance. A common performance metric in multicast transmissions
    is the max-min fairness (MMF), where the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio
    (SINR) or spectral efficiency of users in each multicasting group or among all
    multicasting groups is maximized [16]–[20]. Prior seminal treatments of multicast
    transmission in single-group and multigroup are presented in [16], [17], where
    the MMF problems are formulated as a fractional second-order cone programming
    (SOCP) and are NP-hard in general. The SDR technique [11] was adopted to approximately
    solve the SOCP problem with some mathematical manipulations. In order to reduce
    the high computational complexity of SDR, several low-complexity algorithms, such
    as successive convex approximation approach in the single-group multicast scenario
    [18], asymptotic approach [19] and heuristic algorithm [20] in the multigroup
    multicast scenario, have been proposed by exploiting the special feature of near-orthogonal
    massive MIMO channels. In this paper, we consider an IRS-assisted multigroup multicast
    transmission system in which a multiple-antenna BS transmits independent information
    data streams to multiple groups, and the single-antenna users in the same group
    share the same information and suffer from interference from those signals sent
    to other groups. Unfortunately, the popular SDR-based method incurs a high computational
    complexity which hinders its practical implementation when the number of design
    parameters (e.g., precoding matrix and reflection coefficient vector) becomes
    large. Furthermore, the aforementioned low-complexity techniques designed for
    the IRS-aided unicast communication schemes cannot be directly applied in the
    multigroup multicast communication systems since the MMF metric is a non-differentiable
    and complex objective function. Against the above background, the main contributions
    of our work are summarized as follows: To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first work exploring the performance benefits of deploying an IRS in multigroup
    multicast communication systems. Specifically, we jointly optimize the precoding
    matrix and the reflection coefficient vector to maximize the sum rate of all the
    multicasting groups, where the rate of each multicasting group is limited by the
    minimum rate of users in the group. This formulated problem is much more challenging
    than previous problems considered in unicast systems since our considered objective
    function is non-differentiable and complex due to the nature of the multicast
    transmission mechanism. In addition, the highly coupled variables and complex
    sum rate expression aggravates the difficulty to solve this problem. The formulated
    problem is solved efficiently in an iterative manner based on the alternating
    optimization method under the MM algorithm framework. Specifically, we firstly
    minorize the original non-concave objective function by a surrogate function which
    is biconcave of precoding matrix and reflection coefficient vector, and then apply
    the alternating optimization method to decouple those variables. At each iteration
    of the alternating optimization method, the subproblem corresponding to each set
    of variables is reformulated as an SOCP problem by introducing auxiliary variables,
    which can help to transform the non-differentiable concave objective function
    into a series of convex constraints. To further reduce the computational complexity,
    we use the MM method to derive closed-form solutions of each subproblem, instead
    of solving the complex SOCP problems with a high complexity at each iteration.
    Specifically, we firstly apply the log-sum-exp lower bound to approximate the
    non-differentiable concave objective function, yielding a differentiable concave
    function. Then, we derive a tractable surrogate objective function of the log-sum-exp
    function, based on which we derive the closed-form solutions of each subproblem.
    Finally, we prove that the proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge and the
    solution sequences generated by the algorithm converge to KKT points. Finally,
    the simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the IRS-assisted multigroup
    multicast system over conventional massive MIMO systems in terms of the spectral
    efficiency and energy efficiency. The convergence and the low complexity of the
    proposed algorithms have also been illustrated. The remainder of this paper is
    organized as follows. Section II introduces the system model and formulates the
    optimization problem. An SOCP-based method is developed to solve the problem in
    Section III. Section IV further provides a low-complexity algorithm. Finally,
    Section V and Section VI show the simulation results and conclusions, respectively.

    shown in Fig. 1, we consider an IRS-aided multigroup multicast MISO communication
    system. There is a BS with N transmit antennas serving G multicasting groups.
    Users in the same group share the same information data and the information data
    destined for different groups are independent and different, which means there
    exists inter-group interference. Let us define the set of all multicast groups
    by G={1,2,…,G} . Assuming that there are K(K≥G) users in total, the user set belonging
    to group g∈G is denoted as K g and each user can only belong to one group, i.e.,
    K i ∩ K j = ∅,∀i,j∈G,i≠j . The transmit signal at the BS is x= ∑ g=1 G f g s g
    , (1) View Source where s g is the desired independent Gaussian data symbol of
    group g and follows E[| s g | 2 ]=1 as well as f g ∈ C N×1 is the corresponding
    precoding vector. Let us denote the collection of all precoding vectors as F=[
    f 1 ,…, f G ]∈ C N×G satisfying the power constraint S F ={F∣Tr[ F H F]≤ P T }
    , where P T is the maximum available transmit power at the BS. Fig. 1. An IRS-aided
    multigroup multicast communication system. Show All In the multigroup multicast
    system, we propose to employ an IRS with the goal of enhancing the received signal
    strength of users by reflecting signals from the BS to the users. It is assumed
    that the signal power of the multi-reflections (i.e., reflections more than once)
    on the IRS is ignored due to the severe path loss [4]. Denote M as the number
    of the reflection elements on the IRS, then the reflection coefficient matrix
    of the IRS is modeled by a diagonal matrix E=diag([ e 1 ,…, e M ] T )∈ C M×M ,
    where | e m | 2 =1,∀m=1,…,M [4]. Please note that the design of the practical
    reflection amplitude which was modeled as a function of the phase shifts [21]
    is more complex and will be investigated in our future work. The channels spanning
    from the BS to user k , from the BS to the IRS, and from the IRS to user k are
    denoted by h d,k ∈ C N×1 , H dr ∈ C M×N , and h r,k ∈ C M×1 , respectively. It
    is assumed that the channel state information (CSI) is perfectly known at the
    BS. The BS is responsible for designing the reflection coefficients of the IRS
    and sends them back to the IRS controller as shown in Fig. 1. As a result, the
    received signal of user k∈ K g belonging to group g is y k =( h H d,k + h H r,k
    E H dr ) ∑ g=1 G f g s g + n k , (2) View Source where n k is the received noise
    at user k , which is an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) following circularly
    symmetric complex Gaussian (CSCG) distribution with zero mean and variance σ 2
    k . Then, its achievable data rate (bps/Hz) is given by R k = log 2 (1+ |( h H
    d,k + h H r,k E H dr ) f g | 2 ∑ G i≠g |( h H d,k + h H r,k E H dr ) f i | 2 +
    σ 2 k ). (3) View Source Denoting by H k =[ diag( h H r,k ) H dr h H d,k ]∈ C
    (M+1)×N the equivalent channel spanning from the BS to user k and by e=[ e 1 ,⋯
    e M ,1 ] T ∈ C (M+1)×1 the equivalent reflection coefficient vector, we have |(
    h H d,k + h H r,k E H dr ) f g | 2 ∑ i≠g G |( h H d,k + h H r,k E H dr ) f i |
    2 =| e H H k f g | 2 , = ∑ i≠g G | e H H k f i | 2 + σ 2 k . (4) (5) View Source
    Note that e belongs to the set S e ={e∣| e m | 2 =1,1≤m≤M, e M+1 =1} . Then, the
    data rate expression in (3) can be rewritten in a compact form as R k (F,e)= log
    2 (1+ | e H H k f g | 2 ∑ G i≠g | e H H k f i | 2 + σ 2 k ). (6) View Source Due
    to the nature of the multicast mechanism, the achievable data rate of group g
    is limited by the minimum user rate in this group and is defined as follows min
    k∈ K g { R k (F,e)}. (7) View Source B. Problem Formulation In this paper, we
    aim to jointly optimize the precoding matrix F and reflection coefficient vector
    e to maximize the sum rate of the whole system, which is defined as the sum rate
    achieved by all groups. Mathematically, the optimization problem is formulated
    as max F,e s.t. {F(F,e)= ∑ g=1 G min k∈ K g { R k (F,e)}} F∈ S F ,e∈ S e . (8)
    View Source Problem (8) is a non-convex problem and difficult to solve since the
    objective function F(F,e) is non-differentiable and non-concave, while the unit-modulus
    constraint set S e is also non-convex. In the following, we propose two efficient
    algorithms based on the MM algorithm framework to solve Problem (8). C. Majorization-Minimization
    Method The aim of the MM method [22], [23] is to find an easy-to-solve surrogate
    problem with a surrogate objective function, then optimize it instead of the original
    complex one. Specifically, suppose that f(x) is the original objective function
    which needs to be maximized over a convex set S x . Let f ˜ (x| x n ) denote a
    real-valued function of variable x with given x n . The function f ˜ (x| x n )
    is said to minorize f(x) at a given point x n if they satisfy the following conditions
    [23]: (A1): (A2): (A3): (A4): f ˜ ( x n | x n )=f( x n ),∀ x n ∈ S x ; f ˜ (x|
    x n )≤f(x),∀x, x n ∈ S x ; f ˜ ′ (x| x n ;d) | x= x n = f ′ ( x n ;d),∀d with  x
    n +d∈ S x ; f ˜ (x| x n )is continuous inx and  x n . View Source where f ′ (
    x n ;d) , defined as the direction derivative of f( x n ) in the direction d ,
    is f ′ ( x n ;d)= lim λ→0 f( x n +λd)−f( x n ) λ . View Source SECTION III. SOCP-Based
    MM method In this section, we propose an SOCP-based MM method to solve Problem
    (8). Specifically, under the MM algorithm framework, we first handle the non-convex
    objective function by introducing its concave surrogate function. Then, we adopt
    the alternating optimization method to solve the subproblems corresponding to
    different sets of variables alternately. Note that F(F,e) is a composite function
    which is the linear combinations of some pointwise minimum with non-concave subfunction
    R k (F,e) . We first tackle the non-concave property of R k (F,e) . To this end,
    we introduce the following lemma. Lemma 1: Let { F n , e n } be the solutions
    obtained at iteration n−1 , then R k (F,e) is minorized by a concave surrogate
    function R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e n ) defined by R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e n ) = const k

    where a k = ( f n g ) H H H k e n ∑ G i≠g |( e n ) H H k f n i | 2 + σ 2 k , b
    k = |( e n ) H H k f n g | 2 ( ∑ G i≠g |( e n ) H H k f n i | 2 + σ 2 k )( ∑ G
    i=1 |( e n ) H H k f n i | 2 + σ 2 k ) , const k = R k ( F n , e n )− b k σ 2
    k − b k ( ∑ i=1 G |( e n ) H H k f n i | 2 + σ 2 k ), View Source at fixed point
    { F n , e n } . Proof: Please refer to Appendix A.                      ■ Based
    on the above theorem, Problem (8) can be transformed into the following surrogate
    problem: max F,e s.t. { F ˜ (F,e| F n , e n )= ∑ g=1 G min k∈ K g { R ˜ k (F,e|
    F n , e n )}} F∈ S F ,e∈ S e . (10) View Source We note that R ˜ k (F,e| F n ,
    e n ) is biconcave of F and e [24], since R ˜ k (F| F n )= R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e
    n ) with given e is concave of F and R ˜ k (e| e n )= R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e n )
    with given F is concave of e . This biconvex problem enables us to use the alternating
    optimization (AO) method to alternately update F and e . A. Optimizing the Precoding
    Matrix F In this subsection, we aim to optimize the precoding matrix F with given
    e . With some manipulations, R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e n ) in (9) can be shown to be
    a quadratic function of F : R ˜ k (F| F n ) = const k +2Re{ a k e H H k f g }−
    b k ∑ i=1 G | e H H k f i | 2 = const k +2Re{Tr[ C H k F]}−Tr[ F H B k F], (11)
    View Source where B k = b k H H k e e H H k , C H k = a k t g e H H k , and t
    g ∈ R G×1 is a selection vector in which the g th element is equal to one and
    all the other elements are equal to zero. By using (11), the subproblem of Problem
    (10) for the optimization of F is max F s.t. ∑ g=1 G min k∈ K g { const k +2Re{Tr[
    C H k F]}−Tr[ F H B k F]} F∈ S F . (12) View Source We then tackle the pointwise
    minimum expressions in the objective function of Problem (12) by introducing auxiliary
    variables γ=[ γ 1 ,…, γ G ] T , as follows max F,γ s.t. ∑ g=1 G γ g F∈ S F , const
    k +2Re{Tr[ C H k F]}−Tr[ F H B k F]≥ γ g , ∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G. (13) View Source Problem
    (13) is an SOCP problem and the globally solution can be obtained by the CVX [25]
    solver, such as MOSEK [26]. B. Optimizing the Reflection Coefficient Vector e
    In this subsection, we focus on optimizing the reflection coefficient vector e
    with given F , then R ˜ k (e| e n ) can be rewritten as R ˜ k (e| e n ) = const
    k +2Re{ a H k e}− e H A k e, (14) View Source where A k = b k H k ∑ G i=1 f i
    f H i H H k and a k = a k H k f g . Upon replacing the objective function of Problem
    (10) by (14), the subproblem for the optimization of e is given by max e s.t.
    ∑ g=1 G min k∈ K g { const k +2Re{ a H k e}− e H A k e} e∈ S e . (15) View Source
    Also introducing auxiliary variables κ=[ κ 1 ,…, κ G ] T , Problem (15) is equivalent
    to max e,κ s.t. ∑ g=1 G κ g e∈ S e , const k +2Re{ a H k e}− e H A k e≥ κ g ,
    ∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G. (16) View Source The above problem is still non-convex due to the
    non-convex unit-modulus set S e . To address this issue, we replace it with a
    relaxed convex one as S e−relax ={ e H diag( i m )e≤1,∀m=1,…,M, e M+1 =1}, View
    Source where i m ∈ R (M+1)×1 is a selection vector whose m th element is equal
    to one and all the other elements are equal to zero. Let us denote by e ˆ 1 the
    optimal solution of the following relaxed version of the SOCP problem, i.e., e
    ˆ 1 =arg max e s.t. ∑ g=1 G γ g e∈ S e−relax , const k +2Re{ a H k e}− e H A k
    e≥ κ g , ∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G. (17) View Source Then, the locally optimal solution e
    in the n th iteration is e n+1 ={ e ˆ 2 , e n , if F( F n+1 , e ˆ 2 | F n , e
    n )≥F( F n+1 , e n | F n , e n ), otherwise, (18) View Source where e ˆ 2 =exp{j∠(
    e ˆ 1 [ e ˆ 1 ] M+1 )}, (19) View Source and symbol [ e ˆ 1 ] m denotes the m
    th element of the vector e ˆ 1 . Here the exp{⋅} and the ∠(⋅) are both element-wise
    operations. C. Algorithm Development Based on the above analysis, Algorithm 1
    summarizes the alternating update process between precoding matrix F and reflection
    coefficient vector e to maximize the sum rate of the whole system. Algorithm 1:
    SOCP-Based MM Algorithm. Initialize: Initialize F 0 and e 0 , and n=0 . 1: repeat
    2: Calculate F n+1 by solving Problem (13) with given e n ; 3: Calculate e n+1
    by solving Problem (17) with given F n+1 ; 4: n←n+1 ; 5: until The value of function
    F(F,e) in (8) converges. 1) Complexity Analysis Now we analyze the computational
    complexity of Algorithm 1, which mainly comes from optimizing F in the SOCP problem
    in (13) and optimizing e in the SOCP problem in (17). According to [27], the complexity
    of solving an SOCP problem, with M socp second order cone constraints where the
    dimension of each is N socp , is O( N socp M 3.5 socp + N 3 socp M 2.5 socp )
    . Problem (13) contains one power constraint with dimension NG and K rate constraints
    with dimension NK . Therefore, the complexity of solving Problem (13) per iteration
    is O(NG+ N 3 G 3 +NG K 3.5 + N 3 G 3 K 2.5 ) . Problem (17) has M constant modulus
    constraints with dimension one for sparse vector i m and K rate constraints with
    dimension M+1 . Therefore, the complexity of solving Problem (17) per iteration
    is O( M 3.5 + M 2.5 +(M+1) K 3.5 +(M+1 ) 3 K 2.5 ) . Therefore, the approximate
    complexity of Algorithm 1 per iteration is O( N 3 G 3 K 2.5 + M 3.5 +M K 3.5 )
    . 2) Convergence Analysis The following theorem shows the convergence and solution
    properties of Algorithm 1. Theorem 1: The objective function value sequence {F(
    F n , e n )} generated by Algorithm 1 is guaranteed to converge, and the optimal
    solution converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point. Proof: Please refer to
    Appendix B.                      ■ SECTION IV. Low-Complexity MM Method As seen
    in Algorithm 1, we need to solve two SOCP problems in each iteration, which incurs
    a high computational complexity. In this section, we aim to derive a low-complexity
    algorithm containing closed-form solutions. Since min k∈ K g { R ˜ k (F,e| F n

    to [29], if the Hessian matrix of a function is semi-negative definite, that function
    is concave. In particular, we derive the Hessian matrix of the exp-sum-log function
    f(x)=−log( ∑ k∈ K g exp{−x}) as ∇ 2 f(x)=− 1 (1 z T ) 2 (( 1 T z)diag(z)−z z T

    of vectors a and b are a n = v n z n − − √ and b n = z n − − √ , respectively.
    The inequality follows from the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality. Then ∇ 2 f(x)⪯0 , and
    the log-sum-exp function f(x) is concave. Therefore, − 1 μ g log( ∑ k∈ K g exp{−
    μ g R ˜ k }) is an increasing and concave function w.r.t. R ˜ k . Recall that
    R ˜ k (F,e| F n , e n ) is biconcave of F and e . Finally, according to the composition
    principle [29], f g (F,e) is biconcave of F and e . The proof is complete. ■ Large
    μ g leads to high accuracy of the approximation, but it also causes the problem
    to be nearly ill-conditioned. When μ g is chosen appropriately, Problem (10) is

    this section, we adopt alternating optimization algorithm to alternately optimize
    precoding matrix F and reflection coefficient vector e . Note that the tightness
    of the lower bounds α g in (29) and β g in (42) affects the performance of the
    convergence speed. Here, we adopt SQUAREM [32] to accelerate the convergence speed
    of our proposed algorithm, which is summarized in Algorithm 2. Let M F (⋅) denote
    the nonlinear fixed-point iteration map of the MM algorithm of F in (34), i.e.,
    F n+1 = M F ( F n ) , and M e (⋅) of e in (46), i.e., e n+1 = M e ( e n ) . P
    S (⋅) is project operation to force wayward points to satisfy their nonlinear
    constraints. For the power constraint in Problem (32), the projection can be done
    by using the function (⋅) ||⋅| | F || F 2 | | F to the solution matrix, e.g.,

    D. Complexity Analysis The computational complexity of Algorithm 2 is composed
    of the nonlinear fixed-point iteration maps M F (⋅) and M e (⋅) . In M F (⋅) ,
    the computational complexity of U g in (30) mainly comes from g k ( F n ) in (28)
    and α g in (29). Firstly, the computational complexity of g k ( F n ) is of order
    O(| K g |(2MNG+3NG)) since there are | K g | R ˜ k ( F n ) in (9) of order O(2MNG+3NG)
    . Then each t p k in (30) is of complexity O(4 N 3 +2 N 2 K−NK+4MN) neglecting
    the lower-order terms, thus α g is of order O(| K g |(4 N 3 +2 N 2 K+4MN)) . Therefore,
    the approximate complexity of M F (⋅) is O(4 N 3 K+2 N 2 K 2 +2MNGK) neglecting
    the lower-order terms. In M e (⋅) , the computational complexity of g k ( e n
    ) in (41) is the same as g k ( F n ) , which is of complexity O(| K g |(2MNG+3NG))
    . Furthermore, the eigenvalue operations λ max ( A k ) and λ max ( A k A H k )
    of order O((M+1 ) 3 ) contribute to the main complexity of calculating β g in
    (42), which is of order O(| K g |(M+1 ) 3 ) . Neglecting the lower-order terms,
    the approximate complexity of M e (⋅) is O(2MNGK+K(M+1 ) 3 ) . Eventually, the
    approximate complexity of Algorithm 2 per iteration is O(4 N 3 K+2 N 2 K 2 +3MNGK+K(M+1
    ) 3 ) , neglecting the lower-order terms. The computational complexity of the
    proposed two algorithms are summarized and compared in Table I. Comparing with
    Algorithm 1 based on SOCP, Algorithm 2 has a lower computational complexity and
    requires less CPU time, which will be shown in the following section. TABLE I
    Complexity Analysis of the Proposed MM Algorithms E. Convergence Analysis In each
    iteration, we adopt the MM algorithm to update each set of variables. The monotonicity
    of the MM algorithm has been proved in [23] and [33]. In the following, we claim
    the monotonicity of Algorithm 2. At the n th iteration, with given e n , we have
    f g ( F n , e n )= f ˜ g ( F n , F n )≤ f ˜ g ( F n+1 , F n )≤ f g ( F n+1 , e
    n ), View Source where the first equality follows from (A1), the first inequality
    follows from (32), and the second one follows from (A2). Subsequently, with given
    F n+1 , it is straightforward to have f g ( F n+1 , e n )= f ˆ g ( e n , e n )≤
    f ˆ g ( e n+1 , e n )≤ f g ( F n+1 , e n+1 ). View Source Therefore, the objective
    function values { f g ( F n+1 , e n+1 )} generated during the procedure of the
    AO algorithm are monotonically increasing. Let { F n } be the sequence generated
    by the proposed algorithm. Since S F is a convex set, every limit point of { F
    n } is a d-stationary point of Problem (8), and the limit point F ∞ satisfies
    f ′ g ( F ∞ ;d)≤0,∀d with  F ∞ +d∈ S F . View Source The proof of converging to
    a d-stationary point can be found in [34]. Let { e n } be the sequence generated
    by the proposed algorithm. Since S e is a non-convex set, every limit point of
    { e n } is a B-stationary point of Problem (8), and the limit point e ∞ satisfies
    f ′ g ( e ∞ ;d)≤0,∀d∈ T S e ( e ∞ ). View Source The proof of converging to a
    B-stationary point can be found in [30] and [31]. The property of the converged
    solution of Algorithm 2 is shown in the following Theorem. Theorem 5: The optimal
    solution converges to a KKT point of Problem (24). Proof: Please refer to Appendix
    E.                      ■ SECTION V. Simulation Results and Discussions A. Simulation
    Setup In this section, extensive simulation results are provided to evaluate the
    performance of our proposed algorithms for an IRS-aided multigroup multicast MISO
    communication system. All experiments are performed on a PC with a 1.99 GHz i7-8550
    U CPU and 16 GB RAM. Each point in the following figures is obtained by averaging
    over 100 independent trials. The simulated model in Fig. 2 is as follows: The
    BS locating at (0 m, 0 m) employs a uniform linear array (ULA) with N antennas
    and the IRS locating at (100 m, 0 m) is equipped with a uniform planar array (UPA)
    with M reflecting elements, where the width of the UPA is fixed at 4 and the length
    is M/4 . All users are randomly distributed in a circle centered at (120 m, 20
    m) with radius 10 m. Fig. 2. The simulated system setup. Show All The large-scale
    path loss is PL=−30−10α log 10 (d) dB, in which d is the link length in meters
    and the path loss exponents for the BS-IRS link, the IRS-user link, and the BS-user
    link are set as α BI = α IU =2 and α BU =4 , respectively [35]. The small-scale
    fading in [ H dr ,{ h d,k } ∀k∈K ] is assumed to follow Rayleigh distribution
    with zero-mean and unit variance due to the fact of the large lengths of the BS-IRS
    link and the BS-user link, while the small-scale fading in { h r,k } ∀k∈K is assumed
    to be Rican fading with Ricean factor κ IU =10 . The line-of-sight (LoS) components
    are modeled as the product of the steering vectors of the transceivers and the
    non-LoS components are drawn from a Rayleigh distribution. Unless otherwise stated,
    the other parameters are set as: Transmission bandwidth of 10 MHz, noise power
    density of −174 dBm/Hz, convergence accuracy of ϵ= 10 −6 , smoothing parameter
    of μ g =100 [28], N=4 , N=16 , G=| K g |=2 . We use IRS-Alg. 1 to represent Algorithm
    1 and IRS-Alg. 2 to represent Algorithm 2. For comparison purposes, we show the
    performance of the scheme without IRS, in which the precoding matrix is also obtained
    by our proposed two algorithms, denoted as NIRS-Alg. 1 and NIRS-Alg. 2, respectively.
    B. Baseline Schemes Due to the hardware limitation, it is practically difficult
    to realize the continuous phase shifts at each reflection element considered in
    this work. Hence, two baseline schemes with 2 bit resolution are considered in
    the simulations to investigate the performance loss of using finite resolution
    reflection elements. Specifically, with optimal e o generated by Algorithm 1 or
    Algorithm 2, the m th discrete phase shift can be obtained by θ o m =arg min θ∈
    F θ |exp{j∠θ}− e o m |, View Source where F θ ={0,2π/B,…,2π(B−1)/B} and B= 2 2
    . Therefore, we call the two baseline schemes as IRS-Alg. 1, 2 bit and IRS-Alg.
    2, 2 bit. Besides, IRS is advocated as an energy-efficient device for assisting
    wireless communication. Hence, it is necessary to compare the performance of the
    IRS-based and the full-duplex amplify-and-forward (AF) relay-based multigroup
    multicast systems. To ensure a fair comparison with our proposed IRS-aided system,
    the Relay benchmark scheme, in which the relay is located at the same place of
    the IRS, has considered the same users’ locations and channel realizations. Then,
    the sum rate maximization problem for the joint design of the precoder F and the
    relay beamforming W is given by max F,W s.t. ∑ g=1 G min k∈ K g R relay k ||F|
    | 2 F ≤ P T ||W H dr F| | 2 F +||W| | 2 F σ 2 r ≤ P relay , (47) View Source where
    R relay k is given by log 2 (1+ |( h H d,k + h H r,k W H dr ) f g | 2 ∑ G i≠g
    |( h H d,k + h H r,k W H dr ) f i | 2 +|| h H r,k W| | 2 2 σ 2 r + σ 2 k ). View
    Source Here, P relay is the maximum available transmit power at the relay, σ 2
    r is the noise power received by the relay, and the digital relay beamforming
    W is assumed to be a diagonal matrix. The AO method is adopted to solve the above
    problem. Basically, we extend the SCA method in [36] to alternately update each
    variable in Problem (47). C. Convergence of the Proposed Algorithms Consider the
    fact of the nonconvexity of Problem (8), different initial points may result in
    different locally optimal solutions obtained by the our proposed algorithms. By
    testing 30 randomly channel realizations, Fig. 3 illustrates the impact of the
    initializations on the performance of the proposed algorithms. The initializations
    of IRS-Alg. 1 and IRS-Alg. 2 are: F is initialized by uniformly allocating maximum
    transmit power, e is initialized by setting each entry to 1. IRS-Alg. 1-EXH (IRS-Alg.
    2-EXH) refers to the best initial point of 1000 random initial points for each
    channel realization. It can be seen that the sum rate of IRS-Alg. 1 (IRS-Alg.
    2) is almost the same as that of IRS-Alg. 1-EXH (IRS-Alg. 2-EXH), implying that
    the simple uniform power allocation of F and all-one e is a good option for the
    initialization. Fig. 3. The performance comparison of different initialization,
    when N=4 , N=16 , G=| K g |=2 and P T =15 dBm. Show All In Fig. 4 investigates
    the convergence behaviour of various algorithms in terms of the iteration number
    and the CPU time when P T =20 dBm. Fig. 4(a) compares convergence speed in terms
    of the number of iterations. Only a small number of iterations are sufficient
    for Algorithm 1 to converge for both IRS and NIRS schemes. The reason is that
    the lower bound of the original objective function in (9) used in Algorithm 1
    is tighter than those in (26) and (39) used in Algorithm 2. Although Algorithm
    2 needs more iterations to converge, it has a fast convergence speed in terms
    of CPU time shown in Fig. 4(b). This is because in each iteration of Algorithm
    2, there always exists closed-form solutions when designing precoding matrix and
    reflection coefficient vector. In addition, the optimal objective function values
    generated by both algorithms for IRS case and NIRS case are the same. Therefore,
    Algorithm 2 outperforms Algorithm 1 due to the fact that the former can generate
    the same gain with the latter while costing much less CPU running time Fig. 4.
    The convergence behaviour of different algorithms, when N=4 , N=16 , G=| K g |=2
    and P T =20 dBm. Show All D. IRS vs AF Relay Performance Comparison Fig. 5 shows
    the sum rate, the energy efficiency, and the corresponding CPU running time under
    different maximum transmit power. The energy efficiency (bit/Hz/J) is defined
    as the ratio of the sum rate to the power consumption, i.e., EE= Sum Rate Power
    . View Source In the relay-aided system, we set P T = P relay . The linear power
    consumption model is Power=η( p T + p relay )+N P t +2M P r , where p T and p
    relay are the practical transmit power of the BS and the relay, respectively.
    Following [37], we set the reciprocal of the power amplifier efficiency as η=1.2
    and the circuit power consumption of the active antennas at the BS and the relay
    as P t = P r =200 mW. In the IRS-aided system, we adopt Power=η( p T + p relay
    )+N P t +M P IRS , where the circuit power consumption of the passive reflection
    elements is set as P IRS =5 mW [38]. Fig. 5. The sum rate, energy efficiency,
    and CPU time versus the transmit power, when N=4 , N=16 and G=| K g |=2 . Show
    All It can be seen in Fig. 5(a) that the IRS structure can obviously enhance the
    sum rate performance of the system without consuming additional transmit power,
    comparing with the system without the IRS structure. The performance loss of the
    ‘2 bit’ phase shifter generated by the proposed two algorithms is much small compared
    with the continuous phase shifter cases. However, the relay-aided system outperforms
    the IRS-aided one, which is reasonable due the fact that the relay can amplify
    and forward the received signals by using the relay transmit power P relay . The
    EE of the IRS-aided system shown in Fig. 5(b) is higher than the relay-aided one
    at high transmit power. The reason behind this is twofold. On the one hand, as
    P T increases, the contribution of the relay transmit power P relay to the system
    sum rate gain becomes less. On the other hand, the circuit power consumption of
    the relay is relatively high. Another observation from Fig. 5(b) is that the EE
    of the relay system decreases with the number of the active antennas deployed
    at the relay. From Fig. 5(c), we observe that Algorithm 1 is time-consuming and
    the time required is unacceptable when P T increases. In addition, the computational
    complexity of the joint optimization of the precoder and the relay beamforming
    is much higher than the IRS case when P T is less than 20 dBm due to the fact
    that relay power constraint is complex. Finally, all the results obtained from
    Fig. 5 verify the performance gains of the IRS-aided system in terms of the EE
    and complexity. E. IRS Performance Analysis It is of practical significance to
    compare the communication performance of conventional large-scale antenna arrays
    deployed at the BS and large-scale passive elements deployed at the IRS, since
    IRS is regarded as an extension of massive MIMO antenna array. Fig. 6 illustrates
    the sum rate and the EE performance versus the numbers of antenna elements at
    the BS and reflection elements at the IRS when P T =20 dBm. It is observed from
    Fig. 6(a) that significant gains can be achieved by the IRS scheme over that without
    an IRS even when M is as small as 4, and also that the spectral efficiency performance
    gains achieved by increasing the number of reflection elements are much higher
    than those achieved by increasing the number of transmit antennas. In addition,
    in Fig. 6(b), it is more energy-efficient to deploy an IRS with passive elements
    than installing active large-scale antenna array with energy-consuming radio frequency
    chains and power amplifiers. The trend of EE decreasing with the number of transmit
    antennas comes from the fact that the circut energy consumption of more antennas
    outweighs the system sum rate gain introduced by deploying more antennas. These
    simulation results demonstrate that IRS technology is superior to traditional
    massive MIMO in terms of spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. Fig. 6. The
    sum rate versus the numbers of reflection elements at the IRS M or transmit antennas
    at the BS N , when G=| K g |=2 and P T =20 dBm. Show All The above simulation
    results show that Algorithm 2 requires less CPU time than Algorithm 1. Hence,
    we adopt Algorithm 2 to investigate the effect of an IRS on the performance of
    a multicast communication system. Fig. 7 illustrates the sum rate versus the number
    of users per group for various numbers of groups. It can be observed from this
    figure that the sum rate for all values of G decreases with the increase of the
    number of users per group. The reason is that the data rate for each group is
    limited by the user with the worst channel condition. With the increase of the
    number of users per group, the channel gain for the worst user becomes smaller.
    Fig. 7. The sum rate versus the number of users per group, when N=4 , N=16 , and
    P T =20 dBm. Show All Fig. 8. The sum rate versus the number of groups, when P
    T =20 dBm. Show All Fig. 7 compares the effects of two improvements on the performance
    limit, namely, increasing the number of antennas at the BS and the number of reflection
    elements at the IRS, respectively. When | K g |=1 , the multicasting system reduces
    to a unitcasting system, in which the transmit antennas outperform the reflection
    elements in the aspect of suppressing multi-user interference. While when | K
    g |=3 , the sum rate of the system increases slowly and tends to be stable with
    the increase of the number of multicasting groups for a given number of antenna/reflection
    elements. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this work, we have shown the performance benefits
    of introducing an IRS to the multigroup multicast systems. By carefully adjusting
    the reflection coefficients at the IRS, the signal reflected by the IRS can enhance
    the strength of the signal received by the user. We investigate the sum rate maximization
    problem by joint optimization of the precoding matrix at the BS and reflection
    coefficient vector at the IRS, while guaranteeing the transmit power constraint
    and the associated non-convex unit-modulus constraint at the IRS. Under the MM
    algorithm framework, we derive the concave lower bound of the original non-concave
    objective function, and then adopt alternating optimization method to update variables
    in an alternating manner. Furthermore, we proposed a low-complexity algorithm
    under the MM algorithm framework in which there exists closed-form solutions at
    each iteration. Our simulation results have demonstrated the significant spectral
    and energy efficiency enhancement of the IRS in multigroup multicast systems and
    that the proposed algorithm converges rapidly in terms of CPU time. Appendix A
    The Proof of Theorem 1 We perform some equivalent transformations of the rate
    expression (6) to show its hidden convexity, as follows R k (F,e) = log 2 (1+
    | e H H k f g | 2 ∑ G i≠g | e H H k f i | 2 + σ 2 k ) = log 2 (1+ r −1 k,−g |
    e H H k f g | 2 ) =− log 2 (1− ( r k,−g +| e H H k f g | 2 ) −1 | e H H k f g
    | 2 ) =− log 2 (1− r −1 k | t k | 2 ), (48) View Source where t k = e H H k f
    g , r k = r k,−g +| t k | 2 , and r k,−g = ∑ G i≠g | e H H k f i | 2 + σ 2 k .
    Denoting R k ( t k , r k ) as the last equation expression of R k (F,e) in (48),
    R k ( t k , r k ) is jointly convex in { t k , r k } [39], thus its lower bound
    surrogate function could be obtained by the first-order approximation, e.g., R
    k ( t k , r k ) ≥ R k ( t n k , r n k )+ ∂ R k ∂ t k | t k = t n k ( t k − t n
    k ) + ∂ R k ∂ t ∗ k | t ∗ k = t n,∗ g ( t ∗ k − t n,∗ k )+ ∂ R k ∂ r k | r k =
    r n k ( r k − r n k ) = R k ( t n k , r n k )+2Re{ t n,∗ k ( t k − t n k ) r n
    k −| t n k | 2 }− | t n k | 2 ( r k − r n k ) r n k ( r n k −| t n k | 2 ) = R
    k ( t n k , r n k )+2Re{ t n,∗ k r n k −| t n k | 2 t k } − | t n k | 2 r n k
    ( r n k −| t n k | 2 ) r k − | t n k | 2 r n k −| t n k | 2 . (49) View Source
    Undo t k = e H H k f g , t n k =( e n ) H H k f n g , r k = ∑ G i=1 | e H H k
    f i | 2 + σ 2 k , and r n k = ∑ G i=1 |( e n ) H H k f n i | 2 + σ 2 k , and substitute
    them into the right hand side of the last equation in (49), we have R k (F,e)
    ≥ R k ( F n , e n )+2Re{ a k e H H k f g }− | t n k | 2 r n k −| t n k | 2 − b
    k ∑ i=1 G | e H H k f i | 2 − b k σ 2 k = const k +2Re{ a k e H H k f g }− b k
    ∑ i=1 G | e H H k f i | 2 = R ˜ k (F,e). (50) View Source Hence, the proof is
    complete. Appendix B The Proof of Theorem 1 The monotonic property of the objective
    function value sequence {F( F n , e n )} of Algorithm 1 can be guaranteed by (18).
    In addition, the sequence { F n , e n } generated at each iteration of Algorithm
    1 converges to a stable point as n→∞ because F n and e n are bounded in their
    feasible sets S F and S e , respectively [40]. Denote by { F o , e o } the converged
    solution. In the following, we prove that { F o , e o } is the KKT point based
    on the fact that all the locally optimal solutions (including the globally optimal
    solution) of a nonconvex optimization problem should satisfy the KKT optimality
    conditions [29]. Firstly, the Lagrangian of Problem (13) is given by L(F,γ, λ
    (1) , λ (2) ) = ∑ g=1 G γ g − ∑ g=1 G ∑ k∈ K g λ (1) k ( γ g − R ˜ k (F, e o |
    F o , e o )) − λ (2) (Tr[ F H F]− P T ) View Source where λ (1) =[ λ (1) 1 ,…,
    λ (1) K ] and λ (2) are the dual variables. Since F o is the globally optimal
    solution of Problem (13), there must exist a λ (1),o and λ (2),o satisfying the
    following partial KKT conditions: ∑ g=1 G ∑ k∈ K g λ (1),o k ∇ F ∗ R ˜ k (F, e
    o | F o , e o ) | F= F o − λ (2),o F o =0, λ (1),o k ( γ g − R ˜ k ( F o , e o
    | F o , e o ))=0,∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G, λ (2),o (Tr[ F H,o F o ]− P T )=0. (51) (52) (53)
    View Source According to the conditions (A1) and (A3), we have R ˜ k ( F o , e
    o | F o , e o ) ∇ F ∗ R ˜ k (F, e o | F o , e o ) | F= F o = R k ( F o , e o ),
    = ∇ F ∗ R k (F, e o ) | F= F o . (54) (55) View Source By substituting (55) and
    (54) into (51) and (52) respectively, we arrive at ∑ g=1 G ∑ k∈ K g λ (1),o k
    ∇ F ∗ R k (F, e o ) | F= F o − λ (2),o F o =0, λ (1),o k ( γ g − R k ( F o , e
    o ))=0,∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G. (56) (57) View Source Then, e o is the locally optimal solution
    of Problem (16) and satisfies the following KKT conditions: ∑ g=1 G ∑ k∈ K g ξ
    (1),o k ∇ e ∗ R ˜ k ( F o ,e| F o , e o ) | e= e o − ∑ m=1 M ξ (2),o m ( ∇ e ∗
    | e m |) | e= e o − ξ (2),o M+1 ( ∇ e ∗ e M+1 ) | e= e o =0, ξ (1),o k ( κ g −
    R ˜ k ( F o , e o | F o , e o ))=0,∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G, ξ (2),o m (| e o m |−1)=0,1≤m≤M,
    ξ (2),o M+1 ( e o M+1 −1)=0, (58) (59) (60) View Source where ξ (1),o =[ ξ (1),o
    1 ,…, ξ (1),o K ] and ξ (2),o are the optimal Lagrange multipliers. Furthermore,
    it can be readily checked that ∇ e ∗ R ˜ k ( F o ,e| F o , e o ) | e= e o = ∇
    e ∗ R k ( F o ,e) | e= e o . (61) View Source By substituting (61) into (58),
    we arrive at ∑ g=1 G ∑ k∈ K g ξ (1),o k ∇ e ∗ R k ( F o ,e) | e= e o − ξ (2),o
    M+1 ( ∇ e ∗ e M+1 ) | e= e o − ∑ m=1 M ξ (2),o m ( ∇ e ∗ | e m |) | e= e o =0,
    (62) View Source Now, we move to Problem (8). The general equivalent problem of
    the max-min Problem (8) is given by max F,e,r s.t. ∑ g=1 G r g F∈ S F ,e∈ S e
    R k (F,e)≥ r g ,∀k∈ K g ,∀g∈G. (63) View Source where r=[ r 1 ,…, r G ] T are
    auxiliary variables. It can be readily verified that the set of equations (56),
    (62), (57), (53), and (60) constitute exactly the KKT conditions of Problem (63).
    Hence, the proof is complete. Appendix C The Proof of Theorem 3 Since f g (F)
    is twice differentiable and concave, we propose a quadratic surrogate function
    to minorize f g (F) , as follows f g (F)≥ f g ( F n )+2Re{Tr[ D H g (F− F n )]}
    +Tr[(F− F n ) H M g (F− F n )] (64) View Source where matrices D g ∈ C N×N and
    M g ∈ C N×N are determined to satisfy conditions (A1)–(A4). Note that (A1) and
    (A4) are already satisfied. Then we prove that condition (A3) also holds. Let
    F ˜ be a matrix belonging to S F . The directional derivative of the right hand
    side of (64) at F n with direction F ˜ − F n is given by: 2Re{Tr[ D H g ( F ˜
    − F n )]}. (65) View Source The directional derivative of f g (F) is 2Re ⎧ ⎩ ⎨
    Tr ⎡ ⎣ ∑ k∈ K g g k ( F n )( C H k −( F n ) H B k )( F ˜ − F n ) ⎤ ⎦ ⎫ ⎭ ⎬ , (66)
    View Source where g k ( F n ) is defined in (28). In order to satisfy condition
    (A3), the two directional derivatives (65) and (66) must be equal, which means
    D g = ∑ k∈ K g g k ( F n )( C k − B H k F n ). (67) View Source Now we proceed
    to prove that condition (A2) also holds. If surrogate function f ˜ g (F| F n )
    is a lower bound for each linear cut in any direction, condition (A2) could be
    satisfied. Let F= F n +γ( F ˜ − F n ),∀γ∈[0,1] . Then, it suffices to show f g
    ( F n +γ( F ˜ − F n ))≥ f g ( F n )+2γRe{Tr[ D H g ( F ˜ − F n )]} + γ 2 Tr[(
    F ˜ − F n ) H M g ( F ˜ − F n )], (68) View Source Let us define L g (γ)= f g
    ( F n +γ( F ˜ − F n )), and l k (γ)= R ˜ k ( F n +γ( F ˜ − F n )). Now, a sufficient
    condition for (68) to hold is that the second derivative of the right hand side
    of (68) is lower than or equal to the second derivative of the left hand side
    of (68) for ∀γ∈[0,1] and ∀ F ˜ ,∀ F n ∈ S F , which is formulated as follows ∂
    2 L g (γ) ∂ γ 2 ≥2Tr[( F ˜ − F n ) H M g ( F ˜ − F n )]. (69) View Source In order
    to calculate the left hand side of (69), we first calculate the first-order derivative,
    as follows ∂ L g (γ) ∂γ = ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) ∇ γ l k (γ), (70) View Source where
    g k (γ) ∇ γ l k (γ) Q H k q k f = exp{− μ g l k (γ)} ∑ k∈ K g exp{− μ g l k (γ)}
    ,k∈ K g , =2Re{Tr[ C H k ( F ˜ − F n )] −Tr[( F n +γ( F ˜ − F n ) ) H B k ( F

    F ˜ − F n ) ) H B k , =vec( Q k ), =vec( F ˜ − F n ), View Source Then, the second-order
    derivative is derived as ∂ 2 L g (γ) ∂ γ 2 = ∑ k∈ K g ( g k (γ) ∇ 2 γ l k (γ)−
    μ g g k (γ) ∇ γ l k (γ) ( ∇ γ l k (γ)) T ) + μ g ⎛ ⎝ ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) ∇ γ l k

    l k (γ) =−2Tr[( F ˜ − F n ) H B k ( F ˜ − F n )] =−2f H (I⊗ B k )f. View Source
    We reformulate ∂ 2 L g (γ) ∂ γ 2 in (71) into a quadratic form of f , as follows
    ∂ 2 L g (γ) ∂ γ 2 =[ f H f T ]Φ[ f f ∗ ], View Source where Φ is given in (72)
    shown at the bottom of this page. Φ g = ∑ k∈ K g ( g k (γ)[ −I⊗ B k 0 0 −I⊗ B

    ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) q ∗ k ] [ ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) q k ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) q ∗ k ] H . (72)
    View Source We also manipulate the right hand side of (69) into a quadratic form
    of f by using vectorization operation Tr[ A T BC]= vec T (A)(I⊗B)vec(C) [41],
    as follows 2Tr[( F ˜ − F n ) H M g ( F ˜ − F n )] =[ f H f T ][ I⊗ M g 0 0 I⊗
    M T g ][ f f ∗ ]. View Source Then, (69) is equivalent to [ f H f T ] Φ g [ f
    f ∗ ] ≥[ f H f T ][ I⊗ M g 0 0 I⊗ M T g ][ f f ∗ ], View Source where we need
    to find an M g that satisfies Φ g ⪰[ I⊗ M g 0 0 I⊗ M T g ]. View Source For convenience,
    we choose M g = α g I= λ min ( Φ g )I . Finally, (64) is equivalent to f g (F)
    ≥ f g ( F n )+2Re{Tr[ D H g (F− F n )]} + α g Tr[(F− F n ) H (F− F n )] =2Re{Tr[
    U H g F]}+ α g Tr[ F H F]+ consF g (73) View Source where U g and consF g are
    given in (27) and (31), respectively. α g in (29) is difficult to obtain for the
    complex expression of Φ g . In the following, we proceed to obtain the value of
    α g . The following inequalities and equalities will be used later: (B1): [41]
    A and B are Hermitian matrices: λ min (A)+ λ min (B)≤ λ min (A+B). (B2): [41]
    A is rank one: λ max (A)=Tr[A], λ min (A)=0 . (B3): (Theorem 30 in [42]) a k and
    b k are positive: ∑ K k=1 a k b k ≤ max K k=1 { b k } , if ∑ K k=1 a k =1 . (B4):
    [41] A is positive semidifinite with maximum eigenvalue λ max (A) and B is positive
    semidifinite: Tr[AB]≤ λ max (A)Tr[B] . Φ g is complex and cannot be determined
    by a constant, thus we use (A1)–(A4) to find its lower bound shown in (74) shown
    at the bottom of this page. λ min ( Φ g ) ≥ (B1) − ∑ k∈ K g g k (γ) λ max ([ I⊗

    (74) with (75), we arrive at (29). Hence, the proof is complete. Appendix D The
    Proof of Theorem 4 Since f g (e) is twice differentiable and concave, we minorize
    f g (e) at e n with a quadratic function, as follows f g (e)≥ f g ( e n )+2Re{

    g ∈ C M×1 and matrices N g ∈ C M×M are determined to satisfy conditions (A1)–(A4).
    Obviously, (A1) and (A4) are already satisfied. In order to satisfy condition
    (A3), the directional derivatives of f g (e) and the right hand side of (77) must
    be equal, yielding d g = ∑ k∈ K g g k ( e n )( a k − A H k e n ), (78) View Source
    where g k ( e n ) is defined in (41). Let e= e n +γ( e ˜ − e n ),∀γ∈[0,1] . In
    order to satisfy condition (A2), it suffices to show f g ( e n +γ( e ˜ − e n ))≥
    f g ( e n )+2γRe{ d H g ( e ˜ − e n )} + γ 2 ( e ˜ − e n ) H N g ( e ˜ − e n ).
    (79) View Source Then, we need to calculate the second-order derivatives of the
    left hand side and the right hand side of (79), and make the latter one lower
    than or equal to the former for ∀γ∈[0,1] and ∀ e ˜ ,∀ e n ∈ S e . The second-order

    derivative of the right hand side of (79) is 2( e ˜ − e n ) H N g ( e ˜ − e n
    ) =[ t H t T ][ I⊗ N g 0 0 I⊗ N T g ][ t t ∗ ]. (84) View Source Combining (80)
    with (84), N g must satisfy Ψ g ⪰[ I⊗ N g 0 0 I⊗ N T g ]. View Source For simplicity,
    we choose N g = β g I= λ min ( Ψ g )I . Eventually, (77) is equivalent to f g
    (e) ≥ f g ( e n )+2Re{ d H g (e− e n )}+ β g (e− e n ) H (e− e n ) =2Re{ u H g
    e}+ consE g , (85) View Source where u g , β g , and consE g are given in (40),
    (42), and (44), respectively. The last equation of (85) is from the unit-modulus
    constraints, i.e., e H e=( e n ) H e n =M+1 . The method to get the value of β
    g is similar as α g , so we omit it here. Hence, the proof is complete. Appendix
    E The Proof of Theorem 5 Let us denote the converged solution of Problem (24)
    by { F o , e o } . In the following, we prove that { F o , e o } satisfies the
    KKT conditions of Problem (24). Firstly, since F o is the globally optimal solution
    of Problem (32), the KKT conditions of the Lagrangian in (33) of Problem (32)
    is given by ∑ g=1 G ∇ F ∗ f ˜ g (F| F n ) | F= F o − τ o F o =0, τ o (Tr[ F H,o
    F o ]− P T )=0, (86) (87) View Source where τ o is the optimal Lagrange multiplier.
    According to the condition (A3), we have ∇ F ∗ f ˜ g (F| F n ) | F= F o = ∇ F
    ∗ f g (F, e o ) | F= F o . (88) View Source By substituting (88) into (86), we
    arrive at ∑ g=1 G ∇ F ∗ f g (F, e o ) | F= F o − τ o F o =0, (89) View Source
    Then, since e o is the locally optimal solution of Problem (45), it is readily
    to obtain the following KKT conditions: ∑ g=1 G ∇ e ∗ f g ( F o ,e) | e= e o −
    ∑ m=1 M τ (2),o m ( ∇ e ∗ | e m |) | e= e o − τ (2),o M+1 ( ∇ e ∗ e M+1 ) | e=
    e o =0, τ (2),o m (| e o m |−1)=0,1≤m≤M, τ (2),o M+1 ( e o M+1 −1)=0, (90) (91)
    View Source where τ (2),o =[ τ (2),o 1 ,…, τ (2),o M+1 ] are the optimal Lagrange
    multipliers. Then, the set of equations (89), (87), (90), and (91) constitute
    exactly the KKT conditions of Problem (24). Hence, the proof is complete. Authors

    FOREWORD

    Special Section on Smart Radio and Its Applications in

    Conjunction with Main Topics of SmartCom

    Aiming at tackling with the rapid growth of mobile trafﬁc and consequently the
    spectrum scarcity problem, research

    and development on highly efﬁcient spectrum resource utilization have become more
    and more active. Meanwhile,

    discussions for next generation wireless networks such as 5G and beyond mobile
    communications have been started

    which could support a wide variety of applications including Machine-to-Machine
    (M2M), Internet of Things (IoT),

    etc. Such multi-functional wireless terminals and/or advanced wireless networks
    can be treated as Smart Radio. The

    concept of Smart Radio covers: reconﬁgurable software deﬁned radio; cognitive
    radio and dynamic spectrum access

    functionality; heterogeneous and cooperative wireless networks; and their integrations.
    Under such circumstances,

    much interest recently due to its ubiquitous message exchange and content sharing
    among smart vehicles with the development of the mobile communication and computation
    technologies. In this paper, we investigate the policy for jointly communication
    mode selection, resource block assignment, and power control in device-to-device-enabled
    vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) based IoV communication networks with the purpose of
    guaranteeing the strict ultra-reliable and low latency communications requirements
    of V2V links while maximizing the sum capacity of vehicle-to-infrastructure links.
    Considering the unknown environments dynamics as well as the continuous-valued
    state and action space in IoV networks, we exploit a decentralized actor-critic
    reinforcement learning model with a new reward function to learn the policy by
    interacting with the environment. Moreover, we propose an efficient transfer actor-critic
    learning (ETAC) approach to effectively enhance the learning efficiency and improve
    the learning convergence speed, in order to support reliable and delay-sensitive
    vehicular services in IoV networks. Simulation results show that the proposed
    ETAC approach can effectively reduce the generated interference in IoV networks
    and ensure the latency and reliability requirements of V2V link, as well as achieve
    the fast convergence speed and high convergence stability, compared with other
    existing approaches. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology (

    SECTION I. Introduction With the rapid development of smart vehicles, Internet
    of vehicles (IoV) has been emerging as a promising vision for the road safety,
    collision avoidance, and information transmission services in intelligent transportation
    systems [1]–[5]. With the help of IoV, smart vehicles can be inter-connected to
    the internet and intelligently exchange information and contents among smart vehicles
    with the minimal human interaction [6]. It also applies the mobile communication
    technology to realize the inter-communication and coordination among vehicle-to-everything
    (V2X), such as vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications and vehicle-to-vehicle
    (V2V) communications, which can greatly improve the traffic safety and efficiency,
    and reduce the unfortunate incidents and congestion of the road traffic [7]. In
    IoV networks [8], the information applications and messages sharing require frequent
    access to the servers and the internet, which involve the considerable amount
    of transmission data rate provided by V2I links with high-capacity requirements,
    and the safety-critical information exchange supported by V2V links with the strict
    ultra-reliable and low latency communications (URLLC) requirements [9], [10].
    For example, the METIS reports that a maximum latency of 5 ms, and with the transmission
    reliability of 99.999 % of 1600 bytes message sizes in V2V links [11]. Hence,
    there is a strong desire for searching efficient resource management approaches
    to support the above communication requirements in IoV networks. Recently, various
    resource allocation approaches have been proposed in IoV communication networks,
    in order to ensure the quality-of-service (QoS) or quality of experience (QoE)
    requirements of vehicle users (VUEs) and effectively improve the network capacity.
    The literatures [12]–[14] presented the optimal resource allocation approaches
    to improve the network performance (e.g., transmission reliability, resource utilization,
    road safety, etc.) in cloud-enabled vehicular networks. The authors in [15] and
    [16] addressed the multiple access problem for vehicular sensor networks with
    considering the latency- sensitive requirements. In [17] and [18], the metric
    of efficient resource allocation and interference management was studied in cellular
    V2X communications, which can achieve a higher link rate and greater link reliability.
    Moreover, many software -defined networking-based resource allocation schemes
    were presented to utilize the VUEs states information to guarantee various VUEs
    QoS or QoE [19], [20]. Device-to-device-enabled V2V (D2D-V2V) communication is
    identified as a promising candidate for IoV networks with the high efficient and
    reliable properties [9], [10], [18], [21]–[25], because D2D-V2V communication
    has the ability to reduce transmission latency and power consumption by directly
    providing local message dissemination, and enhance the spectrum efficiency due
    to the proximity and reusing gain [24], [26]. Zhou et al. [3] investigated the
    combination of both the physical layer and social layer to achieve the rapid message
    dissemination in D2D-V2V-based IoV networks. The literature [21] investigated
    the problem of maximizing the individual data rate within the D2D-assisted IoV
    for mobile health by considering different levels of emergency. In addition, for
    D2D-V2V-based IoV networks, the studies [6], [22], [23] jointly considered and
    optimized the performance of both V2V and V2I communications under a wide variety
    of intelligent vehicular applications, and the outage probability performance
    of D2D-V2V links was performed in [24]. In [18], a matrix game theoretical scheme
    was presented to solve the resource management optimization problem in D2D-based
    vehicular networks. The above works [18], [21]–[25] mainly pay attention to the
    physical layer information, and the different kinds of QoS requirements (e.g.,
    strict latency, reliability, etc.) of V2V links has not been well investigated
    in IoV networks. There exist many studies on the resource management in D2D-based
    V2X or IoV networks with considering the stringent latency and reliability constraints
    [5], [9], [27]–[33]. The resource block scheduling and power control algorithms
    were proposed to satisfy the latency and reliability requirements of V2V links
    [9], [27], [28]. In order to enhance the network performance, more researchers
    have started to joint investigate both the V2V and V2I communications [5], [9],
    [29]–[33], specifically, to improve the capacity performance of V2I links while
    satisfying the latency and reliability constraints of V2V links. Silva et al.
    [5] investigated the ethical implications of broader social IoV systems, and analyzed
    the enhancement of the road safety and traffic efficiency with the autonomous
    decision making of V2I and V2V links. Liang et al. proposed two resource allocation
    approaches to maximize the sum capacity of V2I links while satisfying the reliability
    constraints of V2V links in D2D-based V2X communication networks [9], [29]. Furthermore,
    a joint mode selection and resource allocation scheme was proposed to maximize
    the sum capacity of Pedestrian users and V2V links [30]. Even the above works
    [5], [9], [27]–[33] can achieve the considerable performance, they are not intelligent
    enough to efficiently manage the network resource among smart vehicles with high-level
    intelligence in IoV networks. Reinforcement learning (RL) is one of the most powerful
    machine learning tools for policy control and intelligent decision making [34],
    which has been widely adopted in wireless communications [35]–[37]. Recently,
    many works have applied the reinforcement learning tool (e.g., Q-leaning and deep
    Q-leaning) to solve the intelligent resource management and decision making problem
    in V2X or IoV networks [38]–[45]. Liu et al. [38] proposed a distributed cooperative
    reinforcement learning approach to manage the traffic with the help of the V2X
    networks dynamic clustering design, in order to balance the traffic load. In [39],
    a deep Q-network approach was proposed to improve both the traffic safety and
    satisfy VUEs QoS requirements in a green IoV networks. The literature [4] combined
    the RL and software defined network to realize the cognitive capability for IoV
    networks, in order to search the optimal routing policy under dynamic environments.
    The Q-learning is adopted in [40]–[42] to realize intelligent learning strategies
    to improve the V2V communication performance by interacting with the vehicular
    environments. The literatures [43], [44] presented some case studies that how
    to apply the RL tool to manage network resources in intelligent V2X networks.
    Moreover, Ye et al. [45] proposed a decentralized resource allocation approach
    in V2X networks based on a multi-agent deep Q-learning with considering the latency
    constraints of V2V links. Unfortunately, most popular optimization technologies
    [5], [9]–[11], [18], [21]–[33] are not suitable for IoV communication networks
    due to the unknown dynamic vehicular environment and the high intelligent and
    adaptive scheduling demands of IoV. In addition, the above works [38]–[45] based
    on Q-learning or deep Q-learning are capable of intelligently manage the network
    resource in IoV networks, but Q-learning has low convergence speed and the deep
    Q-learning framework may not always suitable to deal with continuous-valued state
    and action spaces in IoV networks. According to the above analysis, in this paper,
    an efficient transfer actor-critic (AC) RL approach is proposed to address the
    intelligent resource management problem in D2D-V2V- based IoV networks, in order
    to maximize the network capacity while guaranteeing the strict URLLC requirements
    of V2V links. The AC approach can efficiently deal with the continuous-valued
    state and action spaces (e.g., channel information, transmit power, etc.), where
    the actor is used to exploit the stochastic actions and the critic is applied
    to estimate the state-action value function. The main contributions of our work
    can be summarized as follows: This paper firstly presents a joint mode selection,
    resource block (RB) assignment and transmit power control scheme to maximize the
    overall network capacity in D2D-V2V-based IoV networks while satisfying the QoS
    requirements of V2I links, and ensuring the strict URLLC requirements of V2V links.
    In addition, the decision making problem is formulated as a decentralized RL framework,
    thus V2I and V2V links are capable of intelligently making their adaptive decisions
    to improve their performance based on the instantaneous observations under high
    dynamic vehicular environments. In order to support reliable and delay-sensitive
    vehicular applications in D2D-V2V-based IoV networks, an efficient transfer AC
    (ETAC) learning approach is proposed to learn the optimal policy for the intelligent
    resource management under the continuous-valued state and action variables. In
    detail, in IoV networks, the new VUE or the existing VUE with poor leaning performance
    can utilize the transferred information from the expert VUE to model its own learning
    framework with a small transmission overhead, which can effectively enhance the
    learning efficiency and improve the learning convergence speed. Moreover, the
    eligibility trace mechanism is adopted to achieve the better convergence property
    and the advantage function is applied to avoid the high policy gradient variance.
    We evaluate and analyze the performance of our proposed ETAC approach from the
    perspectives of the convergence, optimality and stability. In addition, we compare
    it with the classical AC learning, the Q-learning and the random search approaches
    from perspectives of sum rate, the probability of satisfied V2I and V2V links
    under different scenarios. Simulation results prove that our proposed ETAC approach
    can efficiently deploy intelligent resource management for dynamic IoV networks.
    Non-coordinated resource allocation (denoted as non-coordinated RA): Each cell
    selfishly optimize its joint subcarrier and power allocation strategy to maximize
    its data rate while guaranteeing the practical constraints in each cell without
    coordinating with other cells. The rest of this paper can be organized as follows.
    Section II shows the system model and formulates the optimization problem. In
    Section III, we model the resource management problem as a Markov decision making
    process and the AC learning approach is adopted to address it. The ETAC learning
    approach is presented in this section, too. The simulation results and analysis
    are presented in Section IV. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. SECTION II.
    System Model and Problem Formulation A. System Model We consider a D2D-V2V-based
    IoV network, as shown in Fig. 1, the IoV communications can be mainly divided
    into two parts: V2I communication between VUEs and the base station (BS), and
    V2V communication among VUEs on the road which is a form of D2D communication
    by directly communicating with each other when two VUEs are close to each other,
    called D2D-V2V communication. All smart VUEs have the ability to choose both V2I
    and V2V communication connections based on their requirements. Fig. 1. The D2D-V2V-based
    IoV communication network. Show All The D2D-V2V-based IoV network consists K cellular
    VUEs (denoted C-VUEs) in the V2I communication form and M D2D-V2V pairs (The corresponding
    VUEs are denoted by D-VUEs) in the D2D-V2V communication form, where each VUE
    is equipped with one single antenna. The C-VUE set and D2D-V2V pairs set are K={1,2,…,K}
    and M={1,2,…,M} , respectively. The network adopts the orthogonal frequency division
    multiple access (OFDMA) technique to serve VUEs in the uplink scenario, and there
    are a set N={1,2,…,N} of N=K+ N U orthogonal RBs being allocated to the VUEs,
    where K and N U are the number of used RBs for C-VUEs and the number of current
    unused RBs. We assume that each C-VUE is only allocated with one RB, and its RB
    can be reused at most one D2D-V2V pair. Each D2D-V2V pair can only reuse one RB
    of the C-VUE. Let h k and h m denote the channel gains of the desired transmission
    for C-VUE k and D2D-V2V pair m , respectively. Let g k,m denotes the interference
    channel gain between C-VUE k and the receiver of the m -th D2D-V2V pair. Let g
    k,m,B denotes the interference channel gain from the transmitter of the m -th
    D2D-V2V pair to the BS on the k -th C-VUE’ RB. We assume that all the above channel
    gains include the path loss, shadowing fading and small-scale fading [9]. B. D2D-V2V
    Communication Modes In the D2D-V2V-based IoV network, each D2D-V2V pair can select
    one of the following three communication modes, as shown in Fig. 1. 1) Reuse Mode:
    In this mode, two D-VUEs communicate directly by utilizing the uplink RBs resource
    of C-VUEs when the two D-VUEs are close with each other. In this case, even the
    spectrum efficiency can be enhanced, the interference between the D2D-V2V pair
    and the C-VUE is incurred. In the reuse mode, the C-VUE will suffer the interference
    from the D2D-V2V pair when it shares its RB resource with the D2D- V2V pair. Then,
    the received instantaneous uplink signal-to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
    at the BS for the k -th C-VUE is given by ξ c(1) k,m = P c(1) k,m h k P d(1) k,m
    g k,m,B + σ 2 (1) View Source where P c(1) km and P d(1) km indicate the transmit
    power levels of C-VUE k and the m -th D2D-V2V’ transmitter on the k -th C-VUE’
    RB in the reuse mode, respectively. σ 2 is the noise power and we assume all VUEs
    have the equal noise power. On the other hand, RB resource reusing will also cause
    the interference to the D2D-V2V link, where the interference is generated from
    the co-channel C-VUE on the reused RB. Then, the received uplink SINR at the receiver
    of D2D-V2V pair m when reusing the RB of C-VUE k can be given by ξ d(1) k,m =
    P d(1) k,m h m P c(1) k,m g k,m + σ 2 (2) View Source 2) Dedicated Mode: In the
    dedicated mode, a RB resource should be allocated to only one D2D-V2V pair when
    two D-VUEs communicate directly and they are nearby, and this RB is empty that
    it is not currently utilized by C-VUEs or other D-VUEs. The uplink SNR of D2D-V2V
    pair m on the unused RB is expressed as ξ d(2) m = P d(2) m h m / σ 2 (3) View
    Source where P d(2) m denotes the transmit power of D2D-V2V pair m on the unused
    RB in the dedicated mode. 3) Cellular Mode: In this mode, two D-VUEs cannot directly
    communicate with each other if they are far away from each other or the channel
    gain between them is poor. Under this case, two D-VUEs can communicate through
    the BS (as a relay) as conventional C-VUEs, and two RBs (one uplink and one uplink)
    are allocated to this D2D-V2V pair. In this case, we assume that the RB is not
    allocated to any other D2D-V2V pair. The uplink SNR of D2D-V2V pair m on the unused
    RB can be written as ξ d(3) m = P d(3) m h m / σ 2 (4) View Source where P d(3)
    m denotes the transmit power of the m -th D2D- V2V pair on the unused uplink RB
    in the cellular mode. In this paper, we focus on the resource management in the
    uplink and assume that the BS can allocate its resource to guarantee that the
    downlink SNR is not less than ξ d(3) m [26]. In general, when the C-VUE’ RB is
    not currently reused by any other D2D pairs, it will not suffer the interference
    from D2D-V2V pairs. In this case, the received uplink SNR at the BS for the k
    -th C-VUE can be given by ξ c(2) k = P c(2) k h k / σ 2 (5) View Source where
    P c(2) k denotes the transmit power of C-VUE k in this case. Then, the sum data
    rate of C-VUE k and D2D- V2V pair m over their allocated RBs can be given by R
    c k = x d(1) k,m log 2 (1+ ξ c(1) k,m ) +(1− ∑ m∈M x d(1) k,m ) log 2 (1+ ξ c(2)
    k ) (6) View Source and R d m = ∑ k∈K ( x d(1) k,m log 2 (1+ ξ d(1) k,m )) + x
    d(2) m log 2 (1+ ξ d(2) m )+ x d(3) m log 2 (1+ ξ d(3) m ) (7) View Source respectively,
    where x d(1) k,m , x d(2) m and x d(3) m denote the mode selection indicators,
    with representing the reuse mode, the dedicated mode and the cellular mode, respectively.
    C. URLLC Requirements of IoV Communications In IoV networks, the D2D-V2V links
    may have different communication services, but these communication services can
    be mainly divided into two scenarios: the unicast scenario and the normal scenario,
    where the unicast scenario aims to guarantee the vehicular traffic safety by exchanging
    the safety information among VUEs, thus it has strict URLLC requirements but it
    has much looser constraint on the high data rate, while the normal scenario usually
    provides VUEs’ general communication services with the high data rate requirements
    but they have no strict latency and reliability demands. The above requirements
    should be considered into the resource management in practical IoV networks and
    they can be formulated as strict constraints in the mathematical way. Considering
    the requirements differentiation for different kinds of communication links, such
    as, the large data rate requirements for the V2I links and D2D-V2V links under
    the normal scenario, and the high strict latency and reliability for D2D-V2V links
    under the unicast scenario. As illustrated above, the minimum data rate requirement
    constraints of C-VUE k and D2D-V2V pair m under the normal scenario can be expressed
    as R c k ≥ R c,tar k ,∀k,and, R d,nor m ≥ R d,nor,tar m ,∀m (8) View Source respectively,
    where R d,nor m is the data rate of D2D-V2V pair m under the normal scenario.
    R c,tar k and R d,nor,tar m denote the minimum data rate requirements of C-VUE
    k and D2D-V2V pair m in the normal scenario, respectively. In contrast to the
    above the normal scenario with less strict constraints on the latency and reliability
    requirements, the D2D-V2V links under the unicast scenario have both the strict
    latency and reliability requirements even they have much looser constraint on
    the high data rate. According to the LTE standard [46], the transmission delay
    refers to the time interval from the application of the channel access to the
    successful packet transmission. The packet transmission delay is calculated as
    follows T tx = τ mac + τ data [37], where τ mac is the time needs to finish the
    three-way handshake process in the media access control (MAC) protocol, and τ
    data is the time needs to successfully complete one packet transmission τ data
    = L packet / R d , where L packet and R d are the amount of the data packet size
    in bits and the achievable link data rate, respectively. Then, the latency constraint
    for the m -th D2D-V2V pair under the unicast scenario is guaranteed by controlling
    the probability of exceeding the threshold value, where the current transmission
    delay T tx is beyond the predetermined threshold T max . And the probability should
    be less than the tolerable threshold p delay max , which can be expressed as p
    delay m =Pr{ T tx ≥ T max }≤ p delay max (9) View Source The reliability of the
    m -th D2D-V2V pair under the unicast scenario is satisfied by controlling the
    outage probability, where its transmission data rate R d,uni m is below the target
    threshold R d,uni,tar m . And the outage probability should be less than the tolerable
    outage probability p outage max , which is given by p outage m =Pr{ R d,uni m
    ≤ R d,uni,tar m }≤ p outage max (10) View Source D. Problem Formulation In this
    paper, our objective is to maximize the overall network capacity while guarantee
    the above mentioned QoS requirements of VUEs and satisfy the resource constraints

    and power control) problem can be mathematically formulated as s.t. max x,P {

    constraint (11c) indicates that one C-VUE’ RB is reused by one D2D-V2V pair at
    most. Constraint (11d) is to ensure that any D2D-V2V pair will choose at most
    one of the three modes. Constraint (11e) shows that the RBs used by all D2D-V2V
    pairs in the cellular and dedicated modes should not exceed the total number of
    unused RBs. Constraints (11f) and (11g) are to satisfy that the transmit power
    of each D2D-V2V pair and each C-VUE cannot exceed their maximum values, P d max
    and P c max , respectively. SECTION III. ETAC Learning for Intelligent Resource
    Management The optimization problem in (11) is difficult to solve as it is a non-convex
    combination and NP-hard problem. In addition, the IoV communication network needs
    an intelligent resource management framework to enable V2X communication links
    to intelligently make decision with high-level intelligence. Hence, in this section,
    an ETAC learning approach is proposed to address the intelligent resource management
    problem in IoV networks, where the different QoS requirements and constraints
    (e.g., latency and reliability requirements of V2V links or minimum data rate
    requirements of V2I links) can be directly addressed. Before presenting the proposed
    approach, the main parts of the RL based Markov Decision Process (MDP) are shown
    with a new proposed reward function, and an AC learning framework is adopted to
    address the intelligent resource management problem. Finally, the online solution
    based on ETAC is presented to learn the optimized policy for intelligent resource
    management in IoV networks. A. Markov Decision Process for Resource Management
    RL is an important part of machine learning [34], which has the ability to help
    the IoV communication network to exploit the optimal policy to maximize its profit.
    Similar to most of existing works [18], [28], we apply MDP to model the policy
    searching process in the RL formwork. In MDP model, a sequence of resource management
    decisions of a learning agent by interacting with the IoV environment at some
    discrete time scale can be defined as a tuple (S,A,P, r t ,γ) , where S denotes
    the network state space set, A means the action space set, P is the transition
    probability: P( s t+1 | s t , a t ) when the agent takes the action a t ∈A from
    the current network state s t ∈S to a new state s t+1 ∈S ; r t denotes the immediate
    reward at the current time slot. γ∈[0,1) is a discount factor. Agent: Each active
    V2I link and each active D2D-V2V link. State space: For each communication link
    (agent), the network state can be depicted as s={ χ rb , χ ch , χ cq , χ tl ,
    χ re } , where χ rb indicates all RBs occupy status among VUEs, χ ch shows the
    observed channel information, χ cq represents the selected channel quality (SINR
    or SNR), χ tl indicates the remaining transmission load of D2D-V2V links in the
    unicast scenario, and χ re indicates the QoS requirements, such as the minimum
    data rate, the latency and the reliability requirements. Action space: Three actions
    are considered for the intelligent resource management in the reinforcement learning
    framework. We denote a={ β ms , β rb , β po }∈A as the candidate of actions of
    one agent at the state s after making decision in terms of the communication mode
    selection ( β ms ), the RB assignment ( β rb ), and the transmit power level (
    β po ). Note: the action selection of each agent should satisfy the constraints
    (11c)-(11g). Reward function: The learning process is driven by the reward function
    in the RL framework, and each agent makes decision by maximizing its reward with
    the interactions of the environment. Considering the requirements differentiation
    for different types of IoV communication links, a new reward function for the
    intelligent resource management is proposed by following analysis. In the IoV
    network, the goal of RL is to learn the optimal policy to intelligently make decision
    based on the current environment states, through maximizing the expected reward.
    Hence, how to design an efficient reward function is very important, which directly
    determines that the optimal policy that the IoV network makes, and the considerable
    actions it takes. Considering the practical QoS differentiation for different
    types of communication links, we propose a new reward function for the intelligent
    resource management problem in IoV networks, which can be given by r= c 1 ( ∑

    utility (the sum data rate), the Part 2 and Part 3 are the immediate cost functions
    in terms of the unsatisfied latency and reliability requirements for unicast V2V
    links, the unsatisfied minimum capacity requirements for V2I links and normal
    V2V links, respectively. The coefficient c i , i∈{1,2,3} are the weights of the
    three parts in (12), and they are also used to for balancing the utility and cost.
    M uni denotes the D2D-V2V pairs set in the unicast scenario. If the policy is
    optimal, i.e., the highest transmission data rate is achieved with the lowest
    outage probability and transmission delay for different types of communication
    links in the IoV network, the reward value is large. In contrast, if the low transmission
    date rate, the frequent outage events happen and the high transmission delay in
    the network, all these negative factors will lead to the low reward value. The
    low reward value reflects the poor policy of the current learning mechanism, so
    the learning policy should be improved. In the IoV network, each agent aims to
    choose a policy π to maximize its expected reward. Let Q π (s,a) denotes the state-action
    function, which is a cumulative discounted reward for starting the network state
    s with a given policy π , which is expressed as Q π (s,a)=E{ ∑ t=1 ∞ γ t r t (
    s t , a t )| s 0 =s,π} (13) View Source The function Q π (s,a) in (13) is applied
    to evaluate how good the policy π is when taking the action at the current state
    s . It also can be computed recursively using the Bellman equation [34]–[36],
    which is expressed as Q π (s,a)=E{ r t ( s t , a t )+γ Q π ( s t+1 , a t+1 )}
    (14) View Source The goal of the intelligent resource management is to search
    the policy π that maximizes the network objective reward value, which is given
    by [34] J(π)=E{ Q π (s,a)}= ∫ S d(s) ∫ A π(s,a) Q π (b,a)dads (15) View Source
    where d(s) denotes the state distribution function, and π(s,a) is a stochastic
    policy with the state s over the current action a , which shows the conditional
    probability density of the action a at the state s . From (15), we observe that
    the policy can be optimized numerically by adopting the value iteration method
    [34] with the RL tools, such as Q-learning, policy gradient method, actor-critic
    and so on [34]. In the next subsection, a model-free RL is exploited to solve
    the intelligent resource management in IoV networks. B. AC Learning for Intelligent
    Resource Management The intelligent resource management problem formulated in
    Section II-D can be solved by applying the Q-learning, deep Q-learning and policy
    gradient methods. However, the Q-function or the Q-function approximator in the
    Q-learning network is slow to be learned [34], [35], leading to the low convergent
    rate, thus it may fail to search the optimal policy with the given iterations.
    Moreover, Q-learning is not capable of learning stochastic policies, where the
    IoV network has continuous action spaces with continuous- valued stochastic variables
    (e.g., channel condition, transmit power). In addition, the policy gradient method
    can achieve a good policy by operating the learning strategy in the policy space
    with the faster convergence rate than Q-learning, but it may converge to a local
    optimal policy. Hence, in order to learn the optimal policy for the intelligent
    resource management with the continuous-valued states and actions, an actor-critic
    learning algorithm is adopted to optimize the policy by combining the process
    of the policy learning and value learning designs with good convergence properties.
    The framework of the AC learning for the intelligent resource management in IoV
    networks is shown in Fig. 2. In the AC learning framework, there are two parts,
    namely, the actor and the critic, where the actor is represented through adopting
    a control policy with action selections based on the observed network state, and
    the critic evaluates the input policy by a reward function from the environment
    feedback. In IoV networks, V2I and V2V links can be regraded as agents and the
    network constitutes the environment. Each link observes the current network state,
    then it makes decision by itself based on its learned policy strategy without
    sharing its strategy with other links in a decentralized way. After that, the
    IoV environment provides a new network state and the immediate reward r in (12)
    to the agents. According to the feedback, all agents learn a new policy in the
    next step. Fig. 2. The AC learning for IoV communication networks. Show All 1)
    The Critic Process: The Critic Process: The goal of the critic part of the AC
    learning is to evaluate the quality of the policy that the learning framework
    searches. However, the optimal state-action function Q π (s,a) cannot be computed
    for the infinite state (observation state) with the Bellman equation [34]. For
    this problem, the AC learning can adopt the function estimator to approximate
    the value function [34]. The linear-function estimator is usually adopted to evaluate
    the function approximation [34], and the value function approximator can be written
    as Q ν (s,a)= ν T φ(s,a)= ∑ i∈L ν i T φ i (s,a) (16) View Source where φ(s,a)=(
    φ 1 (s,a),… φ M (s,a) ) T is the basis function vector when the network chooses
    the action a at the state s , ν(s,a)=( v 1 ,… v E ) T is the parameter vector
    of weights. L is the set of the elements in the state space. The temporal-difference
    learning scheme is also adopted in the AC reinforcement learning to compute the
    temporal difference (TD) error between the estimated value and the real value,
    which can be expressed as δ t = r t+1 +γ Q ν ( s t+1 , a t+1 )− Q ν ( s t , a
    t ) (17) View Source When adopting the linear function estimator shown in (16),
    the parameter vector of weights ν(s,a) can be updated by using the gradient descent
    method ν t+1 = ν t + β c δ t ∇ ν Q v (s,a)= ν t + β c δ t φ(s,a) (18) View Source
    where β c is the critic learning rate. After optimizing the parameter ν(s,a) in
    (18), then the actor updates its state-value function in (16). 2) The Actor Process:
    The stochastic Policy Gradient (PG) method [34] is usually adopted in the actor
    part to update the parameterized policies, in order to optimize the policy step
    by step to improve the objective function in (15). The policy π(s,a) can be initially
    built by using the parameter vector θ={ θ 1 , θ 2 ,…, θ u } , which is denoted
    by π θ (s,a)=Pr(a|s,θ) . Then, the gradient of the policy with respect to θ in
    terms of the objective function in (15) is given by ∇ θ J( π θ )== ∫ S d(s) ∫
    A ∇ π θ (s,a) Q π θ (s,a)dads (19) View Source The parameterized stochastic policy
    π θ (s,a) is generally represented by the Gibbs distribution [34], i.e., π θ (s,a)=
    exp( θ T ⋅Φ(s,a)) ∑ a ′ ∈A exp( θ T ⋅Φ(s, a ′ )) (20) View Source where Φ(s,a)
    is the feature vector [34]. Then, the policy parameter vector is updated based
    on the gradient of the objective reward in (15) as follows θ t+1 = θ t + β a ∇
    θ J( π θ ) (21) View Source where β a denotes the learning rate of the actor.
    C. ETAC for Intelligent Resource Management The previous subsection addresses
    the intelligent resource management problem by exploiting the classical AC learning
    approach to help the IoV network to smartly select communication mode, assign
    RBs and control transmit power under different QoS requirements. The AC learning
    is capable of optimizing the policy with the low computational cost and fast convergence
    properties by using the gradient method. However, the actor part using the policy
    gradient method may converge to a local optimal policy, and directly updating
    the actor and critic parts with the TD error value causes the AC learning to diverge.
    Moreover, in the high dynamic IoV environment, the classical AC learning in will
    lead to poor convergence performance due to the high variance of the gradient
    estimation. Consequently, motivating by the idea of transfer learning [27], we
    propose an efficient transfer AC learning approach to enhance the convergence
    speed and improve the learning efficiency toward the optimal policy in IoV networks,
    where a part of VUEs are encouraged to utilize the learned knowledge from their
    neighbors by exchanging information with each other, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig.
    3. Transfer AC learning based VUE-to-VUE teaching. Show All There are two following
    issues we should investigate when we propose the ETAC approach for the intelligent
    resource management in IoV networks. 1) The Expert VUE Selection: Let us consider
    that when a new VUE joins IoV networks, instead of building a MDP model, it searches
    a neighboring VUE as the expert to utilize the current learned strategy from the
    expert VUE (such as mode selection, RB assignment and transmit power). In addition,
    if one VUE has slow convergence performance or its QoS requirements fail to be
    satisfied based on its current policy, it can request one neighboring VUE as the
    expert to transfer the learned strategies. In order to search the expert, the
    VUEs can exchange the following three types of information among their neighbors,
    such as, the IoV communications types (V2I or V2V), the communication services
    (unicast scenario or normal scenario), and the QoS requirements (minimum capacity,
    reliability and latency requirements). The similarity level between the learning
    VUE and the expert VUE can be evaluated by adopted the Bregman Ball concept [26],
    and its calculation contains the above three metrics. The VUE has the highest
    similarity level with the learning VUE is selected as the expert VUE, and the
    learning VUE utilizes the transferred knowledge from the expert VUE. 2) Efficient
    Transfer AC Learning Based Learned Knowledge: The AC learning optimizes both the
    policy function (or actor parameter) and the value function (or critic parameter)
    alternately according to the transferred knowledge. We implement the ETAC learning
    process as follows: (i) Action Selection: Once the learning VUE finds its expert
    VUE who has the highest similarity, it utilizes the transferred action information
    from the expert VUE and its current action space to generate an overall action
    space range [ u tr , u cu ] , where u cu is the agent’ current selected action
    and u tr denotes the transferred action information (Note that we suppose u tr
    ≤ u cu ). After that, the agent greedily selects the actual action from them by
    interacting with the environment. Without loss of generality, at the network state,
    the selected action can be updated by μ(s)=ω u tr +(1−ω) u cu (22) View Source
    where ω∈[0,1] can be defined as the transfer rate, which will be decreased after
    each learning step to gradually remove the effect of the transferred strategy
    information on the new action selection. (ii) Critic Parameters Update: In order
    to avoid the bias generated by the approximated policy gradient, we use the squared
    value error between the value function approximator Q v (s,a) and the optimal
    Q π θ (s,a) to evaluate the quality of the parameter vector ν(s,a) in the critic
    part. Then, the squared value error between Q π θ (s,a) and Q v (s,a) is given
    by ε π θ ν (s,a)=[ Q π θ (s,a)− Q v (s,a) ] 2 (23) View Source From (23), the
    smaller the mean square error is, the more accurate the value function parameter
    ν(s,a) achieves. Considering the fact that the selected action and policy may
    affect both the immediate reward and the accumulative reward in the future learning
    process, only updating the parameter vector ν(s,a) is not enough. Hence, an eligibility
    trace mechanism is adopted to improve the convergence speed and the efficient
    learning way by encouraging each agent to overview all the rewards forward and
    better integrate them [34]. Let z t denotes the eligibility trace vector at the
    time step t , then, the update equations for the eligibility trace vector z and
    the critic parameter vector ν can be expressed as z t+1 ν t+1 =γ λ c z t +φ( s
    t , a t ) = ν t + β c δ t z t+1 (24) (25) View Source respectively, where λ c
    ∈[0,1] is the eligibility trace decay factor. With the help of the eligibility
    trace mechanism, the value function can be efficiently updated and hence the learning
    process can be improved. After optimizing the parameter ν(s,a) by minimizing the
    mean square error in (23), the actor updates its state-value function as Q v (s,a)=
    ν T φ(s,a) (26) View Source Finally, the nearest estimator of Q π θ (s,a) by Q
    v (s,a) is achieved iteratively by updating the parameter vector For the gradient
    function in (19), the baseline function b(s) is adopted to reduce policy gradient
    variance without changing the policy gradient value. We denote the best selection
    of baseline function is the state-value function V π (s) . Then, the gradient
    in (19) is expressed as ∇ θ J( π θ )= ∫ S d(s) ∫ A ∇ π θ (s,a)( Q ν (b)−b(s))dads
    (27) View Source When the estimated value Q ν (s,a) in (26) is sufficiently equal
    to the optimal value Q π θ (s,a) , the baseline function b(s)= V π (s) is the
    best baseline that achieves the minimum variance in the action-value function
    approximator. By submitting b(s)= V π (s) into (27), we can get ∇ θ J( π θ )=
    ∫ S d(s) ∫ A ∇ π θ (s,a) B π (s,a)dads (28) View Source where B π (s,a)= Q ν (s,a)−
    V π (s) is the advantage function [25]. (iii) Actor (Policy) Parameter Update:
    The updated is achieved after the optimization of the advantage function in (28),
    the policy gradient is given by ∇ θ J( π θ )= ∫ S d(s) ∫ A ∇ π θ (s,a) Q ν (s,a)dads
    (29) View Source Then, the policy parameter vector can be updated as θ t+1 = θ
    t + β a ∇ θ J( π θ ) (30) View Source If every action is executed under an infinite
    number of iterations at each network state, that is to say, the learning policy
    is greedy with the infinite explorations, the state-value function Q v (s,a) and
    the policy strategy π θ (s,a) will iteratively converge to the final points, respectively,
    with a probability of 1 [35], [36]. D. Online Solution Based Efficient Transfer
    AC Learning For the proposed ETAC approach, the value function parameter vector
    ν is updated in the critic part, while the policy parameter vector θ is updated
    by the actor, both these two parameter vectors can be updated iteratively and
    simultaneously. During the learning process, the eligibility trace mechanism is
    adopted to improve the efficient learning way and the learning process, the advantage
    function combined with the baseline approximator is used to decrease the variance
    in the gradient calculation as well as enhance the function estimation accuracy
    in the critic part, and the action strategy transfer leaning is presented to increase
    the convergence speed and improve the overall learning quality. The complete proposed
    ETAC approach is shown in Algorithm 1 (Note: the IoV environment simulators include
    the C-VUEs and D-VUEs, and their estimated channel state information (CSI). The
    positions of vehicles are randomly dropped on the road so that the CSI of V2V
    and V2I links is generated according to their current positions). In IoV networks,
    in each learning step, each communication link (agent) observes the current network
    state s (the RB occupy status, the channel quality, its QoS requirements, etc.),
    then it chooses an action a (mode selection, RB assignment, and transmit power
    level) according to the policy strategy π θ (s,a) . Then, the IoV environment
    provides a new network state and the immediate r reward in (12) to the agents.
    In the learning framework, the critic part then estimates the value function Q
    v (s,a) and calculates the TD error δ . At the same time, the critic updates the
    eligibility trace vector z as well as the critic parameter vector ν , and compute
    the advantage function B π (s,a) . After that, the actor part uses the advantage
    function to achieve the policy gradient ∇ θ J( π θ ) before updating its policy
    parameter vector θ by applying the policy gradient method. If a new VUE has just
    joined the network or one VUE has poor learning performance (e.g., fail to guarantee
    its QoS requirements or has poor convergence speed, etc.), then the transfer learning
    is operated for these VUEs to improve their learning efficiency. The parameters
    θ and ν in the ETAC learning framework will be improved with an infinite number
    of learning steps, when the efficient transfer AC leaning converges to the final
    value function and policy. Then, the best actions for the intelligent resource
    management are achieved for IoV networks. Generally, for most of communication
    links, the action of each VUE is chosen independently according to its own local
    information without sharing its learned strategy with other communication links
    if the VUE does not need to utilize the transferred strategy from any expert.
    Only when the new VUE or the VUE with poor learning performance requests the learned
    experience from its expert VUE by using a small transmission overhead. Hence,
    compared with the centralized IoV network, the advantage of our proposed efficient
    transfer AC learning approach is that the agent can learn independently when it
    has an efficient learning performance, rather than continuously exchange information
    among VUEs. Algorithm 1: ETAC for Intelligent Resource Allocation. Input: learning

    simulation results are conducted in Matlab R2016a to evaluate the performance
    of our proposed intelligent resource management based the ETAC approach in the
    IoV network, and we compare it with the following approaches: 1. The optimal resource
    management approach, which is achieved by solving the optimization problem (11)
    in a centralized way (denoted as Optimal), where each VUE can obtain the full
    knowledge of environment information; 2. AC learning by using the policy gradient
    method (denoted as AC-PG); 3. Q-learning approach (denoted as Q-learning); 4.
    Optimizing the objective function (11a) with the constraints from (11b) to (11g)
    by decomposing the problem (11) into two subproblems: i). mode selection and resource
    block, ii). power control, which can be solved iteratively in a centralized way,
    refers to [9], [10], [26] (denoted as Baseline 1); 5. Random search approach (denoted
    as random search). We consider a single cell where all smart vehicles are dropped
    in a crossroad (two roads cross each other) based on the spatial Poisson process,
    as shown in Fig. 1, and each road is a multi-lane freeway that passes through
    the cell with the BS being locating at the cell center. The C-VUEs and D-VUEs
    are randomly selected among the active smart vehicles, and each D-VUE can simultaneously
    build two D2D-V2V links (pairs). We use the simulation setup based on the Manhattan
    case detailed in 3GPP TR 36.885 [47]. The radio resource is organized in a number
    of uplink RBs with 180 kHz per RB in one time-slot (0.5 ms), and all RBs are with
    both the Non-Light-of-Sight (NLOS) links as well as the Light-of-Sight (LOS) links
    in IoV communications. In order to achieve the demand of the METIS project [11],
    we set the latency threshold T max = 5 ms, the transmission reliability is 0.001
    with the minimum capacity being 0.5 bits/s/Hz, the safety-critical message sizes
    are 1600 bytes and the SINR threshold in unicast links is 3dB. In order to satisfy
    the general communication services, the minimum capacity of C-VUE and D-VUE in
    normal links are 3.5 and 3 bits/s/Hz, respectively. We set c 1 = 1, c 2 = 10 3
    and c 3 = 10 to balance the utility and the cost in (12) [40], [45]. The RL approaches
    (ETAC, AC-PG and Q-learning) have the following same parameters’ values: the discount
    factor γ=0.95 , the trace decay factor λ c =0.3 and the learning rate is 0.02
    [34]. Other main simulation parameters are shown in Table I. TABLE I Simulation
    Parameters Fig. 4 shows the learning process of the five approaches in terms of
    the reward performance when the number of D-VUEs is 60 and the absolute vehicle
    speed is 40 km/h. We can see that the three RL approaches greatly outperform the
    random search approach, especially, the proposed ETAC approach achieves the best
    reward performance with the fastest convergence speed and the most stable learning
    process (less fluctuations) compared with other three approaches excepts the optimal
    approach. For the Q-learning approach, it needs more learning steps to optimize
    the Q-function approximator, so the slow convergence may fail to guarantee the
    strict latency requirements in IoV networks. In addition, the AC-PG learning approach
    has a fast convergence speed compared with Q-learning, but it may converge to
    the local optimal point. For the random search approach, its performance is worst
    among the five approaches, because it randomly search the policy only based on
    the current immediate reward, but it has the simple structure. The optimal approach
    is capable of searching the optimal policy in a centralized way with the best
    reward performance, while other four approaches search their optimized policy
    in a decentralized way. However, it is not practical that the optimal approach
    can simultaneously collects the feedback information from VUEs, and it needs a
    lot of transmission overhead. Our proposed approach adopts the efficient transfer
    learning to enhance the learning efficiency and the convergence rate, and the
    optimized policy will be learned after a finite number of learning steps. Fig.
    4. Learning process comparison. Show All Fig. 5 demonstrates the probability of
    the satisfied IoV communication links versus the number D-VUEs when the absolute
    vehicle speed is 40 km/h. From Fig. 5, we can see that the probability of the
    satisfied V2I and V2V links decreases as the increase number of active D-VUEs,
    because under the limited radio resource situation, the large number of V2V links
    need to be connected and different QoS requirements should to be satisfied, all
    approaches may fail to complete all the communication services with the large
    number of D-VUEs, leading to bring down the satisfied links. However, the proposed
    approach achieves a much larger satisfied probability for different IoV communication
    links to guarantee the minimum capacity, latency and reliability requirements
    through effectively searching the resource management policy, especially the performance
    gap between the proposed approach and other approaches (excepts the optimal approach)
    becomes more obviously when the number of D-VUEs is large. The high satisfied
    communication links indicates that the ETAC approach can effectively guarantee
    the strict latency and transmission reliability requirements of unicast V2V links,
    and ensure the minimum capacity requirements of V2I links and normal V2V links.
    We would like to mention that Baseline 1 approach has higher performance than
    AC-PG and Q-learning due to its centralized resource management policy at the
    BS, but it has lower performance than that of the ETAC approach due to its suboptimal
    solution by dividing the optimization problem into two subproblems. Fig. 5. Probability
    of satisfied IoV communication links with varying number of D-VUEs. Show All Fig.
    6 depicts the sum rate performance of V2I links and normal V2V links for the six
    approaches with different number of active D-VUEs when the absolute vehicle speed
    is 40 km/h. From Fig. 6, we can see that the performance of all approaches reduces
    as the increase number of D-VUEs. Because more D-VUEs increases the more V2V links,
    all links aim to share the fixed radio resource, consequently leading to the growing
    amount of generated interference to V2I links and normal V2V links, hence the
    sum rate performance reduces as the increase number of D-VUEs. It is interesting
    to note that our proposed approach and the Baseline 1 approach have the comparable
    sum rate performance and they outperform other approaches (except the optimal
    approach) through adjusting the decision making policy to manage network resource
    and effectively mitigating the total generated interference to V2I links and normal
    V2V links. However, even the optimal approach and Baseline 1 achieve the considerable
    performance, they performed in the BS in a centralized way which needs to continuously
    exchange information between VUEs and the BS, leading to the heavy transmission
    overhead. Fig. 6. Sum rate performance of V2I and normal V2V links with varying
    number of D-VUEs. Show All Fig. 7 shows the probability of satisfied IoV communication
    links with an increasing absolute vehicle speed, when the number active D-VUEs
    is 60. We observe that the probability of the satisfied communication links decreases
    as the vehicles move faster. Such the performance degradation results from the
    lower received desired power in IoV communication links due to the average increase
    inter-vehicle distance when the higher movement speed induces sparser traffic.
    In addition, the higher speed results in the high dynamic vehicular environment,
    resulting in the high observation uncertainties (e.g., the channel state information
    and the received interference), which decreases the learning efficiency, hence
    the more unsatisfied communication link events happen in the high vehicle speed
    regions. However, as the vehicle speed increases with high uncertainties, our
    proposed approach can still maintain the probability of satisfied IoV communication
    links at a considerable level, and outperforms other approaches with the higher
    satisfied probability (except the optimal approach), especially in the high vehicle
    speed regions. This reveals that the proposed ETAC approach are more stable and
    robust in high dynamic IoV networks. Fig. 7. Probability of satisfied IoV communication
    links with varying vehicle speed. Show All Fig. 8 presents the impact of the vehicle
    speed on the sum data rate of V2I and normal V2V links when the number active
    D-VUEs is 60. From the figure, the sum rate performance reduces as the increase
    of vehicle speed, because the high observation uncertainties are induced from
    the high dynamic vehicular network due to the high vehicle speed, so four approaches
    fail to find the optimal policy, especially the random search approach has the
    worst performance. However, our proposed approach can still achieves the better
    performance than other approaches under different vehicle speed values approaches
    (except the optimal approach). Fig. 8. Sum rate performance of V2I and normal
    V2V links with varying vehicle speed. Show All Finally, we compare the convergence
    computational time of the RL approaches, where the all approaches are run are
    run in the Matlab 2016a environment on a PC with Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700 CPU
    @ 3.40 GHz, 16 RAM, and the operating system is Windows 10 Ultimate 64 bits. Fig.
    9 shows the convergence computational time of different approaches with varying
    number of D-VUEs. (Note: The policy used in the IoV communication network for
    resource management is random at the beginning and then gradually improved by
    the updated learning strategy.). As the increase number of D-VUEs, all approaches
    need the more computational time to achieve the convergence. This is because that
    the vehicular environment becomes more complex and dynamic as the increase number
    of D-VUEs, all approaches need more iterations and computational time to converge
    their optimized solutions. However, we can observe that other two RL approaches
    (AC-PG and Q-learning) need more computational time to converge to their final
    solutions than our proposed ETAC approach, especially when the number of D-VUEs
    is large, the computational time gap between the two RL approaches and the proposed
    algorithm become more obvious. In addition, the convergence time of proposed ETAC
    approach is substantially less related to the number of D-VUEs than those of other
    two RL approaches. It is interesting to note that the random search approach needs
    the least computational time compared with other approaches, but it achieves the
    worse performance in terms of the probability of satisfied links and sum rate
    performance as shown from Fig. 5 to Fig. 8 in the paper. Fig. 9. Convergence computational
    time with varying number of D-VUEs. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion This paper
    has studied the joint mode selection, RB assignment and power control problem
    in D2D-V2V-based IoV networks, and formulated the intelligent resource management
    problem as a decentralized reinforcement learning model to ensure the URLLC requirements
    of unicast V2V links which maximizing the sum capacity of V2I links and normal
    V2V links. Since the dynamic environments as well as the continuous-valued state
    and action space exist in IoV networks, the model-free actor-critic learning framework
    is adopted to learn the optimal policy. Moreover, the ETAC approach was proposed
    to effectively enhance the learning efficiency and improve the learning convergence
    speed, in order to support reliable and delay-sensitive vehicular applications
    in IoV networks. Simulation results conforms that the proposed ETAC reinforcement
    learning approach can effectively learn to ensure the latency and reliability
    requirements of V2V links while minimizing the generated interference in IoV networks.
    In our future works, we will pay more attention to design efficient and robust
    reinforcement learning algorithms (e.g., combine with deep learning techniques),
    which can effectively provide” real time” analytics in the large-scale IoV communication
    networks, and it is capable of adapting resource management strategy for different
    scenarios in dynamic/complex IoV networks. Authors Figures References Citations

    in technology has caused an explosion in the number of devices connected to the
    Internet. Intel is projecting that the number of connected devices would reach
    200 billion by 2020 from the 2 billion devices in 2006 [1]. Also, according to
    Business Insiders, it is predicted that by 2020, 75% of vehicles will come with
    built-in Internet of Things (IoT) connectivity [2]. Therefore, with the unprecedented
    growth in the number of devices connected to the Internet, i.e., IoT, more and
    more challenges are emerging everyday. Nowadays, IoT applications are seen everywhere.
    In the last few years, many new terms associated with IoT has popped up, such
    as, but not limited to, smart health, smart cities, smart homes, smart transportation,
    smart agriculture and smart industry. Hence, the deployment of IoT systems will
    provide significant savings and revenues in many areas, in particular in providing
    monitoring and maintenance solutions. Therefore, this growth has forced businesses
    to adopt different strategies to cope with this exponential growth and the challenges
    associated with them, such as allocating sufficient spectrum bands in IoT applications.
    That includes transmission performance degeneration, spectrum scarcity, spectrum
    sharing, interference among devices, etc. Recently, the adaptation of Cognitive
    Radio Networks (CRNs) in IoT has shown equivalent or better performance than currently
    used networks such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX, Bluetooth, etc. Hence, opportunistic approaches
    for Radio Frequency (RF) spectrum control and management to optimize the scare
    spectrum resources is emerging as one of the main challenges. With the recent
    unprecedented increase of wireless communication systems, applications and their
    users limits spectrum resources and make connectivity between their interconnected
    objects a crucial task. Therefore, the demands for smart devices that can manage
    and configure its transmission parameters based on the spectrum availability in
    spatio-temporal dimensions are remarkably increased. Cognitive Radio (CR) is the
    best candidate technology; it is defined as an adaptive, intelligent radio and
    network technology that automatically detects available channels in a wireless
    spectrum and changes transmission parameters enabling more communications to run
    concurrently and also improves radio operating behavior [3]. The benefits of CR
    systems would be to [4]: relieve spectrum scarcity by broadcasting on unused spectrum
    and avoiding interference with primary licensee, avoid radio jamming and interference
    based on the selected Spectrum Sensing (SS) approach, support switch to power
    saving protocol, improve communication quality by using higher bandwidth services,
    and improve Quality of Service (QoS), since the availability, suitability and
    reliability will be enhanced. New spectrum resources can be gained by allowing
    non-licensee users, i. e., Secondary Users (SUs), to share a licensee users, i.e.,
    Primary User (PU), bands such that PUs should be always protected from SUs interference.
    Therefore, CR users must consider protecting the PUs over any other interest.
    There are three CR paradigms (i.e., schemes) by which a SU can share a PU’s spectrum
    band, these are: overlay, underlay and interweave. For overlay and underlay schemes,
    a SU can coexist with the PU without interference or with a minimum interference,
    since in underlay scheme transmission power of the SU should never exceed some
    limit, while in overlay scheme there is no such constraint; however, the SU should
    have a full knowledge about the PU’s signal, so that the SU can generate an orthogonal
    signal to the PU’s signal to eliminate interference. In the interweave scheme,
    a SU is allowed to transmit if and only if a PU is not utilizing its spectrum
    band; nevertheless, if the PU resumes its activity, the SU should leave the spectrum
    band by either switching to another band or by ceasing its activity if no vacancy
    exists. The CR works through a cognition cycle with four functional phases which
    are sensing, decision, sharing, and mobility. The cognition cycle begins with
    SS phase through which the available spectrum resources are detected over the
    selected spectrum band using different SS approaches. Based on the detection results,
    the decision is made to concurrently share the band, or to cease transmission
    in that band. Once a CR decides to exploit the band, a proper Medium Access Control
    (MAC) protocol is employed and power allocation should be considered to satisfy
    the PU protection. Finally, switching from band to another is performed through
    the mobility phase. This work initially discusses the main design factors of CR-based
    IoT systems. Moreover, the work reviews the most recent research works related
    to SS and spectrum sharing approaches, classifies the approaches, discusses their
    IoT applications, and introduces the criteria of selecting the most appropriate
    SS approach and MAC protocol for the CR-based IoT system. Furthermore, this work
    reviews and compares the applicable MAC protocols employed in this area. In addition,
    this work discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems. Finally, this work considers the challenges and possible future research
    directions and open issues. The contributions of this survey paper are: reviewing
    the recent existing works on the field of SS and sharing for CR-based IoT, discussing
    the design factors of CR-based IoT system and its main components, presenting
    and categorizing the SS approaches for IoT applications, identifying the main
    requirements for SS phase for IoT CR networks, developing the selection criteria
    of proper SS and sharing approaches for a proper CR-based IoT applications, discussing
    the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT system, and providing
    the future research directions and challenges. A list of acronyms used throughout
    this paper is provided in Table 1, while the remaining part of this paper is organized
    as follows; Section II describes the recent related works, Section III discusses
    the design factors of CR-based IoT, Section IV presents CR-based IoT design flow,
    Section V discusses the integration of emerging technologies with CR-based IoT
    systems, Section VI addresses some future research directions and open issues,
    and finally, Section VII provides the conclusions. TABLE 1 List of the Acronyms
    and Their Definitions SECTION II. Related Works A limited number of papers surveyed
    CR-based IoT and have discussed this topic from different perspectives. The survey
    in [5] briefly discusses the principle of IoT technology; moreover, it describes
    how CR system works, its applications, and challenges of implementing CR system
    in reality. Despite that the survey mentions the possibility of incorporating
    CR and IoT for smart applications; it does not describe how to achieve this goal
    and challenges that might be faced. The authors in [6] classified IoT technologies
    based on their orientations. Furthermore, they described the types of enabling
    technologies for IoT and discuss the IoT applications. Moreover, the authors explained
    the importance of adding cognitive capabilities to the IoT device for smart purposes.
    In addition, the authors considered the challenges of adopting CR capabilities
    in IoT and the SS paradigms for CR-based IoT. The survey did not cover how to
    incorporate different types of SS approaches and their IoT applications; the benefits
    of employing CRNs for IoT applications were not discussed either. The basis of
    the CR-based IoT is thoroughly explained in [7] where the principles of adopting
    CR in IoT applications were explained, as well as, possible architectures and
    frameworks were described. Moreover, the survey classified the frameworks based
    on features such as context awareness, scalablity, configurability and volume
    of data. The survey also considered real-world scenarios of CR-based IoT systems
    and the challenges that might be faced. Finally, the survey summarized the open
    issues and future research directions for hardware design of CR-based IoT. Despite
    that the survey focused on the CR module and the possibility of employing it for
    adding cognitive capability to IoT devices; the survey did not cover how to share
    vacant spectrum bands and employed MAC protocol, how to select the appropriate
    SS approach and which class of SS (i.e., narrowband or wideband) fits for a specific
    IoT application. On the other hand, the authors in [8] developed a comprehensive
    survey on the employed frameworks for spectrum sharing in CR-based IoT. The survey
    also reviewed the existing schemes of SS and spectrum sharing, the challenges
    and issues that might be encountered in the real world applications. In addition,
    the authors of the survey presented a general architecture with four layers for
    spectrum sharing process in CR-based IoT. The four layers are sensing, spectrum
    allocation, transmission power optimization, and security. However, the authors
    did not focus on the suitability of each SS approach for IoT applications and
    the selection of the proper MAC protocol. Different architectures have been proposed
    to implement IoT systems. The survey in [9] discussed the structure of IoT element
    and provided a thorough analysis of the possible architectures of IoT. Moreover,
    the work in [10] focused on Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) IoT which is composed
    of four layers, namely: applications, service, networking and sensing layers.
    A recently published survey in [11] discussed SS approaches in CNRs and addresses
    the recent advances in this technology, its challenges and future research directions.
    The survey presented SS approaches as two main categories, wideband and narrowband.
    Moreover, it discussed many of the available techniques of each category providing
    comparisons in each category as well as applications. The survey was concluded
    by highlighting the open research challenge of tackling attacks targeting secure
    SS and sharing. Nevertheless, all above-mentioned surveys paved the track for
    motivating more research works to tackle those points which were not covered.
    Table 2 summarizes the strong points of each survey paper along with some remarks
    on each. TABLE 2 Remarks on the Published Survey Papers on CR-Based IoT SECTION
    III. Design Factors of CR-Based IoT Systems The main objective of using IoT systems
    is to connect numerous heterogeneous devices and systems together to provide some
    smart services with minimal device resource requirements, i.e., power, hardware
    complexity and cost, i.e., expenses. To achieve this objective, the connectivity
    between devices should always be maintained in all circumstances. This motivates
    us to focus on SS and spectrum sharing processes in CR-based IoT. The designer
    should carefully select a proper SS approach for the CR-based IoT device. Moreover,
    the designer should determine the spectrum band allocation precisely to satisfy
    the PU protection constraints when exploiting the vacant spectrum band. To achieve
    those two goals, the following factors have to be considered: IoT applications.
    Enabling technology. Regulations. Those design factors are used to determine the
    main characteristics of the CR-based IoT system, such as transmission range, transmission
    rate, Bandwidth (BW) occupancy, transmitted signal type, i.e., analog or digital,
    transmission nature, i.e., continuous or intermittent. Based on those characteristics,
    a designer can select the proper SS approach and MAC protocol as discussed in
    Section IV. For example, to design CR-based IoT enabling Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT)
    technology, a designer should select one of the Narrowband Spectrum Sensing (NBSS)
    approaches, such as Energy Detector (ED), Cyclostationary Feature Detector (CFD),
    or Matched Filter (MF). Section IV-A provides more details about selecting the
    proper SS approach. From MAC protocol perspective, standard random MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and Carrier Sense Multiple Access/ Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA)
    can be employed in such case [12], [13]. Figure 1 demonstrates the factors to
    be considered for designing a CR-based IoT system. Moreover, the figure shows
    the relationship between the design factors. FIGURE 1. Design factors of CR-based
    IoT system. Show All A. IoT Applications IoT has enormous applications. The applications
    are selected based on the type of the service to be provided. For instance, if
    IoT devices are used for medical purposes; the Wireless Medical Applications (WMA)
    are classified as Medical Implant Communications Services (MICS), Wireless Medical
    Telemetry Service (WMTS), Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), Ultra Wideband
    (UWB), Radar Imaging (RI), and Telehealth [14]. The type of the application determines
    the nature of the signal to be transmitted (i.e., analog or digital), data size,
    time transmission, type of transmission (i.e., intermittent or continuous), frequency
    range and the standards to be employed. As an illustrative example, Table 3 displays
    the transmission requirements of some medical applications. TABLE 3 Transmission
    Parameters and Applicable SS Class for Some Medical Applications All above-mentioned
    medical applications must employ low power device with transmission power constraint
    of ≤ 0.75 mW; so that they do not pose any harm to a human body; moreover, the
    applications are allowed to use some portions of Industrial Scientific Medical
    (ISM) bands [14]. B. Enabling Technology IoT networks employ many different enabling
    technologies for establishing the communication between the devices in the network.
    Radio frequency IDentification (RFID), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Bluetooth,
    WiFi, and Near Field Communication (NFC) are some of enabling technologies that
    IoT might use for communication. The enabling technologies can be classified as
    short range coverage technologies and long range coverage technologies. For instance,
    Bluetooth, RFID and NFC are classified as short range coverage technologies, while
    WSN, and Long Term Evolution (LTE) fall in the class of long range coverage technology.
    Figure 2 shows an illustrative example of IoT network connecting different technologies
    and standards. FIGURE 2. IoT Network with different technologies and standards.
    Show All The enabling technology specifically determines the data rate of the
    shared information, its bandwidth, transmission range, and operating frequency.
    Moreover, the standard and the MAC protocol must be selected to fit the application
    and the enabling technology. C. Regulations Every country has regulatory bodies
    and working groups which are responsible for imposing the regulations of frequency
    usage such as licences, allowable interference, and certificates [22]. Moreover,
    those bodies and groups determine the frequency assignment for licensed and unlicensed
    services and users. As an example, a CR system for e-health applications are allowed
    to operate on either unlicensed or licensed bands. Table 4 provides different
    regulations and applications for IoT adopting RFID technology in different countries.
    However, for some countries, it is important to satisfy an ElectroMagnetic Compliance
    (EMC) requirement. Therefore, certification of adopted wireless IoT device is
    necessary to meet their emission and susceptibility of ElectroMagnetic Interference
    (EMI). Moreover, the adopted standard determines whether the device needs certification
    or not. For instance, wireless medical device in Canada, under Radio Standard
    Specifications RSS-243 requires certification, while RSS 310 exempts those devices
    from certification. TABLE 4 IoT-RFID Parameters for Different Regulations From
    standard perspective, IoT use different standards such as ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    etc. Each standard is suitable for some applications. The suitability depends
    on the application’s parameters such as data rate, transmission range and whether
    the transmission is continuous or intermittent. Here are some examples: Bluetooth
    and ZigBee are suitable for low data rate applications that need long battery
    life and secured networking. More specifically, ZigBee is suited for intermittent
    transmission with data rate of 250 kbps, and its range reaches 20 m. Wi-Fi is
    suitable for applications with high date rate over Wireless Local Area Network
    (WLAN) platform, and its range reaches 35 to 40 m for indoor and outdoor, respectively.
    Furthermore, it is noticeable nowadays that most of IoT applications uses ISM
    band at 2.4 GHz, where various standards can be facilitated. However, there are
    some wireless IoT applications which employ 5 GHz WiFi and high-band cellular,
    while the low-power-long-range wireless IoT applications can employ TV White Space
    (TVWS), i.e., IEEE 802.22, in the band of 400 MHz to 700 MHz as in the United
    States [25]. In addition to the aforementioned factors; physical specifications
    such as weight, size, and power should also be taken into consideration when designing
    CR-based IoT devices, since the ultimate goal is to design low power constrained
    light weight CR-based IoT device with a compact size. Improving the energy efficiency
    of the devices is a vital research direction in this area, since most of IoT devices
    are battery power terminal with limited lifetime. Charging or replacing batteries
    is not a feasible issue, this fact necessitates determining other alternatives
    to prolong the battery’s lifetime. Energy harvesting techniques are among the
    best alternatives, and many research works have been done in this area [26]–[29].
    SECTION IV. CR-Based IoT System Design Flow Adding cognitive capability to IoT
    device means incorporating CR technology with IoT device, which can be realized
    through designing three consecutive functional phases as illustrated in Fig. 3.
    The functional phases are, namely, SS, spectrum sharing, and spectrum management.
    Details in each functional phase are provided below. FIGURE 3. CR-based IoT system
    design flow. Show All A. Spectrum Sensing Phase In SS component, a designer of
    CR-based IoT system must carefully select the adopted SS approach and the sensing
    decision making technique. This section highlights the selection criteria of SS
    approach and decision techniques. 1) SS Approach Selection The SS process can
    be performed either on narrowband or wideband levels. NBSS implies that the BW
    is lower than the coherence bandwidth. NBSS is performed when there is enough
    information about the PUs’ signal and BW. Many NBSS approaches have been developed
    in literature, including ED [30], [32]–[35], MF detection [31], [35]–[38], eigenvalue-based
    detection [35], [45]–[48], and CFD [35], [39]–[44], etc. Table 5 provides a general
    comparison between the different NBSS approaches. TABLE 5 General Remarks on NBSS
    Approaches In contrast, when the occupancy details of the PUs are unknown to the
    CR, WBSS provides better utilization of the frequency spectrum. However, the design
    and implementation of WBSS approaches are usually complex and consume more energy
    from high-rate Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs). Many WBSS approaches have
    been developed in literature, including Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based detectors
    [49]–[51], filter-based detectors [52]–[54], wavelet detection [55], sequential
    scanning [56], compressive sensing [57]–[63] and multi-coset sensing [64]–[67].
    Table 6 provides a comparison between the different WBSS approaches. TABLE 6 General
    Remarks on WBSS Approaches NBSS approaches concentrate on exploiting the spectral
    opportunities over narrow frequency range; however, due to the large number of
    IoT devices connected to the Internet, CR in IoT will involve the exploitation
    of spectrum opportunities over a wide frequency range in order to achieve higher
    opportunistic throughput [50]. For example, to exploit spectrum opportunities
    in TV bands, WBSS approaches should be implemented. These intend to sense frequency
    bandwidth with higher coherence since NBSS approaches cannot be utilized for WBSS
    as these approaches make a single binary decision and cannot identify single channel
    occupancy state that lie within a wideband spectrum. In the same context, SS approaches
    can also be categorized as blind and knowledge aided based on the required knowledge
    for each approach. For instance, energy-based detection and eigenvalue-based detection
    approaches are categorized as blind spectrum sensing approaches as they need no
    prior knowledge about PU’s signal characteristics while matched filter and cyclostationary
    feature detector are among knowledge aided approaches since they require a full
    or partial prior knowledge about the PU’s signal [35]. Based on the above discussion,
    a CR-based IoT system detects the existence of the PU over a spectrum band of
    interest by adopting a SS approach. The designer can select a proper SS approach
    based on the design factors mentioned in Section III and the available awareness
    of the PU’s information such as BW occupancy and signal characteristics. The selected
    SS approach should satisfies the following selection criteria: it should able
    to detect the PU over the target BW, i.e., spectrum band, it should consume low
    power, i.e., energy efficient, and it should incur minimum computational complexity,
    if possible, As an example, for a SU that employs NB-IoT technology, an NBSS approach
    is selected. Then, based on prior knowledge about PU signal features, a designer
    can determine the most appropriate NBSS approach. Therefore, if the designer has
    no prior knowledge about the PU’s signal features, the ED is the best candidate
    for its simple implementation and low complexity requirement. However, if the
    designer is expecting that the system will experience a noisy radio environment,
    one of the eigenvalue-based detection approaches can be selected. Similarly, if
    the designer has some prior knowledge of the PU signal features, such as cyclic
    prefix or cyclic spectral correlation function; then a CFD is the optimal selection
    for this case, due to its noise and interference immunity. On the other hand,
    in case of WBAN enabling UWB technology, a multi-coset sensing approach is selected
    over the other WBSS approaches, such as wavelet detection or compressive sensing
    approaches, as no prior knowledge about the number of PUs, and sparsity assumption
    are required. In conclusion, the adopted SS approach is selected based on available
    knowledge about the BW occupancy and PU signal features. 2) Decision Making Techniques
    According to the SS observations, the decision is made to declare the presence
    or the absence of the PU over the band of interest. In other words, a single CR
    can make itself sensing decision, i.e., local observation. However, channel impairments,
    such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise power variation, adversely impact
    the detection making of the CR, especially when using NBSS approaches [68]. Therefore,
    another decision making technique should be employed to improve the local observation.
    A collaboration between CRs by sharing their SS observations can effectively alleviate
    the impact of those impairments. The collaboration process is called Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS) and can be implemented using three main techniques, they
    are centralized, non-centralized and relay-assisted. Discussing the CSS techniques
    is beyond the scope of this survey, however, a brief description of each technique
    is provided below. First, in the centralized CSS technique, all participant CRs
    detect PU over the designated spectrum band, then forwards their local observations
    to a central entity to determine the final decision about PU existence, next forwards
    back to all participants [69]–[71]. Second, in the non-centralized CSS technique,
    the participants share their local observations between each other and then the
    decision is made by reaching a consensus between the participants [72], [73].
    Finally, relay-assisted technique can be realized by two strategies either Amplify
    and Forward (AF), or Decode and Forward (DF). In AF strategy, once a participant
    CR receives a decision from another CR, it amplifies it and then forwards it to
    another CR, while in DF strategy, a CR decodes the received decision, remodulates
    it and forwards it to another CR [74], [75]. Excessive research works and surveys
    have focused on CSS techniques, methodologies and challenges [56], [76], [77].
    However, this survey paper mainly focuses on the recent works pertain to CR-based
    IoT systems. B. Spectrum Sharing Phase The objective of this functional phase
    is to allocate the vacant band and then utilize it effectively. In other words,
    an energy efficient scheme that avoids collision between SUs and PUs or SUs themselves
    is mandatory. Generally, spectrum sharing can be implemented through network selection,
    spectrum allocation, MAC protocol, power allocation, and spectrum routing and
    mobility. Once sensing decision is made over the designated bands, the SU should
    allocate the band to be used, this can be performed by selecting the suitable
    vacant PU band to be exploited and the way to access that band taking into consideration
    the channel constraints, such as maximum power and BW. For more understanding,
    spectrum sharing rules and models must be discussed before describing the selection
    of a suitable spectrum sharing approach. 1) Spectrum Sharing Rules for efficient
    spectrum sharing process, some rules should be taken into consideration which
    are: at any given instant, each SU can only use one allocated channel over all
    available channels, total interference caused by all SUs over the allocated channel
    must not exceed a maximum allowable limit of interference, and the allocated channel
    should match the SU’s requirements of BW and power. In other words, spectrum sharing
    process is a three step process; they are spectrum allocation, spectrum access,
    and power allocation. Briefly, spectrum allocation is to select the PU and the
    spectrum band among the vacant spectrum bands. Spectrum access is to select the
    MAC, routing, and mobility protocols. Finally, power allocation is to avoid or
    minimize the interference of SUs to the PUs. 2) Spectrum Sharing Models the spectrum
    sharing models can be classified into open sharing and managed sharing as shown
    in Fig. 4. In open access scheme, no central unit controls the access to the band
    to be used by the SUs. Thus, it is a unauthorized access model where a SU or a
    group of SUs can transmit data any time over some designated bands for short distance
    considering a power limited imposed by the regulatory body. For instance, Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC) allows ISM (2.4 GHz) for open access, but mandates
    that users should never exceed the imposed peak transmission power [78]. Note
    that, in this scheme the collision between SUs cannot be avoided, especially in
    areas crowded by IoT devices. Hence, IoT devices employ ZiGbee and WiFi standards,
    when no cognition capability is adopted [79]. FIGURE 4. Spectrum sharing models.
    Show All On the other hand, to avoid the collision between SUs themselves and
    between them and PUs, a managed access is employed, where a central entity or
    a policy is required to control and manage SUs’ access to a vacant band. The managed
    sharing techniques can be classified into three main classes, centralized, distributed
    and cooperation between PUs and SUs. First, in a centralized class a SU can attain
    an exclusive use to exploit a designated spectrum band through a legitimate spectrum
    management process such as TVWS Geolocation database and spectrum market. Therefore,
    a regularity body or a PU allows a specific SU to use that spectrum band for a
    certain time over a certain geographical area; as a result, no competition between
    SUs occur to use that spectrum band. For instance, if a SU employs geolocation
    capabilities, e.g., White Space DataBase (WSDB) governed by FCC in the US, provides
    the SU with a list of available spectrum bands and maximum allowable transmission
    power over those bands. The SU, i.e., White Space Devices (WSD), should never
    go over the imposed power limit [80]. Spectrum marketing between PUs and SUs is
    an emerging trend for sharing spectrum bands by either trading or leasing spectrum
    bands [81]. The goal beyond spectrum marketing is to maximize the spectrum efficiency
    by increasing the capacity of networks include PUs and SUs. In spectrum trading,
    negotiations between PUs and SUs might take place to exchange benefits, such that
    PUs might provide SUs an exclusive use for their spectrum band for a certain time
    over a specific geographical location for either forwarding PUs’ data to some
    area beyond their transmission range i.e., coverage area, or some fees. Different
    game models, auction mechanisms might be adopted to implement the contract model-based
    spectrum trading [82], [83]. In spectrum leasing, SUs might lease a specific spectrum
    band for a specific time interval to transmit their data over that spectrum band
    for a certain amount of money [81]. All those trades and leases should follow
    the regulations of government agencies in which spectrum marketing takes place
    [80], [81]. Second, distributed spectrum sharing models also can be categorized
    as either opportunistic, i.e., interweave or coexisting models. In interweave
    model, a SU can exploit the vacant band when PU is idle in one of these dimension
    time, frequency or geographical location. However, PU protection from the SU interference
    is a must; therefore, the SU should always detect the existence of the PU over
    the band during its transmission by adopting either Full Duplex (FD) by which
    a SU can sense and transmit simultaneously [84], or spectrum monitoring techniques
    for this purpose [85]. On the other hand, coexisting models are overlay, underlay
    or hybrid. In all these sharing models, a SU must be aware of PU’s signal characteristics
    so that the SU can simultaneously coexist with the PU over its spectrum band.
    More specifically, in overlay model, the awareness of PU’s signal, i.e., code,
    angle or polarization, enables the SU to transmit data without interfering PUs
    by changing code, angle of transmission or beam-forming [56]. In underlay model,
    the SUs can coexist with PUs in their spectrum bands. If SUs know the PU’s transmission
    power level, therefore, SUs can transmit data for a short range and never exceed
    a certain transmit power limit, while hybrid model is a combination of overlay
    and underlay model [8], [9]. Third, the cooperation between PUs and SUs can be
    implemented by either network coordination or spectrum relaying. In network coordination
    scheme it is assumed that there is a Central Network Operator (CNO) to coordinate
    and manage the spectrum sharing between SUs and PUs by minimizing the interference
    and optimizing the sharing time and power resources so that QoS of the SUs can
    be improved. The CNO selects the PU and SUs to be cooperated using Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO) or genetic algorithm [8]. In spectrum relaying, if a PU could
    not reach its throughput target, it asks SUs to cooperate by sending a Request
    To Cooperate (RTC) to the SUs. A SU with an interest to cooperate, replies by
    a confirmation message as Confirm To Cooperate (CTC). As an example, spectrum
    relaying based OFDM, SUs assist the PU using some of its sub-carriers to forward
    PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying. Channel power allocation
    technique, such as Water Filling (WF) algorithms [86], [87], is required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Alternatively, various protocols have been devised to
    perform spectrum sharing based OFDM, where SUs assist the PU using some of its
    sub-carriers to forward PU’s signal, such a scheme is called spectrum relaying.
    Channel power allocation technique, i.e., resource optimization technique, such
    as WF algorithms [86], [87] and interior point method [88], are required to satisfy
    PU’s throughput target. Conventionally most of the SUs adopt Half Duplex (HD)
    relay, in other words, sensing and data transmission cannot be performed simultaneously;
    if the SU senses, no transmission occurs and vice versa. Such kind of system adversely
    impacts the spectrum efficiency. However, the spectrum efficiency of a SU can
    be significantly increased if a SU adopts a FD system [89]. However, this improvement
    comes at the expense of extra hardware complexity (e.g., extra antennas and electronics)
    and computational requirements. The selection of a proper spectrum sharing approach
    has to consider the following three phases which are: 3) Spectrum Allocation The
    spectrum allocation starts with network selection, i.e., PU selection, is an important
    step towards allocating spectrum bands. For SUs use NBSS approaches, the SU determines
    the PU channel before starting detection. However, in case of employing WBSS approaches,
    there always are more than one deployed PU network, i.e., PU transmitters and
    PU receivers. Many approaches can be employed to select the optimal PU network.
    PSO, genetic optimization and game theory are among the best approaches to be
    used for this purpose [8], [90]. Channel allocation is the second step of this
    functional phase, especially when there are multiple PUs and multiple SUs; by
    which each SU will select a designated spectrum band, i.e., channel, to exploit
    or to jointly share. The allocated spectrum band should fit the BW and QoS requirements
    fo the SU. Moreover, before transmitting data, SUs must be aware of the presence
    of other SUs intend to use that allocated channel, i.e., spectrum band, since
    SUs might use different spectrum bands but oblivious of each other. Learning about
    the existence of those intended SUs is known as channel rendezvous [91] and it
    is an important step to communication links between SUs,i.e., CRN configuration.
    The conventional rendezvous algorithms assume to use a Common Control Channel
    (CCC) to establish links between SUs and configure a CRN. However, a CCC is always
    influenced by the dynamic behavior of the PUs over the allocated spectrum band
    and is vulnerable to security threats, therefore, a channel rendezvous might fail
    [92]. For an efficient channel allocation using rendezvous algorithms, a Channel
    Hopping (CH) is adopted to enable SUs to reach a channel consensus within a finite
    number of hops. The most important performance metrics are Maximum Time To Rendezvous
    (MTTR), Expected Time To Rendezvous (ETTR) and Rendezvous Degree (RD). The MTTR
    is defined as the rendezvous latency in the worst case. The ETTR is defined as
    the average rendezvous latency before successfully rendezvous on at least one
    channel, while the RD is defined as the minimum percentage of distinct rendezvous
    channels to the number of common available channels between any pair of SUs. It
    is hoped that the rendezvous can spread out evenly over all common channels in
    order to overcome the vulnerability of one single rendezvous channel and provide
    more rendezvous opportunities [91]–[93]. The work in [79] employed the Round Ribbon
    Tournament to devise a novel asymmetric asynchronous channel hopping algorithm
    for IoT-based CRNs. The devised algorithm achieves guaranteed rendezvous within
    a predefined time. Moreover, the algorithm outperforms the works in [91], [93]
    in the degree of rendezvous. 4) Spectrum Access This phase employs MAC, routing
    and mobility protocols. After allocating the channels, accessing those channels
    can be performed by adopting an appropriate efficient MAC protocol. The designer
    should select a MAC protocol of CR based IoT based on two main criteria. First
    criterion is related to IoT system characteristics, such as data size, transmission
    rate, transmission range, power consumption, latency, employed communication technology,
    and heterogeneity of the systems, i.e., deployment of the system whether it is
    individual or back-haul connection. Second criterion is related to the detected
    spectrum band such as its availability and BW. More specifically, there are three
    factors that play an important role in selecting an energy efficient MAC protocol
    for IoT system. The factors are transmission probability, latency and power consumption.
    Hence, an efficient MAC protocol should incur low cost, low complexity and low
    energy consumption. Moreover, should have ability of channel switching while maintaining
    PU protection, low channel access delay, no collision between SUs when accessing
    the channel, and trades off between duty cycle and control overhead and balances
    between spectrum efficiency and energy efficiency. Finally, a MAC protocol must
    be able to correct errors, i.e., error correction. As an example, the work in
    [94] provides a comprehensive comparison between MAC approaches of two well-known
    standards, namely, IEEE 802.11ah and IEEE 802.15.4. The standards are adopted
    for IoT systems. The comparison shows that IEEE 802.11ah outperforms IEEE 802.15.4
    in data rate, data size, latency, and transmission range. Despite IEEE 802.14.5
    operates with less data rate and over a shorter range than IEEE 802.11ah, it outperforms
    IEEE 802.11ah in power consumption and network capacity since it can accommodate
    more IoT devices than IEEE 802.11ah. Different standard random access MAC protocols,
    such as slotted ALOHA and conventional CSMA/CA, CSMA/CA polling, Orthogonal Frequency
    Division Multiple Access (OFDMA), and Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS)
    have been employed by IoT systems to access the spectrum hole [80]. For instance,
    a CSMA/CA MAC protocol has been adopted in [13], while in [12] slotted ALOHA was
    adopted. The authors in [12] employed an ED as a sensing approach and slotted
    ALOHA protocol as a random access channel for its popularity in Global Mobile
    System (GMS) and LTE. Moreover, the authors derived a closed expression for the
    optimal throughput of narrow band CR-based IoT device with slotted ALOHA for local
    and CSS mechanism. The optimization problem was proposed to maximize the throughput
    of CR-based IoT under constraint of PU protection. However, the work considered
    the channel with only Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and did not consider
    the impact of channel impairments on the performance of the ED, since ED is susceptible
    to dynamic environmental conditions and its performance significantly deteriorates
    under other channel impairments, such as multi-path fading, shadowing and noise
    uncertainty [35]. Moreover, the power consumption was not considered as well.
    On the other hand, some recent works employed non-standard random access MAC protocols.
    For instance, the work in [95] employed conditional interference distribution
    to propose a new cognitive random access mechanism with adaptive transmission
    probability. The transmission probability varies according to the measured interference
    by the IoT device. The proposed mechanism allows the IoT device to share the spectrum
    band used by the PU in non-interfering basis. Moreover, the proposed mechanism
    improves the area spectral efficiency and outperforms the convention ALOHA mechanism.
    Moreover, an energy efficient MAC protocol with a novel channel selection criterion
    was devised in [96]. The protocol significantly reduces the handshakes over control
    and data channels; therefore, improves the energy efficiency by increasing the
    throughput and minimizing the consumed energy. Moreover, the protocol was investigated
    by applying different PU activity models over the channel. Furthermore, the work
    in [97] modified the MAC protocol of IEEE802.11 in order to enable the protocol
    of opportunistically select the channel by adding channel selection algorithm.
    The modified IEEE802.11 outperforms the standard IEEE802.11 with sequential selection
    (i.e., Round Robin) and random channel (i.e., CSMA/CA) selection algorithms in
    both throughput and energy consumption. In addition, Restricted Access Window
    (RAW) is a promising MAC protocol which is adopted for low power IoT network for
    large number of devices with low collision probability. The RAW employs multiple
    equal time slot and allows a limited number of IoT devices to access a specific
    spectrum band at each time slot and spreads devices’ attempts over a long period
    of time to enable an efficient communication for a large number of devices. The
    devices operate in active mode only if their slot turns; otherwise, they operate
    in sleep mode to save power [94]. Besides MAC protocols, spectrum routing and
    mobility protocols are needed to firmly guarantee a PU protection, especially,
    if a PU suddenly resumes its transmission over the licensed spectrum band which
    is opportunistically exploited by a SU. In this case, the SU must leave the spectrum
    band without causing an interference to the PU by switching to another vacant
    spectrum band or immediately cease transmission until that spectrum band becomes
    idle. The band switching process is called spectrum mobility. To perform this
    process efficiently, the SU should be aware of PU activity pattern, in order to
    predict the PU’s behavior, therefore, it can alleviate a collision with the PU.
    Many approaches have been devised to perform an efficient spectrum mobility in
    CRNs. The works in [98], [99] thoroughly explained the principle, mechanism and
    merits of each spectrum mobility approach. The way of when and how a SU switches
    from spectrum band to another band is performed by spectrum routing protocols.
    Those protocols play an important role to significantly improve the spectrum efficiency
    by exploiting the PU’s time varying availability over its spectrum band [8]. A
    survey paper in [100] discussed the joint channel selection and routing from the
    perspective of CRNs. The work provided a comprehensive survey on routing and channel
    selection in CRNs. More specifically, the importance of joint channel selection
    and routing for CRNs. Moreover, the survey highlighted the classification and
    challenges of channel selection and routing strategies. Using the PU behavior
    models, performance metrics and routing metrics, the survey showed how to develop
    an efficient routing protocol. 5) Power Allocation The key aspect of spectrum
    sharing is to optimize the power and energy consumption in order to increase the
    overall spectrum and energy efficiencies of the CR-based IoT. Therefore, power
    allocation approaches have to be employed to realize this objective. Among those
    approaches, point interior approach [88], WF algorithm [86], [101], and game theory
    [90]. The point interior method is generally employed for linear and non-linear
    convex optimization problems. The method mainly approaches the optimal solution
    from the strict interior of the feasible region. On the other hand, the WF algorithms
    are used for radio resource allocation problem for a system with multi channels
    or carriers, where it aims to maximize the sum of data rates or the capacity of
    all channels in the system by optimizing the power distribution of the transmitted
    signals. For CRN, the WF algorithms are used to maximize the sum of throughput
    of all participant CR in the CRN considering their individual peak power constraint
    to guarantee the QoS of the PUs. On the other hand, in case of non-cooperative,
    i.e., a system with selfish CR, game theory is an appropriate tool to model those
    behaviors, since game theory provides the mathematical tools to study the complex
    interactions among interdependent rational players, i.e., selfish CRs, and to
    predict their possible strategies. Different non cooperative game models can be
    employed such as asymmetric Nash bargaining solution-based relay power allocation
    scheme which is used to achieve a balance between global network performance and
    user fairness. Stackelberg game is adopted to model the interaction between the
    relays and the users to find the optimal power allocation, and auction-based power
    allocation algorithms can be used for resource allocation among Device to Device
    (D2D) links reusing the same cellular channels subject to optimizing the system
    capacity [102], [103]. C. Spectrum Management Phase The popularity of IoT system
    encourages IoT users to exchange huge amount of data with their interested parties
    over public and untrusted networks. However, the data should not be exposed to
    every user since those data might be secure, safety critical, or contain private
    and sensitive information. Therefore, it is necessary to enforce security and
    privacy policies, i.e., protocols, to protect the data from any fraudulent acts
    or security threats. The complexity of selected protocol depends on the device
    specifications, networking, and applications [104]. For instance, most of the
    IoT devices are low energy, lightweight devices and use their energy mainly to
    execute their core function applications. This made traditional security algorithms
    not suitable for IoT since they consume much energy and incur high processing
    overhead. Hence, it is necessary to use lightweight energy efficient security
    protocols [105]. Many recent survey works [105]–[108] comprehended this area and
    discussed thoroughly the requirements, architectures, classifications and challenging
    issues for security and privacy protocols for various IoT systems and applications.
    However, in this work, a brief discussion on security and privacy is provided
    below. The discussion covers the important requirements and concepts in this field.
    1) Security To establish a secure IoT system with a large number of IoT devices,
    services and users, three important measures are required. Those measures are
    confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication. First, confidentiality guarantees
    the availability of the data for only the authorized users throughout the data
    exchange process. Data encryption is adopted to avoid the interference and eavesdropping
    of unauthorized users; in other words, strictly limiting the data accessibility
    and disclosure to the authorized users [106]. Second, data integrity is providing
    accurate data to the authorized users during data delivery over the network by
    filtering false data, i.e., tampered and forged data, caused by intended or unintended
    interference. Third, authentication is delivering the data to the legitimate object,
    i.e., a user, a device or an application, which requests a specific data over
    the network. Moreover, availability is an important feature in IoT system, which
    refers to persistent IoT connectivity by making data and devices always available
    when requested by the authorized users and avoid denial of service attack. Note
    that confidentiality, integrity and authentication are information security requirements
    while availability is a functional security requirement that also means continuing
    service provisioning during disruption conditions, i.e., the ability to provide
    a minimum level of service if a failure or power loss occurs [109]. 2) Privacy
    To prevent an adversary, i.e., undesired party, from discovering, eavesdropping
    or/and monitoring private information of other users and to ensure that data can
    be accessed and processed by only the pertinent user. Moreover, privacy allows
    the user to perform specific controls based on a specific portion of the received
    data while prevents it from reaching the rest of that data [110]. Privacy preservation
    mechanisms should be enforced during data collection, aggregation and mining phases
    to block data leakage to the public. Traditional encryption and key management
    mechanisms can be used as privacy mechanisms over data collection and mining phases,
    however, it is not the case for data aggregation phase, since data is aggregated
    and processed in various locations [111]. Despite that there are various attempts
    to tackle an efficient privacy mechanism for data aggregation such as perturbation-based
    privacy mechanisms and anonymity-based privacy mechanisms, this issue is still
    challenging and considered as an open research direction. In summary, for an efficient
    CR-based IoT system, it is recommended to employ lightweight security protocols
    and privacy mechanisms which need minimum communication and processing resources,
    and incur low computational overhead to support the resource constrained IoT devices.
    SECTION V. Integration of Emerging Technologies With CR-Based IoT Systems Integrating
    emerging technologies, such as blockchain and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques,
    i.e., Machine Learning (ML) approaches, with wireless systems is a new step towards
    creating next-generation wireless communication systems with additional capabilities
    such as robust security, autonomy, flexibility, and intelligent architecture.
    This section discusses the impact of adding blockchain and machine learning approaches
    to CR-based IoT systems. A. Blockchain-Enabled CR-Based IoT System The blockchain
    is defined as a tremendous, public, secure and decentralized datastore of ordered
    events, called blocks. Each block contains a timestamp and is linked to a previous
    block. The events can be updated by “only a majority of users” [112]. Erasing
    information is not allowed. The datastore is owned by no one, controlled by users
    and not ruled by any trusted third party or central regulatory instance. In fact,
    trust is encoded in the protocol and maintained by the community of users. The
    work in [113] presented a comprehensive survey on blockchain, its types, features,
    structures, protocols, and the integration of blockchain and IoT systems. On the
    other hand, the survey in [114] focused on blockchain applications and challenges
    for real world applications. Adopting blockchain technology is a promising solution
    to improve system immunity against hacking activities. The blockchain prevents
    central point system failure and cyber attack which results in improving the security
    in IoT and CRNs. The blockchain protocols employ a two-key encryption system,
    i.e., public and private keys; therefore, robustness is added to the security
    of CRNs [115], [116]. However, the use of blockchain in IoT security is limited
    and focused on the following areas: asymmetric and symmetric key management [117],
    [118], trading of collected data [119], [120], incontrovertible log of events,
    and management of access control to data [121]. The security issues related to
    IoT include authentication and authorization, ownership and identity relationships,
    governance of data and privacy [122]. Blockchain-based research has been used
    to tackle some of these issues. The work by Pureswaran and Brody investigated
    how blockchain contracts support the autonomous workflow and sharing of services
    among IoT devices [123]. IoT devices can benefit from blockchain networks in areas
    related to billing, shipping, e-trading, supply chain management, and energy trading
    [123]. In another work, Bahga and Madisetti proposed a blockchain-based framework
    for industrial IoT [124]. The work by Saghiri et. al proposed a framework for
    IoT based on cognitive systems and blockchain [125]. Such work is still in its
    infancy and worth investigating since introducing blockchain in IoT and CR systems
    shows a promising future in supporting secure data sharing and protecting privacy.
    On the other perspective, employing blockchain protocols in spectrum auction offers
    a decentralized validation which increases the accessibility of the CRNs and reduces
    the implementation complexity, since no central entity is required. In addition,
    blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN is a secure spectrum sharing approach
    where it provides an optimal collision-free method to access the spectrum opportunities.
    The work in [115] showed that blockchain-enabled spectrum access in CRN improves
    the security of the CRN and outperforms the conventional random MAC protocol in
    medium and severe radio conditions. The authors in [116] showed that adopting
    blockchain enhances security and performance of CRNs with moving CRs. As a novel
    step towards next-generation wireless networks to enable flexible and secure spectrum
    sharing, the authors in [126] proposed a secure and intelligent architecture with
    three planes, namely., user plane, edge plane and cloud plane, to empower 5G technology
    by integrating blockchain and AI techniques, i.e., Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (DRL). The blockchain is utilized to enable secure and flexible spectrum access
    and enhance privacy protection of the SUs; however, DRL is utilized to provide
    an intelligent resource management since AI techniques can tackle issues such
    as uncertainty, time variant, and complex features. B. Machine Learning-Enabled
    CR-Based IoT System ML approaches are AI applications that establish mathematical
    models based on observations, i.e., training data, to predict or make decisions.
    ML approaches enable systems to automatically learn and improve from experience
    without being explicitly programmed. In other words, ML approaches enable computers
    or processors to automatically learn without human intervention and to select
    actions accordingly. ML approaches have a potential ability to analyze and classify
    massive amounts of data which makes ML approaches as efficient and powerful tools
    for performing other processing tasks, such as data analysis, classification [127],
    feature detection, feature extraction [128] and identification [129]. Also, ML
    approaches improve the security and the data privacy for big data systems [130].
    In addition to the aforementioned advantages, ML approaches can apply complex
    techniques in a simple way, and provide accurate results of identifying the targets.
    Therefore, integrating ML approaches with cognitive capabilities can improve the
    effectiveness of processing large volumes of information from various distinctive
    resources. ML approaches have tremendous applications which cannot be covered
    in this section; however, some related applications of ML approaches to IoT and
    CR are addressed below: 1) IoT Health Applications The survey in [127] made an
    assessment for various ML approaches, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest
    Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), etc. In addition,
    the survey determined the criteria of selecting the most appropriate ML approach
    for IoT application. Moreover, the survey considered the application of ML approaches
    for developing IoT smart applications in a smart city as an illustrative example
    to discuss and address the challenges of adopting ML approaches in IoT data analytics
    of smart data traffic. Moreover, the work in [128] proposed a scalable IoT health
    monitoring framework which integrates IoT architecture with LR approach. The proposed
    framework employs 5G mobile networks for the transfer of clinical data into the
    clinical database to enable the necessary action for emergency situations. This
    framework is mainly used for early detection of heart diseases. In [131], the
    authors proposed a monitoring health framework that alarms when acute heart stress
    occurs. The proposed framework employed KNN and LR approaches to predict and detect
    heart stress and uses IoT devices to measure patient’s stress level. 2) CRN Applications
    The work in [132] provided a comprehensive review of various ML approaches applied
    to CRNs. The work categorized ML approaches into decision-making and feature classification.
    Decision-making is employed to determine policies and decision rules for CRs while
    feature classification is used to identify and classify different observation
    models. This work also addressed several challenging learning issues that arise
    in CRNs, in particular in non-Markovian environments and decentralized networks,
    and provided possible solutions. Furthermore, the work identified the conditions
    under which each ML approach can be used. On the other hand, the authors in [133]
    devised CSS algorithms for CRNs based on ML approaches. The SVM and KNN approaches
    were used as classifiers. The energy level estimated at each CR was used to establish
    the feature vector which is categorized using the classifier into two classes,
    idle channel, “no PU activity”, and busy channel, “at least one PU is active”.
    In this work, the proposed algorithms outperformed the traditional CSS techniques,
    i.e., hard and soft fusion techniques, for two reasons. First, ML approaches have
    a capability of implicitly learning the surrounding environment, i.e., topology
    of the PU and CRNs and the channel fading. Second, ML approaches optimize the
    decision region based on feature space which is better than the optimization used
    by the traditional CSS techniques. Moreover, ML approaches play an important role
    in constructing Radio Environment Map (REM) for their accurate prediction, classification
    and learning. The REM is an integrated database consisting of multi-domain information,
    i.e., temporal, spatial, spectrum sensing, etc., to supply CRs with a comprehensive
    radio environment information in their geographical locations [134]. In other
    words, REM is a global situation awareness system that helps CRs to make adaptations
    beyond their individual capabilities. Hence, using REM results in a improving
    detection performance of PUs and SUs, mitigating hidden terminal problem, and
    reducing CRN adaptation time. REMs utilize ML approaches to build a spatio-temporal
    model to predict spectrum usage, i.e., PUs’ activities, [135], to learn radio
    environment parameters [136], and to establish a feature-based detection system.
    The latter is used as an automatic modulation classifier for PU signals and to
    estimate model parameters of the REM [137]. SECTION VI. Challenges, Open Issues,
    and Future Research Directions A. IoT With 5G Technology (5G-IoT) Each new generation
    of wireless technology has brought faster, more reliable cellular and Internet
    connects, starting with the first generation of wireless technology providing
    cellular communication, then 2G providing secure communication i.e., voice and
    text, next 3G introduced the smart phone era and 4G/LTE offered high-speed Internet
    allowing for streaming videos. Currently, the future era of wireless technology
    is moving to 5G, a generation promising life changing innovation with higher bandwidths,
    faster speeds, lower latency and increased capacity allowing more people and devices
    to communicate with each other at the same time, i.e., IoT. 5G requires frequencies
    reaching 300 GHz, compared to LTE which operates at bands below 6 GHz, hence allowing
    for higher capacity and speeds. Despite 5G offering a significant increase in
    speed and bandwidth, its more limited range will require further infrastructure.
    The initial cost to build 5G networks is very expensive since it is a new technology
    and cannot be built on top of an existing network. Therefore, the concept behind
    IoT is predicated on a fast network that can link devices and services together.
    This will allow devices to connect in new ways such as vehicles, city infrastructures,
    appliances, telehealth, etc. In addition, the need for compatible mobile devices
    is a challenge that manufacturers must combat to allow for a global spread of
    this technology. In the last few decades, with each generation challenges have
    emerged and were tackled allowing each generation to move to the next and 5G is
    no exception. Therefore, the main challenges facing 5G-IoT include technical challenges,
    security assurance and privacy concerns, and standardization challenges [138],
    [139]. 1) Technical Challenges Though many research efforts have been made on
    5G-IoT, there are still many technical challenges that needs to be tackled: 5G-IoT
    architecture is the main challenge which needs to be addressed since architecture
    design still impose many challenges, including, scalability and network management,
    interoperability and heterogeneity, security assurance and privacy concerns [140]–[142].
    Wireless Software Defined Network (SDN) is a challenge for network scalability.
    Deployment of IoT applications is challenging due to its large scale, resource
    limited devices and heterogeneous environment; therefore, a multilevel and multidimensional
    service provision platform could be a solution to tackle these challenges an attempt
    is presented in [143]. D2D communication are expected to provide high throughput
    for 5G-IoT. In D2D, the energy and spectral efficiencies are the two challenges.
    Several other technical challenges include dense heterogeneous networks deployment
    in IoT, multiple access techniques for 5G, full-duplex transmission at the same
    time, etc. 2) Security Assurance and Privacy Concerns With faster data speeds
    and higher capacity, security and privacy is a challenge that needs to be tackled
    to secure user’s data. Therefore, new security capabilities at device and network
    levels need to address security and privacy in complex applications including
    smart city, smart networks, telehealth, etc. Moreover, the security and privacy
    factors that need to be considered in designing G5-IoT systems include intrusion
    software, security assurance, backward compatibility, authentication, key management,
    etc [139], [142]. 3) Standardization Issues 5G-IoT is a very complex system, its
    purpose is to connect humans to their surrounding environment, hence due to the
    diversity nature of networks and devices in 5G-IoT, there is a lack of consistency
    and standardization for both IoT systems and applications. Therefore, the main
    standards which are of concern in 5G enabled IoT are: technology and regulatory
    standards. Technology standards include wireless communication, network protocols,
    data aggregation standards; and regulatory standards, include security and privacy
    of data, security solutions, cryptographic primitives. Finally, investigating
    IoT as a service could be the solution for future standardization [139], [144],
    [145]. B. Big Data Management The collected IoT data are streams of huge data
    volumes from various resources with different formats and patterns. IoT data analysis
    and management are important data processing steps towards converting the collected
    data to a useful knowledge that enables an IoT device to make decisions automatically.
    In other words, IoT devices can automatically extract hidden information from
    the collected IoT data and take the most appropriate action through data analysis
    and management. Data classification, clustering, patterning and feature extraction
    are the key functional components of data analysis and management. Data mining
    is the promising technology to perform data analysis and management, since data
    mining technology can extract knowledge from a large scale of data, i.e., big
    data, [146]. The discussion of data mining algorithms and architectures is beyond
    the scope of this survey; however, the surveys in [146]–[148] provided thorough
    overviews on the data mining algorithms, architectures and their challenges for
    IoT. Data management challenges for IoT has seen to be emerging rapidly and no
    doubt with the use of IoT in CRN more and more data is being created. The data
    does not only include traditional data, but also streaming data generated from
    digital sensors from many devices connected to the Internet. The data is usually
    generated in both structured, which is organized and easy to analyze, and unstructured,
    i.e., images and video data, which needs advanced tools to analyze. Therefore,
    advanced data mining techniques are needed to mine streaming data from sensor
    networks. The challenge lies in the shortage of skilled data analysts and the
    need for more research to develop and implement advanced mining tools to mine
    streaming data from CRN and sensor networks [149]. The IoT e-Health envisions
    a seamless connectivity that spans over physical locations; therefore, several
    research challenges related to data management must be overcome in order to achieve
    this. The main challenge is the continuous change of state of data collected from
    the attached sensors on human bodies, i.e., data continuously transmitted and
    collected via the Fog computing nodes [150], hence the IoT e-Health systems has
    to handle the complexity of the data in terms of their variety, volume and velocity.
    Since, the data produced in different formats is application dependent and is
    a challenge that manufacturers or health organizations must tackle by setting
    standards. In addition, Fog admins are needed to monitor the capabilities of Fog
    node hardware and mange the data communication between different medical devices.
    In [150], [151], the challenge of receiving knowledge from big data analysis to
    acquire a valuable decision and big data security issues in healthcare is discussed
    and a proposed solution in [151], [152] is to implement an IoT Fog computing architecture
    which will process, and store data acquired from sensors. The architecture consists
    of two parts: Meta Fog-Redirection and Grouping and Choosing architecture. The
    deployment of large-scale wireless sensors and IoT, can result in extremely huge
    data and hence optimized data processing and hierarchical communication solutions
    are needed to manage such deployments and data processing networks. More research
    work is needed for big data spatial processing specifically for wireless networking
    applications, as more scalable algorithms are required for performing different
    tasks, such as system identification, anomaly detection, and similar problems
    [153]. Moreover, from CR perspective, establishing a comprehensive spectrum modeling,
    accurate spectrum prediction, and flexible spectrum management necessitates the
    employment of big spectrum data techniques. Big spectrum data provides a comprehensive
    knowledge about the existing PUs over a designated geographical location, such
    as PU presence status, received signal strength, signal features, etc [154]. Geolocation
    database, REM and Spectrum Sensing as a Service (S2aaS) are spectrum aware systems
    where a big data architecture takes place in CRNs. A SU can obtain accurate spatio-temporal
    spectrum availability and spectrum prediction from those systems [154]–[156].
    On the other hand, development of an energy efficient and cost-effective big data
    architecture is still facing many challenges. Some of those challenges are: determining
    the volume of required spectrum data for a specific scale, since the volume of
    spectrum data increases by increasing the time duration, frequency band, spatial
    scale of interest, and resolution. Therefore, extra computational power is required
    which results in extra computational burden and latency. As a solution, the use
    of parallel and distributed computing can help alleviating such a problem; however,
    the configuration and maintenance of the parallel and distributed computing are
    still challenging and requires more investigation. alleviating the deterioration
    of the quality of collected spectrum data caused by ambient radio conditions can
    be solved by adopting an appropriate radio propagation model. This challenge is
    more complicated in scenarios that include moving spectrum data collectors. increasing
    the processing and networking capabilities of the adopted big data architecture
    with low overhead can efficiently increase the number of the data users, i.e.,
    SUs. C. IoT Mobility The application of IoT in vehicular environments or moving
    wireless communication system is a new research area, since mobility is a prominent
    characteristic pertinent to the vehicular environment. Numerous problems and challenges
    still require further investigations and need robust solutions. Despite that mobility
    of a CR improves the sensing performance of the moving CR [157]–[159], the handoff
    process of a moving IoT device from one network to another incurs extra computational
    burden to the network coordinator units. On the other hand, the mobility of IoT
    devices adversely impacts the security and privacy of the network, where mobility
    creates uncontrolled environment by merging and leaving of an unexpected IoT device
    to/from IoT networks. This seriously affects the scalability of the networks and
    their connectivity. Consequently, the privacy and resilience are significantly
    impacted because those measures mainly connected to the scalability of the networks
    [107], [111], [160]. In addition, mobility impacts the security, identity management,
    privacy, trust and resilience of IoT networks. The challenge becomes more complicated
    as heterogeneity of IoT devices increases; therefore, developing resilient security
    approaches becomes a demand [107], [110]. Moreover, developing an automatic trust
    computing platform, i.e., automatic trust management, to investigate the trustworthiness
    of emerging IoT device to the IoT networks is another challenge and future research
    direction. D. Global Standards Standardization bodies exert tremendous efforts
    to develop standards for IoT and CRN independently. The work in [7] summarizes
    the standardization efforts for both IoT systems and CRN individually. However,
    the need to bring CR-based IoT into the reality becomes imperative. Therefore,
    some working groups and standardization bodies have developed some standardization
    efforts for CR-based IoT system, for instance, Third Generation Partnership Project
    (3GPP) has completed a standard for NarrowBand IoT (NB-IoT) using short range
    wireless technologies, such as RFID and NFC. Moreover, the work is still going
    on in developing a standard for IoT using 5G technology and Low Power Wide Area
    (LPWA) network connections [161]. The huge growth of IoT devices and applications,
    besides the upgrading the communication protocols, made the need to globalize
    standards a necessary issue. Hence, there exists no global standard for all different
    IoT devices, since different IoT devices adopt different wireless networks and
    standards. Moreover, data sharing between various IoT devices might lead to decrease
    the required level of security and privacy of communications. Furthermore, quality,
    reliability and transmission rate for remote IoT applications, such as telehealth
    over rural regions, are adversely impacted [14], [162]. Globalizing the standards
    is still a challenging task for the following factors various regulations that
    impose their own constraints, regularity assignments and recommendations on the
    standardization, as described in Section III-C, diversity of employed IoT devices,
    communication technologies, and protocols, which leads to difficulties in comprising
    and tackling all different requirements, especially with the rapid development
    in communication technologies and protocols and deployment scales, since the congestion
    and interference requirements for data transfer over large scale networks do not
    match those requirements for small scale networks. Besides, data privacy and security
    measures differ according to the deployment scale. Finally, developing a global
    standard that comprises all aforementioned factors opens the door for a new future
    research direction in CR-based IoT evolution. SECTION VII. Conclusions The demand
    for smart and CRN enabled IoT systems is ever increasing to perceive the ambient
    radio conditions, analyze RF spectrum and make decisions how, when and where to
    transmit. This demand led to extensive research on designing CR-based IoT systems
    as typical paradigm for smart IoT systems by incorporating the cognition capabilities
    of CR. This survey has provided the existing frameworks of CR-based IoT systems,
    explored the recent SS and spectrum sharing approaches and highlighted the advantages
    and disadvantages of each approach. Moreover, the survey has identified the essential
    requirements of constructing CR-based IoT systems and highlighted the design factors.
    Furthermore, the elements of cognition cycle of CR-based IoT systems has been
    presented and discussed. In addition, the main focus of this survey has been on
    SS and spectrum sharing, since it has developed the criteria of selecting a suitable
    SS approach and MAC protocol for a proper CR-based IoT application. Also, this
    survey has explored and showed the benefits of integrating some emerging technologies,
    such as blockchain and ML approaches, with the CR-based IoT systems. Finally,
    this survey has addressed and highlighted some challenges, future research directions
    and open issues in designing CR-based IoT systems. Authors Figures References

    Footnotes Abstract: In recent years, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have received
    considerable attention from regulators, industry and research community, due to
    rapid growth in a broad range of applications. Particularly, UAVs are being used
    to provide a promising solution to reliable and cost-effective wireless communications
    from the sky. The deployment of UAVs has been regarded as an alternative complement
    of existing cellular systems, to achieve higher transmission efficiency with enhanced
    coverage and capacity. However, heavily utilized microwave spectrum bands below
    6 GHz utilized by legacy wireless systems are insufficient to attain remarkable
    data rate enhancement for numerous emerging applications. To resolve the spectrum
    crunch crisis and satisfy the requirements of 5G and beyond mobile communications,
    one potential solution is to use the abundance of unoccupied bandwidth available
    at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies. Inspired by the technique potentials,
    mmWave communications have also paved the way into the widespread use of UAVs
    to assist wireless networks for future 5G and beyond wireless applications. In
    this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on current achievements in the integration
    of 5G mmWave communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks. More precisely,
    a taxonomy to classify the existing research issues is presented, by considering
    seven cutting-edge solutions. Subsequently, we provide a brief overview of 5G
    mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks from two aspects, i.e.,
    key technical advantages and challenges as well as potential applications. Based
    on the proposed taxonomy, we further discuss in detail the state-of-the-art issues,
    solutions, and open challenges for this newly emerging area. Lastly, we complete
    this survey by pointing out open issues and shedding new light on future directions
    for further research on this area. Topic: Millimeter-Wave Communications: New

    vehicles (UAVs), popularly known as drones, refer to a class of aircrafts that
    operates without a human pilot aboard. The flight of UAVs can be realized with
    various degrees of autonomy: either under the remote control by a human operator
    or autonomously by the onboard sensors and computers. Due to their capability
    to hover, sufficient flexibility, ease of deployment, higher maneuverability,
    lower operating and maintenance costs, UAVs have attracted significant attention
    recently for both civilian and commercial applications. They are being used in
    a broad range of ways ranging from precision agriculture, smart logistics, law
    enforcement, disaster response, prehospital emergency care, and mineral exploration,
    to personal business drone-based photography and drone racing [1]–[6]. For instance,
    Amazon is projected to own nearly 450,000 commercial drones in its delivery fleet
    by 2020 under the proposed “Amazon Prime Air” service, operating with delivery
    worldwide [7]. Meanwhile, the advent of a new generation of highly capable UAVs
    has also led to plenty of interest in the use of UAVs to provide reliable and
    cost-effective solutions for wireless communications in many real-world scenarios
    [8]–[14]. In particular, by the aid of wireless communication modules, UAVs can
    be rapidly deployed as flying base stations (BSs) in three-dimensional (3D) space.
    The aerial deployment has been regarded as a promising way to provide ubiquitous
    access from the sky towards ground user equipments (UEs) in specified areas during
    temporary events (e.g., hotspot areas and large public venues) [8], [12], [13],
    [15]–[18]. Compared with terrestrial static BSs, one unmatched advantage of using
    UAV-based flying BSs is that their positions and altitudes can be dynamically
    adjusted to provide on-the-fly air-to-ground (A2G) communication links. The placement
    of flying BSs has been viewed as an effective complement of existing cellular
    systems to enhance wireless capacity and coverage footprint on the ground with
    ultra dense traffic demands, to meet the requirements of the fifth generation
    (5G) and beyond 5G (B5G) cellular mobile communications. As a consequence of practical
    demands, several drone programs about aerial BSs1 from industrial communities
    have already been initiated, e.g., AT&T’s all-weather flying COW (Cell on Wings)
    to provide the Long Term Evolution (LTE) coverage of the fourth generation (4G)
    cellular systems, Verizon’s Airborne LTE Operations (ALO) initiative to enable
    the access to wireless connectivity, Nokia Bell Labs’F-Cell (flying-cell) to enable
    the “drop and forget” small cell deployment anywhere, Facebook’s Aquila using
    the solar-powered drone to blast Internet to underserved areas via laser communications,
    etc. On the other hand, UAVs can be utilized as mobile relays to provide wireless
    connectivity for partitioned ground UEs without any direct line-of-sight (LOS)
    transmission links because of the blocking of physical obstacles like mountains
    or buildings [9], [19]. Given this scenario, the load-carry-and-deliver forwarding
    strategy is well tailored to the use of a single UAV to relay data packets from
    one source UE to another destination UE, aiming to achieve higher system throughput
    [20]. From the perspective of aerodynamics characteristics, the distinct features
    of various mainstream drones, such as flying altitude, energy resource, maximum
    payload, and endurance time, will necessitate the configuration of multi-tier
    architecture for future drone-cell networks [12], [21]–[23]. It has been further
    highlighted that the coordination, collaboration, and self-organizing flocking
    behavior of multiple UAVs under this architecture can create flying ad hoc networks
    (FANETs), Internet of Drones (IoD), and even drone swarm like a flock of birds
    which is beyond the capability of one single UAV [24]–[28]. Technically, the integration
    of collective intelligence into the drone swarm will ultimately bring lots of
    benefits for 5G cellular mobile systems, e.g., higher downlink spectral efficiency
    and better quality of experience (QoE) for ground UEs. From all the above realistic
    applications of interest, we can observe that the widespread use of UAVs has exerted
    an important influence on wireless networking. The networking strategy by employing
    one single UAV or multiple UAVs to assist wireless networks has attracted even
    more attention from both academia and industry. Beyond that, several other typical
    applications about UAV-assisted wireless networks include wireless sensor networks
    (WSNs) [29], vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communications [30], Internet of Things
    (IoT) [31], flyMesh [32], wireless powered networks [33], caching aided wireless
    networks [34], mobile edge computing (MEC) [35], [36], cloud radio access networks
    (CRANs) [37], emergency networks [38], device-to-device (D2D) communications [19],
    cognitive radio (CR) networks [39], etc. In addition to the role of classic aerial
    BS, the part played by UAVs in these application scenarios has covered various
    networking entities such as aerial relay, aerial data collector, aerial caching,
    aerial MEC server, aerial power source, and so on. These representative applications
    by leveraging one single UAV or multiple UAVs to assist wireless networks are
    summarized in Table 1 for the ease of reference. TABLE 1 Summary of Typical Applications
    of UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks In the past few years, the rapid proliferation
    of massive number of internet-connected things (e.g., smart devices, industrial
    sensors, driverless cars, connected factories, etc.), and their various emerging
    applications (e.g., ultra-high definition video, artificial intelligence, face
    recognition, Tactile Internet, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), broadband
    kiosks, cloud gaming, autonomous driving, etc.) have propelled the explosive growth
    in wireless data traffic. However, radio spectrum resources in legacy cellular
    systems and conventional wireless local area networks (WLANs) based on IEEE 802.11
    standards2 that are all operating in the microwave frequency bands below 6 GHz
    frequencies have been already heavily utilized. There is more and more concern
    about limited spectrum available for use relative to the exponentially growing
    data capacity demand. Several enabling techniques have been proposed to achieve
    enhanced network capacity and higher spectral efficiency for future cellular systems,
    e.g., massive multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) [40], cognitive radio
    [41], network densification [42], non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) [43],
    advanced channel coding and modulation [44], cooperative relaying [45], etc. Nevertheless,
    those advances will not be an essential step towards tackling the issue of limited
    available spectrum. To overcome the spectrum crunch crisis, one potential solution
    has been to expand the use of higher frequencies in radio spectrum, since large
    amount of licensed and unlicensed spectrum bands are still available at these
    frequencies. As such, the expanded use of millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies,
    ranging from around 30 GHz to 300 GHz, has been recognized as a promising approach
    for providing wide available spectrum resources and multiple Gigabit data transmission
    speeds [46]–[52]. With this incomparable advantage, mmWave communications are
    indeed more suited to 5G and B5G wireless systems with the requirements of massive
    data throughput, high wireless bandwidth, super-fast speeds, ultra-low latency,
    and increased connectivity for a networked society. They will also be dedicated
    to the support of a wide variety of broadband applications envisioned for Multiple
    Gigabit Wireless Systems (MGWS) in the frequencies around 60 GHz unlicensed industrial,
    scientific and medical (ISM) frequency band, and WiGig (wireless Gigabit) network
    as the 60 GHz Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) solution [53]. In addition, the use of
    mmWave communications has been highlighted as a key enabler for 5G New Radio (NR)
    developed by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as a unified air
    interface to support many user cases expected in 5G, e.g., enhanced Mobile Broadband
    (eMBB) and Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) [54]–[56]. Owing
    to the promising applications of UAVs to assist wireless networks along with the
    possibility of multiple Gigabit data transmissions by using 5G mmWave communications,
    a natural idea is to link UAV-assisted wireless networking and mmWave communications
    together. Fig. 1 depicts the application scenario of 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks. In the typical scenario, multiple rotary-wing
    drones act as flying BSs, aerial radio access points, and aerial relays via A2G
    mmWave beams to expand wireless coverage footprint and provide multi-Gigabit transmission
    towards physical objects including ground UEs in 5G systems, and ground vehicles
    in vehicular networks via vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I) communications. The information exchange and transfer among several drones,
    e.g., fixed-wing drones and rotary-wing drones, can be achieved through multi-hop
    drone relaying by means of air-to-air (A2A) mmWave beams. Moreover, drones are
    deployed as access networks for ground D2D transmitters (TXs) and receivers (RXs)
    (i.e., D2D pairs) at hotspot areas to provide additional capacity without the
    support of terrestrial BSs. FIGURE 1. Illustration of 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks. Show All There is no doubt that the use of
    mmWave frequencies will be definitely a very promising way for UAV-assisted wireless
    networks to sustain ultra-high-speed and real-time transmissions for future 5G
    and B5G wireless applications. The integration of the merits from these two techniques
    has inspired their respective advantages: MmWave communications for UAV-assisted
    wireless networks can support higher data rate due to higher bandwidth. It is
    easier to achieve the peak data rate of up to 10 Gbit/s which is unlikely to be
    matched by any wireless technologies with lower microwave frequencies. Conceptually,
    a large amount of licensed and unlicensed mmWave frequency bands are potentially
    available for use in UAV-assisted wireless networks, e.g., 28 GHz licensed band
    and 60 GHz unlicensed ISM band [57]. Much shorter mmWave wavelength makes it feasible
    to design the physically smaller mmWave circuits and antennas, which enables to
    build the beamforming antenna arrays with many antennas to be packed on a chip
    in a tiny component size [52], [58]. It is perfect for low-altitude short range
    UAVs with limited payloads. Low interference and increased security benefit from
    the inherently directional mmWave beams and the narrow beamwidth with a high immunity
    to jamming and eavesdropping [48], [59]. In spite of being advantageous, atmospheric
    absorption at mmWave wavelengths is a concern of 5G mmWave communications for
    UAV-assisted wireless networks, thus restricting their transmission range of mmWave
    signals and resulting in high propagation attenuation at higher mmWave frequencies
    [60], [61]. Another major technical challenge is blockage effect, when travelling
    mmWave signals are blocked by physical obstacles in their propagation paths. For
    instance, human-body blockage [62]–[65] and self-blockage [59] caused by human
    activity and components of UAV itself, respectively, which poses extra challenges
    on mmWave LOS propagation. In this paper, we focus on the scenario of the combination
    of 5G mmWave communications with UAV-assisted wireless networks and the emerging
    studies related to the integration of these two important areas. Although UAV-assisted
    wireless networks and mmWave communications have been studied extensively in previous
    works, existing surveys and tutorials either cover UAV-assisted wireless networks
    and UAV communications for 5G and beyond [8], [11], [12], [24], [25], [66]–[68],
    or concentrate on mmWave communications for 5G and vehicular communications [48]–[50],
    [69]–[73]. Those existing contributions are still separated across these two important
    areas. To the best of our knowledge, only two existing survey papers in [10],
    [66] are related to mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks.
    Nevertheless, the work in [66] by Li et al. just shortly review the technology
    challenges and existing solutions for mmWave UAV-assisted cellular networks as
    one of physical layer techniques over the entire topic focused on. Although the
    work in [10] by Xiao et al. discussed the major technical challenges and possible
    solutions in mmWave UAV cellular systems for the first time, they did not fully
    cover the detailed progress of the state-of-the-art comprehensively. This motivates
    us to deliver a detailed survey with the objective to give a comprehensive summary
    of current achievements in the integration of 5G mmWave communications into UAV-assisted
    wireless networks, and to discuss the state-of-the-art issues, solutions, and
    open challenges in this newly emerging area. In this survey, a taxonomy graph
    to classify the related research issues based on the existing literatures is presented
    in Fig. 2. As displayed in Fig. 2, we will discuss seven important research issues
    that we would like to be targeted at: antenna technique, radio propagation channel,
    multiple access mechanism, spatial configuration, resource management, security
    strategy, and performance assessment. To the authors’ best knowledge, this paper
    is the first comprehensive effort to review the cutting-edge solutions related
    with 5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks in a holistic
    way. With this survey, our objective is to provide readers with an overall understanding
    of what has been accomplished so far, in the area of 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks, and to open up new perspectives for subsequent
    studies on this area. FIGURE 2. Taxonomy of related research issues in 5G mmWave
    communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks. Show All For convenience, a
    list of acronyms used in this paper is provided in Table 2. The remainder of the

    wireless networks. In Section IV, we comprehensively review the state-of-the-art
    research issues and challenges from the perspective of the taxonomy of the related
    research issues. Then Section V summarizes the current research and proposes the
    open issues together with the future research directions. Finally, Section VI
    concludes the paper. For the sake of clear presentation, the organizational structure

    Surveys and Tutorials In this section, we will present the existing surveys and
    tutorials, including UAV-assisted wireless networks and communications as well
    as 5G mmWave communications. Moreover, the comparison of this paper with existing
    surveys and tutorials will be also summarized. A. UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks
    and Communications During the past few years, a number of excellent surveys and
    tutorials have been reported to be published in the fields of UAV-assisted wireless
    networks and UAV communications for 5G and B5G wireless systems. Mozaffari et
    al. [8] presented a comprehensive tutorial on UAV-enabled wireless communications
    and networking applications, and provided the insightful comments to some important
    research opportunities and challenges in flying BSs. The analytical frameworks
    and optimization tools were proposed to deal with the challenging open problems
    towards UAV communications and networking. Gupta et al. [25] briefly discussed
    the challenges to effectively design stable and reliable context-specific UAV
    networks according to their inherent features. The authors put more emphasis on
    the problems of routing, seamless handover, and energy efficiency in UAV networks.
    With relation to routing mechanism, Jiang and Han [74] carried out a brief survey
    on routing protocols for UAVs based on hop counts, i.e., single-hop and multi-hop
    routing. Besides, position-based routing protocols and cluster-based routing protocols
    for UAV networks were extensively surveyed and compared by Oubbati et al. [75]
    and Arafat and Moh [76], respectively. By integrating UAVs into cellular networks,
    Fotouhi et al. [11] conducted a comprehensive survey on some major networking
    issues about UAV cellular communications, such as standardization efforts for
    aerial UE, deployment of aerial BSs, drone communication prototypes, security
    and so forth. Li et al. [66] presented a comprehensive survey on key techniques
    for UAV communication towards 5G and B5G wireless networks from three aspects
    involving physical layer, network layer, and joint communication, computing and
    caching. Particularly, mmWave communications as a key technology at physical layer
    of UAV-assisted cellular networks was briefly discussed. From the perspective
    of cyber physical system (CPS), Wang et al. [67] carried out a systematic review
    of UAV networks, with an emphasis on the impact of CPS components on the system
    performance of UAV networks. A survey on wireless communications, evaluation tools
    and applications in unmanned aerial and aquatic vehicle multi-hop networks was
    described in the literature by Sánchez-García et al. [68]. Similar to UAV multi-hop
    networks, Bekmezci et al. [24] presented a survey on communication protocols from
    four layers and cross-layer interactions in FANET which is typically a kind of
    ad hoc networks. Driven by future drone-cell networks, Sekander et al. [12] reviewed
    the existing innovations in drone networks and drone-assisted cellular networks,
    and proposed the multi-tier drone network architecture over the conventional single-tier
    drone networks. In addition to these surveys and tutorials on UAV networks [25],
    [67], [68], UAV cellular networks [11], [66], UAV-enabled wireless networks [8],
    FANETs [24], and multi-tier drone networks [12], several other surveys have also
    been published on different topics with regard to UAV-related networks and communications,
    such as channel modeling [77], civil applications [1], [78], UAV-assisted vehicular
    networks [30], wireless charging techniques [79], IoT services [6], game-theoretic
    optimization approach [80], CR-based UAV [39], etc. B. 5G mmWave Communications
    Many other existing survey papers have been dedicated to mmWave communications
    for 5G wireless systems and vehicular communications. By surveying the recent
    channel measurements of mmWave signals in urban environments, Rangan et al. [69]
    elaborated on several techniques including adaptive beamforming, multi-hop relaying,
    heterogeneous network (HetNet) architectures, and carrier aggregation in the context
    of mmWave cellular wireless networks. Xiao et al. [48] gave a systematic survey
    on main technical progress of mmWave communications for 5G and B5G mobile networks.
    The authors focused primarily on mmWave channel measurement campaigns and modeling,
    mmWave MIMO systems, multiple-access technologies, mmWave bands for backhauling,
    etc. Furthermore, Niu et al. [49] conducted a survey on existing research progress
    in 5G mmWave communications. The authors mainly discussed the peculiar characteristics,
    research challenges, and potential applications of mmWave communications. Other
    similar surveys and tutorials on mmWave communications for 5G and B5G were also
    reported in recent literature [50], [70], [71]. The work of Rappaport et al. in
    [50] focused on mmWave propagation measurement campaigns conducted in New York
    City, NY with 28 GHz mmWave frequencies and Austin, TX with 38 GHz mmWave frequencies.
    Also, the surveys carried out by Hemadeh et al. [70] and Rappaport et al. [71]
    were both targeted at mmWave propagation characteristics and channel modeling.
    Faced to the challenges of ultra-high-speed WLANs, Zhou et al. [72] presented
    a comprehensive survey on MAC-related issues, especially channel access for multiple
    channels and beamforming for both single-user MIMO and multi-user MIMO, for mmWave
    WLANs based on the IEEE 802.11ay standard. Lastly, Jameel et al. [73] briefly
    discussed the mmWave propagation channel modeling from the perspective of vehicular
    communications. Different from all the works as mentioned previously, Xiao et
    al. [10] combined mmWave communications with UAV cellular networks together, and
    presented a brief overview of key technical challenges and possible solutions
    in mmWave UAV cellular, including mmWave channel propagation characteristics,
    fast beamforming training and tracking, mmWave spatial-division multiple access
    (SDMA), problem of mmWave blockage effect, and directional user discovery. To
    sum up, as Table 3 shows, we provide a brief comparison of our study with existing
    survey papers outlined before mainly from three aspects, including topic focused
    on, main issues elaborated and addressed, and whether the integration of mmWave
    communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks or not. In Table 3, we use
    “mmWave-UAV” as the abbreviation to represent the integration of mmWave communications
    into UAV-assisted wireless networks due to the limited space of this table. In
    comparison with the aforementioned survey papers, this survey provides a critical
    and systematic overview of the up-to-date activities related to research issues
    on 5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks from the point
    of view of literature classification. TABLE 3 A Brief Comparison of Our Study
    With Existing Survey Papers and Tutorials SECTION III. An Overview of 5G mmWave
    Communications for UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks In this section, we will present
    a brief overview on 5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks.
    Specifically, we will first introduce the key technique advantages and challenges
    of 5G mmWave communications. Then the integration of 5G mmWave communications
    into UAV-assisted wireless networks will be briefly discussed from two aspects,
    i.e., potential applications as well as main technical advantages and challenges.
    A. Key Technical Advantages and Challenges of 5G mmWave Communications 1) Technical
    Advantages The mmWave communications will play an important role in 5G and B5G
    wireless systems, due to the ability to support orders of magnitude increases
    in network capacity. In what follows, we will briefly discuss the key technique
    advantages of 5G mmWave communications from four perspectives, i.e., larger bandwidth
    availability, shorter wavelength, narrow beam, and increased security/interference
    immunity. a: Larger Bandwidth Availability The mmWave range in the electromagnetic
    spectrum is usually considered to be the band of spectrum from around 30 GHz to
    300 GHz that lies between the microwaves and the infrared waves, also called the
    Extremely High Frequency (EHF) range. The abundance of unoccupied bandwidth available
    at mmWave frequencies is one of key advantages of 5G mmWave communications compared
    to limited microwave spectrum resources below 6 GHz currently used by conventional
    wireless systems and existing 4G LTE. Particularly, the available bandwidth in
    mmWave frequency bands of 71 ~ 76 GHz and 81 ~ 86 GHz (widely known as E-band)
    is more than the sum total of all other licensed spectrum available for existing
    wireless systems [81]. It is obvious that heavily utilized microwave spectrum
    below 6 GHz for existing wireless systems is insufficient to attain the Gigabit
    data transmission speeds. However, there are still huge amount of lightly licensed
    and unused spectrum resources available at mmWave frequencies reserved for future
    applications around the world. The larger bandwidth translates to extremely high
    data rates, easily achieving the peak data rates of 10 Gbit/s or more with full
    duplex capability, which is much greater than the limit rate of 1 Gbit/s by using
    lower microwave frequencies [71]. This achievement of remarkable data rate enhancement
    has been theoretically verified through the Shannon-Hartley theorem showing that
    the capacity increases linearly with the bandwidth. In light of the advantage
    of larger bandwidth availability, a multi-layer spectrum approach was proposed
    by Huawei, based on the consideration of divergent requirements of 5G services
    and different characteristics of related frequency bands. The 24.25 ~ 29.5 GHz
    and 37 ~ 43.5 GHz mmWave frequency bands were specifically selected for early
    deployment of 5G mmWave systems in accordance with the 3GPP Release 15 [82]. To
    provide the full-duplex Gigabit Ethernet connectivity at the data rates of 1 Gbit/s
    or higher, the E-band (i.e., 71~ 76 GHz and 81~ 86 GHz) was initially allocated
    by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as early as 1979, to support
    the ultra high capacity point-to-point communications [83]. The ITU and 3GPP also
    launched a plan for two phases of research for 5G standards, covering two mmWave
    frequency bands to be used with commercial needs, i.e., 40 GHz and 100 GHz [84].
    In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proposed the flexible service
    rules for the mmWave frequency bands including 28 GHz, 37 GHz, and 39 GHz for
    licensed usage, and 64~ 71 GHz for unlicensed usage [85]. In addition to the ongoing
    efforts from the regulators and industrial communities, some service providers
    are all fighting to establish their 5G commercial networks by using the extraordinary
    amount of bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies. In many instances, AT&T and
    Verizon have been focused on the 39 GHz and 28 GHz mmWave frequency bands, respectively,
    for their initial 5G deployments. b: Shorter Wavelength Within the range of the
    electromagnetic spectrum, higher frequency of electromagnetic wave implies shorter
    wavelength of wave, which means that more information can be transmitted per unit
    of time. Compared to microwave signals below 6 GHz previously used by increasingly
    crowded traditional cellular systems and WLANs, mmWave signals have much shorter
    wavelengths that span between 10 mm and 1 mm.3 For example, mmWave signals at
    28 GHz, 60 GHz, and 300 GHz have the extremely short wavelengths of 10.7 mm, 5
    mm, and 1 mm, respectively. In particular, the wavelengths of mmWave signals at
    28 GHz and 73 GHz are nearly 10 ~ 30 times smaller than the wavelength of microwave
    signal at 2.5 GHz [69]. Additionally, shorter wavelengths for mmWave signals also
    bring about several distinct benefits: Tiny component sizes: Compared with lower
    microwave frequencies, the components and antennas for mmWave frequencies can
    be designed in tiny physical dimensions owing to smaller millimeter-long wavelengths.
    Thus, dozens to hundreds of antenna elements are easily packed in an array of
    tiny size similar to fingernail, which makes it feasible to miniaturize physically
    smaller circuits, modules, and equipments for 5G mmWave applications [50], [52],
    [58], [69]. A typical half-wave dipole at 900 MHz is 152.4 mm long, but it is
    only 2.5 mm at 60 GHz in free space or even less when built on a dielectric substrate
    [87]. More recently, Qualcomm designed and developed the world’s first fully-integrated
    5G NR mmWave antenna module QTM052 for next generation smartphones and mobile
    devices. The antenna module packs a tiny phased antenna array with a compact dimension,
    roughly the size of a one-cent coin, as shown in Fig. 4. With these smaller antenna
    modules, equipment manufacturers will have more options for antenna placement,
    providing them with more freedom and flexibility in the design of 5G NR devices,
    e.g., more space for batteries and more choices for smaller smartphones. Higher
    antenna gains: Based on the electromagnetics and antenna theory, shorter wavelengths
    of mmWave signals can obtain proportionally higher antenna gains under the given
    effective antenna aperture. Because of smaller physical dimensions at mmWave frequencies,
    the application of large-scale multi-element antenna arrays enables greater antenna
    gain and achieves highly directional beamforming. Through the configuration of
    a pair of transmit antennas with the same aperture areas and the equal transmit
    power, 30 dB more gain can be achieved at 80 GHz mmWave beam compared to that
    of 2.4 GHz microwave frequency [70]. With the fully digital processing, massive
    MIMO can be integrated to achieve large beamforming gains [88]–[90]. FIGURE 4.
    The comparison of size scale between a one-cent coin and two QTM052 mmWave antenna
    modules announced in July and October 2018, respectively. (Image source: Qualcomm
    Technologies, Inc. [86]). Show All c: Narrow Beam By jointly combining digital
    precoding and analog beamforming, shorter wavelengths of mmWave signals enable
    the integration of massive MIMO with dozens to hundreds of antenna elements to
    be packed into a small space at mmWave transceivers. The antennas can steer mmWave
    beams rapidly in different directions. According to the electromagnetics and antenna
    theory, the increased frequencies result in the decreased beamwidth. As a result,
    highly directional steerable narrow beams can be formed for mmWave antenna arrays
    to direct the transmit power precisely towards the intended users along a desired
    direction [91]. It has been suggested that beam orientation of mmWave signals
    can be optimized, aiming to reduce the energy loss during transmission. Therefore,
    mmWave antennas with narrow directional beams can send and receive much more energy
    to compensate for stronger propagation attenuation and higher free space path
    loss of mmWave signals. These characteristics make mmWave communications be more
    specifically suited to ultra high capacity point-to-point transmission. Moreover,
    another major advantage of the formed narrow beamwidth is spatial reuse over the
    same spectrum to simultaneously serve multiple users with different radios within
    a specific small geographical area. It is further revealed that system capacity
    has an apparent enhancement by employing mmWave antennas with narrow beamwidth
    than the capacity by using wider beamwidth antennas of microwave frequencies [92].
    d: Increased Security and Interference Immunity In contrast to the congested spectrum
    and the easily intercepted signals caused by wide beams at lower microwave frequencies
    below 6 GHz, narrow beams of mmWave signals allow the ability to obtain highly
    directional signals and greater resolutions. When malicious eavesdroppers want
    to intercept and decode the confidential messages successfully, they need to physically
    be within the transmission path of mmWave signals with narrow beams. With the
    help of complicated and high-cost hardware equipments as well as accurate location,
    eavesdroppers may have the possibility to intercept mmWave signals. Obviously,
    the inherent benefits including highly directional beams and greater resolutions
    make the interception of mmWave signals much more difficult and costly because
    mmWave signals are only restricted to a relatively small area. Therefore, the
    security of mmWave communications and the privacy of mmWave users can be enhanced,
    by protecting the sensitive and legitimate messages from passively eavesdropping
    and actively jamming [48], [59], [93]. Additionally, narrow beams also make mmWave
    transmission highly immune to interference and noise at the receiving end due
    to the capability to focus their transmit power levels of mmWave signals. 2) Technical
    Challenges Despite many attracting technique benefits and potentials for 5G mmWave
    communications, there still have several challenges and limitations that we should
    try to overcome for mobilizing mmWave. a: Free Space Path Loss The free space
    path loss is the loss in signal strength of a signal in terms of radio energy
    when it travels between the feedpoints of two antennas through free space (i.e.,
    unobstructed LOS channels in the air) [94]. The signal strength of a signal can
    be measured as the transmitter power output received by a receiving antenna at
    a transmission distance from the transmitting antenna. We generally employ the
    Friis transmission equation as follows to calculate the power (denoted by P R
    ) received from a receiving antenna with gain G R , when transmitted from the
    transmitting antenna with gain G T [95]: P R P T = G T G R d −n ( λ 4π ) 2 , (1)
    View Source where P T is the transmit power, λ is the signal wavelength, d is
    the transmission distance between the TX and RX antennas, and n is the path loss
    exponent. For free space scenario, n=2 [95]. We also note that n usually has different
    values that depend on radio propagation channels for various complex environments
    [96], e.g., n∈[2.7,4.0] for normal urban area cellular radio and n∈[1.6,1.8] for
    indoor LOS scenarios. According to (1), free space path loss can be expressed
    by P L FS = ( 4πd λ ) 2 = ( 4πdf c ) 2 , where f is the signal frequency and c
    is the speed of light. We can actually use P L FS to predict the signal strength
    of a signal at a given distance d of interest. For the typical applications of
    wireless communications and networking, P L FS can be described through a convenient
    way in unit of dB by adopting f in GHz and d in km: P L FS =20 log 10 (d)+20 log
    10 (f)+92.45 (2) View Source Based on (2), P L FS can be obtained in direct proportion
    to signal frequency and transmission distance. Compared to microwave signals below
    6 GHz, free space path loss is much higher for mmWave signals at higher frequencies
    under the condition of the same transmission distance and antenna configurations.
    With different transmission distances, free space path loss at microwave and mmWave
    frequencies is depicted in Fig. 5. As the signal frequency increases, free space
    path loss will raise as well. From the figure, it is also clearly revealed that
    free space path loss will increase for both microwave and mmWave frequencies with
    the growth of transmission distance between the TX and RX antennas. This demonstrates
    that the use of mmWave frequencies limits the transmission distance, e.g., 60
    GHz indoor short-range broadband communications at 3.5 Gbit/s over a range of
    5 m [97]. However, to extend the communication distance, several advanced solutions,
    e.g., distance-adaptive design at physical layer, ultra-massive MIMO, reflectarrays,
    and HyperSurfaces, have been proposed with the improved transmission distance
    up to 100 m in both LOS and NLOS areas at 60 GHz [98]. Recent field trial jointly
    carried out by Huawei and NTT DoCoMo has further attained the long-distance transmission
    with 5G high data speed at 39 GHz in both stationary and mobility scenarios [99].
    In addition, the path loss of mmWave NLOS links is more larger than the free space
    path loss of mmWave unobstructed LOS links. For instance, based on the measurement
    campaigns at 60 GHz, the NLOS path loss is 147.4 dB which is obviously higher
    than the LOS free space path loss with the value 119.3 dB under the transmission
    distance 200 m [100]. FIGURE 5. The free space path loss at microwave and mmWave
    frequencies under different transmission distances. Show All b: Atmospheric Attenuation
    The free space path loss just reflects only a kind of signal attenuation which
    occurs while traveling in the ideal vacuum environment. But beyond that, mmWave
    signals traveling in free space are also effected by frequency-related atmospheric
    attenuation. In principle, the propagation of mmWave signals is typically influenced
    by interaction of atmospheric molecules in the form of oxygen, water vapor, rain,
    fog, cloud, etc, within the Earth’s atmosphere. The atmospheric attenuation is
    primarily caused by the vibrating attribute of atmospheric molecules when they
    interact with mmWave propagation. More precisely, these molecules can absorb a
    certain portion of signal energy of mmWave propagation and vibrate with a strength
    proportional to signal frequency [70], [101], [102]. The atmospheric effect below
    10 GHz is relatively low and can be also measured by using the Friis transmission
    equation [103], however atmospheric attenuation for mmWave frequencies and higher
    increases significantly, specially at certain frequencies. Hence, atmospheric
    effects on mmWave propagation not only restrict the transmission distance of mmWave
    signals, but also affect the utilization of 5G mmWave communications. With the
    varying frequencies from 1 GHz to 350 GHz, atmospheric attenuation per kilometer
    generated by atmospheric oxygen and water vapor at sea level is displayed in Fig.
    6. We can observe from this figure that atmospheric gases make the signal attenuation
    very high at mmWave frequencies, especially for the water vapor density of 7.5g/m3.
    Moreover, there are three attenuation peaks of atmospheric absorption in the frequency
    bands approximately 60 GHz, 120 GHz, and 180 GHz, wherein the attenuation reaches
    the maximum values, namely, 14.65 dB/km, 2.0 dB/km, and 27.77 dB/km, respectively.
    Specifically, atmospheric oxygen absorption is particularly high at 60 GHz and
    120 GHz, and water vapor absorption is especially high at 180 GHz. These attenuation
    peak points are caused by absorption resonances of atmospheric molecules such
    as oxygen and water vapor at those frequencies. FIGURE 6. The specific attenuation
    caused by atmospheric oxygen and water vapor at microwave and mmWave frequencies
    under whether there has water vapor with the density of 7.5g/m3 or not. Here,
    atmospheric pressure P=101.325kPa , temperature T= 20 ∘ C , and distance d=1km
    . Show All In addition to atmospheric absorption by oxygen and water vapor, rain
    attenuation can be regarded as the most significant propagation impairment for
    mmWave frequencies. The raindrops are approximately the same order of the size
    as the wavelengths of mmWave signals. Therefore, the rainfall causes additional
    attenuation due to the scattering and absorption of electromagnetic waves by rain
    particles. Theoretically, rain attenuation has a bearing on raindrop shape, raindrop
    size distribution, rain rate, signal polarization and frequency, etc [102], [104],
    [105]. The impact of rainfall intensity on rain attenuation per kilometer at sea
    level under the varying frequencies between 1 GHz and 350 GHz is further shown
    in Fig. 7. As can be observed, rain attenuation at mmWave frequencies is much
    higher than that of microwave frequencies. On the other hand, as the rain rate
    increases, the attenuation will also become greater. Despite the inevitable rain
    attenuation, there are also a number of frequency windows wherein atmospheric
    attenuation is significantly smaller. In consequence, these windows at mmWave
    frequencies provide the opportunity for mobilizing mmWave. FIGURE 7. The rain
    attenuation at microwave and mmWave frequencies under different rainfall intensities
    in terms of rain rates. Here, distance d=1km . Show All c: Blockage Effect Although
    mmWave communications own the capability to provide ultra-high-speed indoor wireless
    transmission, wireless backhaul, small cell access, cellular access, etc, mmWave
    bands are not robust enough and the system performance degrades significantly
    due to the sensitivity of mmWave links to blockages, e.g., static, dynamic, and
    self-blockage [106]. Typically, the propagation of mmWave signals is rather susceptible
    to blockage effect due to severe penetration loss and higher reflection/diffraction
    loss [106]–[108]. These losses of mmWave signals are caused by different materials
    or surfaces of the physical obstacles and even foliage penetration while traveling
    in their propagation paths blocked by the obstacles. It should be admitted that
    several factors including shape, dimension, and material type of the obstacles
    have a dramatic impact on blockage effect at mmWave bands. In many instances,
    the attenuation of mmWave signals at 60 GHz for drywall with the thickness of
    2.5 cm and mesh glass with the thickness of 0.3 cm reaches 6.0 dB and 10.2 dB,
    respectively [107]. Even more serious, mmWave signals cannot penetrate most solid
    materials compared to microwave signals. With respect to the duration of blockage
    with 0.2 s, the blockage of human body can result in the reduction of signal strength
    of mmWave signals at 60 GHz by 20 dB, much greater than at microwave frequencies
    [109]. As a consequence, frequent blockages of mmWave LOS links and large blockage
    duration lead to performance degradation of 5G mmWave communications. Fortunately,
    traveling signals still have the alternative ways to reach the RX side by the
    aid of diffraction, reflection and scattering, in spite of the blockages of mmWave
    LOS links [110]. d: Beam Misalignment The narrow beams of mmWave signals allow
    the ability to achieve highly directional beams and greater resolutions along
    the desired directions. We can utilize the highly directional antennas to focus
    their power of steerable narrow beams on the intended users. With the large-scale
    antenna arrays, highly directional beamforming can be leveraged to compensate
    for stronger atmospheric attenuation and higher free space path loss at mmWave
    frequencies. In order to fully take advantage of highly directional mmWave transmission
    or reception, the beams between TX and RX sides need to be well steered and aligned
    [111]–[114]. Efficient beam alignment policies, e.g., beam tracking, beam training,
    hierarchical beam codebook design, accurate estimation of the channel, etc, are
    required to reduce the delay overhead with or without a priori knowledge of the
    TX and RX locations [115]–[118]. Nevertheless, due to the decrease of beamwidth
    of mmWave signals and the mobility of UEs, it will become more and more difficult
    to effectively align the beams between TX and RX sides [111], [119]. To this end,
    beam misalignment between TX and RX sides is unavoidable from practical view points.
    The misalignment of beams not only reduces the probability of successful transmission
    and reception for TX and RX sides, but also degrades the network performance,
    such as severe delay spread, reduced system throughput, and significant loss of
    beamforming gain. Based on the measurements, beam misalignment can cause additional
    propagation loss of mmWave links that is almost symmetric with respect to the
    misaligned angle [120]. For instance, in the mmWave system with the beamwidth
    of 7°, the beam misalignment of 18° results in the link budget drop by about 17
    dB, which further generates the maximum throughput reduction by up to 6 Gbit/s
    or leads to the entire link interruption [121]. B. Integration of 5G mmWave Communications
    Into UAV-Assisted 1) Potential Applications As has been mentioned before, the
    use of 5G mmWave communications can bring multiple benefits including larger bandwidth
    availability, shorter wavelength, narrow beam, increased security/interference
    immunity, etc. Meanwhile, UAVs are being used to provide a promising solution
    to reliable and cost-effective wireless communications from the sky. On the one
    hand, they can be deployed as flying BSs to enable aerial access to ground UEs
    in target areas. On the other hand, UAVs can serve as aerial relays for partitioned
    ground UEs, and can even create multi-tier architecture for FANETs or connected
    drones. As such, the application of UAVs has been considered as an alternative
    complement of legacy cellular systems, with the potentials to achieve higher transmission
    efficiency, enhanced wireless coverage, and improved system capacity. To meet
    the exponentially growing data capacity demand of future 5G and beyond wireless
    applications, an intuitive way is to integrate UAV-assisted wireless networking
    with mmWave communications. With this integration of two promising techniques,
    three kinds of typical applications can be summarized as follows: a: Aerial Access
    Via A2G/G2A MmWave Links As previously introduced, UAVs can be used to provide
    aerial access from the sky to ground UEs in a certain area of interest. As summarized
    in Table 1, we can deploy the UAVs as many forms of aerial access equipments,
    e.g., aerial BS, aerial RSU, aerial data collector, and even aerial MEC server
    and caching, to achieve on-the-fly wireless access. To keep up with the exponentially
    growing data capacity demand, a promising idea is to link aerial access in UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications together. Particularly, bidirectional
    mmWave links are allowed to be properly designed for aerial access applications
    in our considered scenario. To be precise, depending on the transmission direction
    between UAVs and ground UEs, bidirectional mmWave links consist of the A2G links
    (i.e., downlink) and the ground-to-air (G2A) links (i.e., uplink). In many instances,
    typical applications for aerial access using A2G and G2A mmWave links include
    downlink NOMA transmission to serve ground UEs simultaneously [122], flying cache-enabled
    remote radio heads (RRHs) by deploying cache storage units at UAVs [37], flying
    BSs with multiple transmit antennas to provide wireless access to ground legitimate
    receivers [123], etc. b: Aerial Relay and Interconnection Via A2A MmWave Links
    UAVs can further serve as aerial relays to provide wireless connectivity towards
    ground UEs without direct transmission links. Given this scenario, data packets
    from source UE are first sent to an initial UAV via aerial access, and then transferred
    to other UAVs in a multi-hop fashion by means of UAV interconnection in FANETs
    or directly to destination UE through UAV relay using the load-carry-and-deliver
    forwarding mechanism. To meet the requirement of the sustainable increase of transmission
    capacity and data traffic, it will be far more realistic to apply higher mmWave
    frequencies instead of lower microwave frequencies to design the A2A communication
    links for both aerial relay and multi-hop interconnection. Additionally, as exhibited
    in Fig. 1, information exchange and transfer among the UAVs can be also achieved
    through multi-hop drone interconnection based on the A2A mmWave links. By using
    multiple antenna arrays to obtain multiple beams, each UAV can establish the directional
    mmWave links with its neighboring UAVs in the mmWave flyMesh architecture [32].
    c: Aerial Backhaul Via A2G/G2A MmWave Links With the ultra dense small cell deployment
    in 5G wireless systems, the backhaul between BS and core network is traditionally
    connected by optical fiber or coax in terrestrial networks, to support multiple
    Gigabit data transmissions. However, it will not be flexible, easier to deploy,
    and cost-effective for massive deployment of small cells [49], [124]. In comparison
    with wired backhaul, UAVs can serve as aerial BSs and RRHs to provide wireless
    backhaul due to flexibility, ease of deployment, and lower operating and maintenance
    costs. With the heavy data traffic burdens for small cells, UAV based aerial backhaul
    via A2G/G2A links by using mmWave frequencies has been proposed as a potential
    solution to attain Gigabit data transmission speeds. Moreover, ultra-high-speed
    wireless backhaul by integrating UAVs and mmWave communications will further improve
    the flexibility and apparently reduce the costs of wired backhaul in terrestrial
    networks [8]. For instance, the mmWave flyMesh has been proposed to provide ultra-high-speed
    wireless backhaul between mmWave flyMesh and relay BS [32]. 2) Brief Introduction
    to Technical Advantages and Challenges Inspired by the technique benefits and
    potentials for 5G mmWave communications, UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave
    communications still have some inherited merits: Multiple Gigabit data transmission
    speeds can be guaranteed for UAV-assisted wireless networking with mmWave communications,
    due to the abundance of unoccupied bandwidth available at mmWave frequencies.
    To be precise, the peak data rate of 10 Gbit/s or more can be easily achieved
    with the help of full-duplex Gigabit A2G mmWave connectivity. This attracting
    peak data rate is much greater than the limit rate of 1 Gbit/s by using traditional
    wireless technologies operating at lower microwave frequencies. A large amount
    of licensed and unlicensed mmWave frequency bands are potentially available for
    usage in UAV-assisted wireless networks including 28 GHz licensed band and 60
    GHz unlicensed ISM band [57]. From the perspective of policymakers, FCC has adopted
    rules for wireless broadband operations at frequencies above 24 GHz [125], and
    approved the unlicensed V-Band use of 57 ~ 64 GHz mmWave bands to enhance wireless
    backhaul [126]. These mmWave bands will be the candidate for A2G and G2A links
    in UAV-assisted wireless networking scenarios. Much shorter mmWave wavelength
    (ranging form 1 mm to 10 mm) makes it feasible to miniaturize physically smaller
    circuits, modules, and equipments for mmWave applications in UAV-assisted wireless
    networks. In particular, hundreds of mmWave antennas can be easily integrated
    as a beamforming array on a chip in a tiny component size [50], [52], [58], [69].
    This advantage makes mmWave antenna arrays and other related modules and equipments
    very suitable for low-altitude short range UAVs with limited payloads. Thereby,
    we can offer more choices for placing antennas, and more freedom and flexibility
    in system design and optimization for computing, memory, and communications of
    UAV payloads. Large-scale multi-element antenna arrays can be potentially applied
    into UAV-assisted wireless networking with mmWave communications. It has been
    demonstrated that greater antenna gain and highly directional 3D beamforming will
    be easily designed and achieved under this scenario [10], [127], [128]. By adopting
    the 3D beamforming, the beamforming gain can be markedly concentrated in the target
    area due to ubiquitous access from the sky [127]. The spatial beamforming gain
    enhancement can effectively combat stronger atmospheric attenuation and higher
    free space path loss at mmWave frequencies. This will bring better system performance
    in UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. Highly directional
    signals and greater resolutions can be achieved owing to narrow beams of mmWave
    signals by integrating mmWave communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks.
    On the one hand, highly directional transmission that is similar to optical-like
    propagation can enable low interference and increased security [59]. It will further
    help to protect the sensitive and legitimate messages for ground UEs from passively
    eavesdropping and actively jamming, especially for A2G mmWave links under the
    scenario of aerial BSs enabled cellular systems. On the other hand, narrow directional
    beams can concentrate much more wireless energy on target area, to compensate
    for stronger propagation attenuation and higher free space path loss of mmWave
    signals. Although there exist many attracting advantages, mmWave communications
    also pose several technique challenges and limitations towards the integration
    of mmWave communications with UAV-assisted wireless networking: Propagation behavior
    and characteristics at mmWave frequencies, i.e., severe atmospheric absorption
    and higher path loss, have restricted the transmission distance for all the potential
    application scenarios as mentioned above. This requires us to consider short distance
    of mmWave links for UAV deployment no matter in aerial access or aerial backhaul.
    In addition, for actual system design, we should avoid using three attenuation
    peaks of atmospheric absorption in the frequency bands approximately 60 GHz, 120
    GHz, and 180 GHz. Within these mmWave bands, atmospheric attenuation can reach
    the maximum values, which may further affect the system performance. This in turn
    tells us that we can take full advantage of several frequency windows with relatively
    smaller atmospheric attenuation, to achieve mmWave communications in UAV-assisted
    wireless networks. It has been highlighted that the propagation of mmWave signals
    is more susceptible to blockage effect along the propagation channel because of
    severe penetration loss and higher reflection/diffraction loss as stated previously.
    Compared with terrestrial static BSs, UAV-based flying BSs are characterized by
    dynamic time-varying positions and altitudes. This kind of high flexibility for
    UAV deployment together with the use of mmWave frequency bands make mmWave signals
    more vulnerable to the blockage problem. The typical blockage primarily includes
    human-body blockage incurred by human activity [62]–[65] and self-blockage caused
    by components of UAV itself [59]. The self-blockage of mmWave signals along the
    propagation channel is especially related with the scenario of UAV-assisted wireless
    networks, due to the components of UAV itself, e.g., the rotating propeller. Despite
    the impact of self-blockage, UAV-assisted wireless networks are more practical
    and applicable towards mmWave transmission owing to the easily established A2G
    LOS links. UAV-based aerial BSs can provide ubiquitous access from the sky owing
    to the typical characteristic of sufficient flexibility and high mobility with
    dynamic time-varying positions and altitudes. In addition, narrow mmWave beams
    and possible mobility of ground UEs make it very difficult to properly steer and
    align the highly directional beams for mmWave antenna arrays at the side of UAVs
    or ground UEs [10], [32]. Apparently, it will be far more realistic to dynamically
    adjust directional beams according to current instant time in practical dynamic
    environment. As such, achieving dynamic beam alignment between UAVs and ground
    UEs with lower overhead and computational complexity will be incredibly complicated
    and challenging. SECTION IV. Research Issues, Challenges, and State-of-the-Art
    From the perspective of the taxonomy of the state-of-the-art research advances,
    we will give readers a comprehensive summary of key topics on 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks in this section, including antenna technique,
    radio propagation channel, multiple access mechanism, spatial configuration, resource
    management, security strategy, and performance assessment. A. Antenna Technique
    As an important component of UAV-assisted wireless networks with 5G mmWave communications,
    the antenna acts as wireless interface to transmit and receive mmWave signals
    for UAVs and ground UEs. In this regard, the antennas can be figuratively described
    as the “eyes and ears” of advanced wireless communication systems. Due to the
    extension from conventional microwave frequency bands to mmWave frequency bands,
    there will be much higher propagation attenuation and severe free space path loss
    under the same communication distance and antenna gains. Compared with traditional
    user devices, high mobility and physical structures of UAVs also pose extra challenges
    on accurate tracking of dynamic mmWave beam directions. Thus, the design of high
    gain and high-efficiency antennas is of great importance for realization of UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications. As shown in Fig. 8, recent efforts
    and solutions on the antenna-related research including antenna design [129]–[132],
    beam tracking [10], [32], [133], [134], and beam optimization [135] will be summarized
    in the following subsection. FIGURE 8. The classification of antenna technique
    solutions for UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. Show
    All 1) Antenna Design The success deployment of UAV-assisted wireless networks
    with 5G mmWave communications has given fresh impetus to the development and design
    of wireless antennas, complying to the requirements of mmWave frequency bands,
    propagation characteristics, circuit components, gain rating, geometries of mounting
    devices, transceiver architecture, communication system performance, and so on.
    Based on the state-of-the-art solutions about antenna design in our considered
    scenario, we will present the existing research efforts on the design issues and
    solutions of two representative antennas, i.e., array antennas and beam antennas.
    a: Array Antenna The use of UAVs flying at a high altitude of about 20 km to build
    up the high-altitude platform station (HAPS) system and the stratospheric-platform
    (SPF) system has been recognized as a low-cost and flexible method for future
    wireless infrastructure. Compared to the outermost layer of the atmosphere in
    which the satellites orbit the earth, the deployment of UAVs at the layer of the
    atmosphere has many advantages, such as free-space like channel, lower transmit
    power similar to terrestrial systems, reduced propagation delay, etc. Based on
    this insight, Tsuji et al. [129] conducted the experiments to test the performance
    of digital beamforming (DBF) antenna and multi-beam horn (MBH) antenna for mmWave
    frequency band under the stratospheric conditions. To be specific, as for array
    antenna design, the authors proposed an electronically controlled mmWave DBF antenna
    for HAPS. In particular, this kind of array antenna was mounted on the helicopter,
    and was operating under the stratospheric conditions where the temperature was
    below −60 °C and the atmospheric pressure is 1/20 of that on the earth. Based
    on this setting, the performance of the devised mmWave DBF antenna under the stratospheric
    conditions was tested to examine the optimal forming of antenna beams for mmWave
    SDMA. More precisely, the contents of the experiments included beam-tracking performance,
    beam compensation, measurement of antenna beam patterns, and transmission of data
    packets. According to the experimental results, despite the harsh conditions of
    low temperature and low pressure, mmWave DBF antenna system can still work properly.
    Bandwidth enhancement and miniaturization for microstrip antenna are one of the
    major challenges towards the design of conventional compact antenna. Especially,
    for the application scenario with mmWave communications, tiny component size of
    mmWave circuits and increased bandwidth result in lower antenna gain, which can
    be improved by building large antenna arrays. Under this background, the dual-band
    mmWave printed microstrip antenna patch was designed by Siddiq et al. [130] for
    UAV applications. The devised antenna array with coaxial feed resonated at 29
    ~ 30 GHz and 57 ~ 66 GHz mmWave bands. Beyond this, the shape of the structure
    of UAV’s wing was based on the size of 1250mm×350mm×50mm by using the star shaped
    printed microstrip antenna. Specifically, the authors put forward two kinds of
    star shaped antenna arrays, i.e., 1×2 array and 1×4 array. Fig. 9 illustrates
    the top view of the 1×4 star shaped antenna array with core parameters. It should
    be admitted that antenna gain can increase for both antenna arrays with the growth
    of frequency, and 1×4 array can achieve more gain than that of 1×2 array. FIGURE
    9. Illustration of the top view of the devised 1×4 star shaped antenna array.
    Show All In addition to the advantage that the positions and altitudes are dynamically
    adjusted to match the requirement of ground users, UAV-based flying BSs can be
    also deployed with the characteristic of directional mobility and quasi-stationary
    hovering. How to improve the directivity of flying BS and facilitate better beam-steering
    resolution and lower cross-beam interference is an important issue we need to
    resolve. Fortunately, phased array antenna is a good choice to tackle this problem.
    Huo and Dong [131] proposed a uniform rectangular based phased array beamforming
    model for flying BSs with mmWave communications. The proposed phased array antenna
    employed a dimension of 2×8 antenna elements to realize the 3D beamforming. In
    order to provide a broad coverage towards ground users, the elevation radiating
    direction of main lobe (i.e., main beam) was required to host sufficient wide
    beamwidth, and the azimuth radiation pattern of main lobe should require narrow
    beamwidth. Through the field trial tests, it is observed that the measurement
    results for both single user and multiple users can obtain multiple Gigabit data
    transmissions over flying BSs with mmWave communications. b: Beam Antenna In the
    context of UAV-enabled HAPS system and SPF system with mmWave communications,
    Tsuji et al. [129] also developed an mmWave MBH antenna that can achieve high-speed
    transmission at 47 GHz and 48 GHz. To be specific, the antenna direction of mmWave
    MBH antenna was devised to own three control modes: i) fixed mode: MBH antenna
    cannot adjust the direction; ii) inclination adjustment mode: the direction of
    beam was adjusted as the helicopter changes its inclination; iii) inclination/position
    adjustment mode: the footprint can be controlled in the same spot. Furthermore,
    mmWave MBH antenna was demonstrated to possess several advantages in controlling
    the antenna beams, such as broad bandwidth, low development cost and low power
    consumption. Similar to the experiments for mmWave DBF antenna in [129], MBH antenna
    was also installed on the helicopter to test its performance over the HAPS system.
    The measurement mission included beam tracking, beam pattern, and quality of communication
    signals. Finally, experiment results showed that the system can work properly
    and further demonstrated that highly directional beams can solve the disadvantage
    of UAV-assisted wireless networks, which becomes a major component of mmWave UAV
    communications for 5G and beyond. The main features of the devised antennas in
    [129] are summarized in Table 4. TABLE 4 The Comparison of Main Features Between
    the DBF Antenna and the MBH Antenna With the help of 3D beamforming and tracking
    antennas, the advantage of using highly directional mmWave antennas at TX and
    RX sides is that a continuously maintained antenna gain can be obtained, although
    there exist higher free space path loss and severe atmospheric attenuation caused
    by higher mmWave frequencies. Motivated by that, Heimann et al. [132] performed
    an experimental verification by implementing the mmWave link at 28.5 GHz with
    the bandwidth of 800 MHz between a fixed ground station equipped with an active
    antenna (i.e., pencil beam antenna) and a lightweight UAV equipped with a passive
    antenna (i.e., lightweight horn antenna). As shown in Fig. 10, a mmWave TX-RX
    scheme was designed by sending from the UAV based platform to the static infrastructure
    side including ground station and mmWave RX. From Fig. 10, the optical reference
    system was used to obtain the accurate position and orientation information of
    UAV for tracking performance evaluation. Based on this setup, the author carried
    out three tests: i) pencil beam alignment in static UAV environment, ii) precise
    tracking of UAV in dynamic environment, and iii) effect of the tracking precision.
    Based on the insightful discussions and tests, the authors analyzed the performance
    of beam tracking in UAV communications at mmWave band according to signal strength,
    quality and throughput for different antenna tapers, tracking algorithms and mobility
    patterns. FIGURE 10. The experiment configuration for verifying the mmWave link
    at 28.5 GHz with the bandwidth of 800 MHz. Here, the mmWave TX and RX connect
    the UAV and the ground station, respectively. Show All 2) Beam Tracking Beamforming,
    also known as spatial filtering, is a signal processing technique that has been
    already used in Wi-Fi routers with multiple antennas, to dramatically improve
    Wi-Fi performance, smoothing the path to the next generation IEEE 802.11ac standard
    and beyond. In practice, beamforming technology concentrates the signal energy
    over a narrow beam by means of highly directional signal transmission or reception
    to improve the spectral efficiency. By applying the beamforming technology into
    mmWave communications, it is efficient to compensate for higher free space path
    loss and stronger atmospheric attenuation at mmWave frequencies [136]. Evidently,
    signal interference will be severe when many people gather in small space to access
    wireless networks. Fortunately, beamforming technology achieves the equivalent
    “bunching” wireless signal into a rope, which can effectively reduce the cumulative
    signal interference to obtain better signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
    at RX. However, due to the fast-moving objects (e.g., vehicles, drones, and trains)
    under the context of 5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks,
    significant challenge of beamforming application is how to achieve fast and accurate
    tracking of dynamic mmWave beam directions with low computational complexity and
    overhead. To deal with this problem, Li et al. [133], [134] developed a recursive
    analog beam tracking algorithm for tracking dynamic beams in mmWave communications
    using analog beamforming. The beam tracking error minimization problem was formulated
    as a constrained sequential control and estimation problem by jointly optimizing
    both the analog beamforming vectors and the beam direction estimators. To resolve
    this problem, the authors relaxed the dynamic scenario into a static beam tracking
    scenario. In this scenario, the devised recursive mmWave beam tracking algorithm
    was focused on two stages: i) coarse beam sweeping, and ii) recursive beam tracking.
    Moreover, the lower bound of the variance of beam direction estimator using the
    mean square error (MSE) converges quickly to the minimum Cramér-Rao lower bound
    by optimizing among all the analog beamforming vectors. However, in the dynamic
    scenario, beam direction maybe changes over time. In order to keep track of the
    changing mmWave beam direction, the step-size parameter α n within the n -th time
    slot was proved to be subject to: α n = λ M − − √ (M−1)πd , (3) View Source where
    λ is the mmWave wavelength, M is the number of antennas at the linear antenna
    array receiver, and d is the distance between neighboring antennas. Compared with
    three reference algorithms (i.e., IEEE 802.11ad, least square, and compressed
    sensing) through simulations, the proposed algorithm simultaneously can achieve
    faster tracking speed, higher tracking accuracy, low complexity, and low pilot
    overhead. Due to high mobility of UAVs, the time to complete the beamforming training
    is more stringent. In the meantime, the overall mmWave beam search time is excessively
    costly for the exhaustive search algorithm because of a large number of candidate
    beam directions. To reduce the beamforming training time and mmWave beam search
    overhead, Xiao et al. [10] proposed to adopt a hierarchical beam search scheme
    based on the tree-structured beamforming codebook which covers the whole search
    space in angle domain. As shown in Fig. 11, there are k layers in the typical
    tree-structured codebook, and there are also M k codewords with equal beamwidth
    and different steering angle in the k -th layer, where M is a positive integer
    which denotes the degree of tree-structured codebook, for M≥2 . It suffices to
    mention that the mmWave beam search overhead of hierarchical beam search scheme
    is greatly lower than the exhaustive search scheme. On the basis of this advantage,
    the authors further designed the hierarchical coarse codebook based on a binary
    tree like structure wherein there are log 2 N+1 layers and the k -th layer contains
    2 k−1 best beams or known as antenna weight vectors (AWVs), for k=1,2,⋯, log 2
    N [137]. We wish to remark that the AWVs of the last layer in the coarse codebook
    can hold the narrowest mmWave beam under the given number of antennas N . It is
    also revealed that the beam coverage of the AWVs of the last layer can be characterized
    as the sum of the AWVs of the next layer. FIGURE 11. The hierarchical beam codebook
    for beamforming training under a tree structure, where w(k,n) stands for the n
    -th codeword in the k -th layer, for n=1,2,⋯, 2 k and k=0,1,2,⋯ . Show All In
    order to improve the efficiency of mmWave beam tracking and training, Xiao et
    al. [10] further pointed out two important strategies: i) priori information with
    respect to the distribution range of beamforming angles, and ii) hierarchical
    tree structure of the beamforming codebooks. According to the potential position
    relations between UAVs and ground UEs, the distribution range of beamforming angles
    can be actually predicted as a priori knowledge. Moreover, the candidate beam
    directions can be also obtained in advance through mmWave beam training process.
    Apparently, these strategies can also significantly reduce the overhead for mmWave
    beam tracking and training. Owing to flexible configuration and mobility nature,
    UAVs can be not only deployed as aerial BSs, but also serve as aerial relays to
    form the flyMesh aiming at achieving a fully connected UAV networks. However,
    as for the flyMesh with mmWave communications, frequent movement of UAVs at different
    altitudes causes the mmWave beam misalignment between UAVs or between UAV group
    leader and relay BS. Even worse, one of the UAVs will not work properly, and the
    nearby UAVs have to detect another one to establish the mmWave links. To address
    this challenge, Zhou et al. [32] proposed a fast mmWave beam tracking mechanism
    by employing the beam tracking policy of IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay standards,
    in order to find the suboptimal solution of the beam alignment maximization problem
    in mmWave flyMesh. This adopted mechanism can infer the directions of the relative
    movement relations between UAVs or between UAV group leader and relay BS according
    to the variations of SINR values obtained by beam tracking. To be specific, it
    is noticeable that the mmWave link for beam pair was not good enough if the SINR-based
    link quality was below a given threshold. Then the beam tracking initiator thus
    triggered the transmit beam tracking in order to select the best beam as the new
    transmit beam for subsequent data transmission. Through the analytical derivation,
    the overhead of the proposed fast beam tracking mechanism was further formulated
    as a function of the beam offset angle and the beamwidth. Simulation results indicated
    that the performance in terms of tracking overhead of the proposed fast beam tracking
    approach was superior to that of the method by using the IEEE 802.11ay standard.
    3) Beam Optimization In practice, intra-group interference involving data transmission
    from other UAVs and mmWave signal reflections and scattering has a bearing on
    the system performance of mmWave UAV group communications. As a consequence, it
    is of paramount importance to investigate the performance of beam anti-interference
    through a kind of beam optimization. In this context, Zhong et al. [135] elaborated
    the beam interference through the beam optimization based on window function and
    codebook design for the antenna with uniform linear arrays (ULA), and also established
    the interference model of mmWave UAV group communications. Fig. 12 shows the specific
    structure of the adopted ULA antenna under this scenario. On the basis of this
    structure of the ULA antenna, the mmWave beam response towards the incoming wavefront
    signal with the angle of arrival (AoA) denoted by θ was calculated as follows:
    p(θ)=w(θ)α(θ)= ∑ m=0 M−1 w m e j 2π λ md sin θ , (4) View Source where w(θ) is
    the mmWave beam weight vector, α(θ) is the array response for the AoA, M is the
    number of the antenna array elements, w m is the beam weight of the m -th antenna
    array element, and λ is the mmWave wavelength. FIGURE 12. Illustration of antenna
    structure with uniform linear arrays wherein θ is the AoA of the incoming wavefront
    signal, d is the distance between two adjacent array elements, and X m is the
    m -th antenna array element for m=0,1,2,⋯,M−1 . Show All As for the beam optimization
    based on window function, the target is to suppress the side lobes by designing
    the mmWave beam weight vector w(θ) of weighting functions. Through the window
    function optimization, the sidelobes of the incoming wavefront signal can be effectively
    inhibited and the main lobe gain can be also been greatly improved. As for the
    beam optimization based on codebook design, Zhong et al. [135] further presented
    an improved N -phased codebook design scheme to optimize the weight vector w(θ)
    . Lastly, simulation results suggested that the phase adjustment of the beam can
    be realized by using this codebook design and the sidelobe interference by using
    N -phased codebook was greatly smaller than that of IEEE 802.15.3c codebook. 4)
    Summary and Lessons Learned Due to the important role of antenna in 5G mmWave
    communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks, we have reviewed the recent
    efforts and solutions about the antenna-related research from three perspectives,
    i.e., antenna design, beam tracking, and beam optimization. With relation to antenna
    design, array antenna and beam antenna have been discussed, respectively. Based
    on the classification of antenna design, key parameters and main features for
    DBF antenna and MBH antenna have been compared and summarized in Table 4. By considering
    the narrow directional beams of mmWave signals, we have then surveyed the existing
    beam-related issues in terms of beam tracking and beam optimization. The important
    lessons learned from the review of the antenna-related research issues are summarized
    as follows: The design of array antenna typically benefits from the feature of
    tiny physical dimensions, and the development of beam antenna actually relies
    on the attribute of highly directional mmWave beams. We can obtain higher antenna
    gain by increasing the number of antenna elements, utilizing the 3D beamforming,
    and taking advantage of the highly directionality of mmWave beams. The fast and
    accurate tracking of dynamic mmWave beam directions is very important for successful
    transmission and reception of data packets. Generally, beam tracking mechanism
    and algorithm with low computational complexity and overhead are required to maintain
    the beam alignment and improve the system performance. To deal with the interference
    problem of adjacent mmWave beams, we can employ the window function and codebook
    design to optimize the beams for mmWave UAV group communications. B. Radio Propagation
    Channel The radio propagation channels in mmWave frequencies are significantly
    different from the channels in lower microwave frequencies due to shorter mmWave
    wavelengths. Besides, atmospheric absorption at the mmWave wavelengths is very
    serious, which further leads to higher propagation attenuation and reduced transmission
    range. Also, the propagation channels of mmWave signals are susceptible to the
    blockage problem that affects the design of LOS propagation links. Correspondingly,
    modeling the radio propagation channel and capturing the propagation characterization
    of mmWave signals for UAV-assisted wireless networks with 5G mmWave communications
    are of paramount importance to design and optimization of UAV-enabled A2G and
    A2A mmWave communications. Moreover, mmWave channel sparsity in angular domain
    necessitates the efficient and accurate channel estimation and tracking technique,
    aiming to obtain better and stable system performance. Another significant technical
    challenge is how to detect the blockage of mmWave propagation channel. In the
    light of the above issues and challenges as already stated, we will summarize
    these related studies in the subsection in terms of channel modeling [10], [37],
    [57], [58], [64], [65], [122], [123], [134], [138]–[145], channel estimation and
    tracking [58], [141], [146], [147], and blockage detection and countermeasure
    [59], [142]. 1) Channel Modeling To fully capture perfect knowledge and understanding
    of actual propagation behavior and characteristics of mmWave signals, several
    state-of-the-art efforts have been made to solve major problems targeted at mmWave
    channel measurement and modeling techniques under the environment of UAV-assisted
    wireless networks. Based on those efforts, we will provide a detailed description
    and discussion about recent advances in mmWave channel modeling solutions for
    UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications from three categories,
    namely, propagation measurement, empirical channel modeling, and analytical channel
    modeling, as depicted in Fig. 13. FIGURE 13. The classification of channel modeling
    solutions for UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. Show
    All a: Propagation Measurement Realistic propagation behavior and characteristics
    at mmWave frequencies can be better captured by carrying out real-world measurement
    campaigns in frequency domain or time domain over the target environments. The
    commonly used channel measurement tools include channel sounder and vector network
    analyzer [148]. As for the environment of UAV-assisted wireless networks with
    mmWave communications, propagation measurements generally focus more on communication
    types, operational frequency bands, flight dynamics of UAV, propagation physical
    scenarios, antenna configuration, TX/RX placement, channel sounding process, etc.
    To understand and analyze the characterization of A2G mmWave channels for UAV
    communications, Khawaja et al. [57] utilized the Remcom Wireless InSite ray tracing
    software to conduct the ray tracing simulations in frequency domain for capturing
    the behavior of A2G mmWave bands at 28 GHz and 60 GHz frequencies. In the A2G
    ray tracing simulations, four different scenarios were adopted, i.e., urban, suburban,
    rural, and over sea. Besides, three key factors about the scatterers (i.e., number,
    material, and height) were also incorporated into the involved scenarios of the
    simulations. Under this setting, the authors analyzed two performance metrics,
    namely, the received signal strength (RSS) and the root mean square delay spread
    of multipath components, for mmWave frequencies of 28 GHz and 60 GHz, respectively.
    It is observed that the fluctuation rate of the RSS versus the distance between
    UAV and ground station at 60 GHz was higher than that of 28 GHz. Furthermore,
    the behavior of root mean square delay spread of multipath components highly depended
    on the height of UAV along with the density/height of the scatterers around UAV.
    On the basis of the A2G ray tracing simulations, Khawaja et al. [57] presented
    a preliminary framework of A2G channel sounding for mmWave UAV channels. To be
    even more concrete, a lightweight and compact A2G mmWave channel sounder was built
    up based on the high-performance software defined radio platform of the universal
    serial radio peripheral (USRP) X310 and the 60 GHz TX/RX development system PEM009-KIT
    from the product of Pasternack. The objective for the channel sounder development
    was to more accurately characterize the A2G mmWave propagation features via the
    propagation measurements at 60 GHz frequency. As the continuation of the work
    about the characterization of A2G mmWave channels for UAV communications, Khawaja
    et al. [138] also performed the ray tracing simulations by taking advantage of
    the Remcom Wireless InSite ray tracing software to study the small-scale temporal
    and spatial characteristics of A2G mmWave LOS channels at 28 GHz frequency. For
    the simulations, four different scenarios including dense-urban, suburban, rural,
    and over sea, were further created and classified in terms of the number, distribution
    and dimensions of the buildings. Especially, the vertically polarized half-wave
    dipole antennas were mounted at both TX and RX with the omnidirectional pattern
    in azimuth direction. In the context of simulation setup, the ray tracing results
    for the UAV trajectories were characterized over sea and dense-urban scenarios.
    Moreover, the power variation of multipath components was observed to be dependent
    on the scatterer properties and the RX sensitivity. Meanwhile, the small-scale
    temporal and spatial characteristics of A2G propagation channels were validated
    to be subject to the constraint of the scatterer properties. To study the impact
    of human-body blockage on mmWave links of flying BSs with mmWave communications
    as depicted in Fig. 14, Gapeyenko et al. [64] used the distance-based path loss
    model to characterize the A2G mmWave LOS and NLOS links. Conceptually, this kind
    of path loss model can be deemed to satisfy a standard linear model with respect
    to the Euclidean distance between flying BS and RX side. In order to determine
    key parameters of this estimated model (i.e., the least square fits of floating
    intercept and slope over the given distance), Akdeniz et al. [139] carried out
    the real-world measurements of mmWave outdoor cellular propagation at 28 GHz and
    73 GHz frequencies in New York City, NY. Particularly, extensive measurements
    were performed by employing the highly directional horn antennas at both TX and
    RX sides under microcellular type deployments, aiming to obtain both the bulk
    path loss and the spatial structure of mmWave channels. What’s more, the power
    measurements were performed at various angular offsets from the strongest angular
    locations. Through the measurements, the authors in [139] provided a scatter plot
    of the approximate omnidirectional path losses which can be easily observed as
    a function of the distance between TX and RX. Table 5 gives the list of key parameter
    values in the estimated path loss models through the realistic measurements in
    [139]. From the results of measurements, it should be also admitted that the theoretical
    free space path loss based on the Friis transmission equation can exhibit a good
    fit for the measurement data of mmWave LOS links. TABLE 5 List of Key Parameter
    Values in the Estimated Path Loss Models Obtained From the Realistic Measurements
    FIGURE 14. Illustration of human-body blockage on mmWave links of a flying BS
    with mmWave communications. Here, the flying BS is currently located at a 3D position
    point ( x D , y D , h D ) , and user 1 and user 2 are blocked by two human-body
    blockers. The user is located at the height of h R , and the blocker is located
    at the height of h B and the diameter of g B . Show All b: Empirical Channel Modeling
    Actual radio propagation behavior of the channel in realistic environments is
    generally too complex to model accurately. Nevertheless, empirical channel models
    can be developed based on a large amount of statistical data collected from the
    in-situ channel observations and measurement campaigns. In what follows, we will
    give a review of empirical channel modeling for UAV-assisted wireless networks
    with 5G mmWave communications from the perspective of fading types for mmWave
    propagation channel. Small-scale fading is characteristic of radio propagation
    resulting from the presence reflectors and scatterers that give rise to multiple
    components of transmitted signal while traveling [149]. At RX, the combination
    of these different components through multipath propagation may cause rapid amplitude
    fluctuations of the received signal over a small travel distance or time interval.
    To characterize the small-scale fading, statistical models have been used to describe
    the empirical fading distribution of amplitude of the received signal along the
    radio propagation channel, e.g., Nakagami- m model, Rayleigh model, Rician model,
    Weibull model, etc [150]. The probability density function (PDF) is generally
    employed to give the quantitative analysis about this kind of fading distribution.
    Under the scenario of UAV-based flying BSs with mmWave communications, Zhu et
    al. [123] modeled the amplitude of the received A2G mmWave signal as Nakagami-
    m fading distribution for both the LOS and NLOS propagation conditions at mmWave
    frequency bands. Based on this A2G channel modeling, their target was to explore
    the secrecy rate performance at physical layer for UAV-enabled wireless networks
    using mmWave communications. The Nakagami fading parameter m is a shape factor
    of Nakagami distribution, which can be specifically expressed by m= (E[ R 2 ])
    2 Var[ R 2 ] , where R≥0 is the amplitude of received signal. Especially, parameter
    m can be empirically estimated, for m≥1/2 . In [123], the authors used m L and
    m N to describe Nakagami- m fading model for mmWave LOS link and mmWave NLOS link,
    respectively. Rayleigh fading is regarded as a reasonable statistical model to
    describe the distribution of the envelope amplitude of received signal, which
    is made up of the multipath reflected and scattered waves as well as the significant
    LOS component. Under the scenario of next generation drone-assisted HetNets with
    mmWave communications, Meng et al. [140] characterized the radio propagation channel
    for information exchange between the BSs and the lead drone as Rayleigh fading
    model at mmWave frequency bands. As a special case, Nakagami- m fading model includes
    Rayleigh fading model when we set m=1 . Thus, we can use a PDF f(R;Ω) to quantify
    Rayleigh fading model, where Ω=E[ R 2 ] is the average fading power. On the basis
    of this fading model, the authors focused on the problem of drone swarm formation
    control for enhancing the formation strength of drones during flight control.
    In comparison with small-scale fading, large-scale fading or shadowing is usually
    used to describe the average signal-power attenuation and path loss of the received
    signal strength at RX after traveling over a large travel distance [151]. Large-scale
    signal-power attenuation caused by shadowing of obstacles has been shown to follow
    a log-normal distribution. We generally employ the path loss model PL(d) in dB
    to analyze this kind of fading distribution, where d is the distance between TX
    and RX. Under the context of the proactive deployment of cache-enabled UAVs in
    cloud radio access network (CRAN), Chen et al. [37] formulated the mmWave propagation
    channel between UAVs serving as the RRHs and ground mobile users as the standard
    log-normal shadowing model using path loss metric. By choosing the specific channel
    parameters, the standard log-normal shadowing model was exploited to characterize
    the mmWave LOS and NLOS links under the constraint of the given 3D position w
    k =( x k , y k , h k ) of the k -th UAV ( h k is the altitude of the k -th UAV)
    and 2D position w i =( x i , y i ) of the i -th ground user. More precisely, the
    channel parameters include the path loss exponents n LOS and n NLOS for LOS link
    and NLOS link, respectively, and the shadowing random variables χ σ LOS and χ
    σ NLOS for LOS link and NLOS link, respectively. With the 800 MHz broadband sliding
    correlator channel sounder, measurement campaigns for outdoor cellular channels
    at 38 GHz were conducted to obtain the measured data, aiming to quantify these
    channel parameters [152]. In Table 6, we provide the comparison among three adopted
    empirical channel models for UAV-assisted wireless networks with 5G mmWave communications.
    As shown in Table 6, the quantitative description about each empirical channel
    model is given in detail in terms of PDF or path loss. TABLE 6 The Comparison
    of Empirical Channel Models for UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks With mmWave Communications
    c: Analytical Channel Modeling In contrast to empirical channel models, analytical
    channel modeling is used to characterize the radio propagation behavior of the
    channel through the way of conceptually and mathematically convenient simplifications.
    This kind of model is very popular for predicting the dedicated propagation phenomena
    by devising simplified models based on the analytical results. In the meantime,
    the effect of radio propagation channel on the performance of communication system
    can be also analyzed by leveraging the analytical models under the given channel
    parameters. In the light of UAV-based MIMO system with mmWave communications,
    Zhao et al. [58] formulated the A2G channel between flying BS and ground UE as
    a 3D geometry-based model. In the considered system, UAV-based flying BS was equipped
    with M×N uniform rectangular arrays (URA), and the variation of mmWave propagation
    channel mainly generated from UAV movements. Under this setting, apart from the
    state parameters of UAV movements in 3D space, the adopted channel model was designed
    based on the steering vector of URA antenna and channel parameters, e.g., small-scale
    fading/large-scale fading coefficients, Doppler frequency, etc. It should be noted
    that the state parameters of UAV movements can be obtained through the sensor
    fusion of the flight control system of UAV, and the channel parameters can be
    estimated by means of the pilot transmission. Under the condition of multi-user
    MIMO system wherein multiple UAVs serving as aerial users communicate with UAV-based
    aerial BS via the A2A mmWave communication links, Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [141]
    characterized the A2A channel between aerial BS and aerial user by a D -delay
    model. Each aerial user was equipped with a hybrid MIMO architecture, and also
    employed a hybrid analog precoder to transfer the data streams denoted by a vector
    to aerial BS within each channel slot. In addition, aerial BS and aerial users
    were equipped with the uniform planar arrays (UPA). Particularly, the authors
    used the d -th delay tap channel matrix for each aerial user under the given channel
    slot to describe the D -delay channel model. Some representative parameters for
    mmWave channel and antenna array were incorporated into the adopted channel model,
    e.g., the array response vector of the UPA, the azimuth angle of departure (AoD)/AoA,
    the elevation AoD/AoA, etc. By jointly considering the LOS and NLOS components
    of the propagation in mmWave hybrid UAV communications with blockage problem,
    Zhao and Jia [142] utilized the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model to describe the
    propagation channel between flying BS and ground user. Each UAV was equipped by
    N ULA antennas with uniform spacing d . Due to the hybrid precoding scheme, the
    number of radio frequency (RF) chains for each UAV (denoted by N RF ) should be
    much smaller than the number of antennas with ULA, i.e., N RF ≪N . The proposed
    channel model underlined not only the multipath channel vector for the scenario
    of multiple ground users (i.e., the NLOS component), but also the LOS component
    of each ground user with the given complex gain. Additionally, both the LOS and
    NLOS components of the propagation depended on the ULA’s steering-response vectors
    that were related with the physical direction of arrival (DoA) of each path between
    flying BS and ground user. It is implicitly understood that the NLOS component
    strongly characterized the radio propagation behavior in mmWave communications.
    Under the downlink mmWave-NOMA transmission scenario where one UAV-based flying
    BS equipped with an M element of ULA array serving multiple ground users with
    single antenna, Rupasinghe et al. [122], [143]–[145] used the simplified channel
    vector to model the LOS propagation channel between UAV and ground users. Different
    from the Saleh-Valenzuela channel model, the authors just incorporated the LOS
    component into the simplified channel model because they believed that the effect
    of LOS path is dominant compared to the NLOS path due to relatively high hovering
    altitudes of UAV. In addition, Xiao et al. [10] analyzed the propagation characteristics
    of mmWave channels in UAV-assisted cellular systems with mmWave communications,
    and discussed some challenges for mmWave channel modeling, e.g., multipath components
    caused by first- and second-order reflections and sparse AoDs and AoAs in angle
    domain. Based on these observations and challenges, the authors proposed to employ
    two channel models for mmWave UAV cellular, i.e., the wideband time-varying continuous
    channel model and the narrowband discrete channel model. Beyond that, Li et al.
    [134] and Gapeyenko et al. [65] exploited the multipath channel model to characterize
    the propagation channel for UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications.
    Similar to [10], [141], [142], the multipath model in [65], [134] was formulated
    bearing in mind the assumption that there are multiple alternative paths (i.e.,
    multipath components) between TX and RX. It is noted that each path was featured
    by some metrics such as delay, path loss, AoA, AoD, etc. Tables 7 summarizes the
    above mentioned analytical channel models and compares the quantitative descriptions
    for each models in terms of channel vector or channel matrix. TABLE 7 The Comparison
    of Analytical Channel Models for UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks With mmWave Communications
    2) Channel Estimation and Tracking The technical challenges including high propagation
    attenuation, atmospheric absorption, limited shadowing and diffraction of mmWave
    communications can lead to the issue of mmWave channel sparsity in angular domain.
    That is, only a limited number of mmWave channels can be used as feasible and
    effective propagation paths between TX and RX. By taking advantage of the channel
    sparsity of mmWave communications, Talvitie et al. [146] proposed a method to
    accurately estimate the channel parameters, such as AoD, AoA and time of arrival
    (ToA) of UE, in mmWave MIMO system by employing a distributed compressed sensing
    method known as the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm. Note that
    the considered MIMO system contained a terrestrial BS with known position and
    antenna orientation, and a UE with unknown position and antenna orientation. An
    iterative refinement algorithm was presented to improve the estimation accuracy
    with the reasonable complexity in comparison with the large dictionary based approach.
    Most important of all, this proposed method can be extended to the tracking scenario
    of UAV networks by replacing UE with UAV. Under the scenario of multi-user A2A
    mmWave MIMO system with the hybrid architecture, Rodríguez-Fernández et al. [141]
    devised a channel estimation and tracking algorithm by using the priori information
    of the trajectory of each UAV (i.e., aerial user) in order to reduce both overhead
    and computational complexity. In this case, during a training stage, UAV-based
    aerial BS was required to estimate the multi-user mmWave MIMO channel matrices
    by taking the priori trajectory information of aerial users into consideration.
    To estimate these channel matrices, the maximum likelihood (ML) estimator assisted
    with prior information was utilized, and the optimal ML estimator of the frequency-selective
    mmWave MIMO channel was further derived for multi-user scenario. Moreover, the
    upper and lower bounds of the azimuth and elevation AoA and AoD for different
    uplink channels were obtained. Simulation results showed that the proposed channel
    estimation and tracking algorithm can achieve lower estimation errors under low
    overhead and low SINR regime. Due to the essential attribute of high mobility
    of UAVs in UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications, one fundamental
    challenging task is how to accurately track a large number of dynamic propagation
    paths while incurring lower pilot overhead. In the meantime, the overhead of channel
    estimation can be also reduced with the help of an effective channel tracking
    technique, i.e., tracking the temporal variations of channel parameters [153],
    [154]. Motivated by this observation, Zhao et al. [58] designed an efficient channel
    tracking method for flight control system in UAV-based MIMO system with mmWave
    communications. The problem of UAV channel tracking was transformed into the track
    of state information of UAV movements, and the estimate of unrelated parameters
    of UAV movements. Besides, sensor fusion was adopted to obtain the UAV movement
    information. Due to the fact that the UAV channel tracking was a typical nonlinear
    procedure, unscented Kalman filter as a widely recognized nonlinear filter was
    used for nonlinear estimation. Compared with the traditional channel tracking
    method, the proposed method required a much lower training overhead. By investigating
    the mmWave UAV communications with beam squint effect, Zhao and Jia [147] proposed
    an efficient channel tracking strategy under the comb-type orthogonal frequency
    division multiplexing (OFDM) structure (i.e., pilot-data-multiplexed OFDM structure).
    In this context, the channel tracking problem was transformed into the parameter
    estimate of the channel vector such as DOA, Doppler shift, and uplink/downlink
    channel complex gain. Simulation results demonstrated that the complexity of the
    downlink channel tracking was obviously reduced by making efficient use of both
    the angle reciprocity and the Doppler reciprocity. 3) Blockage Detection and Countermeasure
    One of the major technical challenges for UAV-assisted wireless networks with
    mmWave communications is blockage effect over the propagation channel, namely,
    travelling mmWave signal is blocked by physical obstacles in their propagation
    paths. Different from the other blockage patterns that most of work discussed,
    Bao et al. [59] placed more emphasis on self-blockage problem of mmWave signals
    incurred by the components of UAV itself, i.e., the rotating propeller of UAV,
    as illustrated in Fig. 15. In order to confirm that there indeed exists this kind
    of self-blockage, the authors conducted the experiments to identify the blockage
    effect of UAV propeller based on hardware testbed. This kind of testbed consisted
    of the mmWave TX/RX modules with horn antennas at 60 GHz frequency and the fine-tuned
    propulsion system. In particular, the blockage loss measurement and the blockage
    pattern identification were carried out. Experimental results verified that self-blockage
    effect of UAV propeller was obvious, which can severely deteriorate the system
    performance. FIGURE 15. Illustration of self-blockage of mmWave signals incurred
    by the rotating propeller of UAV. Here, UAV-based aerial BS with the lightweight
    horn antenna can communicate with ground users and aerial users via A2G mmWave
    links and A2A mmWave links, respectively. Show All On the basis of the experiments
    for blockage effect, the authors in [59] further presented a sequential quickest
    change detection strategy to identify the blockage pattern characterized by three
    parameters, i.e., beginning time, time duration, and SINR drop. Specifically,
    the detection of blockage pattern was formulated as a multi-channel quickest detection
    for identifying the change of distribution in random process by utilizing multiple
    series of observations. Moreover, the Holm procedure was employed to determine
    whether a significant change of channel occurred. Simulation results showed that
    the proposed blockage detection approach can accurately identify the blockage
    with a modest blockage loss. To deal with the blockage problem in mmWave UAV communications
    with hybrid structure, Zhao and Jia [142] further provided the corresponding countermeasure
    proposal by devising an angle domain channel transmission scheme. In this scheme,
    the DoA of LOS path with the most power can be regarded as the optimal transmission
    direction. Meanwhile, the deployment of multiple UAVs was also presented by taking
    deployment diversity into account, aiming to reduce the probability of blockage.
    A user scheduling mechanism to maximize the achievable sum rates was also proposed
    based on the water-filling algorithm. 4) Summary and Lessons Learned We have surveyed
    the existing efforts on channel modeling, channel estimation and tracking, and
    blockage detection and countermeasure for UAV-assisted wireless networks with
    5G mmWave communications. In particular, channel measurement and modeling techniques
    have been reviewed and discussed from three aspects, i.e., propagation measurement,
    empirical channel modeling, and analytical channel modeling. The detailed comparisons
    of estimated path loss models based on realistic measurements, empirical channel
    models, and analytical channel models have been summarized in Table 5, Table 6,
    and Table 7, respectively. The important lessons learned from the review of research
    issues and solutions related to radio propagation channel are summarized as follows:
    Through the realistic measurement campaigns within indoor or outdoor environments,
    we can use channel sounder and vector network analyzer as effective tools to obtain
    the measurement results of propagation behavior and characteristics of mmWave
    signals along the bidirectional mmWave links. The distance based free space path
    loss model can be properly employed to characterize the mmWave LOS and NLOS channels
    by choosing the key parameters (e.g., α , β , and σ ) reasonably. For empirical
    channel models, we need to give more insights into the current fading types (i.e.,
    small-scale or large-scale fading) of A2G and G2A mmWave propagation channels
    when we apply them into our scenario. We should also pay attention to what kind
    of PDFs or path loss models can be utilized to describe fading distribution. For
    the application of analytical models, we ought to take the antenna and its associated
    parameters into account. Moreover, channel vector or channel matrix are required
    to be properly formulated to characterize the propagation behavior of mmWave channels
    between UAVs and ground UEs. To overcome the challenge of mmWave channel sparsity
    in angular domain, channel estimation and tracking approach should be well designed
    to achieve lower overhead and higher estimation accuracy. The commonly used methods
    that we learned include compressed sensing, priori information based policy, Kalman
    filter, etc. The blockage effect of mmWave propagation channel not only covers
    conventional blockage caused by physical obstacles, but also includes self-blockage
    due to UAV itself. The latter one is a novel scenario for further research on
    the blockage problem. C. Multiple Access Mechanism The UAVs acting as flying BSs
    can provide aerial access to ground UEs during temporary events, e.g., hotspot
    areas and large public venues, where a large number of UEs straining the available
    wireless resources. Consequently, much more spectrally efficient multiple access
    techniques are required for enabling multiple UEs to share the same available
    wireless resources, to support massive connectivity while maintaining the requirements
    of different quality of service (QoS). Recently, NOMA has been regarded as an
    effective multiple access solution for 5G to improve spectral efficiency and support
    many thousands of UEs [43], [155]–[157]. In addition, with the advanced multiple
    antenna technique, SDMA as the channel-based multiple access mechanism has also
    attracted increasing research interests, especially for inherently directional
    A2G mmWave beams under our considered scenario. In the following subsection, we
    will summarize the related research on NOMA [122], [143]–[145] and SDMA [10],
    [158] for UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. 1) Non-Orthogonal
    Multiple Access To increase the spectral efficiency and serve more ground users
    simultaneously, Rupasinghe et al. [122], [143], [144] proposed a downlink NOMA
    transmission mechanism at UAV-based flying BS operating in mmWave frequency bands.
    By maximizing the achievable mmWave-NOMA sum rates under the constraint of the
    given hovering altitude of UAV, a beam scanning strategy was introduced to identify
    the best physically radiated region of mmWave beam due to the partial coverage
    of user region by downlink beam. According to the constraint that the transmit
    power allocation of mmWave-NOMA TX to ground users was based on channel quality
    between ground user and flying BS, each ground user should send its feedback information
    about channel quality back to mmWave-NOMA TX. More precisely, the transmit power
    allocation towards each ground user via the NOMA transmission should be conducted
    in a way inversely proportional to its channel quality. By considering that full
    channel state information (CSI) would generate more link overheads, Rupasinghe
    et al. also [145] presented two limited feedback schemes in terms of user distance
    and user angle instead of full CSI feedback. The authors pointed out that both
    user distance and user angle were changing much slowly compared with full CSI.
    The summary of three feedback schemes to measure the channel quality used in [122],
    [143]–[145] is provided in Table 8. In addition, an analytical framework was developed
    to optimize the outage probability of each ground user and the outage sum rates
    based on the user distance feedback policy. The authors noted that mmWave-NOMA
    with distance feedback can exhibit better outage sum rates compared to conventional
    orthogonal multiple access (OMA). TABLE 8 Summary of the Channel Quality Feedback
    Schemes Used in the Proposed mmWave-NOMA Transmission Mechanism 2) Spatial-Division
    Multiple Access With the aid of the inherently directional A2G mmWave beams from
    flying BS, multiple ground users using different spatial beams can access the
    channel with the same set of frequencies concurrently. Based on this insight,
    Xiao et al. [10] explored the use of SDMA or known as beam division multiple access
    (BDMA) in UAV-assisted cellular systems with mmWave communications, as illustrated
    in Fig. 16. To reach this goal, ground users should be dynamically divided into
    several different parallel spatial user groups or clusters according to the entire
    range of AoDs of ground users, and each user group must be identified by a beamforming
    codeword pair. In particular, the beamforming codeword pair of the i -th ground
    user was characterized by { w i , f i } , where w i denotes the beam combining
    codeword for the i -th ground user at the side of BS, and f i refers to the beamforming
    codeword for the i -th ground user at the side of mobile station (MS) on the ground.
    It is worth noting that codewords w i and f i were both obtained from the predefined
    codebook. Compared to conventional UAV cellular operating at lower microwave frequencies,
    UAV-assisted cellular systems with mmWave-SDMA strategy demonstrated a superior
    performance in terms of the total achievable rate of uplink transmission and multi-user
    capacity. FIGURE 16. Illustration of the SDMA technique in UAV-assisted cellular
    systems with mmWave communications. Here, flying BS is equipped with a smart (or
    adaptive) antenna (e.g., multiple beam directional antenna), and each ground user
    is equipped with a single antenna. Each A2G mmWave beam from flying BS should
    correspond to only one user group, and the number of beams is equal to the number
    of transceivers of flying BS using the smart antenna system. Show All Considering
    that the ULA antenna would lead to huge physical size of the transceiver of UAV,
    Tan et al. [158] adopted the uniform circular arrays (UCAs) for phased array antennas
    to be deployed at flying BS in UAV-based MIMO systems under Ricean fading channel.
    With the only knowledge of the CSI at the transceiver of UAV, a statistical-eigenmode
    mmWave-SDMA approach was used in the downlink transmission for two ground users
    with single-antenna. Furthermore, a suboptimal beamforming precoder was exploited
    to maximize the SINR of each ground user. Based on this setting, the authors constructed
    a general theoretical framework to analyze the achievable rate of UAV-based MIMO
    systems. Based on the suboptimal beamforming precoder, a closed-form expression
    of achievable rate was rigorously derived, which was a function of the number
    of antennas, the radius of UCA configuration, and the azimuth and elevation AoDs.
    Moreover, it has been shown that the achievable sum-rate of the systems was quite
    close to a fixed saturation value when SINR was larger than 20 dB. 3) Summary
    and Lessons Learned We have provided a review on existing works about two kinds
    of multiple access techniques for mmWave downlink transmission, i.e., NOMA and
    SDMA, for UAV-assisted wireless networks with 5G mmWave communications. Three
    feedback schemes to measure the channel quality used in downlink NOMA transmission
    mechanisms have been summarized in Table 8. The important lessons learned from
    the review of related research on NOMA and SDMA are summarized as follows: The
    proposed NOMA and SDMA mechanisms all fall into the category of mmWave downlink
    transmission, wherein UAV-based flying BS serves as the TX side of multiple access.
    Due to the effect of channel quality on transmit power allocation, feedback information
    about channel quality should be sent back to flying BS in mmWave NOMA transmission.
    We need to turn our attention to the use of feedback information, because different
    feedback information determines different link overheads. The SDMA approach, also
    known as BDMA, is well suited to our considered scenario, owing to the spatial
    attribute for inherently directional A2G mmWave beams. The difficult is how to
    adaptively and effectively assign ground users into different parallel spatial
    clusters. D. Spatial Configuration Due to the capability to hover, sufficient
    flexibility, ease of deployment, higher maneuverability, rapid reconfiguration,
    etc, UAVs can be effectively deployed at any positions of interest in 3D space,
    to serve as the aerial relay/BS/access point. For the rotary wing UAVs, their
    real-time positions are relatively fixed and static over a given geographic area.
    However, the spatial positions will be in the dynamic time-varying states for
    the fixed-wing UAVs according to current instant time. For such insight about
    UAV spatial configuration, one important problem for the design of UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications is to determine and optimize the
    spatial positions and trajectories of UAVs, to comply with the requirement of
    system performance. Additionally, except for spatial deployment in regard to the
    optimization of positions and trajectories, another challenge is how to effectively
    control the multi-UAV deployment, e.g., UAV clustering and UAV swarm formation.
    In the following, as shown in Fig. 17, we will review the existing studies about
    spatial configuration of UAVs in terms of position and trajectory optimization
    [37], [64], [159]–[162] as well as UAV deployment control [17], [140], [163].
    FIGURE 17. The classification of spatial configuration solutions for UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications. Show All 1) Position and Trajectory
    Optimization For the position and trajectory optimization, the objective is to
    reconfigure UAV’s position and trajectory in order to fulfill the requirements
    of system performance and resource optimization. As described in Fig. 17, we will
    provide readers a review of related work about position optimization and trajectory
    optimization of UAVs in the context of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave
    communications. a: Position Optimization To find and determine the optimal position
    of UAV as an aerial relay accurately and quickly is an extremely challenging task
    in mmWave UAV relay systems. This is because UAV generally has no priori knowledge
    about its optimal position. In this context, Kong et al. [159] proposed an Autonomous
    Relay solution to tackle this problem. The main idea of the Autonomous Relay is
    to apply compressive sensing technique into online measurement and estimate of
    link quality of mmWave beam in 3D space. To describe the link quality, the authors
    constructed a 3D matrix Q∈ R n 1 × n 2 × n 3 , aiming to take advantage of compressive
    sensing for 3D Matrix, where n 1 , n 2 , and n 3 are the coordinate scales of
    the 3D space position point. Specifically, link quality was defined as the product
    of the receiving quality R o (i,j,k) at the 3D point with coordinate (i,j,k) from
    the mmWave TX o (origin point) and the receiving quality R c (i,j,k) at the 3D
    point (i,j,k) from the mmWave RX c , i.e., Q(i,j,k)= R o (i,j,k)× R c (i,j,k)
    . In order to find the optimal position point ( p ∗ x , p ∗ y , p ∗ z ) for UAV
    relay so that link quality Q( p ∗ x , p ∗ y , p ∗ z ) was maximized, link quality
    matrix update procedure was formulated as a matrix recovery problem by using MatrixUpdate
    method. Based on the work by Kong et al. [159], Thomas and Chandran [160] reviewed
    the Autonomous Relay approach specialized for quick and accurate determination
    of mobile relay’s position in mmWave communications. With the help of this approach,
    link qualities of mmWave beams can be sampled while UAV is moving. According to
    the real-time sampling results, UAV adjusted its trajectory to further reach its
    optimal position. It has been shown that the Autonomous Relay approach can obtain
    more accurate relay position and can also generate more stable results than existing
    classic methods including the K-nearest neighbor (KNN) and the tensor recovery
    (TR). By taking the use of the caching in UAVs and the user-centric information
    on the ground into account, Chen et al. [37] investigated the proactive deployment
    issue of cache-enabled UAVs to optimize the QoE of ground mobile users in the
    CRAN. In this work, UAVs acted as the flying cache-enabled RRHs and the A2G communication
    links between UAVs and ground users employed mmWave frequencies in the CRAN system.
    However, G2A communication links (i.e., wireless fronthaul links) between terrestrial
    baseband units (BBUs) and UAVs employed traditional licensed cellular bands at
    microwave frequencies. In particular, a realistic mobility model for users was
    leveraged by considering the periodic, daily, and pedestrian mobility patterns,
    and the QoE metric was defined as the concrete human-in-the-loop metric that captures
    data rate, delay, and device type of each user. Under this setup, their goal was
    to find an effective deployment (i.e., optimal positions) of cache-enabled UAVs
    to improve each user’s QoE while minimizing the transmit power of UAVs. Specifically,
    this optimization problem can be expressed by: C k , U τ,t,k,w,τ,t,k minimize
    ∑ τ=1 T ∑ k∈K ∑ i∈ U τ,k ∑ t=1 F ( 2 δ R i,n ∣ ∣ U τ,k ∣ ∣ B V −1) σ 2 10 l ¯
    t,ki 10 subject to  h min ≤ h τ,k ,k∈K i≠j,i,j∈ C k , C k ⊆N,k∈K 0<; P min τ,t,ki
    ≤ P max ,i∈U,k∈K, (5a) (5b) (5c) (5d) View Source where U is the set of ground
    users, N is the set of popular contents, K is the set of UAVs, C k is the set
    of C cached contents in the storage units of the k -th UAV, U τ,k is the set of
    ground users served by the k -th UAV at the τ -th time slot, w τ,t,k is the coordinate
    of the k -th UAV with altitude of the k -th UAV denoted by h τ,k at the τ -th
    time slot, h min is the minimum altitude of UAV, T is the number of time slots,
    F is the number of intervals in each time slot, δ R i,n is the minimum rate that
    is required to maximize the QoE of user, B V is the total bandwidth available
    for each UAV, σ 2 is the noise power spectral density, l ¯ t,ki is the average
    path loss from the k -th UAV to i -th user at the t -th interval, P min τ,t,ki
    is the minimum transmit power required to ensure the QoE requirement of the i
    -th user receiving the n -th content at the t -th interval within time slot τ
    , and P max is the maximum transmit power of UAV. To solve this problem, Chen
    et al. [37] proposed a prediction algorithm by taking advantage of machine learning
    framework of the conceptor-based echo state networks (ESNs), aiming to find the
    optimal positions of UAVs as well as the user-UAV association and the content
    caching at UAVs. In this case, the optimal positions of UAVs were the 3D points
    where UAVs were serving their associated ground users with minimum transmit power.
    The algorithm to find the optimal position of each UAV just had the runtime complexity
    O(|K|) in linear time. It is also observed via simulations that the proposed algorithm
    can achieve better performance gains in respect of the minimum transmit power
    of UAVs compared to the traditional ESN methods. Considering the impact of human-body
    blockage on the LOS links of flying BSs by using mmWave communications as shown
    in Fig. 14, Gapeyenko et al. [64] explored the optimized deployment problem of
    mmWave-based flying BS, which captures the optimal altitude, coordinate, and coverage
    radius of flying BS. An approximate A2G mmWave path loss model was exploited for
    quasi-stationary flying BS with rotary wing, which combines the LOS and non-line-of-sight
    (NLOS) transmission links at mmWave frequencies together. Thus, the 3D position
    point ( x D , y D , h D ) of mmWave-based flying BS was associated with the adopted
    path loss model, where ( x D , y D ) is the two-dimensional (2D) space position
    of flying BS over the horizontal plane coordinate and h D is the altitude of flying
    BS. To obtain the optimal 3D position point ( x ∗ D , y ∗ D , h ∗ ) of flying
    BS, the authors formulated a 3D placement problem of flying BS as follows: maximize
    x D , y D ,h,{ m i } ∑ i∈M m i subjectto  m i σ i ≥ m i Q,i∈M, ∑ i∈M m i ≤N,i∈M,
    x l ≤ x D ≤ x u , y l ≤ y D ≤ y u , h l ≤h≤ h u , m i ∈{0,1},i∈M, (6a) (6b) (6c)
    (6d) (6e) View Source where M is the set of ground users, m i is a binary variable
    indicating whether the i -th user is covered or not, h= h D − h R ( h R refers
    to the height of the users), σ i is the SINR of the i -th user, Q is the target
    SINR level, N is the maximum number of users that flying BS can concurrently serve,
    and the subscripts u and l stand for the upper and the lower limits of available
    positions in 3D space. Through the analytical derivations by solving the 3D placement
    problem, the authors demonstrated their theoretical results can provide a tight
    match with those obtained by using the interior-point optimization method through
    the MOSEK optimization software. Conventionally, highly capable sensor node with
    large transmit power is generally chosen as the relay in WSNs. In contrast to
    this static placement of relay, Fu et al. [161] used a single UAV operating at
    mmWave frequency in 3D space as the dynamic aerial relay between ground sink node
    (i.e., concentrator) and terrestrial BS (i.e., border gateway) over WSNs as shown
    in Fig. 18. The authors attempted to find the optimal position of UAV by minimizing
    the system power consumption. Under such circumstance, the authors defined the
    system power consumption denoted by P Total as the sum of the transmit power P
    S of sink node and the transmit power P U of the UAV, i.e., P Total = P S + P
    U . Thus, their objective was to minimize the total of system power consumption,
    which can be further formulated as: minimize σ 2 S | h S | 2 ( 2 C B S −1)+ σ
    2 U | h U | 2 ( 2 C B U −1), (7) View Source where σ 2 S and σ 2 U denote the
    noise power spectral density at UAV and terrestrial BS, respectively, | h S |
    2 and | h U | 2 refer to the wireless channel gain from sink node to UAV and from
    UAV to terrestrial BS, respectively, B S and B U stand for the wireless bandwidth
    of sink node and UAV, respectively, and C represents the traffic capacity for
    transmission. Based on this optimization problem, the algorithm to determine the
    optimal position of UAV was proposed, and the performance of UAV based relay in
    WSNs was also verified by comparing with traditional wireless transmission without
    relay. FIGURE 18. Illustration of dynamic aerial relay used for data collection
    in WSNs. Show All b: Trajectory Optimization As stated previously, the obstacles
    to the use of mmWave communications pose additional challenges on optimizing the
    operations of UAVs operating at mmWave frequencies for various communication tasks
    while minimizing energy consumption and service time. Faced to these challenges,
    Ghazzai et al. [162] devised a generic optimization framework to smartly assign
    UAVs as aerial relays to serve some pairs of transceivers. More precisely, each
    UAV can support the dual-band communication module operating at both mmWave and
    microwave bands to complete data transmission for pairs of transceivers. For each
    pair of transceiver, TX or RX may be located on the ground or in the air. Thus,
    three path loss models were adopted for microwave band in terms of A2G, A2A, and
    ground-to-ground (G2G) communication links, and two path loss models were also
    applied for mmWave band according to A2G and A2A links. To quantify the total
    energy consumption of each UAV, the authors characterized the hover and transition
    energy required for its movement, and the communication energy needed to perform
    the relaying of the transceiver’s data. Given this scenario, the authors formulated
    the service time S n,d that is required to serve the n -th pair of transceivers
    by the d -th UAV as follows: S n,d = ∑ m∈N∖{n} p m,n,d S m,d + ∑ m∈N∖{n} p m,n,d
    T f m,n,d + T c n,d ⎛ ⎝ ∑ m∈N∖{n} p m,n,d ⎞ ⎠ , (8) View Source where N is the
    set of the pairs of transceivers, p m,n,d is a binary variable indicating whether
    the d -th UAV is directly serving the n -th pair of transceivers after the m -th
    pair, and T f m,n,d is the flying time of the d -th UAV to move from the position
    where it serves the m -th pair of transceivers to the position where it serves
    the n -th pair. It should be noted that the first term of the right hand side
    of (8) is the service time of the previous m -th pair of transceivers served by
    the d -th UAV, and the second term of the right hand side of (8) is the time where
    the d -th UAV flies from the 3D position x m to the 3D position x n , and the
    last term of the right hand side of (8) is the communication time of the d -th
    UAV to complete the relaying of the transceiver’s data. For D UAVs denoted by
    a set D , the service time of the n -th pair of transceivers can be further calculated
    as S n = ∑ d∈D ( ∑ m∈N p m,n,d ) S n,d . The proposed framework by Ghazzai et
    al. [162] was aimed at optimizing the trajectories of UAVs such that a weighted
    sum of service times of all pairs of transceivers was minimized. By considering
    both the communication time of UAVs to relay the data and the flying time of UAVs,
    this objective problem was formulated as a mixed non-linear programming problem,
    which was optimally solved to determine the trajectory of each UAV based on a
    hierarchical iterative approach. It is important to emphasize that the iterative
    approach comprised four steps with the aim to determine: i) the potential 3D relaying
    positions of UAVs by solving the unconstrained non-convex problem, ii) the trajectories
    of UAVs by converting the proposed objective problem into a mixed integer non-linear
    programming problem (MINLP) and solving the MINLP problem, iii) the adjustment
    of UAV stops by using the 3D hierarchical search, and iv) the algorithm convergence.
    Simulation results were presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
    approach and to evaluate the trajectories of UAVs by adjusting the system parameters.
    2) UAV Deployment Control According to Fig. 17, related studies for UAV deployment
    control generally focus on three directions, i.e., construction of UAV cluster
    within a predefined cylinder space, formation control of drone swarm to enhance
    the network capacity, and small cell densification via UAV deployment. a: UAV
    Clustering and Swarm Formation Control The use of the energy harvesting (EH) enabled
    caching UAVs in terrestrial cellular networks brings about two major advantages:
    i) to ease the fronthaul congestion by directly providing the cached popular contents
    at UAVs towards the ground mobile terminals (GMTs), and ii) to prolong the operational
    duration of UAVs by harvesting the energy from ambient environment such as wind
    and solar. However, the intermittent energy arrival through EH and the uncertainty
    of caching poses additional challenges on the robust connectivity and the ubiquitous
    coverage in UAV-assisted wireless cellular networks. In response to this challenge,
    Wu et al. [17] discussed the problem of coordination and cooperation between UAVs
    and ground BSs under this scenario. Moreover, a user-centric cooperative UAV clustering
    scheme was proposed aiming to offload GMTs from BSs to UAVs within the predefined
    cylinder space. The core of the cooperative UAV clustering was to construct the
    cylinder B (o,χ) + , where o is the 2D space projection position centered on a
    target GMT with the content requirement over the horizontal plane coordinate and
    χ is the radius of the cylinder, as depicted in Fig. 19. Once the cylinder was
    determined, a candidate UAV can be selected to send its cached contents that a
    target GMT requested, which must be subject to three necessary conditions simultaneously
    as follows: The candidate UAV was under a flight condition with a minimum altitude
    H min and a maximum altitude H max , and also owned enough energy including the
    harvested energy and the onboard energy to support the wireless communication
    modules. The candidate UAV had the cached contents that should match the requirement
    of target GMT. The connection capacity (i.e., cell loads) of the UAV was more
    than the number of other candidate UAV serving GMTs or the number of other candidate
    UAV serving GMTs was much greater than the connection capacity of the UAV. FIGURE
    19. The cooperative UAV clustering based on the cylinder B (o,χ) + . Show All
    Based on those necessary conditions, several candidate UAVs constituted the cooperative
    UAV cluster. On the basis of the cooperative UAV clustering, the explicit expressions
    of successful transmission probabilities for a typical GMT were further obtained
    with the help of the Gamma approximation for the distributions of aggregated signal
    strength. To effectively control and manage the drone swarm by terrestrial BSs
    in the deployment of low power ground nodes for next generation HetNets, Meng
    et al. [140] proposed a robust drone swarm formation control approach to raise
    the formation strength of drones during flight control. Their target was to enhance
    the network capacity in traffic hotspots by taking into account the use of mmWave
    communications during information exchange between terrestrial BSs and lead drone.
    Due to the constraints of traditional shape of antenna such as limited angles
    and inconvenience for deployment on flying objects, the authors presented a novel
    barrel antenna shape of antenna to be deployed for drone swarm formation. Especially,
    ray tracing model along with the receiver spatial distribution theory were employed
    in the design of the barrel antenna. The advantage of this kind of antenna was
    to improve the quality and the received power of mmWave signals between terrestrial
    BSs and lead drone. In the proposed approach, the drones equipped with the adopted
    antenna structure can fly around the given regions in which the lead drone transmitted
    its position signals to terrestrial BS as the backhauling and received the fronthaul
    signal from terrestrial BS simultaneously. b: Small Cell Densification Deployment
    In order to overcome the limitation of blockage effect of mmWave communications,
    the technique of small cell densification (i.e., network densification) is a good
    choice for design of 5G system architecture. The reason is that the application
    of small cell densification can raise the probability of LOS transmission conditions
    due to the increased number of access points (APs). To enable the small cell densification,
    Khosravi et al. [163] applied the UAVs as the mmWave APs which were deployed in
    a Manhattan grid manner as the typical urban scenarios, aiming to reduce the probability
    of blockage. The effect of the UAV-mounted mmWave APs on the throughput of ground
    UEs and the coverage probability in the case of a non-uniform load was investigated.
    Through the simulations, the authors showed that the presence of flying UAV APs
    with mmWave communications under the given urban scenarios can lead to ping-pong
    effects, where the throughput performance was found to fluctuate because of frequent
    handovers of UE access between UAVs and nearest APs. This would cause the overall
    per UE throughput performance deterioration. 3) Summary and Lessons Learned We
    have presented a detailed review of the state-of-the-art related to UAV spatial
    configuration in UAV-assisted wireless networks with 5G mmWave communications.
    Especially, optimization of positions and trajectories as well as how to effectively
    control the deployment of multiple UAVs have been reviewed. The important lessons
    learned from the review of existing studies about UAV spatial configuration are
    summarized as follows: No matter position optimization or trajectory optimization,
    the target is to achieve system performance improvement and optimal allocation
    of wireless resource, while satisfying a certain metric. In order to obtain the
    optimal position of UAV, we can take the prediction algorithm into account, such
    as prediction of link quality of mmWave beam via the Autonomous Relay, and machine
    learning framework of ESNs. The trajectory optimization of UAV is always associated
    with mathematical optimization problem under the given starting and ending positions
    of UAV. It’s a general idea for designing effective algorithm to obtain the optimal
    or suboptimal trajectories. For the UAV deployment control, the essential issue
    is to deploy and control multiple UAVs according to specific design requirements.
    We can construct the UAV cluster consisting of multiple candidate UAVs within
    a cylinder space. The aim of this clustering is to carry out the theoretical analysis
    of system performance, e.g., the successful transmission probabilities. E. Resource
    Management The integration of numerous emerging services and applications into
    UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications requires a fundamental
    understanding on design principles and control mechanisms, to fulfill the requirements
    of various optimization criteria, e.g., QoS, energy efficiency, throughput maximization,
    etc. Under these requirements, one of the main challenges for design principles
    and control mechanisms is how to efficiently manage and schedule network resources,
    such as transmit power, radio spectrum, transmission rate, computing capability,
    subcarrier, backhaul capacity, storage availability, content caching, etc. The
    problem of resource management has been broadly involved in several network scenarios
    [36], [164]–[168], but not well explored in UAV-assisted wireless networks with
    mmWave communications. In what follows, the related research progress on resource
    management in our considered scenario will be summarized from two aspects according
    to what kind of network resources to be managed, i.e., power and subcarrier allocation
    [169], [170] and caching optimization [37], [171]. 1) Power and Subcarrier Allocation
    In order to efficiently exploit the advantages of 5G HetNets assisted by UAVs,
    Chakareski et al. [169] and Naqvi et al. [170] envisaged a novel HetNet architecture
    that employed the dual operational frequency bands in comparison with traditional
    HetNets. Specifically, the HetNet architecture consisted of a macro ground BS
    operating at microwave band, multiple dual-mode small ground BSs operating at
    two kinds of mmWave bands, and multiple UAV-based flying small BSs operating at
    microwave band. Additionally, ground users can be served by three kinds of cases:
    i) microwave ground macro BS, ii) microwave flying small BSs (SBSs), and iii)
    ground SBSs with lower mmWave bands represented by L and higher mmWave bands denoted
    by H . Under this scenario of interest, Chakareski et al. [169] and Naqvi et al.
    [170] designed an efficient radio resource management optimization framework for
    mmWave 5G HetNets empowered by flying SBSs. For the case of microwave ground macro
    BS, joint optimization of achievable rate and energy efficiency of all ground
    users was formulated as an optimization problem to maximize the sum rate and minimize
    the total power consumption for ground users simultaneously, while satisfying
    the minimum QoS and the maximum transmit power constraints. Mathematically, the
    presented optimization problem was expressed as follows: maximize p BS m,n ϕ ∑
    m∈ M BS ∑ n∈ N BS κ m,n r BS m,n R norm −(1−ϕ) ∑ m,n p BS m,n P norm subjectto  ∑
    m∈ M BS ∑ n∈ N BS p BS m,n ≤ P BS max ,∀m,∀n, ∑ m∈ M BS ∑ n∈ N BS κ m,n r BS m,n
    ≥ R BS min ,∀m,∀n, p BS m,n ≥0,∀m,∀n, κ m,n ∈{0,1}∀m,∀n, (9a) (9b) (9c) (9d) (9e)
    View Source where p BS m,n is the power allocated to the m -th ground user on
    the n -th subcarrier by ground macro BS, r BS m,n is the achievable rate of the
    m -th ground user on the n -th subcarrier associated with ground macro BS, M BS
    is the set of ground users associated with ground macro BS, N BS is the set of
    subcarriers available for ground macro BS, κ m,n is the binary variable indicating
    whether the n -th subcarrier is assigned to the m -th ground user, P norm is the
    maximum transmit power of ground macro BS, and R norm is the maximum achievable
    rate under the constraint of P norm . By using the Lagrangian function, the optimal
    power allocated to the m -th ground user on the n -th subcarrier can be derived
    via the Lagrangian multipliers which was further obtained through the sub-gradient
    method. Based on the optimal power allocation solution, the optimal subcarrier
    allocation can be also computed by using the Hungarian method. For the case of
    microwave flying SBSs, the maximum interference threshold constraint was introduced
    to guarantee QoS to ground users associated with macro ground BS. Thus, the transmit
    power on a reused subcarrier by flying SBSs should be subject to the minimum rate
    requirement. Finally, for the case of dual-mode ground SBSs, the authors in [169],
    [170] proposed a step-wise algorithm for subcarrier allocation and user association
    to a specific mmWave band by using the Time-division multiple access (TDMA) scheme
    for subcarrier access. Numerical results demonstrated that the proposed optimization
    framework outperformed the conventional approaches in terms of maximizing the
    system sum rate or minimizing the system power consumption. 2) Caching Optimization
    Caching the popular contents at the edge of networks closer to end users during
    off peak hours, has emerged as a promising alternative to mitigate the burden
    of backhaul links in core networks, enhance the capacity of the bandwidth constrained
    fronthaul links, and improve the QoE of end users. Motivated by these advantages,
    Chen et al. [37] explored the proactive deployment problem of cache-enabled UAVs
    to optimize the QoE of ground mobile users in the CRAN by proactively downloading
    and caching the popular contents at UAVs during off peak hours. The UAVs as the
    flying cache-enabled RRHs can directly deliver the caching contents to the requested
    ground users via A2G mmWave frequencies. Additionally, the QoE metric was characterized
    by the concrete human-in-the-loop metric that captures data rate, delay, and device
    type of each user. Based on this setup, an optimization problem was formulated
    as a UAV’s transmit power minimization problem in (5) while satisfying the QoE
    metric constraint for each ground user. To solve this problem, a prediction algorithm
    by using the conceptor ESN was proposed to generate the content request distribution
    and the mobility pattern of each ground user. In this way, the user-UAV associations
    were determined via the K -mean clustering approach, and the optimal contents
    to be cached by each UAV was further obtained. Particularly, within time duration
    T , the optimal set of contents C k to be cached by the k -th UAV can be calculated
    by: C k = argmax C k ∑ j=1 T H ∑ τ=1 H ∑ i∈Uτ ∑ kn∈Ck (pj,inΔ P j,τ,ki,n ), (10)
    View Source where H is the number of time slots to collect user mobility, p j,in
    is the content request distribution of the i -th user during the j -th time period,
    and Δ P j,τ,ki,n is the reduction of UAV’s transmit power by caching the contents
    during the j -th time period. Simulation results showed that the deployment of
    the cache-enable UAVs can greatly reduce the rate required for reaching the QoE
    metric threshold of each ground user with the low wireless fronthaul rate for
    each ground user. Furthermore, compared with two cases without cache and without
    optimizing the locations of UAVs, the proposed prediction algorithm via the conceptor
    ESN can achieve 40% and 25% of the reduction of the average transmit power of
    ground users, respectively. Recently, the emerging VR technology has enjoyed both
    technological advances and widespread adoption to merge physical and virtual environment
    in real time. However, existing cellular networks cannot match the 360° VR content
    transmission due to limited backhaul and fronthaul capacity. Faced to this problem,
    Chen et al. [171] presented a framework of content caching and visible content
    transmission for UAV-assisted wireless VR networks, aiming to reduce the data
    traffic burden of the backhaul and enable the ground VR users to achieve the application
    requirements of low latency. In this scenario, as shown in Fig. 20, UAVs firstly
    collect VR contents with visible format and 360° format that the VR users request,
    and then send the collected contents to the cache-enabled SBSs through wireless
    downlink backhaul links at mmWave frequencies. In the meantime, the SBSs can directly
    transmit the caching contents to VR users via traditional licensed cellular bands.
    With this in mind, joint content caching and visible content transmission was
    formulated as an optimization problem with the goal to maximize the reliability
    of VR user. The reliability of VR user was defined as the probability of the VR
    user’s successful transmission, which indicated that the content transmission
    delay of VR user should satisfy the target of the VR delay requirement. FIGURE
    20. Illustration of the UAV-assisted wireless VR networks. Show All To maximize
    the reliability of VR user so as to find the optimal contents to cache and content
    transmission format, Chen et al. [171] further proposed a deep learning framework
    known as echo liquid state machine (ELSM) by combining the neural network concepts
    of the liquid state machine (LSM) and the ESN together. Specifically, the LSM
    was used to adjust the association policy of VR user, the cached contents and
    the cache content format according to the VR user’s content request. Due to the
    higher complexity of training the traditional LSM, the ESN serving as the output
    function of the LSM was presented. The proposed ELSM algorithm can record large
    number of historical information and use it to predict the future output. Furthermore,
    compared with the ESN algorithm, the total reliability gains of the proposed ELSM
    algorithm can reach 14.5% and 25.4%, respectively. Simulation results showed that
    the ELSM algorithm can achieve 14.7% and 20.2% reliability gains, respectively,
    in comparison with the ELSM algorithm with random caching and the ESLM with random
    transmission format. 3) Summary and Lessons Learned We have pointed out the importance
    of efficiently managing and scheduling network resources. The related research
    progress on resource management in our considered scenario has been summarized
    based on what kind of network resources to be managed. The important lessons learned
    from the review of research issues and solutions about resource management are
    summarized as follows: Generally, the target of resource management is to efficiently
    and optimally allocate network resources, e.g., transmit power, subcarrier, caching,
    computing capability, etc. As such, resource allocation problem can be formulated
    as a mathematical optimization problem, while complying with one or more optimization
    criteria, e.g., QoE, energy efficiency, total power consumption, throughput maximization,
    and so on. Compared with the power and subcarrier allocation, the optimization
    of the cached popular contents at the network edge is an emerging hot topic in
    UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. In essence, caching
    optimization together with other resource allocation can be initially formulated
    as a joint optimization problem. We can take advantage of machine learning framework,
    e.g., conceptor ESN, ELSM, multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, to design
    efficient algorithm for allocating the cached contents. F. Security Strategy The
    broadcast nature of radio propagation of mmWave signals makes wireless transmissions
    be open and accessible to both legitimate users and unauthorized users (i.e.,
    malicious eavesdroppers and attackers) in UAV-assisted wireless networks with
    5G mmWave communications. The open transmission environment and the lack of physical
    protection lead to serious security risk of malicious attacks and wiretapping
    under our considered scenario, e.g., passive interception of sensitive information
    and disruption of legitimate transmission via active jamming [172]. To combat
    the attacks, efficient security mechanism needs to be designed to enable the legitimate
    receivers to successfully obtain the confidential messages from the transmitter,
    while preventing the eavesdroppers from interpreting the legitimate transmission.
    The traditional key-based cryptographic techniques generally focus on applying
    the encryption and decryption at the higher layers such as network layer and application
    layer to secure wireless transmissions [11]. Alternatively, by taking advantage
    of physical characteristics of radio propagation, information theoretic security
    can be also achieved at the physical layer to provide direct secure communications
    in UAV-assisted wireless networks [173]–[176]. By integrating mmWave communications
    into UAV-assisted wireless networks, there also have been some recent studies
    on physical layer security that are focused on directional modulation [177]–[179]
    and jamming transmission [123]. In the following subsection, we will give a summary
    about these related studies. 1) Directional Modulation Owing to the inherent directional
    mmWave beams, it goes without saying that there exists the line-of-propagation
    (LOP) channels (i.e., LOS propagation channels) in UAV-assisted wireless networks
    with mmWave communications. As an important physical layer security technique,
    directional modulation (DM) [177], [179]–[183] has attracted considerable attention
    from both academia and industry to provide an efficient solution for secure wireless
    communications, especially for the LOP channel scenarios. Compared with conventional
    cryptographic methods at the upper layers, DM has the potential to enhance the
    security at the physical layer in UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications,
    based on the feature of spatial direction-dependent signal-modulation-formatted
    transmission. As we all know, in conventional modulation, malicious eavesdroppers
    have the chance to eavesdrop on the captured messages from the receiving modulated
    signals, because the only difference among the received messages from different
    directions lies in the signal power for traditional wireless transmitter. However,
    DM is typically a transmitter side security technique due to its ability to project
    the modulated signals of confidential messages into one or more desired spatial
    directions in the definite constellation patterns. At the same time, in all the
    other spatial directions, the constellation patterns of the same modulated signals
    will be purposely distorted in the phase and amplitude such that the eavesdroppers
    cannot intercept and decode the confidential messages successfully. As a result,
    the directional angles of the desired receiver and eavesdroppers (i.e., the DoAs
    of the modulated signals) are greatly important for the DM transmitter, in that
    DM can achieve high performance gain by beamforming technique in the desired spatial
    directions. From a practical view point, the desired spatial directions can be
    defined in advance as a priori information for the DM transmitter and the legitimate
    receiver. The typical DM system with QPSK modulation under the scenario of UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications is illustrated in Fig. 21, where
    there are one UAV with the multi-beam antenna array in the air as a DM transmitter,
    one ground legitimate receiver, and two ground eavesdroppers. At the side of the
    DM transmitter, the QPSK modulated signals with four phase-dependent unique symbols
    of confidential messages are generated in mmWave frequency by using the 3D beamforming
    technology. For the legitimate receiver, the modulated signal of the confidential
    messages is projected into the a priori spatial direction denoted by the DOA θ
    which owns a definite constellation pattern as shown on the top left corner of
    Fig. 21. For the eavesdroppers, the constellation patterns of the same modulated
    signal are specially scrambled along all the directions other than θ , which also
    means the artificial noise (AN) projection. The joint operation of beamforming
    and AN projection at the physical layer makes the eavesdroppers very difficult
    to intercept the confidential messages, which can further enhance the security
    of the system. FIGURE 21. Illustration of DM system with QPSK modulation in UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications. Show All However, when the eavesdropper
    moves inside the direction of main beam of the desired receiver, and the eavesdropper
    can also intercept the confidential messages. To solve this problem, a new concept
    of secure and accurate wireless transmission was proposed by Shu et al. [177]–[179],
    in which DM, random frequency diversity, and phase alignment were incorporated.
    Particularly, a DOA measurement method based on Bayesian learning was presented,
    and the precoding vector and the artificial noise projection matrix at the DM
    transmitter were further designed. Compared to the single-snapshot measurement
    without machine learning, the proposed DOA measurement approach can generate a
    substantial secrecy rate performance gain. Additionally, the Bayesian learning
    based method can improve the DOA measurement precision with fully-digital structure.
    To be specific, when the size of the training data set was increasing, the root
    mean squared error decreased and the DOA measurement precision was also improved.
    Moreover, the secrecy rate can increase with the growth of the SINR of system
    using the DM technique, but the secrecy rate gain would gradually decrease when
    the SINR increased. 2) Transmit Jamming In consequence of the broadcast nature
    of the A2G wireless links, UAV-assisted wireless networks are particularly susceptible
    to the eavesdropping threats. Faced to the challenges of the security vulnerabilities,
    Zhu et al. [123] employed the physical layer security technique to analyze the
    secrecy performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications.
    In this scenario, UAVs serving as the flying BSs with multiple transmit antennas
    were used to provide wireless access from the sky to ground legitimate receivers,
    in coexistence with multiple ground eavesdroppers. To guarantee the minimum safety
    distance between the randomly deployed UAVs, the Matérn hardcore point process
    was leveraged to implement the UAV deployment. The average secrecy rate between
    the associated UAV and the typical ground legitimate receiver was also evaluated,
    in terms of the complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) of the average
    rate between the associated UAV and the typical legitimate receiver, and the cumulative
    distribution function (CDF) between the associated UAV and the most detrimental
    eavesdropper. Even more important, as a core idea of applying the physical layer
    security strategy, a part of the UAVs of all the deployed UAVs was utilized as
    the jammers in the air to transmit the jamming mmWave signals to the eavesdroppers,
    as shown in Fig. 22. Based on the incorporation of the UAV jammers into the scenario,
    the improved average achievable secrecy rate for the jamming-aided UAV transmission
    was further characterized by: R (J) Sec = ⎡ ⎣ 1 ln2 ∫ ∞ 0 P (J) cov,R (γ)+ F (J)
    E ∗ (γ)−1 1+γ dγ ⎤ ⎦ + , (11) View Source where γ>0 is the threshold, P (J) cov,R
    (γ) is the CCDF of the SINR at the typical receiver, and F (J) E ∗ (γ) is the
    CDF of the SINR at the most detrimental eavesdropper. Simulation results showed
    that optimizing the jamming factor (i.e., the percentage of UAVs that transmit
    the jamming mmWave signals) can quite improve the secrecy rate. Furthermore, the
    use of the proper number of UAVs to transmit the jamming mmWave signals can reduce
    the eavesdropper’s rate more than the typical receiver’s rate. FIGURE 22. Illustration
    of the coexistence scenario of the associated UAV and the UAV jammer to to transmit
    the jamming mmWave signals to the ground eavesdroppers. Show All 3) Summary and
    Lessons Learned We have presented a summary of recent studies on physical layer
    security that are focused on directional modulation and jamming transmission.
    The important lessons learned from the review of research issues and solutions
    about physical layer security are summarized as follows: The directional modulation
    depends on the feature of spatial direction-dependent signal-modulation-formatted
    transmission to enhance the security at the physical layer. Typically, directional
    angles of the desired receiver and eavesdroppers should be different to distinguish
    the constellation patterns of modulated signals. In particular, directional angles
    can be defined previously as a priori spatial direction that owns a definite constellation
    pattern. Therefore, directional angles are quite similar to the frequency hopping
    sequence in frequency-hopping spread spectrum system. For the jamming transmission,
    the primary idea is to apply the partial portions of UAVs as the jammers to proactively
    transmit the jamming mmWave signals to the eavesdroppers. Through this kind of
    method to transmit jamming signals, the average achievable secrecy rate between
    the associated UAV and the ground legitimate receiver can be improved. G. Performance
    Assessment The assessment of the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks
    with 5G mmWave communications plays a significant role in guiding us to design
    network protocols, optimize networking structures, analyze system parameters,
    diagnose performance issues, and so forth. The commonly used methods to evaluate
    the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications include
    theoretical performance analysis [65], [184]–[186] and simulation tool based measurement
    campaign [187]. Both of the methods can be exploited to quantitatively and qualitatively
    assess the network performance and provide some valuable data, metrics, models,
    approaches, frameworks, and mechanisms to improve the network performance. In
    the following, we will review the recent studies that apply performance analysis
    and measurement campaign into the performance assessment of UAV-assisted wireless
    networks with mmWave communications. 1) Performance Analysis Considering the importance
    of evaluating the performance of UAV-assisted wireless networks, especially for
    mmWave scenarios, Yi et al. [184] proposed a unified 3D spatial framework to theoretically
    assess the network performance by employing the tractable blockage model and the
    sectorized antenna pattern. In this scenario, UAV acting as the flying BS was
    deployed to provide the wireless link for ground users during the entire transmission
    process consisting of uplink phase and downlink phase. For the downlink phase,
    the authors analyzed the coverage performance of downlink transmission by considering
    the distance distributions of UAVs and the Laplace transform of interference in
    Poisson point processes. The losed-form expression for the downlink coverage probability
    at the typical BS was further derived, to enhance the evaluation efficiency. For
    the uplink phase, the coverage performance of uplink transmission was also analyzed
    by characterizing the distance distributions in the corresponding or other clusters
    and the Laplace transform of interference in Poisson cluster processes. Moreover,
    the general expression for the uplink coverage probability at the corresponding
    UAV was rigorously obtained. Based on the coverage probabilities of uplink and
    downlink phases, the system coverage probability was formulated as the function
    of SINR thresholds for downlink and uplink phases. Simulation results indicated
    that a large number of antenna elements had the capability to improve the coverage
    performance. Under the scenario of the low-altitude UAVs deploying alongside the
    ground BS, Galkin et al. [185] proposed to utilize the stochastic geometry method
    to analyze the backhaul performance of ground stations serving the low-altitude
    UAV network in the urban environment. In particular, the authors analyzed the
    directional antenna alignment in 3D space between a typical UAV in the scenario
    and the ground stations including the associated backhaul ground station of UAV
    and other interfering ground stations. The antenna array was equipped by each
    ground station, and the 3D beamforming was used to concentrate the highly directional
    beam towards UAV, which forms the backhaul link operating at both 2 GHz LTE and
    mmWave frequencies. Additionally, by setting the SINR threshold, analytical expression
    for the probability of successfully establishing the backhaul link was obtained.
    The expected data rate over the backhaul link was further derived based on the
    backhaul probability. Compared with the interference-limited LTE signals, the
    mmWave signal was the noise limited signal which can generate a higher backhaul
    probability for UAV. Numerical results showed that the backhaul probability can
    increase monotonically with the growth of the height of the ground station, which
    also demonstrated that the backhaul performance was improved by deploying the
    ground station as high as possible above the ground. The inherent challenges including
    multipath propagation of urban environments and dynamic blockage of mmWave links
    impose additional constraints and requirements for the mmWave backhaul connections
    in UAV-assisted wireless networks. To address these challenges, Gapeyenko et al.
    [65] adopted the flexible and reconfigurable backhaul architecture in UAV-assisted
    wireless networks, for the purpose of achieving the capability to dynamically
    reroute the backhaul links due to the unreliable blockage-prone mmWave links.
    The typical mathematical framework was presented by capturing the 3D multipath
    mmWave channel model, the heterogeneous mobility of UAVs and blockers, and the
    dynamic blockage effects. Based on this framework, the authors theoretically carried
    out the performance assessment of the flexible mmWave backhaul operation in the
    case of the crowded urban deployments, aiming to explore the spatial and temporal
    characteristics of the mmWave backhaul. The evaluation of the mmWave backhaul
    performance specifically covered two metrics of interest, i.e., time-averaged
    and time-dependent metrics. Numerical results demonstrated that both the outage
    probability and the spectral efficiency were improved with the growth of the intensity
    of UAV-BS traversals. In terms of the flight speed, the decrease of the UAV-BS
    speed presented an obvious positive effect on the mmWave backhaul performance.
    As one major challenge, blockage effect for mmWave signal along the LOS propagation
    path between the drone-enabled aerial access point and the UE poses the additional
    constraints on the design of the analytical model for drone-based mmWave communications.
    Based on the extension of conventional stochastic geometry method, Kovalchukov
    et al. [186] proposed a 3D analytical model for drone-based mmWave communications
    by jointly capturing the random heights of communicating entities (i.e., drone-enabled
    aerial access points and UEs) and the high directionality of transmission. Their
    objective was to analyze the performance of drone-based mmWave communications
    through joint consideration of the above factors for the 3D analytical model.
    Furthermore, both the mean interference and the SINR were derived as explicit
    expressions. The system performance was assessed with the emphasis on the impact
    of the vertical dimension in aerial mmWave connectivity. Numerical results showed
    that capturing the vertical exposure probability along with the random altitude
    of communicating entities and UEs to access the aggregate interference were of
    great importance to the accurate performance assessment. 2) Measurement Campaign
    In addition to the performance assessment using the theoretical analysis, simulation
    tool based measurement campaign can be also conducted to evaluate the performance
    of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications. By utilizing the
    existing analytical models for free space path loss, spatial consistency, and
    small-scale fading, Vasiliev et al. [187] assessed the end-to-end efficiency of
    UAV-assisted LTE-like mmWave cellular networks in the crowded area with the aid
    of NS-3 simulation tool. Owing to the deployment of antenna arrays and the high
    throughput, the 28 GHz band was used for mmWave communications. For the node layout,
    ground BS and UE were located in the opposite corners of the simulation area,
    and UAV as the aerial relay was located in the middle of the area. Two simulated
    scenarios including the source-destination case and the source-UAV-destination
    case were selected in the measurement campaign. On the basis of this setting,
    end-to-end performance in terms of the QoS metric, i.e., the average goodput and
    the goodput gain, was measured for these two kinds of scenarios with different
    parameters of free space path loss and blockage density. The results via the measurement
    campaign showed that the performance of the source-UAV-destination case was more
    efficient than that of the source-destination case in terms of average goodput
    and goodput gain. Especially, more than 80% of goodput gain was obtained by using
    the UAV as aerial relay with high blockage density. 3) Summary and Lessons Learned
    We have provided readers a survey of existing research efforts related with the
    performance assessment of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications.
    To be more concrete, performance analysis and measurement campaign have been reviewed
    and discussed, respectively. The important lessons learned from the review of
    recent studies on the performance assessment are summarized as follows: The performance
    analysis of UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications focuses
    more on analyzing and assessing one or more performance metrics from a theoretical
    perspective, e.g., coverage performance, backhaul performance, and the effect
    of multiple factors on system performance. The main factors influencing the system
    performance include blockage effect of mmWave propagation channels, antenna patterns,
    vertical heights of communicating entities, and aggregate interference. Compared
    to the performance assessment using the theoretical analysis, we can also conduct
    the simulation tool based measurement campaign to verify the system performance.
    The major problem of using the simulation tool (e.g., NS-3 network simulator)
    is how to initialize the network parameters that are in accordance with the actual
    environments. SECTION V. Summary, Open Issues and Future Research Directions Many
    research efforts have been devoted to the development of 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks. In the previous section, we have presented
    a comprehensive summary of current achievements in the integration of 5G mmWave
    communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks, and have also discussed the
    state-of-the-art issues, solutions, and open challenges in the newly emerging
    area. The survey has covered and highlighted seven different research issues that
    we would like to focus on, i.e., antenna technique, radio propagation channel,
    multiple access mechanism, spatial configuration, resource management, security
    strategy, and performance assessment. Based on the current great research efforts
    in the literature, in this section, we will summarize the existing research works
    in the way of comparison, and outline the open research issues along with the
    potential directions that need to be well investigated to encourage future research
    studies on this area. A. Summary The key research information related to existing
    research works in the area of 5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless
    networks has been summarized in Fig. 23 and Fig. 24. From Fig. 23, the percentage
    of existing research works in terms of seven important research issues is vividly
    described as a pie chart. As can be observed, the majority of existing research
    works, close to 40%, are aimed at modeling the radio propagation channel and capturing
    the propagation characterization of mmWave signals for UAV-assisted wireless networks
    with 5G mmWave communications. This is because that the propagation channels in
    mmWave frequencies steeply differ from the channels in traditional microwave frequencies
    due to the technique challenges caused by higher frequencies, e.g., higher atmospheric
    attenuation and severe free space path loss. Correspondingly, the study and analysis
    on the radio propagation channel including channel modeling, channel estimation
    and tracking, and blockage detection and countermeasure, have great theoretical
    significance and applicable value. From this figure, we can also find that the
    percentage of other research issues occupies a comparatively small proportion,
    which indicates a potential research opportunity. In addition, Fig. 24 illustrates
    the time distribution of existing research works. From Fig. 24, it is clearly
    revealed that almost all of existing research works are distributed in the last
    three years. These research efforts appear a continually increasing trend, although
    six months have passed in 2019. Particularly, the research trend shows that the
    integration of 5G mmWave communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks has
    been recognized as one of the research hotspots in research community recently.

    communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks. Show All FIGURE 24. The time
    distribution graph of existing research works in 5G mmWave communications for
    UAV-assisted wireless networks. Show All B. Challenges and Open Issues 1) mmWave
    Beam Alignment and Beam Switching As a consequence of the decrease of mmWave beamwidth
    and the mobility of ground UEs, a main challenge in our considered scenario is
    to effectively steer and align the mmWave beams between TX and RX sides at the
    beginning of communications [111]–[114]. Efficient beam alignment together with
    highly directional beamforming can achieve a large directional gain to combat
    their stronger atmospheric attenuation and higher free space path loss. Therefore,
    5G mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks need to require advanced
    beam alignment techniques, e.g., beam tracking, beam training, hierarchical beam
    codebook design, beam search, accurate estimation of the channel, etc. Among them,
    there are lots of issues need to be resolved, but one important issue is to mitigate
    the beam alignment overhead. Moreover, an alternative solution to perform a proper
    beam switching is also required when conventional beam alignment schemes by using
    beam sweeping become inefficient if not impossible [188]. In practical scenarios,
    both TX and RX sides cannot purely guarantee perfect beam alignment due to time-varying
    channel conditions and inaccurate beam tracking. As such, by considering the beam
    alignment errors, the impact of imperfect beam alignment between TX and RX sides
    on the system performance and directional gain should further be analyzed and
    evaluated. 2) Dynamic Resource Allocation by Integrating Content Caching and Computation
    Offloading In practical environment, both the users and the UEs on the ground
    are always moving continuously, and even quickly, e.g., vehicle nodes. Meanwhile,
    the UAVs’ spatial positions and trajectories are also changing overtime in a dynamic
    time-varying state especially for the fixed-wing UAVs. Apparently, it will be
    far more realistic to dynamically manage and schedule network resources according
    to the current instant time in the dynamic scenario. That is, we should perform
    dynamic resource allocation in which the network resource will be allocated in
    a continuous-time manner. This kind of continuous-time resource allocation differs
    from traditional resource allocation by assuming that the finite time horizon
    is divided into fixed time slots in a discrete way [19], [33], [189], [190]. By
    using the edge caching, the popular social contents can be cached at the edge
    of network during off-hours, to reduce backhaul loading at peak-hours. With the
    help of the MEC, the resource-limited UEs can offload their computation tasks
    to closer computation servers, to obtain multiple benefits, e.g., reduced latency,
    alleviated backhaul congestion, and enhanced user experience. Current research
    efforts have been targeted at content caching and computation offloading from/to
    the sky [17], [34]–[36], [191]–[193], but not well investigated in UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications. Therefore, one potential issue that
    needs to be resolved is to achieve joint dynamic resource allocation for content
    caching and computation offloading. 3) Cross-Layer Optimization Framework for
    Routing and Distributed Resource Allocation Instead of using one single UAV, multiple
    UAVs have potentials to bring many benefits to assist wireless networks by creating
    drone swarm, such as high scalability, enhanced fault tolerance capability, longer
    network lifetime, improved multitasking ability, and so forth [74]–[76], [194].
    Meanwhile, information exchange and transfer among multiple UAVs can be achieved
    by using the multi-hop drone interconnection via A2A mmWave links. In comparison
    with the lower layer solutions explored by existing research efforts, recent work
    indicates that there are many new challenges to routing problem at the network
    layer in our considered scenario. Several characteristics and constraints that
    affect the design of routing mechanism should be well incorporated, e.g., large
    scale spatial distribution, high degree of mobility, high dynamic network topology,
    possible blockage effect, etc. In addition, with a joint cross-layer optimization,
    other layer is able to share its information and configuration about its core
    function with the network layer without breaking the hierarchical structure of
    the layered architecture. The cross-layer design perspective can improve network
    performance and efficiency through the cross-layer coupling between network layer
    and other layers. As a result, joint cross-layer optimization for routing and
    distributed resource allocation is not only desirable, but also necessary. 4)
    Joint Optimization of 3D Beamforming and an Projection in Directional Modulation
    As a transmitter side security technique, the DM is used to project the modulated
    signals of the confidential messages into one or more desired spatial directions
    with the definite constellation patterns. In our considered scenario, by adopting
    the 3D beamforming architecture with multi-beam antenna array, the UAV serves
    as the DM transmitter to provide the secure communications at the physical layer
    for ground legitimate receivers. Nevertheless, existing works only take single
    desired legitimate receiver into account [177], [181]. That is, only one mmWave
    beam generated by the DM transmitter through modulating the confidential messages
    can be securely conveyed along a desired spatial direction. As such, one of the
    key challenges is to extend single legitimate receiver to multiple receivers by
    projecting multiple modulated signal of the confidential messages along multiple
    different spatial directions simultaneously. Additionally, as a spatial direction-dependent
    transmission, secure mmWave communications via the DM depends directly on the
    predefined spatial direction, i.e., DOA, for ground legitimate receiver. For the
    eavesdroppers, the same modulated signals will be particularly scrambled like
    the AN projection due to their different spatial directions. However, the eavesdroppers
    and legitimate receiver can be located in the same region. More seriously, one
    of the eavesdroppers has the chance to move inside the direction of the main beam
    of the desired receiver. Hence, efficient and adaptive spatial direction measurement
    and adjustment mechanisms for the 3D beamforming are required to provide more
    accurate control of DOAs for ground legitimate receivers. C. Potential Research
    Directions 1) UAV-Assisted Wireless Power Transfer With mmWave Communications
    A challenging issue in UAV-assisted wireless networks is that no matter ground
    UEs or UAVs usually have limited energy storage for normal operations. To prolong
    the operational time of energy-constrained UEs and UAVs, a straightforward and
    effective approach is to apply wireless power transfer to provide a controllable
    and sustainable energy supply [195]–[197]. For our considered scenario, on the
    one hand, UAVs are employed as mobile energy transmitters over the air to deliver
    wireless energy towards ground UEs. On the other hand, UAVs can be recharged by
    other power source, e.g., the solar energy by installing solar panels on UAVs
    [198] and the RF-enabled wireless power transfer performed by other UAVs or ground
    fixed energy transmitters. It is believed that wireless power transfer can be
    incorporated with mmWave communications for UAV-assisted wireless networks, where
    further research is needed. 2) mmWave Communications for Aerial Access Networks
    To achieve the 3D ubiquitous super-connectivity in the global scale, the traditional
    terrestrial network architecture should be fully integrated with various non-terrestrial
    platforms, including UAVs, balloons, airships, and very low Earth orbit (VLEO)
    satellites [199]–[201]. The integration of these platforms has substantially boosted
    the prospect of implementing the aerial access networks (AANs) by extending the
    spatial scale of UAVs at low-altitude to higher altitudes. As the emerging radio
    access platforms, the AANs has attracted growing attentions from both academia
    and industry as a key enabler for future sixth generation (6G) systems of the
    2030s. In addition, as a very promising way to sustain ultra-high-speed transmission,
    we can also apply mmWave communications in the AANs to make global access more
    robust and reliable [22]. More investigation is needed in this direction to address
    key technique challenges, e.g., 3D channel models, hybrid altitude optimization,
    deployment of multiple heterogeneous aerial platforms, cooperative access control,
    etc. 3) Network Functions Virtualization for UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks With
    mmWave Communications It is generally difficult to effectively manage different
    network services and various emerging applications, by identifying specific service
    for each networking entity, e.g., ground UEs and aerial BSs, running on our considered
    network architecture. There is a urgent need to build up a highly flexible network
    architecture with enhanced intelligence and improved resilience for our considered
    scenario [21], [202]–[204]. Network Functions Virtualization (NFV) provides an
    efficient paradigm to optimize network resource utility by virtualizing network
    services [205]–[207]. Such virtualization enables deployment of new network services
    and elastic network scaling to reduce maintenance costs and make network more
    flexible, scalable and cost-effective. It is firmly anticipated that the use of
    NFV in UAV-assisted wireless networks with mmWave communications will certainly
    make the network configuration interesting and valuable for both academia and
    industry studies. 4) Integration of Far-Reaching Applications With mmWave Communications
    for User-Centric UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks As already stated, mmWave communications
    have indeed paved the way into the widespread use of UAVs to enable wireless communications
    and networking, with the target to provide ultra-high-speed transmission for 5G
    and beyond applications. However, current achievements by linking UAV-assisted
    wireless networks and mmWave communications together are primarily focused on
    conventional services and applications. With the pervasiveness of Internet of
    Everything (IoE), the time has come for an unprecedented proliferation of newly
    emerging applications, e.g., boundless mobile eXtended reality (XR), autonomous
    driving, haptics, etc [208]–[210], to improve the QoE objective with the center
    of ground and aerial users. Particularly, the original 5G vision of enabling short-packet
    and sensing-based massive URLLC services will be disrupted due to these IoE applications
    [208]. Further research is especially warranted to address this challenging issue
    of how to integrate the far-reaching applications with 5G mmWave communications
    for user-centric UAV-assisted wireless networks. 5) MmWave Communications for
    UAV-Assisted Wireless Networks With Machine Learning MmWave communications for
    UAV-assisted wireless networks not only have a substantial potential to achieve
    higher transmission efficiency with enhanced coverage and capacity, but also support
    a wide variety of 5G and B5G wireless applications. These innovative applications
    are expected to unleash a massive IoT ecosystem with huge data throughput, high
    wireless bandwidth, super-fast speeds, ultra-low latency, and increased connectivity.
    With exciting opportunities, the design, control and optimization of UAV-assisted
    wireless networks with mmWave communications become very challenging and complex.
    The significant challenges require us to configure, manage, and control networks
    in a smarter and more agile manner. Inspired by the trends, machine learning is
    needed to enable adaptive learning and intelligent decision making, due to its
    capability to achieve the convergence of computing power, algorithm improvement,
    and data proliferation [211]–[214]. Future potential research will be strongly
    expected to apply machine learning technique, e.g., multi-agent deep reinforcement
    learning [215], federated learning [216], concept drift learning [217], in our
    considered scenario, to overcome the challenges of resource allocation, cross-layer
    optimization, physical layer security, etc. SECTION VI. Conclusion In this paper,
    we have presented a comprehensive literature survey focusing on the current state-of-the-art
    achievements in the integration of 5G mmWave communications into UAV-assisted
    wireless networks. By analyzing and reviewing the existing research efforts, we
    first introduced a novel taxonomy to categorize the cutting-edge solutions from
    seven aspects. We then reviewed existing articles related to UAV-assisted wireless
    networks and communications as well as 5G mmWave communications, and further compared
    our survey with them. Subsequently, we provided a brief overview of key technical
    advantages and challenges as well as potential applications in 5G mmWave communications
    for UAV-assisted wireless networks. With the devised taxonomy, we surveyed in
    detail the state-of-the-art issues, solutions, and open challenges of integrating
    mmWave communications into UAV-assisted wireless networks. We also derived several
    lessons learned from these research activities. Finally, we pinpointed several
    open issues and outlined promising research directions. We hope that this survey
    is timely and useful for the interested researchers and practitioners to concentrate
    their research activities on this area for the development of next generation
    wireless networks. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes

    SHARE Abstract In the era of big data, the rapid growth of data services is pushing
    forward the persistent evolution of wireless network designs to resolve new challenges
    such as spectrum efficiency, power consumption, quality-of-service (QoS), mobility.
    In particular, energy consumption issues become critical in many emerging wireless
    applications, for example, in Internet-of-Things (IoT), and motivate researchers
    to revisit the network designs which take the energy efficiency into consideration.
    Energy harvesting (EH) has recently been advocated as an alternative to perpetually
    power wireless nodes in the next-generation wireless networks, especially for
    the networks that are confined by limited battery to affect the network lifetime
    or in the hazardous environments that are inconvenient to frequently replace batteries.
    The characteristics of various ambient energy sources are introduced with the
    focus of their impact on wireless communication designs, as compared with the
    conventional grid power supply. The design issues are then elaborated for various
    modern wireless networks, including cooperative networks, cognitive radio networks,
    vehicular networks, underwater networks, and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks.
    In particular, two examples regarding with the cooperative communications are
    provided to get more insight into the methodology for designing EH networks. The
    design challenges of the incorporation of EH into these wireless networks are
    highlighted in different EH environments from the underwater, ground to air. References

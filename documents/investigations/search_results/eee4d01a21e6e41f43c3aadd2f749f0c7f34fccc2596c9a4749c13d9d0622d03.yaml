    have come a long way since the roll out of the conventional voice-centric cellular
    systems. The demand for wireless access in voice and high rate data multi-media
    applications has been increasing. New generation wireless communication systems
    are aimed at accommodating this demand through better resource management and
    improved transmission technologies. The interest in increasing Spectrum Access
    and improving Spectrum Efficiency combined with both the introduction of Software
    Defined Radios and the realization that machine learning can be applied to radios
    has created new intriguing possibilities for wireless radio researchers. This
    book is aimed to discuss the cognitive radio, software defined radio (SDR), and
    adaptive radio concepts from several aspects. Cognitive radio and cognitive networks
    will be investigated from a broad aspect of wireless communication system enhancement
    while giving special emphasis on better spectrum utilization. Applications of
    cognitive radio, SDR and cognitive radio architectures, spectrum efficiency and
    soft spectrum usage, adaptive wireless system design, measurements and awareness
    of various parameters including interference temperature and geo-location information
    are some of the important topics that will be covered in this book. Cognitive
    Radio, Software Defined Radio, and Adaptive Wireless Systems is intended to be
    both an introductory technology survey/tutorial for beginners and an advanced
    mathematical overview intended for technical professionals in the communications
    industry, technical managers, and researchers in both academia and industry. Back

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive radio techniques are
    being applied to many different communications systems. They hold promise for
    increasing utilization of radio frequencies that are underutilized today, allowing
    for improved commercial data services, and allowing for new emergency and military
    communications services. For example, these techniques are being considered by
    the U.S. FCC for communications services in unlicensed VHF and UHF TV bands. Although
    traditionally these techniques are closely associated with software-defined radios,
    many standards such as WiFi (IEEE 802.11), Zigbee (IEEE 802.15.4), and WiMAX (IEEE
    802.16) already include some degree of CR technology today. Further advances are
    occurring rapidly. IEEE 802.22 will be the first cognitive radio-based international
    standard with tangible frequency bands for its operation. Standardization is at
    the core of the current and future success of cognitive radio. Industry stakeholders
    are participating in international standards activities governing the use of cognitive
    radio techniques for dynamic spectrum access and coexistence, next-generation
    radio and spectrum management, and interoperability in infrastructure-less wireless
    networks. This article provides a review of standardization activities for cognitive
    radio technologies and comments on prospects and issues for future standardization.

    Publisher: IEEE Introduction Technology forecasts predict that cognitive radio
    (CR) will be a critical part of many future radio systems and networks. Some regulatory
    domains, such as the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States
    and of com in the United Kingdom, already are considering the use of CR technologies
    [2], [3]. A great deal of effort is pouring into cognitive radio technology and
    standards but is scattered across many activities. Several standardization organizations
    such as the Software-Defined Radio (SDR) Forum and International Telecommunications
    Union-Radio Sector (ITU-R) are working in this area [4]. This article surveys
    those activities within the IEEE. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Footnotes Abstract: In last few years, especially after release of the FCC Spectrum
    Policy Task Force (SPTF)''s seminal report in 2002, we have witnessed growing
    interest in the field of Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks. Terms such as
    reconfigurable networks, Software Defined Radios (SDRs), Cognitive Radios and
    Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have gained common use. Radio spectrum is a multidimensional
    entity; space, time, polarization, frequency, power of signal transmission and
    interference are some of the key dimensions. The static, command- and-control
    management of spectrum has led to barriers to accessing the spectrum in various
    dimensions. The notion of dynamic spectrum access can break these barriers in
    one or more of the dimensions. A review of published research in the technology,
    policy and legal facets of this broad area indicates that the community is addressing
    this problem from multitude of angles. In fact, we believe the situation is analogous
    to story of seven blind men attempting to describe an elephant based on what they
    perceive when they touch various parts of the elephant. As such, we contend that
    unless a clear taxonomy of various ways of dynamic access is developed, significant
    confusion can prevail within the community dealing with these new ways. This paper
    tries to rectify this situation. It aims to develop a clear taxonomy of various
    forms of DSA networks, describe in detail various models and identify required
    technology capabilities, architectural innovations and policy changes. Published

    Conference Location: Dublin, Ireland I. Introduction The 2002 report of the Federal
    Communications Commission (FCC)''s Spectrum Policy Task Force (SPTF) [1] represents
    a seminal document. It was bold in that it advised FCC to move away from its age-old
    “command-and-control” spectrum management to a more market-oriented, dynamic approach
    enabled by rapid innovations in radio communications technology. It rightly observed
    that spectrum scarcity was the by product of the antiquated spectrum management
    and though a large part of prime spectrum was assigned, allocated, it remained
    highly underutilized. In the face of increasing demand for wireless spectrum based
    services and lack of any new spectrum left to allocate, the task force made the
    recommendation that FCC develop a spectrum policy that allowed more and flexible
    access to spectrum. The three main recommendations that concern improvement of
    spectrum access and efficiency were: (1) Maximize flexibility of spectrum use,
    (2) Account all dimensions of spectrum use and (3) Promote efficient use of spectrum.
    The task force also made the crucial recommendation that a clear and exhaustive
    definition of spectrum rights and responsibilities was central to liberalized
    spectrum access. Another natural outcome of such liberalized access is the need
    for efficient and reliable enforcement mechanisms to ensure regulatory compliance
    of spectrum users. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References Citations

    in many countries shows sporadic and poorly utilized licensed radio spectrum due
    to the outdated exclusive spectrum access policy. Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
    technique allows cognitive (unlicensed) user (CU) to opportunistically transmit
    in a primary (licensed) user (PU) frequency band for a given time if it does not
    detect any ongoing operations. In this work, DSA is realized using cognitive radio
    (CR) technology due to its features of able to sense, learn, adapt and react according
    to the environment. The proposed design of the DSA based CR system consists of
    four main functional blocks: spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum decision
    and data transmission. The implementation is done using GNU Radio and Universal
    Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) Software Defined Radio (SDR) platform. The result
    shows a significant improvement in term of Packet Reception Rate (PRR) in DSA
    based CR systems compared to the system without DSA capability. Published in:

    Langkawi, Malaysia I. Introduction There has been tremendous demand for radio
    spectrum recently due to emerging of new wireless communication technologies and
    services. Traditional static spectrum allocation policies as practiced in many
    countries including Malaysia has resulted in spectrum scarcity as most radio bands
    are already assigned to users by the regulators. In addition, different countries
    may have different spectrum allocations, for instance, the Malaysian Communications
    and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) allocates 2.3GHz band for WiMAX, 900MHz and 1800MHz
    band for GSM and 2000MHz band for IMT2000. The complete list of spectrum allocation

    Abstract\nWith growing interest in using cognitive radio (CR) technology in wireless\
    \ communication systems for vehicles, it is\nenvisioned that future vehicles will\
    \ be CR-enabled. This paper discusses CR technologies for vehicular networks aimed\n\
    at improving vehicular communication efficiency. CR for vehicular networks has\
    \ the potential of becoming a killer CR\napplication in the future due to a huge\
    \ consumer market for vehicular communications. This paper surveys novel\napproaches\
    \ and discusses research challenges related to the use of cognitive radio technology\
    \ in vehicular ad hoc\nnetworks. We review how CR technologies such as dynamic\
    \ spectrum access, adaptive software-defined radios, and\ncooperative communications\
    \ will enhance vehicular communications and, hence, present the potential of\n\
    transforming vehicle communication in terms of efficiency and safety. Our work\
    \ is different from existing works in that\nwe provide recent advances and open\
    \ research directions on applying cognitive radio in vehicular ad hoc networks\n\
    (CR-VANETs) focusing on architecture, machine learning, cooperation, reprogrammability,\
    \ and spectrum management\nas well as QoE optimization for infotainment applications.\
    \ A taxonomy of recent advances in cognitive radio for\nvehicular networks is\
    \ also provided. In addition, several challenges and requirements have been identified.\
    \ The\nresearch on applying CR in vehicular networks is still in its early stage,\
    \ and there are not many experimental platforms\ndue to their complex setup and\
    \ requirements. Some related testbeds and research projects are provided at the\

    focus on improving road safety as well as in-vehicle enter-\ntainment. In tune\
    \ with this demand, we are witnessing\na rise in development of new applications\
    \ and services\nfor vehicular environments. Some common examples\ninclude applications\
    \ for collision avoidance, safety and\ntraffic monitoring, multimedia streaming,\

    [1], vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V), etc. Conse-\nquently, vehicular ad\
    \ hoc network (VANET) has emerged\nas a new technology that can support such emerging\n\
    vehicular applications.\nA VANET is defined as a spontaneous ad hoc network\n\
    formed over vehicles moving on the road. Such a network\ncan be formed between\

    communication in dynamic vehicular environments. IEEE\n802.11p standardizes the\
    \ communication aspects related\nto physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC).\n\
    Currently, the US Federal Communications Commis-\nsion (FCC) has allocated 75\
    \ MHz and the European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) allocated\n\
    30 MHz of spectrum in 5.9 GHz band for the deploy-\nment of Intelligent Transportation\
    \ Systems (ITS) services\n[13,14]. However, a significant rise in vehicular appli-\n\
    cations, especially in urban environments, with several\nvehicles, may lead to\
    \ overcrowding of the band and\nthereby resulting in degraded vehicular communication\n\
    efficiency for safety applications, as pointed out in [15].\nMoreover, not only\
    \ safety applications, but also growing\ndemand and usage of in-car entertainment\
    \ and infor-\nmation systems comprising bandwidth demanding mul-\ntimedia applications\
    \ (e.g., video streaming) will lead to\ncongested vehicular networks and spectrum\
    \ scarcity for\nIEEE 802.11p-based vehicular applications [15].\nIn view of this,\
    \ using cognitive radio (CR) technol-\nogy in VANETs will enable more efficient\
    \ radio spectrum\nusage and, in turn, improve vehicular communication\nefficiency.\
    \ Figure 1 illustrates a V2V scenario with cogni-\ntive radio which allows for\
    \ opportunistic spectrum usage,\nalong with the utilization of DSRC channels.\
    \ Spectrum\nutilization measurements over the years have indicated\nan inefficient\
    \ spectrum allocation and usage with many\nunused or underused licensed bands\
    \ over different space\nand time, for example, spectrum bands for TV broadcast-\n\
    ing, resulting in considerable spectrum wastage [16-20].\nConsequently, regulatory\
    \ agencies, such as FCC [21] in\nthe USA that regulates spectrum allocations,\
    \ have now\nopened the licensed bands to unlicensed/secondary user\n(SU) through\
    \ the use of CR [22-27] in order to enable\na more efficient use of the spectrum\
    \ bands. CR is an\nemerging technology to improve spectrum usage and alle-\nviate\
    \ spectrum scarcity by exploiting underused spectral\nresources through opportunistic\
    \ spectrum access.\nRadio cognition (RC) together with dynamic spectrum\naccess\
    \ (DSA) strategies present promising approaches\nthat allow unlicensed/secondary\
    \ users to opportunis-\ntically capture and use the spatio-temporally available\n\
    licensed spectrum holes as long as licensed/primary user\n(PU) are not perturbed\
    \ [25]. Though many applications\nof CR have been proposed for wireless mesh and\
    \ in ad\nhoc and cellular networks, employing CR in vehicular\n(CRV) environments\
    \ is a relatively novel research subject\nand some works in that direction have\
    \ started to appear\nrecently [28-35].\nVehicular networks and vehicular communication\
    \ can\nbenefit from opportunistic spectrum usage with CR tech-\nnology [36]. Cognitive\
    \ radio for vehicular Ad hoc Net-\nworks (CR-VANETs) is a fast-emerging application\
    \ area\nof CR technology [28]. CR-enabled vehicles can use\nadditional spectrum\
    \ opportunities in TV bands according\nto the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements\
    \ of the appli-\ncations. However, the research solutions proposed for\ngeneral-purpose\
    \ CR networks cannot be directly applied\nto CR-VANETs. This is because the unique\
    \ features of\nvehicular environment such as high mobility and cooper-\nation\
    \ opportunities need to be taken into account while\ndesigning the spectrum management\
    \ functions for CR-\nVANETs. Unlike static CR scenarios, in CR-VANETs,\nmultiple\
    \ cooperating vehicles (during busy hours) can\nFigure 1 Opportunistic spectrum\

    \ will improve the performance of\nexisting and emerging vehicular applications\
    \ such as V2V\ncommunication, entertainment and Information Systems,\nand public\
    \ safety communication.\nIn this paper, we focus on CR-VANETs. Section 2\nprovides\
    \ some background and challenges on vehicu-\nlar networks followed by an overview\
    \ of cognitive radio\ntechnology. Section 3 discusses the motivations of using\n\
    cognitive radio technology in vehicular networks. A sur-\nvey of recent advances\
    \ in CR-VANETs is provided in\nSection 4, and Section 5 describes some related\
    \ projects\nand testbeds. Finally, some open issues which need further\nattention\
    \ from the research community are discussed in\nSection 6 followed by conclusions\
    \ in Section 7.\n2\nBackground\nThis section provides some background and challenges\
    \ on\nvehicular networks followed by an overview of cognitive\nradio technology.\n\
    2.1\nVehicular communications\nModern vehicles are making inroads in the market.\
    \ These\nvehicles are not only equipped with global positioning\nsystem (GPS)\
    \ and navigation systems, but also more\nadvanced features such as environmental\
    \ awareness to\nprevent vehicle collisions, multimedia systems, and inte-\ngrated\
    \ wireless access systems to improve vehicle perfor-\nmance and user experience.\
    \ In addition, there is much\ninterest in improving the efficiency of vehicular\
    \ commu-\nnications. For this purpose, ITS aim at improving safety,\nreliability,\
    \ efficiency, and quality of transport infrastruc-\nture and vehicles through\
    \ the use of information and com-\nmunication technologies (ICT). Additionally,\
    \ ITS focus\non providing sustainable and affordable transportation by\ndesigning\
    \ advanced applications and services to optimize\ntransportation times and energy\
    \ consumption.\nITS support different communication scenarios includ-\ning all\
    \ types of communications in vehicles, between\nvehicles, as well as between vehicles\
    \ and roadside infras-\ntructure. Figure 2 shows the taxonomy of vehicular com-\n\
    munications. Vehicular communications can be classified\ninto V2V and V2I. V2I\
    \ further includes vehicle-to-\nroadside (V2R) communication and communication\
    \ using\ncellular networks. In V2V communications, a vehicu-\nlar ad hoc network\
    \ (VANET) is formed among vehicles\nfor exchanging information e.g., safety information.\
    \ In\nV2R, information is exchanged between the roadside unit\n(RSU) and the onboard\
    \ unit (OBU) of a vehicle. In V2I,\ninformation is exchanged between the RSU,\
    \ or possibly a\ncellular network, and OBU.\nFigure 2 Taxonomy of vehicular communications.\n\
    V2V communications are relatively more complex and\nchallenging as compared to\
    \ V2R and V2I communica-\ntions. The V2I communications are more to exchange\n\
    information with the centralized servers somewhere in\nthe Internet through various\
    \ access networks and tech-\nnologies. Currently, there is continuing effort by\
    \ cellular\nnetwork operators to enhance the network capacity that\nwill improve\
    \ the cellular network support for V2I com-\nmunications. The V2R communications\
    \ that are presently\ndeployed are mainly short-distance one-to-one commu-\nnications,\
    \ for example, toll collection, whereas the V2V\ncommunications are expected to\
    \ be mostly ad hoc com-\nmunications with transmission range up to several 100\n\
    m. However, currently, the V2V communications are not\nyet ad hoc-based. There\
    \ are mainly one-hop communi-\ncations for unicast and multicast. Standardization\
    \ bodies\nand researchers are working on multihop for geo-casting\nand V2V safety\
    \ applications, but there are still strong\nscalability concerns. The transmission\
    \ range commonly\nensured is 300 m in urban area and about 1 km in free\nspace.\n\
    2.1.1\nStandardization\nThe process of standardization for wireless access tech-\n\
    nology to provide connectivity in VANETs is a work in\nprogress. Older DSRC standards\
    \ were developed for V2V\nor V2R for safety and other services, such as fee collection\n\
    in toll plazas. As mentioned earlier, new DSRC is mostly\nused as a generic name\
    \ for short-range, point-to-point\ncommunication. It is also used to name the\
    \ worldwide\nchannels in the 5.9 GHz band, which are reserved for\nvehicular communications.\n\
    Currently, several standards and technologies are avail-\nable including cellular\
    \ (2G/3G/4G) technology and IEEE\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\
    \ and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 4 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    802.11p standard that can be used for high-speed\nvehicular communication. The\
    \ challenge is to make dif-\nferent technologies and standards interoperable.\
    \ Cellu-\nlar (2G/3G/4G) technology provides good coverage and\nsufficient security,\
    \ but it is relatively costly.\nThe IEEE 802.11p standard will support high-speed\n\
    vehicular communication at speeds up to 200 km/h in\n5.9 GHz band, within the\
    \ USA. It is a link layer tech-\nnology based on the former IEEE 802.11a amendment.\n\
    Today, the IEEE 802.11p amendment has been integrated\nin the new version of IEEE\
    \ 802.11 standards. It is mainly\nan adaptation to support efficient infrastructure-less\
    \ com-\nmunications (without any prior attachment). In Europe,\nthis technology\
    \ is promoted by the vehicular industry as a\nstandard for V2V communications\
    \ and thus, deployment\ncost is expected to be comparatively less because of large-\n\
    scale production. IEEE 802.11p defines MAC and PHY\noperations. IEEE also standardized\
    \ a family of IEEE 1609\nstandards for WAVE that build on top of IEEE 802.11p.\n\
    The architecture is shown in Figure 3 and it defines var-\nious functionalities\
    \ related to applications, networking,\nmanagement, communication, as well as\
    \ security. A mul-\ntichannel operation for IEEE 802.11p is also defined which\n\
    includes a control channel and six service channels. The\nmanagement plane defines\
    \ MAC layer management entity\n(MLME) and physical layer management entity (PLME)\n\
    for MAC and PHY layers, respectively. For networking,\nsome applications such\
    \ as infotainment can use TCP/IPv6\nor UDP/IPv6, whereas WAVE short message protocol\n\
    (WSMP) is additionally defined for applications which\nhave strict latency requirements,\
    \ i.e., safety applications.\nNevertheless, IEEE 1609 is not generic, as it is\
    \ based only\non IEEE 802.11p.\nThe International Standards Organization (ISO)\
    \ is\ndeveloping a generic architecture for ITS [14]. Com-\nmunication access\
    \ for land mobiles (CALM) refers to a\nfamily of standards developed at ISO TC204\
    \ Working\nGroup 16 for cooperative ITS. A simplified version of the\nITS reference\
    \ architecture [37] for CALM is shown in\nFigure 4. Today, different heterogeneous\
    \ standards exist as\na result of silo-application-driven approach. The ITS ref-\n\
    erence architecture defines a generic protocol stack which\naims at enabling convergence.\
    \ The communication media\nlayer, shown in the figure, considers various media\
    \ tech-\nnologies and standards, including cellular (GSM/GPRS,\nUMTS), older DSRC\
    \ standards, IEEE 802.11 standards,\nM5 [38] alias IEEE 802.11p, bluetooth, and\
    \ infrared.\nThe networking and transport layer considers IPv6, net-\nwork mobility\
    \ (NEMO), geo-routing, etc. The facilities\nlayer provides support for application,\
    \ information, and\nsession. A management plane and a security plane are\nconnected\
    \ to all the layers for cross-layer functionalities.\nAdditionally, some harmonization\
    \ efforts at ISO include\nthe incorporation of IEEE 802.11p and harmonization\n\
    of CALM-FAST [39,40] (used for short messages having\nreal-time constraints) with\
    \ IEEE 1609. M5 [38] refers to\nthe adaptation of IEEE 802.11p to the ISO CALM\
    \ archi-\ntecture, and G5 [41] is the adaptation of IEEE 802.11p\nto European\
    \ constraints by ETSI. Thus, IEEE 802.11p is\nsometimes referred to as IEEE 802.11p\
    \ alias M5 alias G5.\n2.1.2\nSpectrum policy and regulations\nSeveral portions\
    \ of the radio spectrum are regulated by\nthe governments or regulatory bodies\

    require spectrum availability for V2V communication sys-\ntem. Consequently, FCC\
    \ has allocated 75 MHz of radio\nspectrum at 5.9 GHz for V2V and V2I in the USA.\
    \ How-\never, due to the unavailability of a continuous spectrum of\n75 MHz in\
    \ DSRC band in Europe, Car2Car Communica-\ntion Consortium (C2C-CC), a nonprofit,\
    \ industry-driven\nEuropean organization, has proposed to allocate 2 × 10\nMHz\
    \ for primary use of safety critical applications at 5.9\nGHz range (5.875 to\
    \ 5.925 GHz). Since this band is used\nas control channel in the USA, its allocation\
    \ in Europe will\nallow for worldwide harmonization.\nRecently (since 2012), Japan\
    \ has allocated 10 MHz in\n700 MHz band for ITS because these bands are appro-\n\
    priate for vehicular communications. Radio wave trans-\nmission through obstacles\
    \ is much easier in the 700 MHz\nbands [42], whereas radio waves in 5.8 to 5.9\
    \ GHz are\ngood for short-range communications, e.g., highway toll\ncollection.\n\
    Presently, the number of wireless-enabled vehicles is\nvery low and their spectral\
    \ bandwidth requirements are\nlow as well. However, the increasing number of wireless-\n\
    enabled vehicles, vehicular communication applications,\nand high data rate traffic\
    \ flows will lead to more and more\nV2V and V2I information exchanges facilitated\
    \ by wireless\ncommunications. ITS will more and more use different\nwireless\
    \ access technologies to improve the efficiency and\nsafety of vehicular communication\
    \ and transportation. In\ngeneral, different types of ITS depend on radio services\
    \ for\ncommunication and use specially designed technologies.\nHowever, if we\
    \ consider IEEE 802.11p, then it is limited in\nterms of capacity because it is\
    \ based on IEEE 802.11a, a\nquite old version of Wi-Fi (1999).\nV2V and V2R are\
    \ mainly assured by dedicated com-\nmunication technology in the ITS frequency\
    \ bands (5.8\nto 5.9 GHz). There is recently a strong pressure on\nthese bands\
    \ since some companies (Qualcomm, Cisco,\netc.) have asked the federal agency\
    \ to release a part of\nthese bands for more general usages, for example Wi-\n\
    Fi. Consequently, in the future, these bands could be\nshared between ITS and\
    \ other applications, which may\nlead to crowding of the bands. In addition, the\
    \ grow-\ning demand for vehicular applications (V2V applications)\nwill result\
    \ in scarcity of spectrum dedicated to vehi-\ncle communications. Moreover, vehicle\
    \ communications-\nrelated specific aspects such as high mobility of the vehi-\n\
    cles and fast changes in vehicular network topologies\nadd to the challenges in\
    \ having efficient vehicular com-\nmunications (Table 1). Therefore, novel techniques\
    \ and\napproaches are required to address the problem of spec-\ntrum scarcity\
    \ in VANETs allowing an efficient use of radio\nspectrum.\nWith this view, our\
    \ paper discusses cognitive radio tech-\nnology for vehicular networks in order\
    \ to improve vehicu-\nlar communication efficiency. Cognitive radio techniques\n\
    can be used in the roadside units (RSUs) as well as the\nonboard units (OBUs)\
    \ in a vehicle. CR will enable them\nto adapt their transmissions to deal with\
    \ the fast changes\nin the radio environment. CR-enabled vehicles will also\n\
    be able to adaptively select a radio access technology,\namong many, for communicating\
    \ with different types of\nRSUs.\n2.2\nVANET challenges\nHere we describe the\
    \ unique characteristics of VANETs\nand identify some major issues. Deploying\
    \ a vehicular\nnetworking system requires addressing several challenges\nposed\
    \ by the unique characteristics and requirements of\nvehicular communications\
    \ [43].\n2.2.1\nMobility and dynamic network topology\nHigh mobility (for instance,\
    \ 100 to 200 km/h) of vehicles\nmakes the topology of VANETs very dynamic resulting\
    \ in\nvery short lived vehicular communication links. Addition-\nally, vehicular\
    \ density keeps varying from sparse to dense,\nand high mobility in sparse areas\
    \ may cause fragmentation\nproblem for VANET, which, in turn, will result in network\n\
    unreachability for some nodes. Further, high speeds can\ndeteriorate signal due\
    \ to Doppler and fast fading. These\nfactors can degrade the performance of applications\
    \ that\nTable 1 Challenges and requirements for CR-VANETs\nChallenges\nRequired\

    http://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\nhave QoS requirements in terms\
    \ of high reliability, low\nlatency, etc.\n2.2.2\nDistributed ad hoc coordination\
    \ and one-channel vs.\nmultiple-channel paradigm\nIn V2I communications, the fixed\
    \ roadside units can\nserve as coordinators. However, V2V communications are\n\
    expected to be self-organizing and to function with or\nwithout roadside assisting\
    \ units. Consequently, authors\nin [3] argue that one-channel paradigm, with a\
    \ single\nshared control channel, is a good solution for V2V com-\nmunications\
    \ in the absence of central coordination, con-\nsidering that various applications\
    \ will be broadcasting\nmessages to many neighboring vehicles. However, one-\n\
    channel paradigm comes with the problem of hidden\nterminal and poses difficult\
    \ requirements on the design\nof MAC protocol for V2V communications. Though\n\
    IEEE 802.11 carrier sense multiple access (CSMA)-based\nMAC is good for V2V communications,\
    \ its perfor-\nmance degrades in the presence of high number of\nusers.\nMoreover,\
    \ if we reach a larger number of vehicles, the\ndissemination protocols could\
    \ lead to a larger overhead.\nAdditionally, a high data traffic density may lead\
    \ to chan-\nnel congestion, e.g., in case of an accident and consequent\noutburst\
    \ of messages. Multiple-channel paradigm can be\na potential solution for such\
    \ scenarios where instant shar-\ning of message is required between vehicles and\
    \ thereby\nreducing congestion on common control channels (CCC).\nCurrently, the\
    \ approach that is in use is to let all vehi-\ncles synchronize to a global time\
    \ reference and alternate\nbetween a common control channel and separate service\n\
    channels every 100 ms. However, this approach is not\nefficient [44].\n2.2.3\n\
    Routing issues\nConventional routing protocols are not suitable for\nVANETs due\
    \ to their specific network characteristics, e.g.,\nvarying network topology and\
    \ frequent disconnections.\nSome of the VANETs’ routing algorithms can be catego-\n\
    rized as opportunistic forwarding [45], trajectory-based\nforwarding [46], and\
    \ geographic forwarding [47]. Oppor-\ntunistic forwarding algorithms (carrying\
    \ and forwarding\na message whenever given the opportunity) are useful in\nscenarios\
    \ with frequent disconnections and can be com-\nbined with other approaches that\
    \ use trajectory-based\nor geographic forwarding. Geographic forwarding algo-\n\
    rithms forward packets towards the destination as a func-\ntion of its geographical\
    \ location. This routing approach is\nscalable but not efficient for handling\
    \ dead ends and voids.\nTrajectory routing can be the most suitable message for-\n\
    warding algorithm for VANETs as it considers the road\ninfrastructure as an overlay\
    \ directed graph, with intersec-\ntions as graph nodes and roads as graph edges\
    \ allowing\nmessages to move in predefined trajectories. Moreover,\nsome recent\
    \ opportunistic approaches for delay-tolerant\napplications exploit social networking\
    \ analyses to for-\nward packets. The idea with social-based forwarding is to\n\
    forward a packet to a node which has a high chance of\nmeeting the destination\
    \ node in near future.\n2.2.4\nPrivacy, security, and safety\nPrivacy and security\
    \ issues are highly important in\nVANETs due to potential threats to traffic flow\
    \ and human\nlives by any malicious attempt, for example, fake messages\nleading\
    \ to traffic disruption and fatal accidents. Some of\nthe security and privacy\
    \ issues related to ITS have been\ndiscussed in [48-50].\nSecurity protocols for\
    \ vehicular networks should take\ninto account their specific characteristics\
    \ such as high\nmobility and requirements such as trust (vehicles should\nbe able\
    \ to trust the received messages), resiliency (for\ninterference), and efficiency\
    \ (e.g., ability to authenti-\ncate message in real time). In addition, privacy\
    \ concerns\ninclude preserving anonymity so as to prevent tracking or\nidentification\
    \ of vehicle for non-trusted parties based on\nvehicular communication [43]. Nevertheless,\
    \ such secu-\nrity mechanisms generally come at the cost of degraded\ncommunication\
    \ performance [51].\n2.3\nCognitive radio and software-defined radio\nWith the\
    \ increasing demand for spectral efficiency, cog-\nnitive radio has emerged as\
    \ a very active research area\nfor wireless communications and networks’ research\
    \ com-\nmunity in recent years. CR [26] is an emerging tech-\nnology that enhances\
    \ the performance of existing radio\nby integrating artificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ with software-\ndefined radios (SDRs). Unlike conventional radios in\nwhich\
    \ most of the components are implemented in\nthe hardware, SDRs [24] are radios\
    \ that use software\nimplementations for some functionalities enabling flex-\n\
    ible radio operation. These radios are reconfigurable,\nand hence the need to\
    \ modify existing hardware is\nreduced.\nThough several definitions have been\
    \ provided to\ndescribe CR, the commonly used definitions in liter-\nature are\
    \ given by Joseph Mitola and Simon Haykin.\nJoseph Mitola described CRs [22-24]\
    \ as intelligent radios\nthat can autonomously make decisions using gathered\n\
    information about the radio frequency (RF) environ-\nment through model-based\
    \ reasoning and can also learn\nand plan according to their past experience. Afterwards,\n\
    Simon Haykin defined CR as an intelligent wireless com-\nmunication system capable\
    \ of being aware of its envi-\nronment, learning, and adaptively changing its\
    \ operating\nparameters in real time for providing reliable commu-\nnication and\
    \ efficient utilization of the radio spectrum\n[25].\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal\
    \ on Wireless Communications and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 7 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    As mentioned previously, a cognitive radio can be built\non software-defined radio\
    \ (SDR) that makes it reconfig-\nurable by converging the two key technologies:\
    \ software-\ndefined radio and artificial intelligence [52-57]. While\nthe field\
    \ of CR is independent from SDR, CR has its\norigin in SDR as an enabling technology\
    \ to support its\nimplementation.\nIn the context of VANETs, with increasing number\
    \ of\nvehicles equipped with wireless communication systems,\nvehicular communication\
    \ will require faster connectivity\nand thus, wireless spectrum will have to be\
    \ adapted to the\nnew requirements (of bandwidth). Using CR and SDR will\nprevent\
    \ the need to implement hardware upgrades with\nemergence of new protocols in\
    \ future. SDR enables ‘recon-\nfigurable systems’ for wireless networks. CR allows\
    \ SDR\nto determine which mode of operation and parameters to\nuse. In general,\
    \ CR and SDR will allow CR-enabled vehi-\ncles to search for the best frequency-based\
    \ predetermined\nparameters.\n2.3.1\nCognition cycle\nHere we first describe the\
    \ two main features of CR: cog-\nnitive capability and reconfigurability. Then,\
    \ we briefly\ndiscuss the concept of cognition cycle of CR as well as\nsome specifics\
    \ related to CR-VANETs.\nA CR-enabled device adapts its operational parame-\n\
    ters as a function of its environment [18]. CR com-\nponents are mainly radio,\
    \ sensor, knowledge database,\nlearning engine, optimization tools, and a reasoning\n\
    engine. CR has cognitive as well as reconfigurability capa-\nbilities [25,26,58].\
    \ Cognitive capability allows CR to sense\nand gather information (e.g., different\
    \ signals and their\nmodulation types, noise, transmission power, etc.) from\n\
    its environment and, for example, secondary users can\nidentify the best available\
    \ spectrum. The reconfigurability\nfeatures of CR allow it to optimally adapt\
    \ the operational\nparameters as a function of the sensed information. CR\nsystems\
    \ involve PU and SU of the spectrum; primary\nusers are license holders, while\
    \ secondary users seek to\nopportunistically use the spectrum through CR when\
    \ the\nprimary users are idle.\nThe cognition cycle of CR consists of multiple\
    \ phases:\nObserve, Analyze, Reason, and Act. The goal is to\ndetect available\
    \ spectrum, select the best spectrum, select\nthe best operational parameters,\
    \ coordinate the spec-\ntrum access with other users, reconfigure the operational\n\
    parameters, and vacate the frequency when a primary user\nappears.\nA spectrum\
    \ hole refers to a portion of spectrum not\nbeing used by the primary/licensed\
    \ user at a particular\nplace and time. It is detected through spectrum sens-\n\
    ing and signal detection techniques. The SUs oppor-\ntunistically access the spectrum\
    \ if the sensed portion of\nspectrum is found empty. The secondary user can oppor-\n\
    tunistically use different spectrum bands by adaptive\nspectrum switching through\
    \ spectrum hand-offs. How-\never, the secondary user is responsible to detect\
    \ arrival\nof any primary user. If a primary user is detected, then\nit should\
    \ vacate the licensed portion of the spectrum in\norder to prevent interference.\n\

    \ stages: Observe, Analysis, Rea-\nsoning, and Act with some customized functionalities\
    \ for\nvehicular networks. The Observe stage consists of sensing\nas well as the\
    \ consideration of location, policies, and appli-\ncation QoS needs. In the Analysis\

    \ the radio environment are\nanalyzed, similarities from the past are considered,\
    \ and\noptimal parameters as well as optimal spectrum strategies\nare determined.\
    \ The reconfiguration and optimal adapta-\ntion is finally done in the Act stage.\n\
    The CR-VANETs cognition cycle has a lot of similarities\nwith that of CR, but\
    \ some differences are due to the nature\nof high-mobility vehicular environment.\
    \ Most of the vehi-\ncles will be equipped with navigational systems, and hence\n\
    location as well as mobility prediction based on the cur-\nrent direction of movement\
    \ can be used for cognition. The\nuse of knowledge database becomes more relevant\
    \ as a\nvehicle may pass through the same location at approxi-\nmately the same\
    \ time of the day. Thus, past experiences\ncan be combined with the current location\
    \ for optimiz-\ning the operational parameters. Finally, it should be noted\n\
    that the requirements for CR-VANETs are more strict in\nterms of faster adaptability\
    \ and faster running time of the\ncognition cycle due to the dynamic nature of\
    \ the vehicular\nenvironment.\n3\nMotivations for CR-VANETs\nCurrently, high-speed\
    \ modern vehicles and a large num-\nber of cars move on the road every day. ITS\
    \ [13] aim to\ndevelop advanced applications for improving safety and\nefficiency\
    \ of road infrastructure and transportation. This\nwill enable users to utilize\
    \ transport networks in a smarter\nand safer way.\nPresently, the primary objective\
    \ of vehicle industry is to\nimprove the traveling experience of users by enhancing\n\
    vehicular communication capabilities with better safety\nand efficiency, as well\
    \ as Internet access and infotainment\napplications.\nThe number of vehicles on\
    \ road is always increas-\ning as well as the demand for intervehicle commu-\n\
    nications. However, ITS and vehicle communications\nneed to overcome several technical\
    \ challenges. Proto-\ncols and applications designed for vehicular communica-\n\
    tions should consider various important factors such as\ncommunication infrastructure,\
    \ road infrastructure, vehi-\ncle density, user demands and types of vehicular\
    \ networks,\nas well as available wireless spectrum. Many envisioned\napplications\
    \ will need uninterrupted and reliable connec-\ntivity and this can be challenging\
    \ in high-speed vehicular\nscenarios. New protocols are needed that can deal with\n\
    rapidly changing environment and are fault tolerant espe-\ncially for applications\
    \ related to safety. Overall require-\nments for such applications are QoS support,\
    \ adaptability\nto fast changing environment, robustness, and additional\nbandwidth\
    \ to deal with congestion and high bandwidth\nrequirements of some applications\
    \ such as video stream-\ning. We argue that the cognitive radio technology can\
    \ help\nin answering some requirements, and the motivations\nleading to CR-VANETs\
    \ are provided in the remaining part\nof this section.\n3.1\nQoS requirements\n\
    QoS support is important for applications such as related\nto safety. From the\
    \ point of view of radio technology, satis-\nfying QoS guarantees is easier when\
    \ there is enough band-\nwidth, which can be traded with QoS guarantees such as\n\
    low delay or high reliability. Additionally, there should be\nmechanisms to protect\
    \ important flows from lower prior-\nity flows. We discuss the issues related\
    \ to bandwidth and\nflow priority in the following text.\n3.1.1\nBandwidth scarcity\
    \ and congestion\nWireless communication is popular as ever and the\ndemand for\
    \ more bandwidth and spectrum is ever\nincreasing. In addition, applications like\
    \ video stream-\ning are becoming popular, which, in turn, consume high\nbandwidth\
    \ and can cause congestion. Similar problems\nof bandwidth scarcity and congestion\
    \ will impact vehic-\nular communications with growing demands. Recently,\nmany\
    \ car manufactures have started to provide connec-\ntivity features in their cars\
    \ enabling Internet connectivity\nthrough cellular networks (that provide mobile\
    \ voice and\ndata connections) and other wireless access technologies\nfor accessing\
    \ various applications. However, the perfor-\nmance of cellular networks suffers\
    \ in urban areas (large\ncities) due to congestion of cellular spectrum while\
    \ in\nrural areas, cellular coverage is either absent or low. More-\nover, as\
    \ mentioned previously, for dedicated communi-\ncation, ITS are based on IEEE\
    \ 802.11p, which is based\non an old version of Wi-Fi, namely, IEEE 802.11a, and\n\
    thus, it has limited capacity. Presently, there is a lack of\napplications for\
    \ intervehicle communications, which will\nchange in the future. Car manufacturers\
    \ look unlikely to\nbuy spectrum. Additionally, note that spectrum is a scarce\n\
    natural resource and should be used efficiently. Thus,\nopportunistic spectrum\
    \ access is an attractive solution.\n3.1.2\nOffloading lower priority flows\n\
    Many applications are envisioned for VANETs such as\ninfotainment. Some of these\
    \ video applications, for exam-\nple, peer-to-peer (P2P) video sharing and multimedia\n\
    advertisements can consume a lot of bandwidth and can\ncause collision with other\
    \ flows. One idea is to use the\nmain 802.11p spectrum for important flows and\
    \ use addi-\ntional bandwidth available with cognitive radio, oppor-\ntunistic\
    \ spectrum (see Figure 1) for lower priority video\nflows, and P2P traffic.\n\
    3.2\nResiliency\nThe flexibility and agility offered by cognitive radio is very\n\
    useful for resilient communications in vehicular scenarios.\nSingh et al. EURASIP\
    \ Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 9 of 22\n\
    http://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\nIn case of emergency situations,\
    \ CR can be reconfigured\nin real time to operate in emergency mode by focusing\
    \ on\nminimizing bit error rate (BER) and avoiding interference\n[59]. This property\
    \ is very useful for ITS safety applica-\ntions, and with CR functionalities,\
    \ some objectives like\nbandwidth maximization or power minimization can be\n\
    flexibly traded for more resiliency.\n3.3\nMore spectrum holes on highway\nIn\
    \ many cases, highways are open spaces and there is\na high chance of finding\
    \ a spectrum hole that can be\naccessed opportunistically. This is unlike downtown\
    \ and\nurban areas where chances of finding spectrum holes\ncan be low due to\
    \ high population. In fact, some exper-\niments have been done [29] which show\
    \ free abundant\nspectrum available for opportunistic use on highways.\nThus,\
    \ cognitive radio technology is very attractive as it\ncan exploit such spectrum\
    \ availability using opportunis-\ntic spectrum access. This, in turn, can answer\
    \ some of the\nbandwidth and congestion problems discussed above.\n3.4\nSufficient\
    \ space and power supply in vehicles\nSome of the advanced cognitive radio capabilities\
    \ come\nat a price in terms of bigger size of onboard units. Some\nfunctionalities\
    \ can also consume energy. However, vehi-\ncles have sufficient space and power\
    \ supply and are not\nlimited by them unlike the case with smart phones and\n\
    other highly portable devices. Cost can still be a fac-\ntor, but performance\
    \ vs. cost trade-off can be exploited.\nCost can also be reduced with the help\
    \ of mass produc-\ntion, by optimally designing an OBU with cognitive radio\n\
    capabilities.\n3.5\nReprogrammable vehicular telematics\nEvery 2 to 3 years, a\
    \ new communication standard is being\nproposed, such as DVB-H, DVB-T2, WiMaX,\
    \ 802.11p,\nLTE, and HSDPA. Some of these standards face the risk\nof becoming\
    \ a commercial failure such as was the case\nwith DVB-H. Moreover, different countries\
    \ have different\nregulations related to spectrum usages, transmit power\nlimits,\
    \ etc. Thus, global manufacturers of vehicles face\na dilemma on which technology\
    \ to deploy and how to\ndeploy different versions of communication units for dif-\n\
    ferent countries. A vehicle has a life cycle of more than\n15 years, and onboard\
    \ communicating devices should\nnot become obsolete during that period. Moreover,\
    \ the\ndrivers as well as passengers would like to use the newer\ntechnologies\
    \ that come out in the future.\nCognitive radio combined with SDR offers a solution\
    \ to\ncope with evolving and numerous technologies. Reconfig-\nurable and reprogrammable\
    \ capabilities of CR and SDR\nprovide the possibilities to design ‘future proof’\
    \ onboard\nunits that are upgradeable with software updates. This\nallows flexibility\
    \ in deploying different versions of units\nfor different countries and allows\
    \ upgradeability when\nnew technologies come out in future.\nAn OBU can integrate\
    \ an SDR transceiver with navi-\ngational devices (GPS) and onboard computer to\
    \ provide\ncapabilities of context awareness and adaptation.\n3.6\nHighly mobile\
    \ environment\nDeploying base stations to provide wireless services (e.g.,\nInternet\
    \ access) in vehicular networks is challenging due\nto the highly mobile environment.\
    \ VANETs are con-\nsidered as a special case of mobile ad hoc networks\n(MANETs)\
    \ due to their specific characteristics such as\nspecial mobility pattern, varying\
    \ vehicle density, and inter-\nference with other types of networks.\nSeveral\
    \ applications\nof\nVANETs\nhave\nbeen\npro-\nposed that take into account the\
    \ above-mentioned\nconstraints of vehicular communication. As described\nbefore,\
    \ different communication technologies have been\nstandardized (WAVE, IEEE 802.11p,\
    \ etc.) for vehicular\ncommunications. However, presently, the deployment and\n\
    performance evaluation of the proposed standards, espe-\ncially in a large-scale\
    \ vehicular environment, are works\nin progress. Moreover, different standards\
    \ and proto-\ncols proposed for vehicular communication applications\nshould be\
    \ interoperable. Additionally, short-range com-\nmunication protocols may not\
    \ be able to provide good\nInternet connectivity for high-speed vehicles and that\n\
    would require developing new efficient protocols suitable\nfor them.\n4\nRecent\
    \ advances in CR-VANETs\nCognitive radio technology [36] presents a promising\n\
    solution for addressing the problem of spectrum scarcity.\nVehicle communication\
    \ may benefit from cognitive radio\ntechnologies such as dynamic spectrum access,\
    \ adap-\ntive software-defined radios, and cooperative communi-\ncations as shown\
    \ in [60-62]. CR-enabled VANETs can use\nadditional spectrum opportunities in\
    \ TV bands according\nto the QoS requests of the applications.\nExisting works\
    \ on CR [36,58] focus on various issues\nthat include investigating techniques\
    \ for spectrum sensing\nand spectrum access (dynamic spectrum access), coop-\n\
    erative communications, MAC protocols [63], routing\nprotocols, QoS [64], and\
    \ software-defined radios. While\nseveral studies exist in literature on applying\
    \ CR to wire-\nless mesh networks, ad hoc networks, and cellular net-\nworks,\
    \ the research on applying CR to VANETs is still\nin its early stage. The research\
    \ solutions proposed for\ngeneral-purpose CR networks cannot be directly applied\n\
    to CR-VANETs as the unique features of vehicular envi-\nronment, such as the role\
    \ of mobility, and the coop-\neration opportunities need to be taken into account\n\
    while designing the spectrum management functions for\nCR-VANETs. Thus, the existing\
    \ solutions need to be\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\
    \ and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 10 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    customized for CR-VANETs to account for high mobility,\ndynamic topologies, frequent\
    \ disconnections, etc. Unlike\nstatic CR scenarios, in CR-VANETs, multiple cooperating\n\
    vehicles (during busy hours) can exchange spectrum infor-\nmation to get information\
    \ on the spectrum availability.\nMoreover, this enables adaptive operations and\
    \ proactive\nresponse feasible for the vehicles that follow.\nIn this section,\
    \ we present some of the recent works that\nfocus on using cognitive radio technology\
    \ for vehicular\nnetworks. We provide a taxonomy of recent advances in\nCR-VANETs,\
    \ in Figure 6. Different approaches are clas-\nsified into spectrum sensing, spectrum\
    \ management and\nQoS, and network. These approaches as well as their\nsub-categories\
    \ related to cooperative sensing, sensing in\nfast varying channels centralized\
    \ to distributed spectrum\nmanagement approaches, routing, mobility management,\n\
    content distribution, etc. are discussed in the following\ntext.\n4.1\nArchitecture\n\
    The network architecture of CR-VANETs consists of vehi-\ncles with onboard units\
    \ (OBUs) and infrastructure units\nsuch as RSUs and base stations of network providers.\
    \ Note\nthat setting up of roadside units everywhere may be costly;\nthus, V2V\
    \ communication, including multihop, should be\nable to work without any infrastructure\
    \ support.\nSeveral functionalities are needed for CR-VANETs\nparadigm, and an\
    \ initial architecture related to different\nfunctionality blocks and protocols\
    \ is proposed in [65].\nThe architecture proposed by its authors consists of sev-\n\
    eral blocks related to policies such as those imposed by\nFCC and local authorities\
    \ and onboard sensors, includ-\ning radio sensors and GPS. It also includes a\
    \ knowledge\ndatabase that consists of previously learned cases, rules,\nspectrum\
    \ information, and radio maps. Further, it consists\nof a cognitive engine that\
    \ is the core of all functionalities.\nAdditionally, there are software-defined\
    \ radio or multiple\nradios, performance measurement block for feedback, and\n\
    finally a user interface to allow users to configure the sys-\ntem offline. Figure\
    \ 7 illustrates the architecture showing\nthese different functional blocks for\
    \ CR-VANETs.\nAs illustrated in the figure, the cognitive engine (CE)\nuses real-time\
    \ data from onboard sensors and history and\nmap information from knowledge database\
    \ to learn from\nthe present as well as the past. It then controls the oper-\n\
    ation of software-defined radio through optimization of\ntransmission parameters\
    \ and decision making related to\nspectrum use and management.\nA taxonomy of\
    \ machine learning approaches for CE is\nprovided in Figure 8. The classification\
    \ is done in terms\nof supervised learning, decision making and parameter\ntuning.\
    \ Supervised learning can be used for prediction\nor classification, by learning\
    \ the mapping between the\ngiven inputs and outputs. It is called supervised learn-\n\
    ing because the outputs for the given inputs are known\nbeforehand. For example,\
    \ in the case of signal identifica-\ntion, the target signal and the input signal\
    \ features are\nknown during the learning phase. Decision making is\nrelated to\
    \ the problem of making optimal decisions. Some\navailable tools for decision\
    \ making use reinforcement\nlearning, which can be used in unknown environments,\n\
    or case-based reasoning based on history, etc. Parameter\nCR-VANETs\nSpectrum\n\

    Figure 7 CR-VANETs functional blocks (architecture).\ntuning is needed to set\
    \ the parameters optimally. A sys-\ntem model is used, and some metaheuristics\
    \ can be used\nto find the optimal values of the system parameters for\na given\

    \ as maximization of bandwidth\nvs. minimization of bit error rate, can be assigned\

    ideas for applying machine learning to CR-VANETs are\ndiscussed in [61]. We summarize\

    \ transports, such as\nbuses and trains but also for cars considering that peo-\n\
    ple commute everyday from their homes to offices, at\napproximately the same time.\
    \ With case-based reason-\ning, the optimization process can be populated from\
    \ the\npreviously found optimal configurations, and then fur-\nther search for\
    \ optimization can start from there. This\ncan highly improve the convergence\
    \ time of optimiza-\ntion algorithms such as genetic algorithms and simulated\n\
    annealing, which in turn can be used for optimizing trans-\nmission parameters.\n\
    Machine learning tools for classification such as sup-\nport vector machines and\
    \ neural networks are interesting\nfor signal identification and discovery of\
    \ spectrum holes.\nWith cognitive radio, it is required that the opportunis-\n\
    tic use of spectrum should not collide with primary user\ntraffic. Thus, classification\
    \ tools can be used to enhance\nthe detection of primary user signals and can\
    \ provide\nimproved accuracy as compared to just using energy\ndetection. This\
    \ improved primary user detection accuracy\nis desired especially in VANETs scenarios,\
    \ where high-\nmobility conditions leading to signal fading can cause\ndifficulties\
    \ in spectrum hole detection. Neural networks\ncan also be used as function approximators\
    \ to predict\nthroughput at a given location on a particular time of\nthe day.\
    \ Different inputs such as PU and SU traffic statis-\ntics can be mapped to predict\
    \ throughput through trained\nneural networks [61]. Some online learning tools\
    \ like\nreinforcement learning can be used. Such tools are use-\nful in unknown\
    \ environments and are useful for channel\nselection and decision making.\n4.2\n\
    Spectrum sensing\nSpectrum sensing is required by cognitive radio to detect\n\
    the presence of spectrum holes and more importantly to\ndetect the presence of\
    \ PUs. The priority is to avoid inter-\nference with PUs and thus, spectrum sensing\
    \ should be\nhighly reliable.\nHigh mobility in VANETs can deteriorate the perfor-\n\
    mance of spectrum sensing due to signal fading and fast\nchanging location. In\
    \ the case of fast varying channels\nover time, some works focus on improving\
    \ the perfor-\nmance of sensing [66] and signal identification [67-69].\nSimilarly\
    \ improved algorithms have been proposed for\nchannel estimation and equalization\
    \ [70] in high-speed\nenvironments.\nAdditionally, cooperative spectrum sensing\
    \ [71] can be\nused to tackle the problems due to high mobility. Sev-\neral spectrum\
    \ sensing vehicles combined with a regularly\nupdated central spectrum database\
    \ can improve the per-\nformance of spectrum sensing in VANETs scenarios. The\n\
    work in [72] investigates the effect of mobility on the\nperformance of spectrum\
    \ sensing in CR networks. The\nstudy confirms that cooperation can improve the\
    \ spec-\ntrum sensing performance as a result of increased spatial-\ntemporal\
    \ diversity in received primary signal strengths.\nThis forms the basis of their\
    \ proposed sensing technique\nthat finds an optimal combination of the number\
    \ of sen-\nsors for cooperation and the number of times to sense\nthe spectrum\
    \ in order to reduce the sensing overhead.\nThis work does not specifically target\
    \ CR-VANETs sce-\nnario, but it is still interesting for that. Additional works\n\
    such as [31,34,73] aim to achieve better spectrum sensing\nprecision and efficiency\
    \ through a coordinated spectrum\nsensing. The data sensed by the vehicles is\
    \ sent to RSUs\nthat forward the gathered data further to a central pro-\ncessing\
    \ unit. The delay and reliability of spectrum sensing\nin vehicular environments\
    \ is discussed in [74]. They argue\nthat cooperative spectrum sensing can be used\
    \ to tackle\nthe sensing limitations of a single vehicle as it exploits spa-\n\
    tial diversity. They show that sensing time can be reduced\nsignificantly with\
    \ cooperative sensing as compared to\nsensing by only a single vehicle.\nThe authors\
    \ of [75] point out that cooperative sensing\ncan help a vehicle to detect the\
    \ spectrum availability in\nfuture locations by exploiting sensing information\
    \ from\nother cooperating vehicles. An experimental study on\nsensing performance\
    \ in VANETs scenario is conducted\nin [30]. They found that sensing accuracy depends\
    \ on\nvehicular speed as well as location. For example, in the\nareas with open\
    \ space, the fast fading is not high and\nhence, sensing performance is good unlike\
    \ at places such\nas downtown. They also propose a framework for coop-\nerative\
    \ spectrum sensing and sharing called Cognitive\nV2V (Cog-V2V). In Cog-V2V, each\
    \ vehicle keeps a spec-\ntrum availability database that is regularly updated.\
    \ Note\nthat using such knowledge database, shared by different\nvehicles or kept\
    \ distributed among them, is an inter-\nesting way of collaborating for spectrum\
    \ sensing. The\ndata from different cooperating vehicles is merged using\nweights\
    \ that depend on distance between the locations\nat which sensing samples were\
    \ collected. Intuitively, they\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\
    \ and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 13 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    calculate weights such that weights from nearby vehi-\ncles are weighed lower\
    \ as they are likely to have similar\nradio conditions due to their similar location.\
    \ After the\nspectrum opportunities are detected, Cog-V2V decides\nthe channel\
    \ to be used between the two vehicles.\nAnother work [76] uses spectrum database\
    \ as well as\nsupport from infrastructure. They also provide guidelines\nfor the\
    \ uniform placement of RSUs that will provide infor-\nmation about the availability\
    \ of TV channels and thereby\nsupport the mobile CR-enabled vehicles. Systems\
    \ using\ncentralized approaches and RSUs can be effective, specif-\nically for\
    \ safety applications as it improves their reliability\nby improving data delivery\
    \ in vehicular networks.\nHowever, the centralized approach is not apt to sup-\n\
    port multihop communication, especially in the absence\nof infrastructure support.\
    \ Nonetheless, in the absence of\ncentral infrastructure, clustering techniques\
    \ can be used\nto create cluster leaders among several vehicles. Cluster\nleaders\
    \ can then assume the role of central entities respon-\nsible for coordinating\
    \ spectrum sensing and data fusion as\nused in [35].\nIn [77], a different type\
    \ of sensing is used that focuses on\nestimating the amount of congestion in a\
    \ given channel.\nThe authors address the problem of insufficient spectrum\nfor\
    \ reliable exchange of safety information over congested\nurban scenarios through\
    \ the use of cooperative spectrum\nsensing provided by vehicles. The spectrum\
    \ sensing pro-\nvided by vehicles is used to provide a distributed measure\nof\
    \ contention on the roads and locate white channels in\nthe industrial, scientific,\
    \ and medical (ISM) bands. If con-\ntention is detected, free channels from the\
    \ ISM spectrum\nare allocated to the vehicles. Note that some of these\nworks\
    \ are also discussed in the next section in the context\nof spectrum management.\n\
    4.3\nSpectrum management and QoS support\nOne of the main focuses of research\
    \ in CR-VANETs is to\ndesign specific spectrum management techniques which\ntake\
    \ into account spectrum sensing and access as well as\nmobility for CR-enabled\
    \ vehicles. Spectrum management\nshould also aim at providing QoS support in CR-VANETs\n\
    scenario. QoS guarantees are important for messages and\nsignals related to vehicular\
    \ safety. QoS guarantees can\nbe in terms of maximum permitted delay and reliability\n\
    in terms of permitted packet loss, etc. For example, in\nthe event of an emergency\
    \ brake, the vehicles that follow\nshould be notified as quickly as possible in\
    \ order to leave\nsome time for other drivers to react.\nHowever, providing such\
    \ QoS guarantees can be dif-\nficult in case of congestion or when there are several\n\
    vehicles. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the feasibility of\nusing TV white space\
    \ for vehicular communications is\nrestricted due to the scarcity of TV white\
    \ space in large\nurban cities, where the average number of vehicles is also\n\
    higher as compared to the remote areas. Such factors\ncan make it difficult to\
    \ ensure QoS support for some\nimportant applications.\nTaking the example of\
    \ safety messages, authors in [77]\nargue that the bandwidth of a single DSRC\
    \ control channel\nmay not be enough for reliable delivery of safety messages\n\
    during congestion. They propose to use cognitive radio\nto augment the spectrum\
    \ of the control channel. They\nproposed to use TV white space (TVWS) spectrum\
    \ to\nenhance the bandwidth of the control channel [15] and in\na follow-up work\
    \ [77], 5.8 GHz ISM band is used instead\nof TVWS, as 5.8 GHz ISM band is the\
    \ neighboring band to\nthe DSRC 5.9 GHz band and it can simplify the transceiver\n\
    design. They argue that Wi-Fi users, who use 5.8 GHz ISM\nband, are unlikely to\
    \ be present on highways.\nIn order to counter congestion problems, authors in\
    \ [77]\nfirst propose a contention metric Cr(t) to estimate the\namount of congestion\
    \ in different regions r, at time t:\nCr(t) = α Dr × Br\nSr\n+ βUr.\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ the delay Dr is the delay experienced by the trans-\nmitted packet and it increases\
    \ during congestion. The\nparameter Br is the channel’s bitrate, Sr is the average\n\
    packet size, and Ur is the number of untransmitted pack-\nets due to congestion.\
    \ The parameters α and β are tuning\nparameters, which are estimated from curve\
    \ fitting of sim-\nulation data. Different scenarios were simulated to obtain\n\
    such data by varying the number of vehicles, payload sizes,\nand bitrates.\nDifferent\
    \ vehicles perform sensing and report the mea-\nsurements to their nearest RSU.\
    \ RSUs communicate with\nother RSUs and vehicles to form an estimate of conges-\n\
    tion in different zones. Based on congestion estimates, a\nfuzzy-logic-based controller\
    \ is used to decide the amount\nof spectrum needed, and RSUs allocate more spectrum\
    \ to\nthe vehicles traveling in a zone with increased congestion.\nThe idea is\
    \ that the spectrum is a scarce resource and\nadditional spectrum is allocated\
    \ only when needed. Addi-\ntionally, the proposed contention metric looks interesting\n\
    and it will be interesting to see how it can be used in\nother 802.11-like scenarios.\
    \ Another interesting research\ndirection is to explore improved contention metrics.\n\
    Several interesting ideas related to dynamic spectrum\naccess in CR-VANETs are\
    \ explored in [44]. They call\nthe dynamic spectrum allocation problem for VANETs\n\
    as vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA). Sev-\neral VDSA approaches covering\
    \ spectrum measure-\nments and machine learning are proposed; for example,\nreinforcement\
    \ learning is used for intelligent channel\nselection (also presented in [65]).\
    \ Moreover, a testbed\nimplementation with some experimental results is also\n\
    provided. A feasibility analysis is done for VDSA using\nqueuing theory. Different\
    \ TVWS bands are considered as\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\
    \ and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 14 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    servers which are either occupied by PUs or not. Taking\nthe case of V2I communication,\
    \ the requests to access\nthose channels from SU vehicles are modeled as clients\n\
    arriving in a queue and these requests stay in the queue\nuntil they are served.\
    \ Thus, with this formulation, the\nqueuing theory results can be used to analyze\
    \ VDSA sce-\nnario. However, it is pointed out in [78] that such model\ncan be\
    \ over optimistic because vehicles can move out of\nRSU range. Thus, vehicular\
    \ dynamics need to be taken\ninto account and an analysis considering such dynamics\
    \ is\nproposed in [78].\nAdditional works such as in [30,31] propose to first\n\
    detect the available spectrum resources, then according to\nthe QoS requirements\
    \ of the vehicular applications, spec-\ntrum decision algorithms select the channel\
    \ to be used at\na specific location. Finally, note that even if vehicles have\n\
    sufficient power supply, the energy consumption is still an\nimportant factor\
    \ for environmental considerations [79].\nAn energy-efficient technique is proposed\
    \ in [79] by for-\nmulating the problem of deciding whether to use direct\ntransmission\
    \ or relay-based transmission as an optimiza-\ntion problem, with the objective\
    \ of minimizing energy\nsubject to QoS constraints in terms of delay.\nMost of\
    \ the above approaches assume a centralized\narchitecture where decisions can\
    \ be taken in a central\nmanner. However, this may not be always possible in\n\
    the case of CR-VANETs. Thus, in [35] the authors focus\non a clustering strategy\
    \ as illustrated in Figure 9 where\nvehicles are grouped into clusters and one\
    \ of the vehi-\ncles act as a cluster leader making central decisions for\nthe\
    \ cluster. It can be seen as a hybrid of distributed and\ncentralized approaches.\
    \ The authors study the problem\nof optimal channel access to provide QoS for\
    \ data trans-\nmission in CR-VANETs. The data from cluster members\nis first transmitted\
    \ to the cluster leader and then it is\nforwarded to its destination.\nThe problem\
    \ is to opportunistically use available chan-\nnels using CR, optimally reserve\
    \ some bandwidth in\nDSRC channels, and control the size of the vehicular\ncluster.\
    \ The authors use constrained Markov decision pro-\ncess (MDP) for decision making.\
    \ The vehicles use two\nradios: one for opportunistic spectrum access and the\n\
    other for DSRC channel. Vehicles send a request to join\na given cluster using\
    \ DSRC channel. The cluster head\ntakes the decision of whether the new node should\
    \ be\nadded to the cluster or not. The cluster head also opti-\nmally reserves\
    \ some bandwidth in the DSRC channel.\nFor opportunistic spectrum access, the\
    \ cluster head col-\nlects the sensing results from cluster members and then\n\
    the scheduling decision is broadcasted to the cluster. The\nauthors point out\
    \ that there are two different time scales\ninvolved in decision making: opportunistic\
    \ channel access\n(fast) and cluster size control with DSRC bandwidth reser-\n\
    vation (relatively slow). Thus, a hierarchical MDP with\ntwo levels with each\
    \ level corresponding to each prob-\nlem is used. These two levels interact with\
    \ each other\nusing the following parameters: QoS performance mea-\nsures, location,\
    \ cluster size, and available bandwidth in\nDSRC channel. The optimization problem\
    \ is solved using\nlinear programming, and different statistics and variables\n\
    are assumed to be available in advance. Thus, one inter-\nesting extension of\
    \ this work could be to explore online\nlearning.\nSome distributed spectrum management\
    \ schemes exist\nfor ad hoc CR networks that focus on MAC design [63] as\nwell\
    \ as QoS [64]. Such proposals may be customized for\nCR-VANETs. The distributed\
    \ opportunistic multiChannel\nMAC (OMC-MAC) proposal in [64] assumes a fixed\n\
    CCC, transmits beacons at regular intervals for syn-\nchronization, and divides\
    \ the beacon interval into three\nphases: channel sensing, contention, and data\
    \ transmis-\nsion. SUs sense the channel in the first phase and then\nFigure 9\

    \ for reservations of time slots belong-\ning to data transmission phase. Data\
    \ transmission phase is\nthen used for contention-free transmission of data based\n\
    on the reservations on different available channels. QoS\nprovisioning is done\
    \ by first letting only the prioritized\nusers contend for the reservations and\
    \ if some time slots\nare left, then other users can also make some reserva-\n\
    tions. This can be useful for prioritizing safety messages\nin CR-VANETs. However,\
    \ the impact of vehicular mobil-\nity and short-lived links needs to be studied\
    \ for such\nschemes. The common control channel may also get\ncongested when there\
    \ are many vehicles. The discovery\nprocess of available channels, during the\
    \ sensing phase,\ncan be improved by using a common spectrum database,\nas explained\
    \ in Section 4.2. Adaptive bitrate as well as\nbeacon interval can be explored\
    \ to further improve the\nperformance.\n4.4\nNetwork layer: routing, mobility\
    \ management, and\ncontent distribution\nIn this section, we discuss the works\
    \ on CR-VANETs that\nare related to upper layers. We mainly focus on network\n\
    layer but also talk about P2P approaches that work on top\nof an overlay network.\n\
    4.4.1\nRouting\nSeveral cognitive routing schemes have been proposed\nfor CR-VANETs,\
    \ accounting for spectrum scarcity, inter-\nference, and high mobility. Some important\
    \ metrics for\nrouting in CR-VANETs are PU activities, availability of\nspectrum,\
    \ geographic location, channel switching delays,\nhop count, etc.\nOne initial\
    \ protocol called Search [80] is proposed for\ncognitive radio ad hoc networks\
    \ that is interesting for\nCR-VANETs scenario also. It selects a route and the\
    \ chan-\nnel that avoid the regions of PU activities. It sends route\nrequest\
    \ packets (RREQs) and they reach the destination\nvia different paths. The destination\
    \ selects the optimal\npaths based on geographic forwarding. The cost of switch-\n\
    ing a channel is also taken into account because with\ncognitive radio the intermediate\
    \ nodes might have to\nswitch a channel to forward a packet on a given path. Then\n\
    the paths are combined to minimize the number of hops.\nAnother recent approach\
    \ based on RREQ packets is pro-\nposed in [81] but without using the location\
    \ information\nas all vehicles may not have GPS information. Two routing\nschemes\
    \ are proposed: (1) First scheme searches through\nseveral routes with each route\
    \ evolving on a single chan-\nnel; (2) Second scheme discovers only one route,\
    \ but it\nexploits several channels.\nA recent protocol CoRoute [33] is an anypath\
    \ vehic-\nular routing protocol for CR-VANETs that exploits\ngeo-location and\
    \ sensed channel information. CoRoute\nextends the anypath multirate scheme proposed\
    \ in [82]\nto include cognitive radio and geo-location. With anypath\nmultirate\
    \ routing, a node broadcasts to a set of nodes\nusing a selected rate. Then, any\
    \ one of them forwards the\npacket towards the destination in the same way while\
    \ the\nother nodes in the set avoid broadcasting duplicate copies\nif they hear\
    \ the first broadcast. This routing has an any-\npath property that any node that\
    \ received the packet can\nforward it and hence, the path can change depending\
    \ on\nwhich node received the packet. If multiple nodes receive\nbroadcast then,\
    \ the one with highest priority forwards the\npacket. This priority is chosen\
    \ based on the expected any-\npath transmission time (EATT), which is the expected\n\
    time to transmit a packet to the forwarding set depend-\ning on packet size, bitrate,\
    \ and the delivery probability\nthat the packet is received at least by a single\
    \ node in the\nforwarding set.\nCoRoute extends the anypath multirate routing\
    \ protocol\nsuch that the broadcasts are done on different channels\ndepending\
    \ on the sensed channel information and geo-\nlocation. The set of forwarders\
    \ is chosen such that the\nnodes in the set are geographically closer to the destina-\n\
    tion. The channel with the least amount of congestion is\nchosen. The priority\
    \ of the nodes in the set of forwarders\nis set based on EATT as described before.\n\
    4.4.2\nMobility management\nMobility management is important for ensuring con-\n\
    nectivity even when the vehicles move. The Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ has defined some IP mobil-\nity support protocols that will be used for vehicular\n\
    networks. For instance, NEMO [83] protocol based on\nMobile IPv6 (MIPv6) [84]\
    \ is being considered for vehic-\nular scenarios. In addition, Proxy Mobile IPv6\
    \ (PMIPv6)-\nbased NEMO protocol is also a possible candidate\n[85-87]. Currently,\
    \ Distributed Mobility Management\n(DMM) and data offloading techniques are being\
    \ consid-\nered [88]. DMM can reduce the overall path latency and\ncan eliminate\
    \ the single bottleneck problem of the cen-\ntralized architectures. Moreover,\
    \ data offloading is useful\nfor adaptively offloading some flows to other available\
    \ net-\nworks and benefiting from additional available bandwidth.\nThese mobility\
    \ management approaches can benefit\nfrom the information available from cognitive\
    \ radio mod-\nules. Network selection and handovers can be optimized,\nusing cross-layer\
    \ optimization, for example, by consider-\ning geo-location and spectrum availability\
    \ to store dif-\nferent signal thresholds used for handover. The spec-\ntrum can\
    \ be allocated among RSUs so as to maximize\nthe coverage and minimize the number\
    \ of handovers,\netc. Additionally, some flows can be adaptively offloaded\nto\
    \ the cognitive radio network using data offloading\ntechniques.\nVery few works\
    \ [89] discuss mobility management in\nthe context of cognitive radios. In [90],\
    \ a joint mobility\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and\
    \ Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 16 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    and spectrum management scheme is studied focusing\non cellular networks, but\
    \ the ideas are also interesting for\nCR-VANETs.\n4.4.3\nContent distribution\
    \ using peer-to-peertechniques\nFor content distribution in CR-VANETs, one proposal\n\
    [91] uses V2I communication for content distribution\nand uses V2V communication\
    \ with cognitive radio to\nexchange the missing packets. They use a P2P-like content\n\
    sharing approach using cognitive radio. For P2P com-\nmunication in the context\
    \ of CR-VANETs, the problem\nis to determine that the onboard unit should download\n\
    which chunk, from which peer, depending on the link\nand spectrum characteristics.\
    \ The authors propose an\napproach based on coalitional graph game. When some\n\
    vehicles pass a RSU, then they can download some data\nchunks from RSU and other\
    \ chunks from peer vehicles.\nFor opportunistic spectrum use, each vehicle senses\
    \ a set\nof spectrum channels for detecting the presence of pri-\nmary users.\
    \ A channel is chosen which has maximum\ntransmission capacity and is not occupied\
    \ by primary\nusers or neighboring vehicles.\nA utility function is used such\
    \ that payoffs are a func-\ntion of the number of successful packets transmitted\
    \ as\nwell as received multiplied by the probability of successful\ntransmission.\
    \ The probability of successful transmission is\ncomputed by the probability that\
    \ no neighbor of a given\nvehicle is transmitting on a particular channel multiplied\n\
    by the probability that the given transmission does not\ncollide with primary\
    \ user. The latter depends on the prob-\nability of missing the primary traffic\
    \ and probability of\nfalse alarm. The cost of using a link between two vehicles\n\
    is defined as a weighted function of the total number of\nneighbors of receiving\
    \ and transmitting vehicles. This cost\nfunction is used to represent the probability\
    \ of data colli-\nsion because any transmission on this link has a chance of\n\
    interfering with those neighbors.\nFinally, a myopic distributed algorithm is\
    \ proposed\nwhose objective is to converge towards a graph describing\nwhich vehicle\
    \ connects with which other vehicle or RSU.\nThe proposed algorithm is myopic\
    \ as it uses only local\ninformation, as compared to centralized algorithms which\n\
    need global information. Initial approach is that each vehi-\ncle chooses a graph\
    \ that just optimizes its own utility\nbased on current neighbors and channel\
    \ characteristics.\nUsually, it is desired for any distributed algorithm to\n\
    converge. However, authors state that it is difficult to\nprove the convergence\
    \ of such algorithms due to dynam-\nically evolving topologies in VANETs scenarios.\
    \ More-\nover, the proposed algorithm can have a ping pong effect\nthat is to\
    \ oscillate from one graph formation strategy to\nanother. Thus, they introduce\
    \ a notion of history function\nwhich keeps a count of how many times a given\
    \ strategy\nwas used. If a strategy was already used up to a certain\nthreshold,\
    \ then it is not used again. With this history\nfunction, the authors show that\
    \ their algorithm converges\nwithin a finite number of iterations. The simulation\
    \ results\nshow that their algorithm can improve the throughput by\n250% as compared\
    \ to just V2I broadcast.\nIt would be interesting to see how this work can be\n\
    extended for the case of multihop communication (only\nline of site neighbors\
    \ are used) and selfish users. Addi-\ntional ways of ensuring convergence could\
    \ be explored\nwith newer algorithms. Moreover, it would be interesting\nto consider\
    \ more detailed link models as presently only\na simple model for link layer collisions\
    \ and contention is\nused.\n5\nProjects and testbeds\nThe research on cognitive-radio-enabled\
    \ vehicular net-\nworks is still in its preliminary stage, and there are not\n\
    many related experimental platforms due to their complex\nsetup and requirements.\
    \ In this section, we describe some\nexisting projects and testbeds related to\
    \ cognitive-radio-\nenabled vehicular networks.\n5.1\nCORRIDOR\nCognitive Radio\
    \ for Railway Through Dynamic and\nOpportunistic Spectrum Reuse (CORRIDOR) [92]\
    \ is a\nFrench research project that targets opportunistic spec-\ntrum access\
    \ for railways. Communication demands are\nincreasing for modern railways from\
    \ the point of view\nof railway operations as well as for providing Internet\n\
    connectivity to the passengers. However, there is no sin-\ngle universal wireless\
    \ technology that can answer the\nneeds of heterogeneous services and railway\
    \ applica-\ntions. Modern railway applications and passenger’s Inter-\nnet connectivity\
    \ demands call for more bandwidth and\nspectrum.\nOne answer to such needs is\
    \ cognitive radio. Thus,\nCORRIDOR plans to use CR technology to support mul-\n\
    tiple railway applications such as command and control,\nCCTV, maintenance, and\
    \ Internet connectivity for pas-\nsengers. The project aims to develop algorithms\
    \ and tech-\nnology for very high speed environments that are typical\nof railways.\
    \ The focus will be on spectrum access and\nmanagement, exploiting TVWS, cognitive\
    \ engine, cross-\nlayer optimization, mobility management, and handover\noptimization.\
    \ Different techniques will be validated with\nsome real on-site trials.\n5.2\n\
    PROTON-PLATA project\nThe PROTON-PLATA project [93] is a European project\nthat\
    \ aims at developing a reconfigurable prototype based\non emerging software-defined\
    \ technologies for telem-\natics applications for cars-to-roadside and car-to-car\n\
    communications. The project proposes a multitechnology\ncooperative Advanced Driver\
    \ Assistance System (ADAS)\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\
    \ and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 17 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    that is based on the integration of SDR devices in\nvehicles.\nThe first part\
    \ of the project deals with developing a pro-\ntotype including SDR device and\
    \ driver assistance appli-\ncations to demonstrate the utility of a cooperative\
    \ ADAS\nfor improving communication performance. This involves\ndesigning a multitechnology\
    \ communication infrastruc-\nture and equipping onboard units with SDR devices\n\
    that support different communication scenarios i.e., V2V\ncommunications, V2I\
    \ communications, and broadcasting\n(infrastructure-to-vehicle) at the same time.\
    \ The perfor-\nmance evaluation using network simulation tools forms\nthe second\
    \ part of the project.\n5.3\nRail-CR project\nThe Rail-CR project [94] is a US\
    \ project that is a part of\nthe efforts toward implementing the positive train\
    \ control\n(PTC) technology to equip trains with wireless communi-\ncation capabilities.\
    \ This will allow trains to communicate\nwith wayside wireless stations, while\
    \ moving, and provide\nuseful information related to their location, speed, direc-\n\
    tion, etc. The project adapts Virginia Tech cognitive radio\ntechnology [95] to\
    \ improve safety and operations of the\nrailways.\nThe complex radio characteristics\
    \ faced during train\ntransportation such as continuously changing situation of\n\
    the train as well as continuously changing communica-\ntions environment due to\
    \ varying noise, multiple sources\nof interference, multiple users competing for\
    \ scarce spec-\ntrum, etc. make wireless communication with trains very\ndemanding.\
    \ This has motivated the railway industry to\nuse SDRs equipped with a reconfigurable\
    \ platform for\npacket-data transmission. Though SDR provides interop-\nerability\
    \ and enables multiple configurations, it lacks the\ncapability of integrating\
    \ additional adaptation to alleviate\ncrowded spectrum, intentional jamming, or\
    \ learning from\npast experiences.\nIn this context, the project developed a railroad-specific\n\
    cognitive radio namely, Rail-CR, capable of fulfilling the\nrequirements of future\
    \ wireless communication systems\nfor trains. The Rail-CR combines AI-based decision-\n\
    making and learning algorithms with SDR to address the\nrailway transportations’\
    \ specific need for adaptable com-\nmunications. The Rail-CR cognitive radio will\
    \ enhance\nthe performance of railway communications in terms of\ninteroperability,\
    \ robustness, reliability, and spectral effi-\nciency, and will make it cost-effective\
    \ to deploy and\nmaintain.\nThe Rail-CR system includes a CE that relies on the\n\
    tunable radio parameters (knobs) and observable perfor-\nmance indicators (meters)\
    \ of the SDR platform. Based\non situational awareness from the radio in the form\
    \ of\nobservable parameters (meters), a cognitive engine uses\nsoftware-based\
    \ decision-making and learning algorithms\nto decide if the radio parameters (knobs)\
    \ should be\nadapted depending on sets of predefined objectives. The\nRail-CR\
    \ was evaluated under different interference con-\nditions, and results show that\
    \ the cognitive engine can\nmanage to overcome the interference by adapting con-\n\
    figurable parameters whereas a radio minus cognition\ncapability was not able\
    \ to overcome interference resulting\nin high errors or a loss of connectivity.\n\
    Further, a case study showing the use of metacognitive\nradio to improve wireless\
    \ communication systems used\nfor signaling and train control in railroads is\
    \ presented\nin [96]. In a metacognitive engine [96], a master process\nmonitors\
    \ and adapts the cognition process (i.e., cognitive\nengine). Metacognition enhances\
    \ the performance of a\ncognitive radio with better learning and decision-making\n\
    capabilities.\n5.4\nThe cognitive cars testbed\nResearch in VANETs has focused\
    \ on simulation studies\nto evaluate the performance of communication protocols\n\
    for VANETs. Testing and evaluation of VANETs commu-\nnication protocols (e.g.,\
    \ VANETs-based multihop com-\nmunication system) in real testbed scenarios for\
    \ example,\non the road, has been considered a difficult task as there\nare virtually\
    \ no highly dense vehicular testbed that exists.\nRecently, a new cognitive approach\
    \ to VANETs research\nwas introduced in [97] that enables performing real vehic-\n\
    ular experiments, which usually require several vehicles,\nusing only a few vehicles\
    \ equipped with wireless commu-\nnication interfaces. This is done by setting\
    \ up a virtual\noverlay network consisting of relaying and interfering\nvehicles\
    \ on top of a group of only a few vehicles to con-\nduct experiments. The communication\
    \ packets travel over\na random number of hops and experience interference\nfrom\
    \ random number of vehicle transmitters with varying\ntransmission characteristics.\n\
    The cognitive car testbed [98] is based on guide-\nlines presented in [97] to\
    \ conduct real experiments\nwith VANET applications and communication protocols\n\
    under constraints of vehicular environment and comput-\ning resources. The objective\
    \ of the cognitive car testbed\nis to explore the possibility of using cognitive\
    \ network\ntechnologies in advanced vehicular testbeds. It focuses on\nusing cognitive\
    \ radios to study the impact of different fre-\nquency bands and different frequency\
    \ switching delays\non the performance of VANET communication protocols.\nMore\
    \ specifically, cognitive car testbed enables evaluating\na communication protocol\
    \ vs. different variables including\nnumber of hops, density of interfering neighbors,\
    \ wireless\nchannel conditions, transmission frequency, and switch-\ning delay\
    \ at the node.\nIn this context, it introduces the architecture guidelines\nfor\
    \ implementing a VANET testbed and, in addition, pro-\nvides preliminary results\
    \ for the experiments conducted\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\

    with an accident warning system developed for high-\nways and a cognitive network\
    \ based on the software\nradio (SORA) technology provided by Microsoft. Pre-\n\
    liminary results show that cognitive interfaces can be\nused as an additional\
    \ tunable dimension in an experi-\nment platform where highly dense vehicular\
    \ testbeds can\nbe set up with just few real vehicular resources (e.g., few\n\
    cars and drivers). The cognitive interfaces enable testing\nnovel techniques designed\
    \ for addressing radio spectrum\nscarcity in a vehicular environment as well as\
    \ performance\nof VANET communication protocols. The performance of\nVANET communication\
    \ protocol can be evaluated by tun-\ning two additional variables: frequency band\
    \ and switch-\ning time. The first variable is the frequency band used for\ntransmitting\
    \ and receiving communication packets and\nthe second variable is the switching\
    \ time needed to change\nfrom one frequency to another.\n5.5\nVirginia Tech CR\
    \ network testbed (VT-CORNET)\nVT-CORNET [95] is an open-source cognitive radio\
    \ net-\nwork testbed, developed by Virginia Tech (Blacksburg,\nVA, USA) for the\
    \ evaluation of CR wireless communi-\ncation protocols and applications. The testbed\
    \ consists\nof 48 software-defined radio nodes (USRP2-based nodes)\ndeployed over\
    \ the four floors of a building and equipped\nwith a custom-made daughterboard\
    \ covering the fre-\nquency range of 100 MHz to 4 GHz. The CORNET nodes\nare remotely\
    \ accessible to the registered users. A unique\nfeature of the testbed is that\
    \ it uses Software Commu-\nnications Architecture (SCA) framework that assumes\n\
    USRP nodes at the physical layer and provides support for\ngenerating and visualizing\
    \ a range of radio configurations.\nThe testbed focuses on CE design, self-organizing\
    \ net-\nworks, and topology research. VT-CORNET is a highly\nreconfigurable testbed\
    \ that enables testing of indepen-\ndently developed CR engines, sensing techniques,\
    \ appli-\ncations, protocols, performance metrics, and algorithms.\nIn addition\
    \ to the static 48 nodes deployed in the ceiling,\nlow-power mobile nodes will\
    \ also be available to support\nvehicular environment. The rail-CR project has\
    \ adapted\nthe VR-CORNET cognitive radio technology for railways\nas described\
    \ in the first part of this section.\nThe CORNET testbed is openly available for\
    \ conducting\nresearch on advanced CR networks. It provides a col-\nlection of\
    \ resources to researchers lacking the ability to\nperform advanced experiments\
    \ because of limited expo-\nsure to software-defined radio and CR platforms. The\n\
    resources are made available to the researchers through\nflexible RF front ends,\
    \ open-source software, and FCC\nexperimental licenses.\n5.6\nORBIT testbed\n\
    The ORBIT testbed [99] is an open-access research\ntestbed for next generation\
    \ wireless networking that\nallows large-scale reproducible experimentation on\
    \ next\ngeneration protocols and applications. It consists of an\nindoor radio\
    \ grid emulator for large-scale reproducible\nexperiments and an outdoor field\
    \ trial system for support-\ning real-world experimentation and evaluations.\n\
    A 400-node radio grid emulator has been deployed at\nthe WINLAB Tech Center building\
    \ and is open for general\nuse by the research community to conduct experiments.\n\
    The ORBIT testbed provides support for conducting a\nwide range of experiments\
    \ including mobile ad hoc net-\nworks, dynamic spectrum coordination, network\
    \ virtual-\nization, wireless security, and vehicular networking. The\nradio grid\
    \ testbed enables emulation of real-world net-\nwork topologies via noise injection\
    \ and packet filtering.\nThe testbed has been recently upgraded to include pro-\n\
    grammable software-defined radios (GNU USRP/USRP2)\nfor flexible MAC/PHY experiments.\n\
    The testbed users can access the radio grid through\na web portal to specify their\
    \ experiments and mea-\nsurements. As mentioned previously, the testbed can\n\
    be accessed worldwide for conducting experiments and\nevaluate protocols and applications\
    \ related to ad hoc\nrouting, P2P, spectrum sensing, and dynamic spectrum\naccess.\
    \ Recently, the testbed has started providing support\nfor vehicular mobility\
    \ as well. The ORBIT management\nsoftware has been extended to enable mobile vehicular\n\
    (vehicle-to-vehicle networks) experiments, and the radio\ngrid is now supplemented\
    \ by a number of outdoor and\nvehicular nodes.\n6\nOpen research issues\nCR-VANETs\
    \ is a relatively new research area and hence,\nthere are many issues that are\
    \ open to further research.\nIn general, customizing existing CR approaches to\
    \ CR-\nVANETs is an interesting research direction. Additionally,\nthere are some\
    \ specific issues and we discuss some of\nthem in this section.\n6.1\nVehicular\
    \ mobility\nInitial studies [30,72] on the effect of vehicular mobility\non spectrum\
    \ management show that the primary users\nmay have to face adverse interference\
    \ due to the incor-\nrect detection of occupied frequencies as a result of the\n\
    Doppler spread generated by vehicular mobility. At the\nsame time, since a CR-enabled\
    \ vehicle can gather samples\nof signal at different locations along its path\
    \ while moving,\nthis increases the spatio-temporal diversity of the samples\n\
    and, in turn, decreases the chances of inaccurate decisions\ndue to shadowing\
    \ effects.\nOpen issues on how the performance of spectrum sens-\ning is affected\
    \ by vehicular mobility that need investiga-\ntion include the following: techniques\
    \ to achieve a balance\nbetween cooperation and spectrum scheduling for a CR-\n\
    enabled vehicle on the move, how to use predictable\nSingh et al. EURASIP Journal\
    \ on Wireless Communications and Networking 2014, 2014:49\nPage 19 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\n\
    mobility of vehicles to improve spectrum awareness, and\nhow the mobility-related\
    \ parameters such as speed and\ndirection affect the performance of spectrum sensing\
    \ [28].\n6.2\nVehicle-to-vehicle communications\nMobile ad hoc networking is difficult\
    \ in general. In case of\nCR-VANETs, V2V communication is more complex and\ndifficult\
    \ because of dynamically evolving topologies and\nfrequent disconnections that\
    \ are due to vehicles going out\nof range. This happens more often when the vehicular\n\
    density is low. Such disconnections can create instabil-\nity and performance\
    \ issues for upper layer protocols such\nas routing and transport (TCP). Some\
    \ cross-layer strate-\ngies to optimize transport protocols, for example TCP,\n\
    can also be explored such as in [100,101]. For routing\nin vehicular networks,\
    \ some approaches based on delay-\ntolerant networking (DTN) are becoming popular.\
    \ DTN\napproaches can help in improving the stability and perfor-\nmance of routing\
    \ protocols by providing some tolerance\nto disruptions. Thus, CR-VANETs routing\
    \ protocols also\nneed to integrate some DTN elements to counter frequent\ndisconnections,\
    \ apart from being spectrum aware.\n6.3\nMachine learning and environment characterization\n\
    in CR-VANETs\nSeveral machine learning approaches have been applied\nfor cognitive\
    \ radio. However, as discussed in this paper,\nCR-VANETs can have more stringent\
    \ requirements in\nterms of requiring fast algorithms due to fast changing\nenvironment.\
    \ Moreover, there can be different types of\nredundancies that can be exploited\
    \ such as redundancy in\nnetwork statistics at a given location at the same time\
    \ of a\nday. This is especially pertinent in the case of public trans-\nport such\
    \ as buses and trains. Thus, machine learning\nalgorithms that are more specific\
    \ to CR-VANETs should\nbe explored. Moreover, it is also important to design\n\
    the knowledge database, which is consultable by machine\nlearning algorithms for\
    \ faster convergence. Some design\nissues are the following: which statistics\
    \ to measure and\nstore, how to divide the region into different zones, how\n\
    to characterize different environments from the point of\nview of radio propagation\
    \ (open space vs. city landscape),\nhow to fuse different measurements, etc.\n\
    6.4\nDistributed algorithms\nMany of the works assume centralized decision making\n\
    for spectrum access and sharing. This may be valid in\ncases with infrastructure\
    \ support for example, when a\nRSU can take central decisions. However, setting\
    \ up of\ninfrastructure is difficult and using the services of cellular\nnetworks\
    \ has some costs as well as bandwidth limitations.\nThus, infrastructure support\
    \ may not be available all the\ntime and consequently, distributed algorithms\
    \ are highly\ndesired for CR-VANETs. Spectrum-aware distributed\nalgorithms for\
    \ CR-VANETs should be explored that only\nuse local information, such as that\
    \ available from neigh-\nboring vehicles. These algorithms should have low conver-\n\
    gence time, incur low signaling overhead, and should be\nfault tolerant.\n6.5\n\
    Adaptive beamforming\nDirectional antennas are an interesting way to reuse space\n\
    through beamforming, by focusing the antenna pattern\non a specific region. A\
    \ recent work on analyzing mul-\nticast capacity with beamforming is [102]. Beamforming\n\
    also improves throughput as signal quality is improved\nin the concentrated beam.\
    \ Moreover, beamforming is\nmore relevant in vehicles than as compared to, for\
    \ exam-\nple, smart phones. This is because smart phones rapidly\nchange their\
    \ orientation in our hands, which makes it dif-\nficult to exploit beamforming\
    \ with smart phones. On the\nother hand, vehicles change their orientation only\
    \ while\nchanging the route and it can be used to enhance the com-\nmunication.\
    \ With adaptive beamforming, a vehicle can\nfocus the antenna beam only on a particular\
    \ vehicle and\ncan thus avoid interference in another zones containing\nPUs or\
    \ other SUs. Thus, adaptive beamforming com-\nbined with opportunistic spectrum\
    \ access is an interesting\ndirection to explore.\n6.6\nQoE aware optimization\n\
    Most of the works focus on optimizing QoS metrics, such\nas throughput and delay.\
    \ Some works optimize user util-\nities based on generic utility functions. However,\
    \ it is\nultimately the quality of experience (QoE) which matters\nto the users.\
    \ For example, perceptual quality, an important\nQoE component for videos, is\
    \ important for passengers\nstreaming a video. For video streaming applications,\
    \ it is\nnow easier to adapt to changing network characteristics\nwith some new\
    \ standards such as scalable video coding\n(SVC) and dynamic HTTP streaming (DASH).\
    \ One of\nthe optimization approaches, in wireless networks, can be\nto use subjective\
    \ testing to design perceptual video qual-\nity models for SVC and DASH [103,104]\
    \ and apply such\nmodels for optimizing QoE, as done for wireless multi-\ncast\
    \ in [105]. Thus, similar QoE aware approaches can\nbe explored in the context\
    \ of CR-VANETs by considering\nadditional parameters related to spectrum characteristics\n\
    and availabilities.\n6.7\nCR-VANETs experiment and simulation platforms\nTypically,\
    \ the hardware experiment platforms designed\nfor VANETs and CR-VANETs consist\
    \ of regular vehicles\nand software-defined radios [106,107] and it is complex\n\
    to set up such platforms involving vehicle mechanics inte-\ngrated with radios.\
    \ Thus, currently, simulators are used.\nUsing traffic simulators such as SUMO\
    \ [108] and net-\nwork simulators (NS-2/3 and OMNeT++) together enable\nSingh\
    \ et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications and Networking 2014, 2014:49\n\
    Page 20 of 22\nhttp://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2014/1/49\ndesigning simulators\
    \ that combine vehicle mobility and\ncommunication networks. However, there is\
    \ a lack of suit-\nable simulators with features such as spectrum database,\n\
    spectrum sensing and management, power spectral den-\nsity, wireless interference\
    \ level, and Doppler effects in\norder to be able to model and simulate varying\
    \ topology\nof CR-VANETs and local wireless networks.\n6.8\nSecurity and privacy\n\
    With the use of cognitive radio for vehicular net-\nworks, there are additional\
    \ security-related issues which\nneed to be addressed, such as protecting the\
    \ privacy\nof cooperating vehicles and identifying malicious CR-\nenabled vehicles\
    \ that broadcast false spectrum sensing\nreports while on the move. Addressing\
    \ security issues in\nCR-VANETs is challenging as neighboring vehicles can\nkeep\
    \ changing over time while moving. While moving\non the road, it is difficult\
    \ to detect a malicious car that\nmay be transmitting fake spectrum sensing reports\
    \ as this\nrequires rapid detection and correction.\noreover, it is important\
    \ to consider the privacy concerns\nof end users while using collaborative spectrum\
    \ sensing in\nCR-enabled vehicles. Security issues should focus on how\nto prevent\
    \ a potential attacker from tracking a driver’s\nidentity and movements by eavesdropping\
    \ the periodic\nspectrum information broadcast by the vehicle [28].\n7\nConclusions\n\
    This paper has surveyed novel approaches and discussed\nresearch challenges related\
    \ to the use of cognitive radio\ntechnology for VANETs. Though CR deployment in\
    \ vehic-\nular networks is still in the preliminary stage, CR-VANETs\nhas the\
    \ potential of becoming a killer CR application in\nthe future due to a huge consumer\
    \ market for vehic-\nular communications. However, the research solutions\nproposed\
    \ for general-purpose CR networks cannot be\ndirectly applied to CR-VANETs due\
    \ to their unique fea-\ntures that need to be considered while designing the spec-\n\
    trum management functions for CR-VANETs. In this con-\ntext, several challenges\
    \ and requirements for CR-VANETs\nhave been identified. We have provided recent\
    \ advances\nand open research directions on applying cognitive radio\nfor vehicular\
    \ networks focusing on architecture, machine\nlearning, cooperation, reprogrammability,\
    \ and spectrum\nmanagement as well as QoE optimization for infotain-\nment applications.\
    \ A taxonomy of recent advances in\nCR-VANETs is also provided. In addition, some\
    \ exist-\ning testbeds and research projects related to CR-VANETs\nhave been described.\n\

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dublin, Ireland I. Introduction Given the
    public and private sectors'' insatiable desire for additional wireless bandwidth,
    new solutions are required to help address the burgeoning problem of “spectrum
    scarcity”. Measurement studies have shown that licensed spectrum is relatively
    unused across time and frequency [1], [2]. This is particularly true (on a per
    market basis) for TV spectrum. A new concept has been proposed which would enable
    unlicensed devices to access this unused spectrum, thus solving the scarcity issue
    and spurring innovation in the wireless industry. Nevertheless, current government
    regulations prohibit unlicensed transmissions in these bands, constraining them
    instead to several heavily populated and interference-prone regions of spectrum.
    Despite these current prohibitions, the figurative “regulatory wheels” are beginning
    to roll towards the possibility of opening certain frequency bands to unlicensed
    usage. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has already commenced work
    on the concept of unlicensed users “borrowing” spectrum from spectrum licensees
    [3], [4]. Simultaneously, a similar approach has also been promoted through the
    Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Next Generation (XG) program
    [5]. This form of spectrum allocation is known as dynamic spectrum access (DSA).

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Recent studies
    suggest that spectrum congestion is primarily due to inefficient spectrum usage
    rather than spectrum availability. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and cognitive
    radio (CR) are two techniques being considered to improve spectrum efficiency
    and utilization. The advent of CR has created a paradigm shift in wireless communications
    and instigated a change in FCC policy towards spectrum regulations. Within the
    hierarchical DSA model, spectrum overlay and underlay techniques are employed
    to enable primary and secondary users to coexist while improving overall spectrum
    efficiency. As employed here, spectrum overlay exploits unused (white) spectral
    regions while spectrum underlay exploits underused (gray) spectral regions. In
    general, underlay approaches use more spectrum than overlay approaches and operate
    below the noise floor of primary users. Spectrally modulated, spectrally encoded
    (SMSE) signals, to include orthogonal frequency domain multiplexing (OFDM) and
    multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), are candidate CR waveforms.
    The SMSE structure supports and is well suited for CR-based software defined radio
    (SDR) applications. This paper provides a general soft decision SMSE (SDSMSE)
    framework that extends the original SMSE framework to achieve synergistic CR benefits
    of overlay and underlay techniques. This extended framework provides considerable
    flexibility to design overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    that are scenario dependent. Overlay/underlay framework flexibility is demonstrated
    herein for a family of SMSE signals, including OFDM and MC-CDMA. Analytic derivation
    of CR error probability for overlay and underlay applications is presented. Simulated
    performance analysis of overlay, underlay and hybrid overlay/underlay waveforms
    is also presented and benefits discussed, to include improved spectrum efficiency
    and channel capacity maximization. Performance analysis of overlay/underlay CR

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction Spectrum crowding will continue to increase as
    the demand for higher data rates grows and the number of wireless applications
    and users increases. From an assigned spectrum perspective, a cursory glance at
    the FCC''s spectrum allocation chart can lead one to believe that spectrum is
    scarce [1]. However, recent studies suggest that spectrum congestion is mainly
    due to inefficient spectrum usage rather than spectrum scarcity [2]. Two techniques
    are being considered within the research community to address improved spectrum
    efficiency, including Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) and Cognitive Radio (CR).

    50 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract The cognitive radio (CR) paradigm for designing
    next-generation wireless communications systems is becoming increasingly popular,
    and different aspects of it are being implemented in currently available wireless
    systems. In the last decade, a significant amount of research efforts has been
    made to solve CR challenges, and several standards related to CR and dynamic spectrum
    access have been developed. Also, there have been advances in software-defined
    radio platforms to implement the CR systems. In this article, we provide a comprehensive
    survey on the evolution of CR research covering aspects such as spectrum sensing,
    measurements and statistical modeling of spectrum usage, physical layer aspects
    such as waveform and modulation design, multiple access, resource allocation and
    power control, cognitive learning, adaptation and self-configuration, multihop
    transmission and routing, and robustness and security in CR networks. Also, state-of-the-art
    research on the economics of CR networks, CR simulation tools, testbeds and hardware
    prototypes, CR applications, and CR standardization efforts is summarized. Emerging
    trends on CR research and open research challenges related to the cost-effective
    and large-scale deployment of CR systems are outlined. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley
    & Sons, Ltd. 1 Introduction and Historical Notes on Cognitive Radio For wireless
    communications, the right to access the spectrum or license is generally defined
    by frequency, space, transmission power, spectrum owner (i.e., licensee), type
    of use, and the duration of license. Normally, a license is assigned to one licensee,
    and the use of spectrum by this licensee must conform to the specification in
    the license (e.g., maximum transmission power and type of use). In the traditional
    spectrum licensing scheme, the license cannot change the type of use or transfer
    the right to other licensees. Also, the radio spectrum is licensed for a large
    region and generally in large chunks. All these factors in the current command-and-control
    model for spectrum allocation and assignment limit the use and result in low utilization
    of the frequency spectrum. Because the existing and new wireless applications
    and services are demanding for more transmission capacity and data transmission
    performance and hence more radio spectrum, the utilization of the radio spectrum
    needs to be improved. To improve the efficiency and utilization of the radio spectrum,
    the aforementioned limitations should be remedied by modifying the spectrum licensing
    scheme and adopting a dynamic spectrum management model. The idea is to make spectrum
    access more flexible by allowing the unlicensed users to access the radio spectrum
    under certain restrictions. Because the legacy wireless systems were designed
    to operate on a dedicated frequency band, they are not able to utilize the improved
    flexibility provided by this spectrum licensing scheme. Therefore, the concept
    of cognitive radio (CR) emerged, the main goal of which is to provide adaptability
    to wireless transmission through dynamic spectrum access (DSA) so that the utilization
    of the frequency spectrum can be enhanced without losing the benefits associated
    with static spectrum allocation. The CR is a “smarter radio” in the sense that
    it can sense channels that contain signals from a large class of heterogeneous
    devices, networks, and services. On the basis of this sensing, the radio will
    implement sophisticated algorithms to share the limited-bandwidth channel with
    other users in order to achieve efficient wireless communication. In this way,
    the CR concept generalizes the idea of multiple access involving devices in a
    single homogeneous system to multiple access among devices in different radio
    spectrums using different radio transmission techniques and hence different systems
    (i.e., inter-system multiple access as opposed to the more traditional intra-system
    multiple access), which have different priorities in accessing the spectrum 1.
    Again, the concept of CR can be generalized as a topic within the field of adaptive
    or cognitive systems. The CR refers to a sophisticated radio device that mimics
    the human brain in a DSA environment to perceive and learn the radio environment
    to control and adapt the transmission actions 2. Such a radio device or terminal
    has to operate in a networked environment where many of such devices sense the
    radio channels in their own geographical environment, and the sensed information
    is processed (either centrally or distributively) to make a decision on channel
    access using appropriate modulation scheme, transmission power, and error control
    algorithms. The wireless network infrastructure will also have a significant role
    here, for example, to manage information about the radio devices and their operating
    environments, determine the consequences of interference, and facilitate cooperation
    among the radio devices. Significant challenges exist in the design, analysis,
    optimization, development, and deployment of DSA-based CR networks (CRNs), and
    these challenges involve both technology and policy (or regulatory) considerations.
    The major technical challenges include the following: spectrum sensing; measurements
    and statistical modeling of radio spectrum usage; waveform, modulation, and radio
    frequency (RF) front-end design at the physical layer (PHY); methods for multiple
    access, resource allocation, and transmission power control for CRs; distributed
    learning, adaptation, self-configuration, cooperation, and coexistence methods
    for CRs; routing in multihop CRNs and cross-layer optimization; methods for robustness
    and security in CRNs; wide-area end-to-end performance modeling and analysis for
    global internetworking; modeling and understanding the emergent system behavior;
    development of network control and management protocols; software abstractions
    for the radio modules at the application programming interface level; and development
    of testbeds and real-world deployment of CRNs. The challenges in the spectrum
    policy domain include the following: development of practical DSA policies that
    lead to efficient spectrum use, protect the rights of license holders, and maintain
    the service quality and development of certification and enforcement policies
    for CRs 3. The term cognitive radio was first used and discussed in 4 in 1999
    by J. Mitola III and G. Q. Maguire. In 2000, in his Ph.D. dissertation 5, J. Mitola
    III introduced CR and networks as an extension of the software-defined radio (SDR)
    concept where the radios are computationally intelligent and are aware of the
    radio environment and user applications. Although the term cognitive radio has
    been used only recently, the concept of intelligent spectrum access is not completely
    new. For example, the idea of sensing before transmitting as used in the popular
    carrier-sense multiple-access (CSMA) protocols dates back to the early 1990s when
    the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineer (IEEE) 802.3 standards or
    Ethernet standards were being developed. Also, the idea of using “dynamic channel
    allocation and selection” was extensively studied in the 1980s and 1990s in the
    context of mobile cellular wireless networks. The fact that one of the main reasons
    of the spectrum scarcity problem is the traditional fixed spectrum allocation
    was first realized when the Federal Communications Commission''s (FCC''s) Spectrum
    Policy Task Force Report 6 was published in 2002. Since then, FCC pushed towards
    advances in technology for more efficient spectrum usage, and the idea of exploiting
    CR technology to facilitate the flexible, efficient, and reliable use of spectrum
    gained momentum in both industry and academia. In particular, FCC advocated the
    use of concepts such as dynamic frequency selection (DFS), incumbent profile detection,
    and transmit power control for CRs. In 2004, FCC issued a notice of proposed rulemaking,
    which introduced the possibility of allowing the unlicensed (or secondary) users
    to temporarily use spectrums allocated to licensed (or primary) users as long
    as the secondary users do not cause harmful interference to primary users. An
    important milestone in the development of CR is the approval by FCC in November
    2008 of the unlicensed use of the TV white space (TVWS; 54–72, 76–88, 174–216,
    and 470–806 MHz) based on spectrum sensing as well as consultation with an FCC-mandated
    database 7. These spectrum bands are attractive because of their superior radio
    propagation characteristics in the sub-gigahertz frequencies. In September 2010,
    FCC released new rules for the use of white space for unlicensed wireless devices,
    which removed the mandatory sensing requirements and thus facilitated the use
    of the spectrum with geolocation-based channel allocation 8. This has motivated
    the development of new wireless standards and standardization initiatives including
    the IEEE 802.22 for wireless regional area networks (WRANs), the European Computer
    Manufacturers Association 392 for personal portable devices, and the IEEE 802.11af
    and 802.19.1 Task Groups. In the last decade, there has been a significant amount
    of research work focusing on the different aspects of CRNs such as spectrum sensing
    and signal classification techniques at the PHY; scheduling, transmission power
    control, and adaptive channel access protocols at the link layer; resource allocation
    for multihop transmission at the routing layer; modeling and analysis of security;
    and CRN economics. In addition to a huge number of research papers including survey
    and tutorial types of articles 2, 4, 9-14, a number of research monographs and
    edited books 15-23 have appeared in the literature. A number of special issues
    on CR have been organized in both IEEE and non-IEEE journals 24-36. A number of
    small-scale testbeds have been built in the academia. Also, a significant amount
    of efforts has been put by the different standardization bodies for the standardization
    of CRNs. The aim of this article is to concisely summarize the current state-of-the-art
    research in the DSA-based CR systems and the future research trends. The rest
    of the article is organized as follows. After reviewing the fundamental concepts
    of CR and DSA, we describe the building blocks of a CRN and outline the major
    research issues from a layered perspective. Then, we provide a summary of the
    current state-of-the-art spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing methods for CR
    systems. This is followed by a concise review of the work on robustness and security
    in CRNs and on the economics of CRNs. Then, we describe the available CR simulation
    tools, testbeds, and hardware prototypes. The current and future trends in CR
    including the applications (e.g., smart grid 37, 38, machine-to-machine (M2M)
    communications 39, and cloud computing 40) are reviewed, and the open research
    issues are outlined next. To this end, the standardization activities on CR are
    summarized. 2 Fundamental Principles of Cognition and Dynamic Spectrum Access
    The term CR is defined in 2 as follows: “Cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless
    communication system that is aware of its ambient environment. A cognitive radio
    transmitter will learn from the environment and adapt its internal states to statistical
    variations in the existing RF stimuli by adjusting the transmission parameters
    (e.g., frequency band, modulation mode, and transmission power) in real-time and
    on-line manner.” This definition essentially captures the fundamental concept
    behind CR. A CRN enables us to establish communications among CR nodes/users.
    The communication parameters can be adjusted according to the change in the radio
    environment, topology, operating conditions, or user requirements. Two main objectives
    of the CR are to improve the utilization of the frequency spectrum and to achieve
    the highly reliable and highly efficient wireless communications. Cognitive radio-based
    DSA or sharing has basically two major flavors, that is, horizontal spectrum sharing
    and vertical spectrum sharing. In the former case, all users/nodes have equal
    regulatory status, whereas in the latter case all users/nodes do not have equal
    regulatory status. In vertical spectrum sharing, there are primary (i.e., licensed)
    users and secondary (i.e., unlicensed) users, and the secondary users opportunistically
    access the spectrum without affecting the primary users’ performances. Horizontal
    spectrum sharing can be between homogeneous networks (e.g., IEEE 802.11a operating
    in the 5-GHz Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure band) or between heterogeneous
    networks (e.g., coexistence between IEEE 802.11b and 802.15.1 [Bluetooth] networks).
    When all the networks in a heterogeneous environment have cognitive/adaptive capabilities
    (i.e., all coexisting networks have equal incentives to adapt), it is referred
    to as symmetric sharing. On the other hand, when there is one or more network
    without cognitive/adaptive capabilities (e.g., coexistence of legacy technology
    with CR technology), this is referred to as asymmetric spectrum sharing 15. One
    example of this is the coexistence of high-speed IEEE 802.11 networks with low-power
    IEEE 802.15.4 networks. DSA in vertical spectrum sharing is referred to as opportunistic
    spectrum access. This opportunistic spectrum access is the method for the secondary
    user to operate within a frequency band that is designated to the primary user.
    The major functionalities of a CR device include spectrum sensing, spectrum management,
    and spectrum mobility 22. Through spectrum sensing, the information of the target
    radio spectrum (e.g., type and current activity of the licensed user) has to be
    obtained so that this information can be utilized by the CR user. The spectrum
    sensing information is exploited by the spectrum management function to analyze
    the spectrum opportunities and make decisions on spectrum access. If the status
    of the target spectrum changes, the spectrum mobility function can switch the
    operating frequency bands for the CR users. Spectrum sensing: The goal of the
    spectrum sensing mechanism is to determine the status of the spectrum (e.g., to
    detect the signature of a signal from a licensed user) and the activity of the
    licensed user by periodically sensing the target frequency band. In particular,
    a CR transceiver detects an unused spectrum or spectrum hole (i.e., band, location,
    and time) and also determines the method of accessing it (i.e., transmission power
    and access duration) without interfering the transmission of the licensed user.
    Spectrum sensing can be either centralized or distributed. In centralized spectrum
    sensing, a sensing controller (e.g., an access point or a base station) senses
    the target frequency band, and the information obtained from sensing is shared
    with other nodes in the system. Centralized spectrum sensing can reduce the complexity
    of user terminals, as all the sensing functions are performed at the sensing controller.
    However, centralized spectrum sensing suffers from location diversity. For example,
    the sensing controller may not be able to detect licensed user at the edge of
    the cell. In distributed spectrum sharing, unlicensed users perform spectrum sensing
    independently, and the spectrum sensing results can be either used by individual
    CRs (i.e., noncooperative sensing) or shared among other users (i.e., cooperative
    sensing). Although cooperative sensing incurs more communication and processing
    overhead, the accuracy of spectrum sensing is higher than that of noncooperative
    sensing. Spectrum analysis: The information obtained from spectrum sensing is
    used to schedule and plan the spectrum access by the unlicensed users. In this
    case, the communication requirements of the unlicensed users are also used to
    optimize the transmission parameters. The major components of spectrum management
    mechanisms are spectrum analysis and spectrum access optimization. In spectrum
    analysis, information from spectrum sensing is analyzed to understand the ambient
    RF environment (e.g., the behavior of licensed users) and gain knowledge about
    the spectrum holes (e.g., interference estimation, duration of availability, and
    probability of collision with licensed user due to sensing error). A knowledge
    base of the spectrum access environment can be built and maintained on the basis
    of learning and knowledge extraction. Machine learning algorithms from the field
    of artificial intelligence can be applied for learning and knowledge extraction.
    Subsequently, a decision to access the spectrum (e.g., frequency, bandwidth, modulation
    mode, transmission power, location, and time duration) is made by optimizing the
    system performance given the desired objective (e.g., maximize throughput of the
    unlicensed user) and constraints (e.g., maintain the interference caused to the
    licensed users below the target threshold). Spectrum access: After the decision
    is made on spectrum access on the basis of spectrum analysis, the spectrum holes
    (also called spectrum opportunities) are accessed by the unlicensed users. Spectrum
    access is performed on the basis of a cognitive medium access control (MAC) protocol
    that intends to avoid collision/harmful interference with/to licensed users and
    also with other unlicensed users. The CR transmitter is also required to perform
    negotiation with the CR receiver to synchronize the transmission so that the transmitted
    data can be received successfully. A cognitive MAC protocol could be based on
    a fixed-allocation MAC (e.g., frequency-division multiple access, time-division
    multiple access, and code-division multiple access [CDMA]) or a random access
    MAC (e.g., ALOHA and CSMA with collision avoidance). The optimal spectrum access
    decision depends on the ambient environment and the cooperative or competitive
    behavior of the unlicensed users. The spectrum access decision can be made in
    a noncooperative and distributed way based on a local optimization objective.
    Alternatively, a cooperative spectrum access decision can be made either in a
    distributed or a centralized way based on a global optimization objective. The
    spectrum access decisions are then communicated among CR transmitters and receivers.
    In a CRN, the secondary users may use either an interference control (or spectrum
    underlay) approach or an interference avoidance (or spectrum overlay) approach
    to exploit the spectrum opportunities. In the spectrum underlay approach, the
    secondary users transmit over the same spectrum as the primary users as long as
    the interference caused to the primary users does not exceed a threshold level.
    Therefore, such an approach requires a sophisticated power control scheme for
    secondary transmitters. In the spectrum overlay approach, the secondary users
    need to have the knowledge about spectrum holes so that the secondary users can
    exploit them, ensuring that there is no interference caused to the primary users.
    The interference avoidance approach is, therefore, more conservative than the
    interference control approach, and no strict power control is required for this
    spectrum access paradigm. Spectrum mobility: Spectrum mobility is a function related
    to the change of operating frequency band of CR users. When a licensed user starts
    accessing a radio channel that is currently being used by an unlicensed user,
    the unlicensed user can switch to the idle spectrum band. This change in operating
    frequency band is referred to as spectrum hand-off 9. During spectrum hand-off,
    the protocol parameters at the different layers in the protocol stacks have to
    be adjusted to match with the new operating frequency band. Spectrum hand-off
    must ensure that the data transmission by the unlicensed user can continue on
    the new spectrum band. The preceding functionalities can be implemented on the
    basis of the SDR, which is a reconfigurable wireless communication system. With
    the SDR, the transmission parameters (e.g., operating frequency band, modulation
    mode, and protocol) can be controlled dynamically. This adjustability function
    is achieved by software-controlled signal processing algorithms. The main functions
    of SDR include multiband operation, multistandard support, multiservice support,
    multichannel support, and self-organization (i.e., “plug-and-play” capability).
    The flexibility of SDR is useful for prototyping and evaluating cognitive networking
    technology. In a network of CRs, the network infrastructure should support and
    facilitate the aforementioned CR functionalities (i.e., spectrum sensing, analysis,
    access, and mobility). The network will facilitate communication among multiple
    cooperating CRs, or the network will control communication processes among competing
    CR users through proper radio resource allocation. The policies specifying the
    limitations of radio access (e.g., available frequency bands in a certain location)
    and the operating characteristics of the physical radio can be stored in the policy
    and configuration databases, which would be accessible to the CRs through the
    network infrastructure. 3 Architectures and Building Blocks of Cognitive Radio
    Networks: A Layered Perspective A DSA-based CRN may adopt either a cooperative
    or noncooperative network architecture. In the noncooperative CRN architecture,
    each cognitive node is responsible for its own decision. Therefore, it has minimal
    communication requirements (hence less overhead); however, the spectrum utilization
    may be low. On the other hand, in the cooperative but centralized CRN architecture,
    a centralized server maintains a database of spectrum availability and access
    information (based on information received from secondary users, e.g., through
    a dedicated control channel). Therefore, spectrum management is simpler and coordinated
    in this case, and it enables efficient spectrum sharing. For DSA, a cooperative
    but distributed CRN architecture relies on cooperative local actions throughout
    the network to achieve a performance close to the global optimal performance.
    In this architecture, CRs periodically exchange information on their local environment,
    communication requirements, and performances among themselves. The CRs use their
    local information as well as information received from their peers to determine
    their communication parameters. The network performance, however, may suffer from
    the hidden node problem and large control overhead. Note that in both centralized
    and distributed strategies, the primary user may or may not cooperate. The protocol
    architecture for a CR system is shown in Figure 1. The communication protocols
    at the different layers need to function such that the utilization of the radio
    spectrum is maximized while satisfying the policy constraints. Physical layer:
    In the PHY, spectrum sensing is the primary task, which includes functionalities
    such as the following: detect spectrum holes/opportunities over wide-frequency
    spectrum, estimate opportunity, estimate interference at the primary receiver
    (e.g., in a CDMA environment). Spectrum sensing involves obtaining the spectrum
    usage characteristics across multiple dimensions such as time, space, frequency,
    and code (e.g., modulation, waveform, bandwidth, and carrier frequency). A primary
    transmitter can be detected by using methods such as matched filter detection,
    energy detection, and cyclostationary feature detection. The leakage power at
    the RF front end of a primary receiver can be measured/estimated to detect the
    activity of the corresponding primary receiver. In the PHY, the RF front-end is
    implemented on the basis of the SDR (i.e., SDR transceiver). The RF front end
    requires a high sampling rate, high-resolution analog-to-digital converters with
    large dynamic ranges, multiple analog front-end circuitries, and high-speed signal
    processors to perform computationally demanding signal processing tasks with small
    delay. MAC layer: In the MAC layer, a decision is taken on whether to transmit
    or not considering that the spectrum sensing/detection could be erroneous and
    how to exploit the spectrum holes (e.g., what modulation and power level to use)
    and, in case of transmission, on how to share the spectrum with other CRs. The
    MAC protocol functionalities include the following: obtain information on channel
    occupancy (spectrum sensing † ) and make decision on spectrum access, synchronize
    transmission parameters (e.g., channel and time slot) between the transmitter
    and receiver, facilitate negotiation among primary users and secondary users for
    spectrum allocation, facilitate communication among secondary users to perform
    channel sensing and channel access, and facilitate spectrum trading functions
    (e.g., spectrum bidding and spectrum pricing). The major challenges in designing
    the MAC protocols for CRNs include optimal channel sensing for multichannel access;
    primary users’ time-varying activity; hidden and exposed terminal problems; synchronization
    between transmitter and receiver for which the unavailability of any fixed common
    control channel and the channel availability changes depending on the spectrum
    access by primary users; optimal channel allocation/scheduling, rate, and power
    adaptation; and coexistence between primary and secondary users. Network layer:
    The primary tasks at the network layer are constructing topology, addressing,
    and routing. The topology construction involves spectrum detection, neighbor discovery,
    and topology management (e.g., through spectrum mobility). Addressing can be static
    (e.g., extension of PHY/MAC address) or dynamic (e.g., using a dynamic host configuration
    protocol). In multihop CRNs, routing decisions need to be made on the basis of
    topology, MAC congestion, and link quality/reliability (a cross-layer solution).
    Note that there is no fixed common control channel (e.g., for route discovery)
    and rerouting may need to be performed frequently because of intermittent connectivity
    among cognitive nodes. The routing metric has to consider parameters such as hop
    count and link quality as well as spectrum management parameters such as interference
    to primary users and availability of spectrum holes. Transport layer: The transport
    layer protocol is responsible for flow and congestion control, the performance
    of which is affected by MAC protocol performance and spectrum mobility. The throughput
    performance of the traditional transmission control protocol (TCP) is a function
    of round-trip time (RTT) and packet loss probability, which would depend on the
    spectrum management/sharing protocols, bandwidth of spectrum holes, transmission
    power, and interference levels. During rerouting, RTT and packet loss rate change,
    and spectrum hand-off latency (due to spectrum mobility) may increase the RTT.
    Therefore, the performance of TCP in a CRN would be improved if the packet delay
    and loss can be minimized during spectrum hand-off (e.g., through efficient queue
    management). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Cognitive radio protocol
    stack. MAC, medium access control; SDR, software-defined radio. The adaptive protocols
    in the MAC, network, transport, and application layers should be aware of the
    variations in the CR environment. In particular, the adaptive protocols should
    consider traffic activity of primary users, transmission requirements of secondary
    users, and variations in channel quality. For this, the MAC-layer beacons can
    be sensed for information about sleep and wake-up schedules of the CRs and information
    about nodes’ connectivity. The routing protocol messages, for example, can be
    exploited to detect mobility of the CR nodes. To link all the protocol modules
    in the stack and enable cross-layer interaction, a CR control is used to establish
    the interfaces among the SDR transceiver, adaptive protocols, and wireless applications
    and services. This CR module (Figure 1) uses intelligent algorithms to process
    the measured signal from the PHY and to receive information on transmission requirements
    from the applications to control the protocol parameters in the different layers.
    A programmable radio architecture and related protocol stack with cross-layer
    interactions along with the wideband radio front ends will be the key enabling
    technologies for the CRNs. In the following section, we survey the existing literature
    on PHY, MAC, and networking layer issues in CRNs. 4 Current State-of-the-Art Research
    on Spectrum Sharing in Cognitive Radio Networks In this section, we provide a
    survey on the evolution of CR research covering different aspects of spectrum
    sharing, that is, spectrum sensing 41-61; measurements and statistical modeling
    of spectrum usage 62-68; PHY aspects such as waveform and modulation design 69-92;
    multiple access, resource allocation and power control, and spectrum mobility
    93-125; cognitive learning, adaptation, and self-configuration 126-140; and multihop
    transmission and routing 141-148. 4.1 Spectrum sensing, interference modeling,
    and measurements and statistical modeling of spectrum usage Spectrum statistics
    are important information for secondary users to opportunistically access the
    spectrum of primary users. Therefore, there is a need to study and understand
    the characteristics and nature of spectrum usage by the primary users. To gain
    such information, the following issues are considered in the literature. Spectrum
    sensing: Spectrum sensing is a primitive action for secondary users to detect
    the status of spectrum access by primary users. Without this information, the
    secondary users may not access idle spectrum and thus reducing the spectrum utilization,
    or may cause interference to the primary users occupying spectrum. Interference
    modeling: Secondary users may observe the interference on spectrum for two reasons.
    Firstly, the secondary users must ensure that their transmission will not interfere
    and interrupt the ongoing transmission of primary users. Secondly, given an interference
    condition, the secondary users must access the spectrum such that their transmission
    requirements are satisfied. Interference modeling provides the secondary users
    with the capability to achieve these goals. Measurements and statistical modeling
    of spectrum usage: Whereas spectrum sensing is a short-term action to observe
    the instantaneous status of the spectrum, spectrum measurement is performed on
    a long-term basis (e.g., over a few months) to gain knowledge and statistical
    data of primary users. This information is useful for the secondary users to determine
    their spectrum access strategy (e.g., access in a particular time of the day to
    minimize interference to the primary users). In the following, we provide a review
    of the related work addressing these issues. An overview of the regulatory requirements
    (e.g., sensing periodicity and detection sensitivity) and the major challenges
    associated with spectrum sensing in CRNs is given in 41, 42. A comprehensive survey
    of the different spectrum sensing techniques can be found in 43, 44. Traditional
    spectrum sensing techniques include the following: matched filter detection, energy
    detection, cyclostationary detection, wavelet detection, and covariance detection.
    The performance metrics generally used for spectrum sensing are probability of
    correct detection and probability of false alarm. The main challenges of spectrum
    sensing arise because of the uncertainty in a radio environment caused by channel
    fading, interference and noise, the requirement of quick detection, and also the
    fact that the modulation schemes, transmission powers, and bit rate may be different
    for the different primary users. Also, a secondary user may not be able to detect
    the location of the primary receiver. We refer to 46 for a comprehensive overview
    of the different channel fading models. In 47, the authors evaluated the secondary
    channel capacities under the average and peak interference power constraints at
    the primary receiver in different fading environments such as Rayleigh fading,
    Nakagami fading, and lognormal shadowing. It was shown that with the same interference
    power limit, channel capacity in fading environments exceeds that of the additive
    white Gaussian noise channel. In 48, the authors used random matrix theory to
    obtain the probability distributions of the test statistics and find the closed-form
    expressions for the probability of detection and the probability of false alarm.
    Also, the authors proposed spectrum sensing methods that overcome the noise uncertainty
    problem and can be used without requiring the knowledge of signal, channel, and
    noise power. Mariani et al. 49 studied the impact of the uncertain information
    about the noise power level on the performance of the energy detector spectrum
    sensing. In 51, the authors provided a tutorial on the multitaper method, which
    is a nonparametric method for spectrum sensing. This method provides high spectral
    resolution capability, estimates the average power in each sub-band of the spectrum,
    and identifies the unknown directions of interfering signals. In 52, the spectrum
    sensing duration was optimized to maximize the throughput of secondary users while
    achieving a target detection probability in order to protect the primary users.
    For improved performance, cooperative spectrum sensing can be used 53-60. The
    cooperative spectrum sensing process works as follows. Every CR performs its own
    local spectrum sensing independently and then makes a binary decision on the presence
    of a primary user. Then, all of the CRs transmit their decisions to a common node.
    The common node fuses the decisions and makes a final decision to identify whether
    a primary user is present or not. The fusion techniques for cooperative spectrum
    sensing can use either decision fusion or data fusion. Through cooperation, the
    reliability of primary user detection can be improved. However, the performance
    of cooperative sensing can be limited when the reporting channels are subject
    to fading and/or shadowing. In 53, the authors proposed several robust cooperative
    spectrum sensing techniques based on the concepts of cooperative diversity and
    multi-user diversity. In 56, the authors focused on the cooperative spectrum sensing
    system in which the individual CR users make independent decisions about the presence
    of the primary signal and communicate their decisions to a fusion center. Then,
    the fusion center makes the final decision about the occupancy of the spectrum
    band. The observations at the nodes are assumed to be correlated, and therefore,
    a linear-quadratic (LQ) fusion strategy was proposed as compared with a counting
    rule that is linearly combining. The proposed LQ rule requires the second-order
    statistics of the local decisions when the primary users are present, which can
    be obtained by estimating the pairwise statistics. In 58, the authors presented
    optimal weighting for linearly combining the energies measured at the CR users
    such that the probability of detection is maximized with a constraint on the probability
    of false alarm. The amount of sensing and transmission overhead in a CRN with
    a large number of cooperating users and frequency channels is large when every
    node scans all the channels and sends each channel''s status to the fusion center.
    To reduce the communication overhead, Meng et al. 59 proposed matrix completion
    and joint sparsity algorithms for spectrum sensing based on a small number of
    observations. The work in 60 proposed a location-aware cooperative sensing algorithm
    that decides whether a primary user exists within a certain detection area or
    not. The primary network is modeled as a random geometric network, and the CRN
    is assumed to know the relative locations of its users. The optimal weighting
    that linearly combines the measured energy levels of the sensing nodes such that
    a modified deflection coefficient is maximized is obtained by the Fisher linear
    discriminant analysis. The work in 62 reported a comprehensive experimental study
    on interference analysis in the IEEE 802.22-based WRAN system. The work in 42
    is a significant contribution towards modeling the distribution of aggregate interference
    at a primary receiver due to the secondary transmitters. The work in 63 is also
    an important contribution to statistical modeling of aggregate interference caused
    to a primary user in a CRN. The theory of truncated stable distributions is used
    for the modeling. The effect of power control on the cognitive network interference
    is also considered. The work in 64 is one of the very early studies on spectrum
    occupancy and interference in CR systems. The authors 64 discussed the opportunities,
    challenges, and communication limits in the CR technology. Datla et al. 65 provided
    a framework for spectrum measurement and off-line processing of measured data.
    The framework has been evaluated by using it on real-world spectrum measurement
    data. The authors in 66 proposed a statistical model for spectrum occupancy in
    the time and frequency domains, and the key model parameters were determined from
    actual measurements. The work in 67 presented a spectrum measurement campaign
    in detail and the lessons learned in this campaign. Also, the paper presented
    a stochastic model based on modified beta distribution for the duty cycle of occupancy
    in a sub-band. The authors in 68 addressed the potential drawback of Poisson modeling
    for primary user activity and introduced a new model based on the first-difference
    filter clustering and temporal correlation statistics. There are a few design
    considerations for the different spectrum sensing methods. Firstly, the cooperative
    spectrum sensing can improve the detection performance, but at the cost of higher
    false alarm probability and larger overhead (e.g., processing and communication).
    Spectrum sensing can be performed in a reactive or proactive manner. Unlike a
    proactive spectrum sensing method, a reactive spectrum sensing method will not
    incur an overhead if spectrum access is not performed. However, the reactive spectrum
    sensing will have longer latency to collect radio environment status when a secondary
    user needs to access the radio spectrum. Finally, the trade-off between rate and
    reliability must be optimized. Spending a longer time in spectrum sensing will
    lead to a more accurate sensing result. However, this is at the cost of lower
    rate due to shorter time for transmission. 4.2 Waveform and modulation design
    for cognitive radios To minimize interference to primary users, the design of
    waveform and modulation of signal from secondary users can be optimized. For example,
    in an underlay spectrum access scheme, the secondary user can use ultra-wideband
    (UWB) transmission and adjust the pulse position and/or width to avoid interference
    to the narrowband transmission of the primary users. Similarly, in an overlay
    spectrum access scheme, the secondary user adapts the multicarrier modulation
    for an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based system to minimize
    interference. 4.2.1 Waveform design and interference mitigation In 69, a new pulse
    waveform design method was proposed for the UWB telecommunication system that
    has to coexist with some other narrowband systems. In 72, a novel low-complexity
    adaptive UWB pulse-shaping algorithm was presented for producing the expected
    spectral notches right in the frequency band occupied by the nearby wireless devices.
    Adaptive pulse waveform optimization based on linear combination of different
    derivative functions of Gaussian pulse is investigated to produce expected notches
    in achieving narrowband interference avoidance as well as matching with the FCC
    spectral mask. In 75, noncontiguous multicarrier modulation that can be used to
    facilitate spectrally opportunistic CR was considered. Hu et al. 76 jointly designed
    the transmitted waveform and the FIR filters at the relay nodes for cognitive
    relay networks. Hu et al. 77 considered the problem of waveform optimization for
    multiple-input single-output CR links with the spectral mask constraint at the
    transmitter and the interference cancelation at the receiver. In 86, a novel method
    of adding extended active interference cancelation (EAIC) signals to suppress
    sidelobes and to shape the spectrum of CR-OFDM signals with a cyclic prefix (CP)
    was presented. The key idea of the proposed EAIC-CP method is to use the cancelation
    signals consisting of EAIC tones that are spaced closer than the OFDM subcarrier
    interval. In 87, a statistical model of interference aggregation in spectrum sensing-based
    cognitive wireless networks was presented by explicitly taking into account the
    random variations in the number, location, and transmitted power of the CRs as
    well as the propagation characteristics. Cheng et al. 90 proposed an enhanced
    opportunistic interference mitigation scheme utilizing both successfully and unsuccessfully
    decoded primary packets to improve the data rate of secondary user''s transmission.
    Also, an analytical model was proposed to investigate the overall spectral efficiency
    due to the changes of spectrum usage affected by the coexisting secondary user''s
    transmission. 4.2.2 Modulation design and classification Bogucka et al. 91 provided
    an excellent tutorial on two multicarrier modulation schemes, namely, noncontiguous
    OFDM (NC-OFDM) and noncontiguous non-OFDM for opportunistic wireless access. Kollar
    and Horvath 78 also reviewed different modulation schemes (e.g., discrete Fourier
    transform-spread OFDM, constant envelope OFDM, and filter bank multicarrier) for
    CRs with their advantages and disadvantages. Different modulation schemes were
    compared in terms of spectral characteristics, signal metrics, and system performance
    with the presence of nonlinear distortions. In 84, a quantitative comparison of
    NC-OFDM and noncontiguous multicarrier CDMA transmission techniques was presented
    in the context of a DSA network. In 85, the authors provided a review of the state-of-the-art
    methods specifically designed to protect the transmissions of the primary users
    from possible interference caused by nearby secondary transmitters using NC-OFDM.
    These methods are designed to suppress out-of-band (OOB) emissions resulting from
    the use of NC-OFDM transmission. In 79, the performance of adaptive modulation
    for CR with opportunistic access was analyzed by considering the effects of spectrum
    sensing and primary user traffic for Nakagami-m fading channels. Both the adaptive
    continuous-rate scheme and the adaptive discrete-rate scheme were considered.
    Budiarjo et al. 83 introduced modulation strategies to realize the coexistence
    between the CR-based rental system and the licensed system in such a way that
    the secondary users are invisible to the primary users. In 89, the techniques
    for detecting interfering signals, estimating the distance between victim and
    interfering devices, and shaping the spectrum to mitigate interference into the
    victim receiver were considered. Zamanian et al. 80 designed a classifier for
    linear digital modulation based on the clustering (using the K-Means algorithm)
    of the received signal constellation diagram. Ye et al. 82 presented a novel digital
    modulation classification system for CRs using only temporal waveform features.
    A hierarchical approach was used to first make separations into intermediate subclasses,
    where some of the subclasses can consist of more than one modulation type. Then,
    the second classifier was used to discriminate between higher-order modulation
    schemes using additional features. In 92, the authors proposed a method for modulation
    classification based on the support vector machines that is robust against heavy
    non-Gaussian interference. In the experiment, four classes of signal modulations,
    that is, binary phase-shift keying, quadrature phase-shift keying, frequency-shift
    keying, and minimum shift keying, were considered. 4.3 Analysis of spectrum sharing
    systems Capacity analysis is an important issue to quantify the performance limits
    (e.g., performance bounds) of CR systems. The capacity of a CR system is constrained
    not only by the transmit power limit but also by the interference caused to the
    primary users. Capacity analysis would be useful to determine the achievable transmission
    rates of secondary users considering the effects of different channel fading.
    Ghasemi and Sousa 47 evaluated the secondary channel capacities under the average
    and peak interference power constraints at the primary receiver in different fading
    environments. It was shown that with the same interference power limit, channel
    capacity in fading environments exceeds that of the additive white Gaussian noise
    channel. The impacts of correlated fading and multiple primary receivers on the
    channel capacity were also studied. Asymptotic capacities under different fading
    distributions were derived. The work in 93 analyzed the ergodic capacity of secondary
    user system for different spectrum sharing strategies (underlay, overlay, and
    hybrid strategies) with one primary user and one secondary user. The analysis
    revealed that the maximum capacity in a spectrum underlay system can be achieved
    with reduced signaling complexity where the channel state information (CSI) between
    the secondary transmitter and the primary receiver may not be required for power
    allocation. In 94, the authors discovered a new way of spectrum sharing by exploiting
    the primary automatic repeat and request retransmissions for secondary user communications.
    The paper also avoided somewhat impractical assumptions such as complete CSI at
    the secondary transmitter. Xing et al. 110 presented a learning-based spectrum
    sharing protocol for spectrum-sharing wireless networks such that the weighted
    time fairness can be achieved among the different networks sharing the spectrum.
    4.4 Multiple access, resource allocation, and power control 4.4.1 Multiple access
    in spectrum underlay In a spectrum underlay scenario, the problem of optimal spectrum
    sharing among secondary users can be formulated as an optimization problem with
    a suitable objective function and a set of constraints that capture user fairness,
    quality of service (QoS) of secondary users, and interference constraints for
    primary users as follows: where U is the objective function, Ri is the achievable
    rate for secondary user i, Bi is the minimum rate requirement for user i, μj is
    the total interference created by secondary users at primary receiver j, hj,i
    denotes the channel gain from the transmitter of secondary user i to primary receiver
    j, Pi denotes transmission power of secondary transmitter i, and Ij denotes the
    maximum tolerable interference level at primary receiver j. Note that the preceding
    optimization problem may not be feasible when its constraints are too stringent
    and/or the network load is too high. If this is the case, an admission control
    mechanism needs to be invoked to limit the number of admitted secondary users.
    Then, the power allocation for the set of admitted secondary users can be performed.
    Using this framework, in 96, a solution approach was proposed for the joint admission
    control and power allocation problem for secondary users to achieve fairness among
    them, assuming CDMA technology at the PHY. A related spectrum sharing problem,
    which maximizes throughput of secondary networks, was solved in 97. To obtain
    the power allocation solutions, the instantaneous channel gains among secondary
    users and interference from secondary transmitters to primary receivers need to
    be estimated. In a practical scenario where only estimates of the average channel
    gains are available, the power allocations for the secondary transmitters need
    to be performed in a conservative way to satisfy the target interference constraint
    violation probability for primary receivers 98. The problem of sum-rate maximization
    for secondary transmitters under joint beamforming and power allocation in a CRN
    with multiple secondary transmitters and primary receivers (each with one antenna)
    was investigated in 100. The performance of a CRN could be enhanced by using multiple
    antennas at the secondary transmitters and/or secondary receivers. However, in
    this case, power allocations among the transmit antennas under total transmission
    power constraints and interference power constraints at the receiver antennas
    need to be jointly considered. Also, the trade-off between throughput and fairness
    in a multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) CRN needs to be modeled
    and analyzed. The work in 99 exploited multiple antennas at the secondary transmitter
    to maximize the CR''s transmission rate under the transmission power constraint
    and a set of interference power constraints. The authors demonstrated the effectiveness
    of using convex optimization for solving resource allocation problems for cognitive
    spectrum sharing. A survey on dynamic resource allocation schemes for CR systems
    with the interference temperature-based spectrum sharing model can be found in
    101. To maximize the secondary network throughput, the transmission power, bit
    rate, bandwidth, and antenna beam can be dynamically allocated according to the
    available CSI of the primary and secondary networks. Many new and challenging
    problems regarding the design of CR systems were formulated, and some of the corresponding
    solutions were shown to be obtainable by restructuring some classic results known
    for traditional (non-CR) wireless networks. 4.4.2 Multiple access in spectrum
    overlay In a spectrum overlay scenario, secondary users need to sense a frequency
    band of interest and transmit only if primary users are not detected on the chosen
    band. Therefore, no strict power control is required for this spectrum access
    paradigm. Either scheduling or random access-based multiple access techniques
    can be used 102, 103. In the former case, a scheduler (e.g., in a base station
    or an access point) makes the scheduling decisions based on the spectrum sensing
    results and/or the statistical information regarding channel availability. Generally,
    either a Markovian or independence assumption is made for channel availability.
    In the latter case, the secondary users need to discover the spectrum opportunities
    to access the channel(s) through a contention resolution and reservation process.
    The hardware constraints (i.e., partial spectrum sensing and spectrum aggregation
    limit) of secondary users need to be considered for a practical channel access
    protocol. The work in 104 studied the problem of optimal discovery of spectrum
    opportunities with MAC-layer sensing in CRNs. The objectives are to maximize the
    discovery of spectrum opportunities by adapting sensing periods and to minimize
    the delay in finding an available channel. The analysis defines sensing overhead
    and unexplored opportunity, and optimizes these factors. The sensing overhead
    is the average fraction of time during which a channel''s discovered opportunities
    are interrupted and not utilized because of sensing of one of the channels. The
    unexplored opportunity is the average fraction of time during which the channel''s
    opportunities are not discovered in the case that the channel is being periodically
    sensed with its sensing period. The optimal channel sequencing can be obtained
    from the probability that the channel would be idle at a certain time on the basis
    of the previous samples. The proposed approach requires the estimation of the
    underlying channel-usage patterns with an on/off alternating renewal channel.
    The distribution parameters of on/off periods are estimated by maximum likelihood
    estimators and their confidence intervals. With a Markovian assumption on channel
    availability, the work in 105 proposed a decentralized cognitive medium access
    method in a single-user scenario, which allows a secondary user to independently
    search for spectrum opportunities without a central coordinator or a dedicated
    communication channel. An analytical framework was developed from the theory of
    partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). However, the optimal policy
    for a general POMDP can be computationally prohibitive because of the exponential
    growth of the dimension of the sufficient statistic. The authors proposed a greedy
    approach that maximizes per-slot throughput. This decision-theoretic approach
    integrates the design of spectrum access with spectrum sensing at the PHY and
    traffic statistics determined by the application layer of the primary network.
    An opportunistic user makes optimal decisions for sensing and access on the basis
    of the belief vector that summarizes the knowledge of the network state on the
    basis of all past decisions and observations. With an independence assumption
    on channel availability, Jia et al. 106 proposed a hardware-constrained multichannel
    cognitive MAC protocol considering the trade-off between exploring more idle channels
    and encountering more sensing overhead. The channel access problem was formulated
    as a well-defined optimal stopping problem. The objective is to choose a time
    to stop spectrum sensing (probing) such that the expected reward is maximized.
    The decision is either to stop and receive the known reward or to continue and
    observe the channel status (i.e., the 0–1 (occupied/idle) state of the channel
    probed) for further decision. This problem can be solved by the backward induction
    method. A similar case of correlated traffic from primary users was also considered
    in 107. 4.4.3 Cross-layer multiple access In 108, the authors characterized quantitatively
    the interaction between the physical and MAC layers. In particular, they demonstrated
    how the sensing errors at the PHY layer affect the MAC design and how incorporating
    the MAC layer information into PHY leads to a cognitive spectrum sensor whose
    performance improves over time by learning from accumulating observations. The
    cross-layer channel access problem was formulated as a constrained POMDP. It was
    shown that there exists a separation principle in the optimal joint design of
    channel access that circumvents the curse of dimensionality in general POMDPs
    and leads to closed-form optimal solutions. Su and Zhang 111 proposed a cross-layer-based
    opportunistic channel access protocol that integrates spectrum sensing at the
    PHY and packet scheduling at the MAC layer. The authors assumed that each secondary
    user is equipped with two transceivers. One transceiver is tuned to the dedicated
    control channel, and another transceiver is used to periodically sense and dynamically
    use the identified unused channels. Two channel spectrum-sensing policies, namely,
    the random sensing policy and the negotiation-based sensing policy, were considered.
    Under the random sensing policy, each secondary user randomly selects one of the
    channels for sensing with a uniform distribution. Under the negotiation-based
    sensing policy, each secondary user attempts to select a channel for sensing by
    overhearing the control packets in the control channel. The authors developed
    an M ∕ GY  ∕ 1-based queuing model to analyze the performance of the proposed
    multichannel MAC protocols under the two types of channel-sensing policies for
    both the saturation and nonsaturation conditions. The analyses revealed the trade-off
    between throughput and delay, which would be useful in supporting the different
    QoS requirements in CRNs. In multichannel CRNs, one important issue is how a secondary
    user chooses the sequence of channel sensing such that the best idle channel can
    be identified within the shortest time, thus maximizing the throughput of the
    secondary user. Jiang et al. 112 considered the optimal channel sensing order
    by formulating and solving a dynamic program. This optimal sensing order is part
    of a cognitive MAC that can be implemented given a spectrum sensing technique
    in the PHY. In the simplest case, Jiang et al. 112 first showed that the intuitive
    sensing order (i.e., descending order of the channel availability probabilities)
    is optimal. Then, the model was extended for the system with adaptive modulation
    transmission, when the probability of an idle channel is known. Finally, the most
    complex scenario, where the probability of an idle channel is unknown and there
    is a sensing error, was also considered. Cross-layer design and optimization can
    be applied for multiple access of CR nodes. In this case, the MAC protocol can
    utilize information from protocols in other layers (e.g., physical and network
    layers) to optimize its performance. However, the cross-layer approach may suffer
    from losing independency of the protocols in different layers. That is, operation
    of a protocol in one layer would then depend on the state of protocols in other
    layers. Nevertheless, a few work studied the benefits of a cross-layer design
    in CRNs. Su and Zhang 113 integrated spectrum sensing in the PHY with the MAC
    protocol. Specifically, two collaborative spectrum sensing policies, namely, random
    sensing and negotiation based spectrum sensing policies were introduced. Whereas
    the former is a simple policy where secondary users can decide on spectrum sensing
    and access randomly and independently, the latter allows coordination so that
    the secondary users choose different channels to sense and access. Jalaeian and
    Motani 114 studied the use of location information of a primary user to optimize
    the PHY–MAC protocol of secondary users. The location information is obtained
    through observing the received signal strength (RSS) indicator and direction of
    the signal from an antenna array. A collaborative sensing algorithm was proposed
    to utilize this location information and optimize the spectrum access given the
    interference constraint to the primary user. A similar problem was also studied
    in 115 with the reporting overhead taken into account. 4.4.4 Power control In
    116, the authors discussed the coexistence of the primary and cognitive users
    in the same spectrum by using power allocation strategies at the CRs such that
    the interference power experienced by the primary receiver is limited. The work
    considered various combinations of peak/average transmission and interference
    power constraints and studied the power allocation strategies to achieve the ergodic,
    delay-limited, and outage capacities of the CR system. Different fading channel
    models such as Rayleigh, Nakagami, and lognormal shadowing were considered. The
    OFDM-based transmission technology is particularly promising for CRNs using spectrum
    overlay. However, OFDM transmission causes mutual interference between the primary
    and secondary users due to the nonorthogonality of the transmitted signals. The
    amount of interference depends on the power allocated in the subcarriers as well
    as the spectral distance between subcarriers used by the primary and secondary
    users. In 117, the authors investigated the optimal power loading problem to maximize
    the transmission data rate while maintaining the interference caused to the primary
    users within a given limit. The work was extended in 118 considering different
    statistical interference constraints imposed by different primary receivers where
    the probability that the interference introduced by secondary user''s transmission
    in the ith subcarrier to the lth primary receiver is less than the interference
    limit must be greater than a . Hasan et al. 120 considered the problem of energy-efficient
    power allocation for maximizing the expected transmission rate for OFDM-based
    CR systems. The reliability of the available sub-bands (which depends on sensing
    error and primary user''s activity), sub-band power constraints, and total allowed
    interference limit to the adjacent primary user bands were taken into account.
    The authors considered an energy-aware capacity expression through the factor
    called subcarrier availability. A convex optimization problem was formulated,
    which incorporates a linear average rate loss function in the optimization objective
    to include the effect of subcarrier availability. The objective function is to
    maximize the capacity minus cost due to transmit power. Because of the complex
    structure of the optimal solution, the authors proposed three suboptimal schemes,
    namely, the step-ladder, nulling, and scaling schemes, to redistribute the power
    within the sub-bands, which share boundaries with the primary users’ bands. The
    step-ladder scheme assigns lower power to subcarriers closer to primary users’
    bands with a step size that could be either constant or proportional to the interference
    caused to a primary user. For the nulling mechanism, zero power is allocated to
    subcarriers adjacent to the primary user band (one-nulling), or zero power is
    allocated to two subcarriers closest to primary user band on each side (two-nulling).
    Finally, the scaling scheme allocates the power that satisfies the interference
    criterion strictly by scaling down the power to the function on the total interference
    threshold prescribed by primary user bands. The worst-case complexity of the algorithm
    is O(MN), where M is the number of groups of the available sub-bands and N is
    the available subcarriers to the secondary user for opportunistic access using
    OFDM. Phunchongharn and Hossain 121 extended the traditional scheduling and power
    control problems by considering their robustness for cognitive spatial-reuse time
    division multiple access networks. The objective is to minimize the transmission
    length (in terms of time slots) of the secondary links under their minimum QoS
    requirements without violating the maximum tolerable interference limit for the
    primary receivers. Because of the stochastic nature of wireless link gains, the
    power allocation based on average (or estimated) link gains can be improper. To
    overcome the improper power allocation, the channel gain uncertainty is modeled
    by ellipsoid. Because an optimal solution cannot be obtained owing to the NP-completeness
    of the problem, the authors proposed a distributed two-stage algorithm based on
    the distributed column generation method to obtain the near-optimal solution for
    the robust transmission schedules in an ad hoc CRN. 4.5 Distributed learning,
    adaptation, self-configuration, and coexistence Learning, adaptation, and self-configuration
    are fundamental functions of CR. Secondary users should be able to observe spectrum
    state and learn the status of a primary user and then optimize and adapt the transmission
    so that the secondary users can achieve their performance target while minimizing
    interference to the primary user. Self-configuration is also an important functionality
    for the secondary users to determine a set of optimal system parameters. The self-configuration
    capability generally relates to a long-term setting (e.g., frequency band and
    maximum transmission range), whereas the DSA is concerned about a short-term action
    (e.g., transmit power in each time slot). The main objective is to ensure that
    a secondary user can coexist with primary users and other secondary users amicably.
    The work in 126 described the motivations, architecture, functionality, design,
    and implementation of cognitive networks applicable to both wired and wireless
    networks. A cognitive process to learn from past decisions and use this learning
    to influence future behavior is the foundation for such networks. In 127, the
    authors proposed a game-theoretic framework to analyze the behavior of CRs for
    distributed adaptive channel allocation. The objective is to choose the frequency
    channels that maximize the reward function. Two different reward functions are
    formulated to capture the utility of selfish users (U1) and cooperative users
    (U2), respectively. U1 values a channel based on the level of interference perceived
    on that particular channel, whereas U2 accounts for the interference seen by a
    user on a particular channel, as well as the interference this particular choice
    will create to neighboring nodes. The authors demonstrated that the channel allocation
    problem can be formulated as a potential game, and thus, it converges to a deterministic
    channel allocation Nash equilibrium point. Although the game with the utility
    function given by U2 fits the framework of an exact potential game, the function
    U1 lacks the necessary symmetry properties that will ensure the existence of a
    potential function. To analyze the behavior of the selfish user game, the authors
    resorted to the implementation of adaptation protocols using the no-external-regret
    learning algorithm with exponential updates. By the proposed learning adaptation
    process, the CR users learn how to choose the channels that maximize their rewards
    through repeatedly playing the game. The no-regret learning provides performance
    similar to that of the potential game when cooperation is enforced, but with a
    higher variability across users. However, the learning formulation is particularly
    useful to accommodate selfish users. Noncooperative learning games have the advantage
    of very low overhead for information exchange in the network, whereas the cooperative
    learning game improves the overall network performance at the expense of increased
    overhead required for information exchange. Note that the case of nonconvex game
    was considered in 128. In 129, the authors provided a comprehensive survey on
    the use of artificial intelligence for CRNs. It reviewed different implementations
    of CR that are designed on the basis of intelligent algorithms including artificial
    neural networks (ANNs), metaheuristic algorithms, hidden Markov models (HMMs),
    rule-based systems, ontology-based systems (OBSs), and case-based systems (CBSs).
    He et al. 129 also discussed the issues related to the selection of intelligent
    algorithms (e.g., responsiveness, complexity, security, robustness, and stability)
    for CRNs. The work in 130 introduced an innovative method of designing CR by adopting
    the human behavior model. The concepts of a homo egaulis society, a homo parochius
    society, and a homo reciprocans society in social science are discussed in the
    CR context with illustration. The work in 131 used the machine learning techniques
    in CR, in contrast to the traditional methods that rely on the policy-based and
    hard-coded approaches and presented a concrete model of a generic CR with learning
    engine. The work in 132 considered the problem of aggregated interference management
    due to multiple CRs using ideas from artificial intelligence. The IEEE 802.22
    standard was modeled as the multi-agent system where agents are the secondary
    base stations supporting and controlling the data transmission of secondary users.
    A real-time multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithm (i.e., decentralized
    Q-learning algorithm) was introduced to manage the aggregated interference. Both
    complete and partial information cases were evaluated in which the optimal and
    suboptimal solutions were obtained, respectively. The computational and memory
    requirements for implementations of these reinforcement algorithms were evaluated.
    The work in 133 adopted the concept of Bayesian nonparametric learning algorithm
    to optimize the repeated spectrum auction in a CRN. The repeated spectrum auction
    was used, which considers the monitoring and entry costs of the secondary users
    to bid for the radio resource from the primary users. Because the knowledge of
    the secondary users about other users is limited owing to the distributed environment,
    a secondary user learns from experience using a Bayesian nonparametric belief
    update scheme and adapts the bidding strategies accordingly. From this belief,
    the secondary user decides to join the auction or not. In addition, the bidding
    strategy was proved to be optimal. In 135, the authors considered the multi-user
    distributed DSA problem in a spectrum overlay scenario based on game-theoretic
    learning. In particular, a CSMA protocol was considered, and a game theoretic
    correlated equilibrium was achieved. In 136, the authors considered CRNs for delay-critical
    applications using game theory and learning algorithm. Previously, the CR was
    believed to be useful only for non-real-time applications (e.g., best-effort applications).
    However, by using advanced techniques in optimization and artificial intelligence,
    this paper proved the feasibility of deploying real-time applications (e.g., multimedia)
    in CRNs. This paper presented centralized and decentralized spectrum market models
    based on the stochastic game framework. The work in 137 proposed the use of neural
    network from the field of artificial intelligence to implement dynamic spectrum
    selection in CRNs. A neural network-based cognitive engine was developed to learn
    from the environmental measurement on the different channels. Then, the algorithm
    chooses the channel with the highest chance to yielded the best performance based
    on the result from the cognitive engine. Experimental measurement based on the
    testbed implementation was conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed
    CR design. The work in 138 also adopted a neural network to predict the availability
    of the spectrum for CR users. With a multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network,
    where the training data are assumed to be available, the accuracy of the spectrum
    prediction by the secondary user can be improved significantly. Therefore, a secondary
    user can efficiently access the available spectrum without collision with the
    transmission by the primary users. The authors in 139 investigated on distributed
    learning of channel availability statistics and channel access in CRNs and present
    distributed channel access policies based on the results on classical multi-armed
    bandit problem. For these policies, the bounds on the regrets were obtained. The
    work in 140 presented a novel learning-based approach for DSA by secondary users
    in a spectrum overlay scenario where the probability of collision with the primary
    users needs to be bounded. This approach significantly outperforms the traditional
    listen-before-talk approach. 4.6 Multihop transmission, routing, spectrum mobility,
    and cross-layer optimization In multihop CRNs 141, CR users communicate with each
    other in a local area in either a centralized or an ad hoc manner. Hence, route
    selection plays an important role in multihop cognitive networks. A local coordination-based
    routing scheme for multihop cognitive networks was proposed in 142. In 143, joint
    routing, subband division, and scheduling scheme for multihop CRNs were considered.
    In 145, a cross-layer optimal scheduling algorithm was proposed for cooperative
    multihop CRNs. In this network, secondary users help primary users to transmit
    in a multihop fashion, and the secondary users receive a spectrum opportunity
    for their transmission in return. The analysis was developed to achieve optimal
    throughput for the primary users, where the upper bound was derived. To exploit
    the time-varying channel opportunities and provide QoS requirements to the users
    and save transmission power, the authors in 148 considered joint dynamic rate
    allocation, routing, and spectrum sharing scheme for multihop cognitive networks.
    In 143, the authors studied the problem of multihop networking with CR nodes.
    For the CRN, each node has a pool of frequency bands (typically of unequal size)
    that can be used for data transmission. The difference in the bandwidth among
    the available frequency bands provokes the need to divide these bands into sub-bands
    for optimal spectrum sharing. The authors characterized the behaviors and constraints
    for a multihop CRN from multiple layers, including the modeling of spectrum sharing
    and sub-band division, scheduling and interference constraints, and flow routing.
    The objective is to minimize the required network-wide radio spectrum resource
    for a set of user sessions. The problem can be formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear
    programming (MINLP). However, this MINLP problem is NP-hard. Therefore, the authors
    developed a lower bound to estimate the objective function by relaxing the integer
    variables and using a linearization technique. Simulation results showed that
    the solutions obtained by the proposed algorithm are very close to the lower bounds
    obtained via the proposed relaxation. Therefore, the solution produced by the
    algorithm is nearly optimal. The work in 122 studied the data-link-layer QoS performance
    measures for CR users in an infrastructure-based DSA environment. The authors
    developed a queuing analytic framework with a discrete-time Markov chain and derived
    important QoS measures. The model considers primary users’ activity as a two-state
    Markov chain, CR users’ channel activity as a finite state Markov chain, bursty
    traffic arrival pattern at the CR user ends, and correlated channel fading. The
    authors provided a step-by-step procedure to derive the delay distribution, average
    throughput, and packet loss rate for the CR users. The delay distribution can
    be derived by considering an absorbing Markov chain. The proposed framework has
    important applications including cross-layer analysis and design for improved
    QoS experience and model-based admission control in CRNs. There have been only
    a few work on spectrum hand-off and its effect on the performance of CRNs. In
    123, the authors outlined the research issues and challenges related to spectrum
    mobility in the context of spectrum management process for CRNs. The work in 124
    comprehensively modeled the effects of spectrum hand-off and spectrum management
    methods on the call-level QoS performance of secondary users. The work in 125
    demonstrated spectrum hand-off and spectrum mobility features of CR (based on
    noncontiguous multicarrier transmission) using SDR. Robustness and security are
    important issues in the development of CRNs. In the next section, we review the
    existing literature on security and robustness in CRNs. 5 Robustness and Security
    of Cognitive Radio Networks A CRN could be vulnerable to different types of attacks,
    which could degrade the performance considerably. Clancy and Goergen 149 provided
    a comprehensive study and analysis on the security issues in a CRN. The CR devices
    could wrongly learn from the environment and be taught by malicious users. Various
    attacks (e.g., sensory manipulation attacks against policy radios, belief manipulation
    attacks against learning radios, and self-propagating behavior leading to CR viruses)
    can use this approach. To address the problem, different methods were discussed.
    Firstly, the robust sensory input can be performed by allowing the secondary users
    to run a cross-correlation algorithm to determine the difference between noise
    and malicious signal. Secondly, all possible states of the environment must be
    enumerated to obtain a complete knowledge so that the secondary user will be aware
    of an attack. Thirdly, multiple secondary users can cooperate to form a group
    and exchange information if there is an attack. Each of these methods has some
    drawbacks. The cross-correlation algorithm could be too complicated to implement
    in a typical secondary node. State enumeration requires too much memory and a
    too long execution time of a secondary user. Finally, forming a group and exchanging
    information could incur an unacceptable overhead in a network. Alternatively,
    some defense mechanisms for CRs against the attack (e.g., using trust network)
    were also mentioned. In a CR system, it is important to distinguish between the
    signals from primary and secondary users. Especially, in a hostile environment,
    the attacker may use a modified air interface to imitate the signal of primary
    users, making secondary users unable to access the spectrum. Chen et al. 150 systematically
    showed that the aforementioned attack can result in severe interference and significantly
    reduce spectrum utilization. To solve the problem, the authors proposed a transmitter
    verification scheme, namely, the localization-based defense (LocDef) scheme. This
    LocDef scheme is able to identify whether the signal is from a primary user or
    not by using an estimated location of the transmitter (i.e., based on a noninteractive
    localization technique) and characteristics of the signal itself (i.e., RSS).
    They 150 considered the log-loss signal propagation model, in which the expected
    RSS is given by μ = P + β0 + β1 ln d, where d is the distance between actual primary
    transmitter and secondary receiver, P is the transmission power, and β0 and β1
    are constants for a particular environment. The value of RSS is then smoothed
    to extract the important pattern, and the RSS peak can be used to identify the
    primary transmitter. In 151, the authors considered incumbent emulation and spectrum
    sensing data falsification attacks (Figure 2), which can degrade the performance
    of distributed spectrum sensing in CRNs. In particular, an attacker (e.g., malicious
    secondary user) tries to gain priority over other secondary users by transmitting
    signal emulating that of a primary user (i.e., incumbent emulation) or reporting
    false spectrum sensing data (i.e., spectrum sensing data falsification). Defense
    methods against these attacks were introduced. For the incumbent emulation attack,
    defense methods based on distance ratio test and distance difference test were
    considered. The distance ratio test uses the RSS obtained from the pair of location
    verifiers (e.g., dedicated spectrum sensor devices or secondary user devices)
    to verify the location of the transmitter. However, the distance ratio test suffers
    from channel fading and shadowing and may not yield the accurate distance to the
    transmitter. The distance difference test uses the relative phase difference of
    the signal obtained at a pair of location verifiers to verify the transmitter.
    The distance difference test needs synchronization among location verifiers to
    obtain the accurate result. For the spectrum sensing falsification attack, the
    attacker tries to manipulate the spectrum sensing at the spectrum sensors or data
    collector (i.e., fusion center). Different methods related to the data fusion
    techniques were considered against the spectrum sensing falsification attack,
    that is, decision fusion, Bayesian detection 152, and Neyman–Pearson test. In
    the decision fusion method, the sensing results from spectrum sensors are compared
    with the rule (e.g., threshold based). In the Bayesian detection, the knowledge
    of a priori conditional probabilities of the spectrum sensing is used to detect
    the attack. In the Neyman–Pearson test, the maximum acceptable probability of
    false alarm or the maximum acceptable probability of misdetection is used to determine
    the presence of an attack. Figure 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spectrum
    emulation attack. The work in 153 and 154 developed a defense strategy against
    the primary user emulation attack. The passive anti-primary user emulation attack
    approach here is similar to the random frequency hopping used for anti-jamming
    in traditional wireless networks. In this approach, the defender randomly switches
    the channel to sense and access so that the defender can escape from the attack
    on a particular channel by the attacker. In 153 (unlike that in 154), the channel
    statistics (e.g., availability probability) were assumed to be known. In 153,
    the attack and the defense mechanisms were modeled as a zero-sum game. The actions
    of the attacker and the defender are the channel to jam and to perform channel
    sensing, respectively. The payoff of the attacker is a constant reward if the
    attacker successfully attacks the defender, and zero otherwise. Similarly, the
    payoff of the defender is the same constant reward if the defender can successfully
    avoid the attack by the attacker, and zero otherwise. The Nash equilibrium was
    analyzed for this game. The metric named anti-jamming efficiency (AJE) is introduced
    to measure the outcome of the game, which is defined as follows: (1) The exact
    expression for anti-jamming efficiency was derived. The analysis in 153 also considered
    the multiple-stage case. The problem is simplified because of the partial observation
    of channel sensing and imperfect monitoring. A POMDP was formulated and solved
    for the secondary user defender to optimally sense and access the channel. The
    work in 154 extended the analysis of a primary user emulation attack for the unknown
    channel statistics case. The secondary user as the defender must address the uncertainty
    in the channel statistics and time-varying policy of the attacker. The defender
    therefore has to learn and adapt the channel selection policy accordingly. In
    155, the authors considered the problem of malicious secondary users deliberately
    sending false reports in collaborative spectrum sensing. This is the spectrum
    sensing falsification attack. In a CR system, the secondary users sense the channel
    independently. Then, the secondary users report to the data collector where the
    OR rule is applied to determine the final spectrum sensing result. A method based
    on the double-sided neighbor distance algorithm was proposed to detect attacks.
    T-dimensional space data, where T is the number of spectrum sensing periods, were
    used for detection. The distance (e.g., Euclidean, Hamming, and double-sided neighbor)
    was calculated from these historical sensing data, which are used to identify
    the outlier secondary user far away from most secondary users in the history space.
    Performance evaluation was carried out to analyze the probability that the malicious
    user sends a sensing result different from that sent by the secondary user. In
    addition to the technical considerations, the design, optimization, and deployment
    of CRNs will be affected by economic considerations. In particular, market mechanisms
    will be used in designing efficient spectrum allocation and sharing methods. In
    the following section, we survey the related work on different issues related
    to the economics of CR. 6 Economics of Cognitive Radio Networks In a CR system,
    pricing is an important issue, which motivates the primary and secondary users
    to share the available spectrum through a process often called spectrum trading
    156. Spectrum trading is the mechanism for the entities in a CR system (e.g.,
    primary and secondary users, spectrum owner and users, and service provider and
    subscriber) to exchange the radio resources. The exchange could be performed through
    money or through different forms of resources (i.e., bartering). In spectrum trading,
    the primary users or service providers attempt to sell unused spectrum resources
    to secondary users for monetary gains, and the secondary users attempt to buy
    these resources to achieve their desired communication goals. Two major approaches
    for spectrum trading are based on auction and open market. 6.1 Spectrum auction
    Auction is a traditional but efficient way to distribute commodity and services
    to the customers. The theory of auction can be naturally applied to CR systems
    because the price of a radio spectrum cannot be determined precisely in advance
    157. In an auction, the primary users submit their asks, and the secondary users
    submit their bids to sell and buy a radio resource, respectively. Different auction
    models have been applied to CR (e.g., single-sided, double-sided, English, Dutch,
    Vickrey–Clarke—Groves, and combinatorial auctions). In 158, an auction-based algorithm
    (second-price auction mechanism) was developed, which helps the wireless users
    to compete for channels in a fair manner. In this auction, the users bid for a
    channel given the channel state. The users can optimize their bids to maximize
    the throughput under the budget constraint. Game theory was applied to analyze
    the bidding strategies of users, and it was shown that the Nash equilibrium exists,
    which also leads to the unique allocation of channel under certain channel state
    distribution. In 159, different auction models (i.e., single-object pay-as-bid
    ascending clock auction [ACA-S], traditional ascending clock auction [ACA-T],
    and alternative ascending clock auction [ACA-A]) were proposed to sell the spectrum
    of a primary user to multiple secondary users. A multimedia streaming application
    with delay requirement was considered for secondary users to bid for the spectrum.
    All of the proposed auction algorithms (i.e., ACA-S, ACA-T, and ACA-A) are distributed,
    and all of them converge within a finite number of auction rounds. Kasbekar and
    Sarkar 160 considered a spectrum auction in which a regulator sells channels for
    primary and secondary networks. The primary network on each channel has higher
    priority to transmit data than that of secondary networks, whereas all secondary
    networks have the same priority. Two objectives were considered, that is, to maximize
    revenue of regulator (i.e., an auctioneer) and to maximize social welfare (i.e.,
    sum of the valuations of all networks). Different algorithms were developed for
    these objectives. It was also shown that the optimal channel access allocation
    algorithm of dependent bids (i.e., the network has some knowledge or belief about
    transmission pattern of other networks) is an NP-complete problem. Then, for the
    case of independent bids, a dynamic programming algorithm was developed to solve
    the channel access allocation problem. Sodagari et al. 161 studied the truthfulness
    of secondary users to inform the valuation and arrival–departure period in the
    spectrum auction performed by the primary user. The spectrum has an expiry constraint,
    where the spectrum is available only for a certain period. In this auction, the
    secondary users have an incentive to misreport the valuation and arrival–departure
    period to gain more spectrum allocation from the primary users. Therefore, to
    avoid such misreporting, the channel allocation and pricing schemes were introduced
    to minimize the impact of false information. To adapt the bidding strategy competitively,
    the bidders (e.g., secondary users) must have knowledge of other opponents. However,
    information about other bidders may not be available publicly, and the bidders
    must learn from past auction results and history. In a CR, this learning capability
    can be implemented for auction 162, 163. In 162, a learning algorithm was adopted
    to optimize the repeated spectrum auction in a CRN. A repeated spectrum auction
    that considers the monitoring and entry costs of the secondary users to bid for
    the radio resource from the primary users was used. Because in a distributed environment
    the knowledge of secondary users about other users is limited, the secondary users
    learn from experience by a Bayesian nonparametric belief update scheme and adapt
    the bidding strategies accordingly. From this belief, the secondary user decides
    to join the auction or not. In addition, the bidding strategy was proven to be
    optimal. 6.2 Price competition in open market Unlike an auction, which needs an
    auctioneer to control the trading, in an open market model, the primary users
    and secondary users are free to sell and buy radio resources, respectively. Because
    there is no control, the pricing strategy of primary users plays an important
    role here, which determines the revenue generated by the primary users. Also,
    pricing influences the decision of the secondary users to buy the radio resource.
    A competitive pricing scheme based on a noncooperative game among multiple primary
    networks was proposed in 164. A static game model and a dynamic game model were
    introduced with and without global information, respectively. In the dynamic game
    model without complete global information, the primary networks can adjust their
    pricing strategies to reach the Nash equilibrium. In addition to noncooperative
    pricing, collusion among the primary users was analyzed, in which if collusion
    happens, the primary networks will adopt a cooperative pricing scheme instead
    of a competitive one. In 165, a joint power/channel allocation scheme based on
    a distributed pricing approach was presented. The spectrum allocation was modeled
    as a noncooperative game where the players are CR users. A price-based iterative
    water-filling algorithm was introduced to reach the Nash equilibrium solution.
    The game theory can model the behavior of CR users with self-interest, and therefore,
    the game-theoretic models are very useful in modeling and optimization of dynamic
    spectrum sharing networks 166. With game-theoretic models, it is possible to design
    DSA methods that can achieve flexibility, efficiency, and fairness. The work in
    167 adopted a dynamic game model to analyze competitive spectrum sharing. The
    importance of the work in 167 lies in the consideration of dynamic behavior of
    strategy adaptation of primary users to sell the radio spectrum. In this case,
    the convergence and the optimality of strategy adaptation were evaluated. The
    conditions to ensure the stability of strategy adaptation are derived, which would
    be useful for the primary users to avoid undesirable fluctuations. In the most
    general scenario, spectrum trading in a CR system may involve multiple spectrum
    sellers and buyers. In 168, the authors developed a spectrum trading framework
    for this general spectrum trading scenario (Figure 3). An evolutionary game model
    was used for the spectrum selection of secondary users when choosing the primary
    user (or service providers) to buy spectrum from. A hierarchical game model was
    presented to obtain the equilibrium solution for the primary users in selecting
    the spectrum price to maximize their profit given the performance degradation
    of the primary users due to sharing available spectrum with the secondary users.
    The collusive behavior of users could be a significant threat to efficient dynamic
    spectrum allocation in a distributed CRN. Ji and Liu 169 presented a systematic
    approach to avoid collusion in CR. In 169, the spectrum allocation with multiple
    selfish legacy spectrum holders and unlicensed users was modeled as a multistage
    dynamic game, and a pricing-based distributed collusion-resistant spectrum allocation
    approach was used to optimize overall spectrum efficiency. Yang et al. 170 studied
    price-based spectrum access control in which the primary users sell spectrum to
    secondary users. The secondary users compete with each other through random access.
    Therefore, the concept of “price of contention” was introduced. Decentralized
    pricing mechanisms were developed for the monopoly and multiple primary user market.
    The solution in terms of a Nash equilibrium was considered. Toroujeni et al. 171
    considered spectrum leasing problem between primary and secondary users. A noncooperative
    game was formulated to determine the optimal parameters. Figure 3 Open in figure

    and buyers 168. For the deployment of practical CR systems, development of simulation
    tools, testbeds, and hardware prototypes are essential. The simulation tools provide
    the capability for the hardware, software, and protocol developers, engineers,
    and researchers to test and evaluate the design and new concepts for CRs with
    low cost, small effort, and short time. In addition, the testbed and the hardware
    platforms can be used to develop prototypes for investigation and experimentation
    of the actual CR systems. In the next section, we review the simulation tools,
    testbeds, and hardware prototypes developed for CR systems. 7 Cognitive Radio
    Simulation Tools, Testbeds and Hardware Prototypes A few work in the literature
    have introduced and reported simulation tools, testbeds, and hardware prototypes
    for CR. Pereira et al. 172 described a simulation tool for performance evaluation
    and assessment of a CRN with existence of multiple wireless systems (i.e., cellular
    networks and opportunistic networks, which are primary and secondary users, respectively).
    The simulation tool considers the high-speed downlink packet access, hybrid automatic
    repeat and request, and adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) features for CRs.
    Zhan et al. 173 presented a CR simulation platform. A customizable and extensible
    platform based on C/C++ language was developed. The major components in the platform
    are the network topology, channel access of a primary user, mobility model, protocols
    (e.g., MAC and routing), traffic scheduling, and physical wireless channel. The
    platform has a set of performance measures to be obtained, including throughput,
    spectrum efficiency, packet loss rate, jitter, and delay. Sibille 174 considered
    the issue of random number generation used for frequency-dependent spatial correlation
    and position applicable for CR simulations. It was argued that the Kronecker approximation
    cannot account for the dependence. Therefore, a new method that uses nonassociative
    left and right products of user-dependent frequency correlation matrices and frequency-dependent
    spatial correlation matrices was introduced. Whereas the study in 174 concerned
    only a random number generator, the work in 173 provided a complete set of simulation
    modules for CR. Abidi 175 provided a comprehensive survey on the design methodologies
    for constructing flexible SDR receiver for CR based on the concept proposed by
    Mitola 176, 177 (Figure 4). The receiver should be able to receive data on a channel
    with any band from 800 MHz to 6 GHz and any bandwidth. The design of the receiver
    is proposed to have a digital front-end that can be tuned electronically. Then,
    the analog baseband samples the channel of interest at zero intermediate frequency
    (IF). The clock-programmable downsampling is applied with the embedded filtering.
    With this design, the receiver can change the operating frequency band dynamically.
    The use of this design in CDMA requires the system to operate in full-duplex mode
    (i.e., the transmitter and the receiver operate simultaneously) and the ability
    of the receiver to operate on multiple channels concurrently. Figure 4 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Software-defined radio introduced by Mitola 176 177.
    Mishra et al. 178 introduced a real-time CR testbed for PHY and link-layer experiments.
    This testbed is based on the Berkeley Emulation Engine 2 (BEE2), which is a multi-FPGA
    emulation platform. By using BEE2, the testbed can connect to 18 radio front ends,
    and these front ends can be set to be the primary and secondary users in various
    test scenarios. In addition, by using FPGA, the testbed can simultaneously operate
    on multiple radios, which is suitable for complex experiments and performance
    studies involving high-speed low-latency links. Cabric et al. 179 discussed the
    design and implementation of a UWB CR for high-data-rate communications with very
    low transmission power. The design of ultra-low-power baseband, impulse-UWB transceiver
    front end, and digital backend implementation was introduced. In addition, the
    authors reported a testbed implementation based on the BEE2. In 180, the design
    of an SDR from a low-power analog-to-digital converter perspective was introduced.
    The design is based on the windowed integration sampler and clock-programmable
    discrete-time analog filters. By using a low-noise amplifier (LNA) and a wide-tuning-range
    synthesizer, the wideband RF front end can operate on any frequency between 800 MHz
    and 6 GHz. The wideband LNA can achieve a good performance (e.g., 18–20 dB of
    maximum gain). The performance evaluation was performed on the GSM and the IEEE
    802.11g standards. There are a number of wireless testbeds with cognitive networking
    capabilities that have been developed in the academia and they differ in terms
    of the scale of the network, the degrees of experimental control and isolation
    they offer, and the indoor and/or outdoor nature of the deployment and measurement
    environment 3. They are based on the off-the-shelf radio technologies such as
    Wi-Fi and WiMAX technologies. A variety of software radio platforms for base stations,
    client nodes, spectrum sensors, and different RF sources or users are used in
    these testbeds. These platforms are generally capable of implementing different
    modulation algorithms, MAC protocols, and adaptation methods. Examples of the
    testbeds include the CMU emulator 181, the ORBIT radio grid testbed 182, the “DieselNet”
    testbed 183, and the “CitySense” network 184. The CMU wireless network emulator
    testbed has 15 nodes (with 802.11b or Bluetooth interfaces), and it supports the
    entire 2.4-GHz ISM band. The nodes communicate through the emulator, which is
    an FGGA-based central DSP engine, and this emulator models the effects of wireless
    signal propagation. The ORBIT radio grid testbed, which contains 400 programmable
    radio nodes in an area of 5000 ft 2, is also based on an emulator, and the testbed
    can be accessed through an Internet portal. It supports end-to-end wired and wireless
    experiments. Also, the testbed includes an outdoor field trial system. Examples
    of CR platforms include WiNC2R CR board 185, the Kansas University Agile Radio
    186, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency Wireless Network after Next
    CR 187, the Universal Software Radio Peripheral and GNU radio software architecture
    188, and the RICE WARP board 189. In general, these platforms consist of RF transceiver
    modules, digital processing boards, and networking interfaces/modules, and they
    are supported by software architectures such as GNU. 8 Future Trends in Cognitive
    Radio Networking Research and Open Issues In this section, we summarize future
    trends in CR networking research, which include the cooperative and CR communications,
    CRs for the emerging LTE-Advanced networks, and CR applications. Also, the major
    open research issues are outlined. 8.1 Cooperative and cognitive communications
    Relay-based communication is a powerful approach to combat channel fading, extend
    transmission coverage, and improve system capacity 190. This approach can be also
    used for CRNs to improve the network capacity, reduce interference to primary
    users, and achieve fairness in data transmission among the CR users 191-196. However,
    because of the different spectrum availability at the CR nodes (i.e., transmitter,
    receiver, and relay) in a cognitive relay network, the traditional relay-based
    communication approaches cannot be directly applied. The relay-assisted cognitive
    transmission can be divided into two main scenarios, that is, cooperative transmission
    between secondary users 197, 198 and cooperative transmission between primary
    users and secondary users 199, 191. In the first scenario, the secondary users
    act as a relay to assist only secondary user''s transmissions. In the second scenario,
    each secondary relay cooperates by relaying primary user''s signal to its primary
    receiver, and as an incentive, each secondary relay gets an opportunity to transmit
    in the same spectrum that is used by the primary user. One of the most difficult
    challenges in relay-based cognitive systems is the design of MAC protocols that
    are able to utilize the best relay and the spectrum opportunities for the optimal
    performance. A centralized relay-assisted MAC protocol was presented in 191, 194
    for relay-assisted cognitive networks. For resource allocation in relay-based
    CRNs, in addition to power and rate allocation, the channel and relay allocations
    are also important because the secondary users as well as the relays contend for
    channel access. Thus, the allocation of both relay and channel resource is coupled
    together and must be addressed jointly 198, 200-202, 197, 203-205. The selective
    fusion spectrum sensing and best relay data transmission scheme and the fixed
    fusion spectrum sensing and best relay data transmission scheme were used to address
    this relay selection problem 206. In 207-209, centralized solutions were considered
    in which the resource allocation at the transmitter (CR base station) and at the
    relay stations is computed in a centralized manner based on the global channel
    state knowledge. Because of the signaling overhead and computational complexity,
    decentralized resource allocation is more desirable for cognitive relay networks
    210. In a practical implementation, because of imperfect channel sensing, the
    relay node may not always be able to acquire available spectrum for relay transmission.
    Further, because of the imperfect CSI, the selected relay may not always be the
    best relay. The problem of optimal resource allocation under imperfect spectrum
    sensing and imperfect CSI in cognitive relay networks has been addressed in the
    recent literature 211, 199, 212, 210. 8.2 Cognitive radio for LTE/LTE- Advanced
    networks Dynamic resource management is the one of the most significant features
    in cognitive and SDR systems. Future LTE/LTE-Advanced networks will have to address
    more complex resource management problems involving both contiguous and noncontiguous
    carrier aggregation, dynamic co-channel and adjacent channel interference mitigation,
    advanced MIMO techniques, multiple radio access technology (RAT) functionalities,
    coordinated multiple point transmission and reception, and relaying for efficient
    use of radio spectrum 213. CR concepts will be useful to develop enabling techniques
    to implement these features in the LTE/LTE-Advanced networks. LTE-Advanced networks
    will also use the concept of small cells such as femtocells, picocells, and microcells
    (such multi-tier networks are also referred to as heterogeneous networks) to provide
    higher QoS to the end users by improving the indoor coverage. However, deployment
    of small cells will result in a complex interference scenario when compared with
    that due to traditional frequency planning. Interference mitigation in such a
    scenario will require frequency agility, dynamic channel selection, and complex
    power control. The CR technologies can be used in the heterogeneous networks to
    enable the small cells to perform the required adaptation. 8.3 Cognitive radio
    applications 8.3.1 General applications A comprehensive survey of the emerging
    CR applications was presented in 214. This paper identified some killer applications
    of CR technology and discussed about the opportunities. The major applications
    included smart grid communications, public safety communications, and broadband
    cellular to medical applications. This paper discussed how to adopt CR in these
    applications. The benefits and the challenges were outlined, and the possible
    solutions were discussed. Last but not the least, this paper reviewed some standardization
    activities related to adopting CR in various applications. The potential applications
    of CR to the public safety communications were discussed in 215. The public safety
    community will adopt DSA technique to improve the efficiency, capacity, robustness,
    and flexibility of the wireless communications systems. This paper raised an important
    issue regarding such an adoption, which is the spectrum management reform to create
    spectrum pools. With these spectrum pools, CR devices can utilize the spectrum
    efficiently under the control of adaptive prioritization policies. This approach
    overcomes many limitations in the legacy communications systems. This paper also
    discussed about the economic, policy, and business issues of such spectrum pooling.
    The work in 216 discussed the use of CR in the IEEE 802.16-based WiMAX networks.
    Although the original IEEE 802.16 standard does not adopt any CR into account,
    this paper pointed out that a significant benefit can be achieved by increasing
    frequency reuse through power control and cognitive channel assignment. Then,
    the paper introduced an algorithm for optimal channel assignment. Simulations
    were performed for an IEEE 802.16 system to verify the benefits of the proposed
    algorithm. One of the very promising applications of CR will be its use in the
    multi-tier networks such as the two-tier macrocell-femtocell networks to improve
    the indoor coverage as well as the capacity of traditional cellular wireless networks.
    The work in 217 introduced an interesting idea of ultra-broadband femtocells based
    on the CR concept. Specifically, the opportunistic spectrum reuse method that
    allows the femtocells to access the radio spectrum licensed to different operators
    with different services was presented. The architecture and the key technology
    enablers were discussed to achieve the optimal performances of heterogeneous networks
    with multiple macrocells and femtocells. The work in 218 proposed a femtocell-based
    CR architecture to enable multitiered opportunistic access in next-generation
    heterogeneous networks. The architecture unifies the concept of conventional femtocells
    with infrastructure-based overlay CRNs. The principles of CR can be also used
    in multihop wireless mesh networks. Instead of a fixed channel allocation among
    the mesh nodes, a dynamic channel allocation can be used to improve the spectrum
    utilization. With this spirit, in 219, a cluster-based dynamic channel allocation
    framework is proposed for cognitive wireless mesh networks taking the issues of
    interference and coexistence with primary users into account. In 220, the authors
    presented applications of CR in the context of green communications. Two approaches
    are discussed, that is, applying CR to achieve energy efficiency and developing
    energy efficiency for CR systems. The paper introduced different techniques for
    achieving energy efficiency in wireless systems and how to apply those techniques
    in CR. 8.3.2 Cognitive radio networking in the TV white space Cognitive radio
    networks can be developed to exploit the TVWS for broadband wireless access, as
    the analog TV bands, which are largely underutilized, have been released for data
    communications. Many studies in the literature considered CR on the TVWS (e.g.,
    221-224). In the TVWS, the TV broadcasting stations and low-power wireless microphones
    serve as incumbents, and the secondary systems such as the IEEE 802.22-based WRANs,
    the Wi-Fi hotspots, and home networks can coexist with the incumbent systems.
    Nekovee 221 provided a comprehensive survey on accessing TVWS. Various issues
    were identified, including high-precision spectrum sensing 225, agile modulation
    and spectrum pooling techniques, and system-level design. Also, the potential
    of using TVWS for a wireless home network and cognitive femtocell was discussed.
    The coexistence challenges for heterogeneous cognitive networks in the TVWS were
    discussed in 222. In 223, the problem of coexistence among wireless networks in
    TVWS was studied. The framework to exchange information related to coexistence
    was also introduced. This framework supports both centralized and distributed
    information exchanges. The framework uses a multiradio cluster-head equipment
    (CHE) to collect information about TVWS and coexisting wireless networks. In the
    centralized approach, there is a central coexistence database available for the
    CHE to obtain information about wireless environment and to make the decision
    on spectrum access. On the other hand, in the distributed approach without the
    central database, a broadcast channel is used to exchange the coexistence information
    among CHEs. The simulation results showed that with the proposed framework, both
    centralized and distributed approaches can discover larger spectral availability
    than that without information exchange. In 226, a wireless hardware prototype
    to operate on TVWS was introduced. The prototype has a sensor and a geolocation
    device to collect information about the wireless environment in TV bands. This
    information is stored in the TV band database. A cognitive management entity was
    introduced to process the channel information and to control the transmission
    and reception of the transmitter and receiver, respectively. The prototype was
    developed on the basis of a TVWS test trial regulation in Singapore, which requires
    the wireless networks to operate on the 630–742-MHz band. The prototype is capable
    of automatically searching for and accessing unused TV bands. Kawade and Nekovee 227
    presented the feasibility study of using TVWS for wireless home networks. Also,
    the performance was compared with that of 2.4- and 5-GHz ISM bands, which are
    currently widely used. The simulation results showed that the performance of using
    TVWS is better than that of 5- and 2.4-GHz bands for low to medium traffic load
    (e.g., several megabits per second). Also, a low power level (i.e., below 3 dBm
    per channel) can be used. However, at high traffic load, it is suggested that
    the TV bands should be used with the interference management and are suitable
    as complementary channels of the 5- and 2.4-GHz bands. 8.3.3 Cognitive radio for
    smart grid communications The concept of smart grid has been introduced to improve
    the efficiency and responsiveness of the traditional power grid. The smart grid
    will use data communications technologies to transfer different information related
    to the generation, transmission, and distribution operations of the power grid
    to achieve the optimal operation of the power system. Wireless technologies will
    be used for the smart grid communications 228. CR will be a potential technology
    to improve the spectrum utilization and transmission efficiency of wireless communications
    used in the smart grid 229-231. In 229, the feasibility of using CR in the smart
    grid applications was extensively investigated. The system architecture, algorithms,
    and hardware testbed were developed and analyzed for a microgrid environment to
    support power and information flows. In addition, the mechanisms to ensure secure
    control and information exchange in the power system were also considered. The
    independent component analysis together with the robust principal component analysis
    techniques were used to improve the robustness of the smart meter data transmission
    under strong interference. In 232, a hierarchical CR communications infrastructure
    was proposed as a solution to manage a large number of transceivers in the smart
    grid. In this infrastructure, CR will be potentially deployed for the home area
    networks (HANs), the neighborhood area networks, and the wide area networks. DSA
    and sharing were also proposed to optimize the performance in each network to
    achieve the globally optimal spectrum access strategy. In 233, a CRN was developed
    for HANs. The spectrum sensing and channel switching techniques are introduced
    for the smart meter to transmit the meter data on either the licensed or unlicensed
    channels. The objective is to improve reliability and reduce delay in data transmission.
    The sensing time is optimized to reduce packet loss rate and delay whereas the
    transmission of primary user is not interfered. Although the preceding work addresses
    different issues of using CR in the smart grid, there are many research opportunities.
    For example, a QoS framework for the CR used in the smart grid must be designed
    and optimized to meet the delay and reliability requirements of the different
    smart grid applications. The benefits of CR in power generation, power transmission,
    and consumption must be analyzed. Also, the integration of the CR into existing
    wireless communications infrastructure of the smart grid needs to be investigated.
    8.3.4 Cognitive radio for machine- to-machine communications Machine-to-machine
    communications allows wireless nodes to communicate without or minimal interaction
    with humans. In M2M communications, the data to be transmitted are smaller in
    size but more in frequency than those of the human-to-human communications. CR
    is a potential solution for M2M communications to offload the data transmission
    from a licensed channel to an unlicensed channel. However, there are many issues
    that need to be addressed. M2M communications will be application centric, in
    which the protocol design and optimization must take the requirements of the specific
    applications into account. For example, Vo et al. 234 considered M2M communications
    for the smart grid applications focusing on the energy consumption of data transmission
    through CRNs (i.e., TV band devices). The DSA was optimized using a multi-objective
    genetic algorithm to find the optimal trade-off between power efficiency and spectrum
    efficiency. Yu and Chen 235 studied the CRN tomography and spectrum map for cooperative
    spectrum sensing. A two-step cooperative learning algorithm was proposed to analyze
    the spatial correlation of the results from sensing nodes, and the spectrum map
    was efficiently constructed. The proposed algorithm is suitable for large-scale,
    dynamic, and heterogeneous M2M networks. M2M communications can be integrated
    into the existing wireless systems (e.g., WiMAX and LTE 236 networks). However,
    optimal system architectures must be developed for integrating M2M communications
    and CR into such wireless systems. With the dense deployment of device-to-device
    (D2D) communications in the limited cellular radio spectrum, CR-based sophisticated
    interference control and avoidance methods will be essential for these systems.
    8.3.5 Cognitive radio and mobile cloud computing Mobile cloud computing combines
    wireless technologies and cloud computing to improve the performance and reduce
    cost of mobile services to the users 237. In mobile cloud computing, the mobile
    application is divided into two parts, that is, local computing modules to run
    on a mobile device and remote computing modules to run on a server in the cloud
    to reduce the energy consumption of a mobile device and to improve the performance
    of a mobile application. These two parts need to communicate with each other through
    a wireless connection. CR can be used to support mobile cloud computing, that
    is, to transfer data among local and remote modules of mobile applications. The
    major challenge in using CR for mobile cloud computing is the problem of guaranteeing
    QoS to the users and efficient radio resource allocation 238. The radio resource
    allocation must be performed jointly with the computing resource (e.g., CPU of
    a server) allocation because mobile applications can be executed in different
    modes, each of which requires different amounts of bandwidth and computing resource.
    Energy efficiency will be also an important factor that has to be optimized for
    CRs used in a mobile cloud computing scenario. Cloud computing can be used to
    support cognitive ratio networks. Complex signal processing for wireless transmission
    can be offloaded from mobile devices and base stations to the servers in the cloud.
    This concept has been used in a few work in the literature. In 239, cloud computing
    was used as the central communication and optimization infrastructure for a CRN.
    This network is used for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) to support the
    smart grid applications. In this case, the data processing of AMI is performed
    by servers in the cloud. In 240, cooperative spectrum sensing and radio resource
    scheduling for CR communications in the TVWS was implemented and executed in a
    cloud computing environment. In particular, the spectrum sensing reports were
    analyzed in the CR cloud to identify the spectrum opportunities. The analysis
    was performed through the sparse Bayesian learning algorithm using Microsoft''s
    Windows Azure Cloud platform, which is one of the public cloud computing services.
    In 241, the authors presented a prototype system of a CR architecture implemented
    using cloud computing to store and process spectrum sensing data. Cloud computing
    was used for data sharing among network devices in the network-centric operation.
    8.4 Open issues The emerging CR technology is envisioned to become a key element
    in the future-generation “smart radio” technology, which will dynamically optimize
    usage of limited radio resources and mitigate the “radio traffic jam” problem
    in future wireless networks. This technology will also provide robustness and
    efficiency for wireless and mobile communications services. It is anticipated
    that CR will evolve as a general-purpose programmable radio, which can be implemented
    through SDR, and it will serve as a universal platform for flexible and adaptive
    wireless system developments 3. Although a significant amount of research efforts
    have been spent on different aspects of CR communications and networking, there
    are still many technical challenges and interesting research opportunities. Also,
    there are significant challenges in the spectrum policy domain and pricing for
    DSA. In addition, rigorous testing and evaluation of CR technology in real-world
    environments is a significant issue that must be addressed to study the emergent
    behavior of CR and for large-scale deployment of this technology. A few of the
    open technical challenges are outlined in the following. 8.4.1 Practical methods
    to estimate channel parameters and spectrum sensing for cognitive radios A CR
    system is characterized by a time-dependent structure of the primary user traffic
    pattern and imperfect spectrum sensing. It has been investigated by a large body
    of CR literature, especially from the standpoint of the decision-theoretic framework
    such as a POMDP, quickest detection, sequential detection, a restless bandit problem,
    and sequence detection. In most of the existing work in the literature, secondary
    users’ knowledge of the channel parameters is simply assumed without giving a
    specific method for obtaining the information. However, in a real scenario, it
    may be the case that the primary user does not explicitly help the secondary user
    in obtaining the knowledge of the channel parameters. Therefore, developing a
    method for the secondary users to estimate the channel parameters without any
    help from the primary user is crucial for the design of a practical CR system.
    Although a significant amount of research have been carried out on spectrum sensing
    based on transmitter detection, there are only a limited number of techniques
    available for receiver detection. 8.4.2 Practical spectrum sharing protocols for
    cognitive radios Practical methods for spectrum sharing among CRs need to be developed
    considering the limited (or no) availability of control channels for coordination
    of spectrum access in a multi-user, multichannel, and multiradio scenario. Both
    horizontal and vertical spectrum sharing scenarios need to be considered. In this
    context, distributed adaptation and resource management techniques, which depend
    on local information only and incur low control overhead and implementation complexity,
    are desirable. For this, different machine learning, pattern recognition, and
    artificial intelligence tools will be useful. In order to make the developed resource
    allocation (i.e., power and rate allocation) methods amenable to real-world environments,
    they have to be made robust against the various limitations encountered in practice
    such as the unavailability of instantaneous channel gain information (due to the
    time-varying nature of wireless channel) and unavailability (or limited availability)
    of a control channel. Also, practical protocol designs to support spectrum sharing
    using advanced communications techniques such as network coding, MIMO communication,
    and relay-based cooperative communication in CRNs are interesting research problems.
    Because the cognitive radio systems could be vulnerable owing to the malicious
    eavesdroppers who try to overhear other users’ messages, spectrum access and sharing
    methods that can maximize the secrecy rate (i.e., rate of perfectly secure transmission
    of information) of CR users against the malicious behavior of eavesdroppers are
    required. 8.4.3 Protocol architectures and cross-layer adaptation Design and evaluation
    of higher-layer protocols such as the transport-layer protocols for CRNs in a
    wired-cum-wireless scenario has not been adequately addressed in the literature.
    Design and analysis of transport and routing layer protocols for a multihop or
    ad hoc CRN 242 also need extensive investigation. Cross-layer adaptation and optimization
    will be a key component in the design of CR protocols for adaptive, flexible,
    and stable DSA networks. This optimization will need to consider spectrum availability
    and dynamic channel and network selection in addition to the network parameters
    such as QoS requirements, mobility, traffic load, node density, and channel parameters
    as considered for traditional cross-layer optimization in wireless networks. Also,
    a management and control framework will be required for exchange of interlayer
    information to support cognition and achieve cross-layer adaptation. Design and
    evaluation of such frameworks is an open problem. 8.4.4 Spectrum policy research
    on cognitive radio Spectrum policy research is required to define the etiquettes
    for the CRs, analyze their impacts on the technology and business strategies,
    analyze their economic and social benefits, develop mechanisms to enforce the
    etiquettes derived from the spectrum policy, and define the role of the different
    stakeholders 3. Development of policy and legal frameworks for CRs for the different
    spectrum sharing models (or market models) is a very significant research direction.
    Techniques from microeconomic and game theory models and incentive mechanisms
    are useful in this context. Although there have been some work in this direction,
    more work are required to analyze large-scale spectrum markets in terms of efficiency
    and convergence and understand their emergent behavior as well as practical implementation
    of the derived methods and policies in the CR protocols. Enforcement of the spectrum
    policies for the CRs is another big challenge. 8.4.5 Development of cognitive
    radio testbed, experimentation, and application-centric performance evaluation
    Because CRNs are very complex systems with many degrees of freedom, it is very
    critical to evaluate their system-wide performance in real-world environments
    and study their emergent behavior to assess the viability of their practical implementation.
    Therefore, development of prototypes and testbeds and their management are essential
    so that experimentations can be performed in realistic environments to complement
    the analytical models and simulations. The adaptive protocols and the policy requirements
    add challenges for the testbed development and experimentation for CRNs. Again,
    application-centric evaluations (e.g., for public safety applications, broadband
    Internet access in rural areas, smart grid communications, eHealth applications,
    and vehicular networking applications) of CR systems are interesting avenues of
    future research on CR. 8.4.6 Cognitive small cell networks Deployment of small
    cells has been identified as a potential approach to increase the cellular wireless
    network capacity. By connecting to a small-cell base station (e.g., a pico or
    femto base station for picocell and femtocell, respectively), users can locally
    transmit and receive data with much better channel quality. However, the small
    cells will be underlaid in a macrocell. If the small cells and the macrocell use
    the same spectrum, interference will occur, deteriorating the performances of
    users in both cell tiers. CR techniques can be adopted to mitigate this problem.
    In this case, the small cells can reuse the spectrum allocated to the macrocell.
    By opportunistic access, the spectrum utilization can be improved while the network
    capacity is enhanced because of macrocell offloading 243. For efficient opportunistic
    spectrum access, a spectrum sensing mechanism to identify spectrum availability
    needs to be carefully and optimally designed 244. 8.4.7 Cognitive device- to-device
    communications Device-to-device communications has been introduced to offload
    data traffic from a base station by allowing D2D devices to communicate with each
    other directly. Similar to cognitive small cell networks, D2D communications can
    reuse the spectrum allocated to the cellular users (i.e., users connected with
    the base station). CR techniques can be applied to D2D devices (i.e., secondary
    users) to opportunistically access the spectrum. Again, the spectrum sensing is
    important to ensure that QoS requirements of the cellular users will not be violated
    while D2D devices can achieve satisfactory performance. 8.4.8 Energy-efficient
    cognitive radio Energy is an important resource for mobile devices 245. Therefore,
    techniques in CRs (e.g., spectrum sensing 246, DSA 247, 248, and sharing 249)
    can be also optimized to maximize energy efficiency for data transmission. One
    approach for spectrum sensing is to use an adaptive algorithm to perform sophisticated
    signal detection and estimation, which consumes a lot of energy, only when needed
    (e.g., a primary user is likely to present). For the spectrum access, a secondary
    user must optimize the data transmission given the available energy 250. Different
    forms of learning and reasoning techniques can be exploited for this. In the context
    of both single-tier and multitier cellular wireless networks, CR techniques (e.g.,
    for traffic load sensing and estimation) can be used to opportunistically switch
    on/off some of the base stations while satisfying the users’ communications requirements.
    Also, CR users can use energy-harvesting techniques to avoid relying on a fixed
    source of energy 251. 9 Cognitive Radio Standardization The IEEE 802.22 and SCC
    41 are considered as the primary CR standards today. They are also the completed
    standards of interest for CR 252. However, there are also many other standards
    being developed. IEEE created the 802.22 Working Group (WG) for WRANs in November,
    2004. This WG was assigned to develop an air interface (i.e., PHY and MAC) based
    on CRs for unlicensed operation in the TV broadcast bands. The focus of 802.22
    is on rural broadband wireless access and its coverage range is considerably larger
    than that of the IEEE 802.16 253. A brief review of the different standardization
    efforts is provided in the following. 9.1 IEEE 802.22 An overview of the 802.22
    architecture (e.g., topology, entities, and connections), its requirements (e.g.,
    service capacity, service coverage, and physical and MAC layer details), applications,
    and coexistence issues (e.g., antenna, TV, and wireless microphone sensing and
    protection) was provided in 254, 255. In North America, the frequency band of
    operation of the IEEE 802.22 networks is 54–862 MHz. Also, the standard shall
    accommodate various international TV channel bandwidths of 6, 7, and 8 MHz. The
    IEEE 802.22 systems have a fixed point to multipoint air interface. The base station
    controls the consumer premise equipments (CPEs). The base station also coordinates
    “distributed sensing,” which is needed for incumbent (original user) protection.
    The base station directs the CPEs to measure different TV channels and provide
    feedback. For an average spectral efficiency of 3 bits/s/Hz in the IEEE 802.22
    systems, considering 12 users, the minimum peak throughput rate is 1.5 Mbps per
    CPE in the downstream direction and 384 kbps in the upstream direction. Another
    striking feature of the IEEE 802.22 WRAN as compared with the existing IEEE 802
    standards is the base station coverage range, which can be up to 100 km if transmission
    power is not an issue (current specified coverage range is 33 km at 4 W CPE EIRP).
    9.2 IEEE 1900–SCC41-DYSPAN The IEEE Standard Coordinating Committee 41 (SCC41),
    formerly known as the IEEE 1900 task force 256, was created by the IEEE to work
    in the area of DSA networks for CR standardization. The IEEE SCC41 is divided
    into four WGs termed as 1900.x, “x” being the WG. In 2010, the SCC41 was approached
    by the IEEE Communications Society Standards Board (CSSB) and was renamed as IEEE
    DYSPAN-SC. IEEE P1900.1 (Terminology and Concepts for Next Generation Radio Systems
    and Spectrum Management): This standard intends to create a glossary of important
    CR terms and concepts related to spectrum management, policy-defined radio, adaptive
    radio, SDR, and related technology and also compare different technologies and
    their capabilities 257. IEEE P1900.2 (Recommended Practice for Interference and
    Coexistence Analysis): The 1900.2 WG recommends interference analysis criteria
    and develops a structure for measuring/analyzing the interference. This standard
    provides a systematic way of analyzing interference and coexistence. IEEE P1900.3
    (Dependability and Evaluation of Regulatory Compliance for Radio Systems with
    DSA): On the software side, the 1900.3 WG is developing test methods for evaluating
    SDR devices. The main goal is to verify the coexistence and compliance of the
    software modules for CR devices before certifying final devices. IEEE P1900.4
    (Architectural Building Blocks Enabling Network-Device Distributed Decision Making
    for Optimized Radio Resource Usage in Heterogeneous Wireless Access Networks):
    This standard is for radio systems with multiple RATs 258, 259. The end terminal
    users are considered to be supporting multiple RATs and with some CR capabilities
    such as flexible operations in different frequency bands. The IEEE 1900.4 defines
    reconfiguration management entities, which help in decision making at the terminal
    and network sides. IEEE P1900.5: The SCC41 established this WG to address the
    policy language issues. IEEE P1900.6: The SCC41 established this working group
    to address RF sensing functions that can be managed in a terminal reconfiguration
    manager defined in the IEEE P1900.4. Published in April 2011, this standard provides
    definition of structure and interfaces for exchanging sensing-related information
    between sensor and users of sensing information (cognitive engines). IEEE P1900.7
    (Radio Interface for White Space DSA Radio Systems Supporting Fixed and Mobile
    Operation): This standard would focus on the development of cost-effective white
    space DSA radio systems capable of operation in white space frequency bands on
    a noninterfering basis to incumbent users in these bands. The IEEE SCC41 has also
    started cooperating with the FCC (Federal Communications Commission), OFCOM UK,
    SDR Forum, and OMG forum, and others. 9.3 IEEE 802 projects related to cognitive
    technologies IEEE 802.16.2: Completed in November 2001, this is one of the first
    coexistence standards, which provides guidelines for minimizing interference in
    fixed broadband wireless access systems. IEEE 802.15.2: Completed in June 2003,
    this standard outlines recommended practices for coexistence of IEEE 802.15 wireless
    personal area networks with other wireless devices operating in unlicensed bands.
    It also provides a technique for the IEEE 802.11 devices to coexist with the IEEE
    802.15 devices. IEEE 802.11h: Completed in September 2003, this standard provides
    mechanisms for DFS and transmit power control. The DFS feature developed for the
    IEEE 802.11 allows relocation of interfering IEEE 802.11 basic service set to
    another frequency. This standard has been superseded by IEEE 802.11-2007. IEEE
    802.11y: This amendment to the IEEE 802.11 standard will allow 802.11 to operate
    at 3650–3700-MHz bands in the USA. It will allow shared 802.11 operations with
    other users. It also includes transmit power control (extending 802.11h) and DFS
    (extending 802.11h). 9.4 Wireless innovation forum (SDR forum) In 2008, the SDR
    forum published a report 260 on “Cognitive Radio Definitions and Nomenclature.”
    This report highlighted the components involved and defined many working technologies
    involved with CR. The Cognitive Radio Working Group under SDR forum is also working
    on a report entitled “Quantifying the Benefits of Cognitive Radio” developed for
    the benefits of using CR technologies in upcoming wireless systems. In 2009, the
    SDR forum also started a test and measurement project to develop a set of use
    cases, testing requirements, and methods for SSDR/CR technologies. The project
    addresses critical TVWS functions, for example, spectrum sensing, interference
    avoidance, database performance, and adherence to policy. 9.5 ETSI standardization
    In October 2009, ETSI''s Technical Committee on Reconfigurable Radio Systems (RRS)
    released a series of ETSI Technical Reports (TR 102 838) 261 that examined the
    standardization needs and opportunities related to reconfigurable radio systems
    including SDR and CR. The reports summarized the feasibility studies carried out
    by the committee and presented the recommended topics for standardization. Following
    the completion of the feasibility studies, standardization of RRS is now getting
    underway with four different working groups studying different aspects of reconfigurable
    radio systems as follows: System Aspect Studies (WG1): The basic role of this
    group is to form a technical framework that can map other topics being studied
    by other groups. Reconfigurable Radio Equipment Studies (WG2): This group finalized
    two study reports identifying potential SDR standardization mobile devices and
    reconfigurable base stations. Cognitive Network Management Studies (WG3): This
    study is divided into two parts, that is, functional architecture (FA) and cognitive
    pilot channel. The scope of FA is to study and propose a generic architecture
    for the management and control of reconfigurable radio systems, namely, the FA.
    The FA is designed to improve the utilization of spectrum and radio resources.
    Public Safety Studies (WG4): This group studies the application of RSS to the
    public safety domain in two parts, that is, user requirements and operational
    requirements. 9.6 International Telecommunication Union standardization The International
    Telecommunication Union (ITU)-Radio communication sector (ITU-R) study Group 8
    (Mobile, Radio Determination, Amateur and Related Satellite Services) deals with
    standardization of CRNs. The ITU-R study Group 8 has published two reports on
    SDR 262, 263. The reports focused on the application of SDR in International Mobile
    Telecommunications-2000 (IMT-2000) technology. IMT-2000 systems are the third-generation
    mobile systems, which provide access to a wide range of telecommunication services,
    supported by the fixed telecommunication networks (e.g., PSTN/ISDN/IP), and to
    other services, which are specific to mobile users. The SDR technology is employed
    in the base station and the controllers of a mobile radio access network to increase
    the flexibility of radio access networks. 10 Conclusion Cognitive radio represents
    a new paradigm for designing intelligent wireless networks to mitigate the spectrum
    scarcity problem and provide significant gain in spectrum efficiency. We have
    provided a comprehensive survey of the research activities in CR. The major issues
    in the design of CR communication networks have been discussed (e.g., spectrum
    sensing, DSA, applications, and standardization), and the related work in the
    literature have been reviewed. First, the historical note of the CR has been given
    to provide a motivation of the dynamic and efficient next-generation wireless
    systems. The various approaches of spectrum sharing in CR have been reviewed.
    The security and economic issues have been discussed. From the practical perspective,
    the reviews of simulation tools and testbed have been provided. The future trends
    and research directions have been discussed and open research issues have been
    outlined. Also, the standardization activities related to CR have been summarized.

    (SDR) and Cognitive Radio (CR) are the key enabling technologies to overcome the
    spectrum scarcity problem a bit, by supporting dynamic spectrum access in which
    either a network or a wireless node reconfigures its transmission or reception
    parameters to communicate efficiently, avoiding interference with licensed or
    unlicensed users. CR senses the environment and enables a secondary system to
    share the licensed spectrum with the primary system, which usually has exclusive
    access. The performance of the secondary system could be enhanced by Cooperative
    Spectrum Sensing (CSS) as it increases the primary detection probability. Again
    cognitive radio network greatly benefits from a cooperative transmission, employing
    intermediate nodes as relays. This chapter is focused on software defined radio,
    its architecture, limitations, then evolution to cognitive radio network, architecture
    of the CR, and its relevance in the wireless and mobile ad-hoc networks. Additionally,
    an overview of Cooperative Spectrum Sensing (CSS), its classification, components,
    challenges, and Cooperative Relay are discussed. Request access from your librarian
    to read this chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Introduction Over the last
    few years Radio spectrum, which is needed for wireless communication systems,
    appears to be a limited resource with the proliferation of various wireless applications
    and services in a noninterfering basis. This policy has traditionally been adopted
    by spectrum regulators and is known as Fixed Spectrum Access (FSA) policy. By
    doing so, only the assigned (licensed) users have the right to exploit the allocated
    spectrum, and other users are not allowed to use it, regardless of presence or
    absence of the licensed users. Eventually recent studies on the actual spectrum
    utilization measurements have revealed that a large portion of the licensed spectrum
    experiences low utilization. To maintain sustainable development of the wireless
    communication industry, novel solutions are to be developed to enhance the utilization
    efficiency of the radio spectrum. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA) technique has
    been proposed as an alternative policy to allow the radio spectrum to be used
    more efficiently and economically. It is no secret that anticipated technologies
    are often hyped as being “hot”, especially in the rapidly evolving and highly
    dynamic field of wireless communication. These very same technologies about which
    everybody has talked so enthusiastically then disappear silently, without leaving
    any impact on the industry, and remaining merely as just another vocabulary in
    the glossary of Newton’s Telecom Dictionary. However, this time it seems really
    different…The emergence of a promising, versatile technology into the commercial
    world seems to set the entire communication industry into pure excitement. Not
    only has it definitely become a major focus of attention, but it is also catalyzing
    enhancement of new standards as the industry is taking its big steps towards the
    age of “third generation,” 3G communication. Software defined radio (SDR) is receiving
    enormous recognition as the next evolutionary stage of wireless technology that
    aims to take advantage of the programmable hardware modules in order to build
    an open-architecture based software radio system to support DSA policy as well
    (Banerjee & Chakraborty, 2014). It is a rapidly evolving technology that is generating
    enormous interest in the telecommunication industry, as it facilitates some of
    the functional modules of a radio system (such as: signal generation, coding,
    modulation/ demodulation, link layer protocols) in software. This programmability
    empowers the radios the ability to change its operating parameters to accommodate
    new features and capabilities without changing the hardware portion much. Even
    after SDR, which is slowly becoming more of a reality, is another intelligent
    radio, known as Cognitive Radio (CR) which is basically SDR along with cognition
    and reconfigurable properties. With the development of cognitive radio technologies
    spectrum sharing in the licensed spectrum has drawn a great attention in the research
    community, which shows the potential advantage of mitigating spectrum scarcity
    and improving spectrum utilization efficiency. Further, Cognitive Radio (CR) is
    that very paradigm for wireless communication, in which either a network or a
    wireless node reconfigures its transmission or reception parameters to communicate
    efficiently avoiding interference with licensed or unlicensed users. CR adapts
    itself to the newer environment on the basis of its intelligent sensing and captures
    the best available spectrum to meet user communication requirements. Therefore,
    in this chapter CR has been discussed after SDR.As cognitive radio has a lower
    priority than the licensed spectrum, it needs to be able to determine independently
    whether the spectrum is available at a particular time, and adjust its transmission
    and reception accordingly. Spectrum sensing has therefore become one of the major
    challenges confronting cognitive radio. The sensing performance of a single cognitive
    user is limited because of channel fading and shadowing effects. As a result,
    cooperative spectrum sensing (CSS), which can enhance sensing performance, has
    attracted considerable attention. Still this cooperative spectrum sensing does
    not improve the secondary transmission or the system throughput to that extent.
    However, by employing a CR that is located nearby the PU as a “Helper” or “Carrier”
    or “Relay”, Secondary transmission may be improved. This Relay based CSS scheme,
    known as Cooperative Relaying scheme is a major breakthrough in the wireless communication
    domain and demands keen research further. Continue Reading References Follow Reference

    Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: In this paper we present
    the design process of an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) implementation
    for the Kansas University Agile Radio (KUAR). The KUAR is a portable, experimental,
    FPGA-based software-defined radio unit employed as a test bed to facilitate advanced
    research into frequency agile and cognitive radios. The baseband processing in
    this implementation is accomplished entirely on a Xilinx Virtex-II Pro FPGA that
    is built into the KUAR Our OFDM PHY implementation demonstrates the capabilities
    of the KUAR and serves as an important first step towards conducting actual experiments
    on multicarrier schemes for dynamic spectrum access communications, such as non-contiguous
    (NC)-OFDM. Published in: IEEE GLOBECOM 2007 - IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference

    a limited resource. Although the electromagnetic spectrum theoretically is infinite
    in size, there is a finite subset of frequency spectrum that is actually practical
    for wireless communications systems. As the frequency increases, the propagation
    loss also increases and the need for line-of-sight communications becomes more
    of an issue. Additionally, RF hardware becomes more expensive and difficult to
    implement as the frequency of operation increases. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: New trends and developments in radio technology together
    with current developments towards liberalization of spectrum management regulations
    are opening the opportunity to exploit the new paradigm of dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA). The key characteristic of DSA systems is their ability exploit knowledge
    of their electromagnetic environment to adapt their operation and access to spectrum.
    Their key promise is that they open the possibility of highly efficient (re)use
    of spectrum. The cognitive radio, built on software defined radio, is the intelligent,
    adaptive and frequency agile wireless device that will underlie most forms of
    DSA. In this paper we review proposed architectures for future DSA systems and
    describe some of the key research challenges associated with this new paradigm.
    Particular emphasize is given to autonomous cognitive radio DSA Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Mykonos, Greece I. Introduction In most countries
    regulatory bodies (e.g. Of com in the UK and FCC in the US), use a static command-and-control
    model for managing the radio spectrum. In this model the available radio spectrum
    is divided into fixed and non-overlapping blocks, separated by so-called, guard
    bands, assigned to different services and, wireless technologies. These blocks
    are then licensed for exclusive use to carriers, radio and TV broad casters, specialized
    mobile radio, corporations, the military or public safety agencies. Faced, with
    an apparent scarcity of spectrum resources, which is partially due to the inefficiency
    of the above model, regulator bodies, world over are in the process of modernizing
    their spectrum policies, and are seeking alternative spectrum management models
    which exploit recent advances in radio and wireless networking technology in order
    to achieve a much more efficient, and flexible utilization of spectrum. Sign in

    Research (CTVR) and the Center for Wireless Telecommunications (CWT) are carrying
    out joint research work investigating the potential of different software-defined
    radio (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR) systems that can coexist in common frequency
    bands. This paper describes the independently developed dynamic spectrum access
    test beds used in a practical coexistence experiment. An initial analysis of actual
    coexistence experiences involving a primary user and a secondary opportunistic
    spectrum user in a common frequency band is also presented. The results in this
    paper include an analysis of a worst case scenario where the primary user and
    secondary opportunistic user are coexisting with no guard bands separating each
    other. The experimental results showed that the primary user experienced zero
    packet loss when guard bands separated the primary and secondary services. Additionally,
    when no guard bands were used and the spectrum segment was maximally used over
    the geographical area involved in the experiments, the signal to noise and interference
    ratio (SNIR) needed to be adjusted to 20 dB by modifying the secondary user transmissions
    in order to minimise the interference experienced by the primary user. Published

    Conference Location: Dublin, Ireland I. Introduction The use of cognitive functionality
    in wireless telecommunication systems and networks presents new and exciting possibilities
    for improving the way information is conveyed between nodes. In addition, this
    technology also paves the way for new wireless applications that can exploit the
    abilities of different cognitive radio architectures to inter-operate, coexist,
    and work together as a team within this network. In order to demonstrate and evaluate
    these possibilities, the Centre for Telecommunications Value-Chain Research (CTVR)
    and the Center for Wireless Telecommunications (CWT) are undertaking a joint collaborative
    research effort investigating these possibilities. This paper builds on previous
    work carried out as part of this collaborative effort [1], [2] and details further
    outcomes of coexistence experiments in the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific and
    medical (ISM) frequency band. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    \ Hanna Bogucka1* and Alexander M Wyglinski2\nAbstract\nOne of the primary objectives\
    \ of deploying cognitive radio (CR) within a dynamic spectrum access (DSA) network\n\
    is to ensure that the legacy rights of incumbent licensed (primary) transmissions\
    \ are protected with respect to\ninterference mitigation when unlicensed (secondary)\
    \ communications are simultaneously operating within the\nsame spectral vicinity.\
    \ In this article, we present non-contiguous orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\
    \ (NC-\nOFDM) as a promising and practical approach for achieving spectrally agile\
    \ wireless data transmission that is\nsuitable for secondary users (SUs) to access\
    \ fragmented spectral opportunities more efficiently. Furthermore, a\nreview of\
    \ the current state-of-the-art is conducted with respect to methods specifically\
    \ designed to protect the\ntransmissions of the primary users (PUs) from possible\
    \ interference caused by nearby SU transceivers employing\nNC-OFDM. These methods\
    \ focus on the suppression of out-of-band (OOB) emissions resulting from the use\
    \ of NC-\nOFDM transmission. To achieve the required OOB suppression, we present\
    \ two practical approaches that can be\nemployed in NC-OFDM, namely, the insertion\
    \ of cancellation carriers and windowing. In addition to the theoretical\ndevelopment\
    \ and proposed improvements of these approaches the computer simulation results\
    \ of their\nperformance are presented. Several real-world scenarios regarding\
    \ the coexistence of both PU and SU signals are\nalso studied using actual wireless\
    \ experiments based on software-defined radio. These simulation and experimental\n\
    results indicate that OOB suppression can be achieved under real-world conditions,\
    \ making NC-OFDM transmission\na viable option for CR usage in DSA networks.\n\
    1 Introduction\nThe idea of cognitive radio (CR) encompasses opportu-\nnistic\
    \ and dynamic access to spectrum resources that\nmight be available at a certain\
    \ location and time. These\nresources, called spectrum holes, especially in metropoli-\n\
    tan areas, can potentially be fragmented with several\nnon-contiguous spectral\
    \ bands of different width. More-\nover, the availability of these spectrum holes\
    \ may dyna-\nmically change over time, as the licensed users (primary\nusers–PUs)\
    \ enter into and depart from a given location.\nThere has been a substantial amount\
    \ of research con-\nducted with respect to finding suitable technologies cap-\n\
    able of aggregating the available spectrum adaptively\naccording to dynamics of\
    \ spectrum holes availability,\nand to support the transmissions of the secondary\
    \ users\n(SUs) in a spectrally efficient manner. In order to use\nthe fragmented\
    \ spectrum, an SU radio transceiver must\nbe able to shape its emission to make\
    \ best use of avail-\nable resources while simultaneously respecting the\nincumbent\
    \ spectral accessing rights of the PUs.\nThe key for achieving a spectrally agile\
    \ waveform that\nenables the coexistence of both PU and SU transmis-\nsions within\
    \ a specified spatial, temporal, and spectral\nvicinity is to exert strict control\
    \ over the spectral extent\nof the transmitted signal. One spectrally agile waveform\n\
    approach that has been receiving significant attention in\nrecent years is noncontiguous\
    \ orthogonal frequency divi-\nsion multiplexing (NC-OFDM) [1,2], which is based\
    \ on\nthe popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing\n(OFDM) transmission\
    \ technique. One of the primary\nadvantages of using NC-OFDM within the context\
    \ of a\ndynamic spectrum access (DSA) network is that it pro-\nvides the flexibility\
    \ of deactivating, or nulling, specific\nsubcarriers with zeros as input values\
    \ such that there is\n* Correspondence: hbogucka@et.put.poznan.pl\n1Chair of Wireless\

    \ locations corre-\nsponding to the presence of PU emissions.\nDespite its advantages,\
    \ NC-OFDM possesses several\nsubstantial technical issues that need to be resolved\
    \ in\norder to make this form of wireless data transmission\nwithin a DSA environment\
    \ a viable option. One of these\nissues is the shape of the NC-OFDM spectrum outside\n\
    of the intended transmission bandwidth, which is\nknown to be relatively high\
    \ when left untreated due to\nthe Sinc pulse shapes of the individual data-bearing\
    \ sub-\ncarriers. Consequently, if PU transmissions are located\nnext to a collection\
    \ of data-bearing subcarriers belong-\ning to an NC-OFDM signal, this may result\
    \ in the for-\nmer experiencing an unacceptable level of interference\nfrom the\
    \ latter. Therefore, it is essential that the spectral\nshape of the NC-OFDM waveform\
    \ is treated such that\nthe out-of-band (OOB) radiation is minimized.\nIn addition\
    \ to the issue of OOB interference, OFDM-\nbased waveforms are generally characterized\
    \ by relatively\nhigh peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR), which makes\nthe transmit\
    \ signal vulnerable to nonlinear distortions,\nsuch as signal clipping in high-power\
    \ amplifiers. If signal\nclipping does occur, the resulting transmission spectrum\n\
    will broaden, thus yielding a potential interference situa-\ntion with adjacent\
    \ PU signals. Consequently, it is impor-\ntant to investigate suitable methods\
    \ for reducing the\nPAPR of NC-OFDM transceivers with the goal of miti-\ngating\
    \ OOB interference. There have been a number of\narticles dealing with this problem,\
    \ suggesting either\nPAPR reduction methods (see an overview of these\nmethods\
    \ in [3] and the references therein), signal pre-\ndistortion (e.g., [4]) or the\
    \ linearization methods of a\npower amplifier. However, further development of\
    \ these\nmethods is required to make them sufficiently practical\nfor the purposes\
    \ of realizing transceiver implementa-\ntions in actual real-world scenarios,\
    \ such that the choice\nof an appropriate method should be able to handle the\n\
    time-varying radio transmission environment, including\ndynamically changing types\
    \ of the PU transmissions.\nSimultaneously, these methods should aim at achieving\n\
    reasonable computational complexity, negligible perfor-\nmance degradation of\
    \ the SU transmission, and low\nenergy costs.\nIn this article, we present an\
    \ investigation of spectrally\nagile waveforms based on NC-OFDM and assess their\n\
    suitability for achieving SU transmissions that are cap-\nable of respecting the\
    \ rights of incumbent PU signals. In\nSection 2, we present an overview of NC-OFDM\
    \ trans-\nmission within the context of a cognitive radio-based\nDSA network.\
    \ We then review in Section 3 existing\nmethods for achieving flexible spectral\
    \ waveforms using\nNC-OFDM while simultaneously mitigating the effects\nof OOB\
    \ interference. Section 4 provides a closer look at\na promising technique for\
    \ mitigating OOB interference\nthat combines the insertion of so-called cancel\
    \ lation\ncarriers (CCs) with OFDM symbol-based windowing.\nMoreover, we present\
    \ an enhanced optimization algo-\nrithm with reduced computational complexity\
    \ and\nreduced energy costs. Finally, the proposed OOB inter-\nference reduction\
    \ approach for NC-OFDM is evaluated\nusing actual wireless transceivers based\
    \ on software-\ndefined radio (SDR) technology within a controlled\nenvironment,\
    \ and the results of these experiments are\npresented and discussed in Section\
    \ 5.\n2 Spectrally agile multicarrier waveform\nframework\nA conventional wireless\
    \ transmission system is usually\nallocated a specific frequency band for data\
    \ communica-\ntions. These wireless transmissions are usually licensed,\nwhich\
    \ means they possess exclusive rights to the\nassigned frequency bands. Although\
    \ much of the wire-\nless spectrum up to 3 GHz has been assigned to\nlicensed\
    \ wireless applications, several measurements\ncampaigns have shown that a substantial\
    \ portion of the\nlicensed frequency bands are underutilized across the\ntemporal,\
    \ spectral, and spatial domains [5]. To continue\nproviding sufficient spectral\
    \ bandwidth for satisfying\nboth current and future wireless access needs, both\n\
    spectrum policy makers and communication technolo-\ngists have proposed an innovative\
    \ approach with respect\nto the wireless spectrum usage via opportunistic spec-\n\
    trum access (OSA). Relative to traditional approaches\nfor accessing spectrum,\
    \ OSA allows for unlicensed wire-\nless users to temporarily “borrow” unoccupied\
    \ licensed\nfrequency bands [6]. However, these unlicensed (i.e., sec-\nondary)\
    \ devices must still guarantee interference-free\nwireless access to incumbent\
    \ licensed (i.e., primary) sig-\nnals. In particular, it is essential that the\
    \ OOB radiation\ngenerated by the SU wireless device is mitigated in\norder to\
    \ prevent interference with PU wireless signals\nlocated in the frequency vicinity.\
    \ Consequently, given\nthis constraint on SU wireless transceivers, communica-\n\
    tion systems performing OSA require a level of spectral\nagility in order to operate\
    \ in the presence of PU signals,\nespecially when it comes to mitigating interference\n\
    resulting from OOB radiation, as well as simultaneously\ntransmitting across several\
    \ unoccupied frequency bands\nthat are fragmented across the wireless spectrum\
    \ whose\naggregate bandwidth satisfies the secondary transmission\nrequirements.\n\
    Multicarrier modulation (MCM) possesses sufficient\nspectral agility in order\
    \ to facilitate the transmission of\ndata from unlicensed SU transmitters across\
    \ several\nfragmented frequency bands simultaneously even in the\npresence of\
    \ licensed PU signals, thus resulting in an\nincrease in spectrum utilization\
    \ [7]. In particular, sub-\ncarriers located in the frequency vicinity of unoccupied\n\

    \ 20\nwireless spectrum can be used for transmitting data\nwhile those sub-carriers\
    \ that could potentially interfere\nwith nearby PU signals can be deactivated\
    \ or nulled.\nHowever, simply deactivating subcarriers for the pur-\nposes of\
    \ OOB interference mitigation may not be suffi-\ncient for the neighboring PUs’\
    \ interference tolerance\nlevels. Moreover, in addition to achieving a required\n\
    level of OOB interference within a given spectrum\nmask, an SU transmitter performing\
    \ OSA must be cap-\nable of tailoring its spectral characteristics dynamically\n\
    in order to avoid interference with the dynamically\nchanging incumbent licensed\
    \ PU transmissions. Finally,\nmost MCM transmission approaches possess the possi-\n\
    bility of exhibiting large envelope variations in the time\ndomain that is often\
    \ characterized by a high PAPR. This\nresults from the combination of the subcarrier\
    \ signals\ninto a single composite multicarrier waveform in the\ntime domain.\
    \ When high PAPR occurs, the resulting\ntransmission spectrum broadens and produces\
    \ OOB\ninterference regardless of whether the initial spectral\nwaveform has been\
    \ properly shaped at the transmitter\nfor low OOB interference.\nOverall, non-contiguous\
    \ MCM techniques have been\nrecognized as a suitable candidate for OSA due to\
    \ their\npotential for achieving spectrally efficient communica-\ntions by exploiting\
    \ fragmented unoccupied spectrum\nwhile simultaneously achieving high data rates\
    \ [8,9]. In\nfact, this form of data transmission approach is well-sui-\nted for\
    \ future wireless communication systems, includ-\ning CR systems [10]. As mentioned\
    \ before, the NC-\nOFDM scheme possesses the ability to efficiently use\nfragmented\
    \ spectrum opportunities as well as perform\nspectrum shaping in order to suppress\
    \ interference that\nmay affect nearby primary wireless transmissions. To\ncounteract\
    \ the potential for significant OOB interference\nresulting from NC-OFDM transmission,\
    \ which can\nnegatively affect neighboring wireless signals, several\ntechniques\
    \ have been proposed in the literature that are\ndesigned to significantly suppress\
    \ these sidelobes in\norder to make coexistence between PUs and SUs feasi-\nble.\
    \ On the other hand, the OOB reduction process can\npotentially increase the computational\
    \ complexity and\nenergy (power) utilization. Given the possible con-\nstraints\
    \ of limited computational and energy resources\navailable via a user equipment,\
    \ a practical approach to\nthis problem is needed that achieves a balance between\n\
    the OOB interference mitigation efficiency and its asso-\nciated costs.\n3 OOB\
    \ reduction techniques for spectrally agile\nmulticarrier waveforms\nThe dilemma\
    \ of how to mitigate the OOB interference\nin multicarrier systems has attracted\
    \ substantial interest\nover the last decade. In this section, we present an\n\
    overview of the major achievements in this field, and\nindicate two methods that\
    \ are particularly attractive for\nthe application in CR framework.\n3.1 State-of-art\
    \ techniques for OOB radiation reduction\nThe simplest method for achieving OOB\
    \ interference\nreduction is to reserve a number of edge (guard) subcar-\nriers\
    \ (GS) to serve as a spectral buffer between PU and\nSU transmissions [7], i.e.,\
    \ deactivation of subcarriers.\nAlthough simple to implement, this method significantly\n\
    decreases the spectral efficiency and does not provide\nsufficient OOB interference\
    \ reduction in most scenarios.\nAnother approach to the OOB power reduction of\
    \ an\nOFDM signal is to spectrally shape each individual sub-\ncarrier spectrum\
    \ [7]. We will discuss this simple method\ncalled windowing (W) in the following\
    \ subsection in\ngreater detail. In the adaptive symbol transition (AST)\nmethod\
    \ [11], similar to W, the time-domain samples in\nthe transition region between\
    \ consecutive symbols are\nchosen adaptively in order to minimize the OOB power.\n\
    For the AST algorithm, the information about symbols\nmapped to each subcarrier\
    \ is needed in order to assess\nthe amount of OOB interference in the neighboring\
    \ fre-\nquency bands. A mean-square-error (MSE) minimiza-\ntion method is used\
    \ to determine the values of the\ntime-domain samples in the transition region.\
    \ The pri-\nmary drawbacks of this method are high computational\ncomplexity and\
    \ reduced throughput.\nAnother method, called constellation expansion (CE)\n[12],\
    \ adjusts the modulated data symbols transmitted\nper subcarrier such that the\
    \ OOB interference can be\nreduced while simultaneously not losing any data infor-\n\
    mation or causing distortion. This is achieved by enlar-\nging the modulation\
    \ constellation and by allowing data\nsymbols to be represented by any one of\
    \ the two con-\nstellation points. As a result, the minimum distance\nbetween\
    \ the constellation points is reduced, and the bit-\nerror-rate (BER) performance\
    \ decreases.\nAnother method, called subcarriers weighting (SW)\n[13,14], minimizes\
    \ the signal OOB interference level by\nmultiplying the data subcarriers by optimized\
    \ real\nweighting coefficients. At the receiver, data symbols\ntransmitted using\
    \ the weighted subcarriers can be\nviewed as distorted, particularly for the high\
    \ values of\nthe weighting coefficients. Consequently, the authors\nsuggest to\
    \ impose a constraint on the weighting coeffi-\ncients values. Simulation results\
    \ exhibit significant OOB\ninterference suppression. Some modifications to this\n\
    method have been made in [15], where maximization of\nthe channel capacity combined\
    \ with OOB interference\nmitigation is addressed.\nIn the multiple-choice sequences\
    \ (MCS) [16] method,\nfor each sequence of data symbols to be transmitted in\n\
    an OFDM symbol, a set of corresponding sequences\nKryszkiewicz et al. EURASIP\

    Page 3 of 20\nrepresenting it is calculated. The sequence yielding the\nlowest\
    \ interference to adjacent bands is then chosen\nfrom this set and transmitted.\
    \ To retrieve the initial\ndata sequence at the receiver the identification number\n\
    of the selected sequence has to be provided, what\nrequires additional control\
    \ channel for this side-infor-\nmation. A variant of the MCS method with reduced\n\
    computational complexity is presented in [17]. In this\nmethod, the corresponding\
    \ sequences are generated\nthrough the data symbols phases rotation of the multi-\n\
    ple of π/2, and thus a limited number of possible sets of\nsequences must be examined\
    \ to choose the optimum\none. As the OFDM edge subcarriers possess the stron-\n\
    gest influence on the OOB radiation, only those subcar-\nriers are altered. Another\
    \ variant of the MCS method\ninvolves its merging with other spectrum shaping\
    \ algo-\nrithms, e.g., in [18] the authors combined the MCS\nmethod with both\
    \ SW and CCs method.\nPolynomial cancellation coding (PCC) has been pro-\nposed\
    \ in [19] and revisited in [20]. This method not\nonly reduces the OOB radiation\
    \ but also lowers the\nOFDM signal sensitivity to phase and frequency errors.\n\
    As neighboring subcarriers have firmly aligned spectra,\nthe adjacent subcarriers\
    \ are modulated with the same,\nappropriately scaled data symbol in order to reduce\
    \ the\nsidelobes power. This is usually done for groups of two\nor three subcarriers.\
    \ Although this method reduces the\nsystem throughput, this effect can be weakened\
    \ as the\ncyclic prefix (CP) does not have to be added and coded\nredundancy can\
    \ be used to increase SNR.\nAnother method for achieving OOB interference\nreduction,\
    \ called spectral precoding (SP), has been\ndescribed in [21,22]. In this method,\
    \ the correlation\nbetween the data-symbols transmitted on subcarriers is\nintroduced\
    \ by block-coding. The code-generating matrix\nis chosen so as to minimize the\
    \ OOB radiation power.\nThe SP method provides the lowest OOB interference\nlevels\
    \ relative to other methods simulated in [21]. On\nthe other hand, it has been\
    \ observed that the OOB\ninterference suppression is not so high when the CP is\n\
    applied.\nAnother method for reducing OOB interference,\ncalled extended active\
    \ interference cancellation (EAIC)\n[23], is based on the insertion of special\
    \ carriers that are\ndesigned to negatively combine with high-power side-\nlobes\
    \ caused by the data subcarriers. The AIC subcar-\nriers can be placed inside\
    \ the adjacent transmission\nspectrum, usually at frequency locations that are\
    \ non-\northogonal to the SU data subcarriers. The main draw-\nback of this method\
    \ results from this lack of orthogon-\nality and thus, data symbols distortion.\
    \ A variant of the\nEAIC method was presented in [24], where the sidelobe\nsuppression\
    \ approach was improved by using a long\ntime-domain cancellation signal spanning\
    \ over a number\nof consecutive OFDM symbols. This method results in\nan increase\
    \ of BER due to increased interference relative\nto the method presented in [23].\
    \ In [25], this method is\nimproved by introducing the constraint on the self-\n\
    interference power level.\nAn interesting approach to the mitigation of OOB\n\
    interference, called partial response signaling (PRS) [26],\nmakes the values\
    \ on each subcarrier dependent on the\nsubsequent OFDM symbols. This can be done\
    \ by inde-\npendent lowpass filters on each input of the inverse fast\nFourier\
    \ transform (IFFT) block. Although relatively sub-\nstantial OOB interference\
    \ suppression can be achieved\neven with very low order (2-3) filters, the reception\
    \ of\nsuch a signal requires either a slicer or a Viterbi detec-\ntor when treating\
    \ PRS filtering after being influenced by\nthe multipath propagation channel.\n\
    An observation that the OOB radiation is the result of\nthe time domain non-continuity\
    \ between subsequent\nOFDM symbols was the basis for a spectrum shaping\nmethod\
    \ presented in [27]. This method is called N-con-\ntinuous OFDM (NC). The continuity\
    \ of 0th to Nth-\norder derivatives at the ends of the OFDM symbols is\nachieved\
    \ by adding low power, complex-valued quanti-\nties to each active data subcarrier\
    \ at the input of a IFFT\nblock.\nAn entire class of methods that support the\
    \ protection\nof PU signals from the effects of OOB interference is\nbased on\
    \ the use of power allocation schemes that not\nonly maximize the throughput but\
    \ also reduce the OOB\ninterference power, e.g., refer to methods presented in\n\
    [2,28,29]. However, as these approaches might be seen\nas part of radio resources\
    \ management they will not be\ninvestigated here further.\nFinally, the concept\
    \ of modulated filterbanks (MFB)\ncan be also successfully applied to suppress\
    \ the side-\nlobes of the OFDM transmission [30]. MFB can be used\nfor sidelobe\
    \ suppression by applying them over the\nOFDM spectrum such that the series of\
    \ bandpass filters\nallows only the required spectrum to pass through it\nwhile\
    \ rejecting the unwanted OOB radiations in every\nsubband.\n3.2 Windowing\nWindowing\
    \ (W) is usually applied to the OFDM symbol\ntime-domain samples with CP. The\
    \ use of windowing is\nshown in Figure 1. The time-domain OFDM symbol of\nduration\
    \ N + NCP samples, where NCP is the duration in\nsamples of the CP, is extended\
    \ cyclically with b samples\nat the end of the considered symbol. This extension\
    \ is\nreferred to as the cyclic suffix (CS). If we denote the\ntime-domain signal\
    \ for a single OFDM symbol as a vec-\ntor x = {x−β−NCP, . . . , xN−1+β}, the OFDM-symbol\
    \ time-\ndomain samples are defined by vector y = {yk}, which\nKryszkiewicz et\
    \ al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\nand Networking 2012, 2012:23\n\
    http://jwcn.eurasipjournals.com/content/2012/1/23\nPage 4 of 20\nresults from\
    \ the multiplication of the vector x = {xk} by\nthe window shape w = {wk}, namely:\n\
    yk = wkxk,\n(1)\nwhere k = -b - NCP, ..., N - 1 + b. In [31], it has been\nshown\
    \ that the largest sidelobe suppression is achieved\nwhen the Hanning window is\
    \ applied. In case of the\nHanning window, w = {wk} possesses the following form:\n\
    wk =\n⎧\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎨\n⎪⎪⎪⎪⎩\n0.5 + 0.5 cos\n\x06\nπ k + NCP\nβ\n\a\n, k ∈ {−β − NCP,\
    \ . . . , −1 − NCP}\n1,\nk ∈ {−NCP, . . . , N − 1}\n0.5 + 0.5 cos\n\x06\nπ k −\
    \ N\nβ\n\a\n,\nk ∈ {N, . . . , N − 1 + β}\n.\n(2)\nReferring to Figure 1, it is\
    \ worth mentioning that to\nprovide a relatively small throughput decrease, consecu-\n\
    tive symbols overlapping with each other by b samples\ncan yield an effective\
    \ OFDM symbol duration of N +\nNCP + b samples.\nThe primary advantages of this\
    \ method is its low com-\nputational complexity, independence of the modulated\n\
    data, and its suitability for NC-OFDM. When employed\nby a CR communication system\
    \ attempting to access\nthe available spectrum in a dynamically varying radio\n\
    environment, it is also important that the length and\nshape of the applied window\
    \ can be also altered dyna-\nmically. This method is the most suitable for minimizing\n\
    the interference in the PU transmission that is relatively\ndistant in frequency\
    \ from SU transmission band [7,31].\nThe main drawback of this method is the decrease\
    \ of\nthroughput caused by the addition of the CS.\n3.3 Cancellation carriers\n\
    The CCs method [32] takes advantage of the spectrum\nshape of each subcarrier\
    \ in order to reduce the resulting\nOOB interference level. As each OFDM symbol\
    \ pos-\nsesses a limited time duration, this can be interpreted as\ncutting out\
    \ a part of an infinitely long OFDM symbol by\na rectangular window. In other\
    \ words, the spectrum of\neach subcarrier is convolved with a sinc function, thus\n\
    widening the spectral overlapping regions with the other\nsubcarrier spectra.\
    \ Although this is generally the pri-\nmary reason for the existence of high OOB\
    \ interference,\nthis phenomenon can be manipulated in a positive fash-\nion using\
    \ the CCs method, where a subset of active sub-\ncarriers are selected for the\
    \ sole purpose of cancelling\nthe OOB interference of the adjacent subcarriers.\
    \ As the\nsubcarriers closest to the spectrum edge have the stron-\ngest influence\
    \ on the OOB radiation, they are usually\nchosen to carry the cancelling signal,\
    \ and they do not\nsupport any data transmissions themselves. The side-\nlobes\
    \ of these subcarriers are intended to negatively\ncombine with the sum of the\
    \ sidelobes resulting from\nthe active data-bearing subcarriers, thus potentially\n\
    reducing the overall OOB interference levels as shown\nin Figure 2.\nThe values\
    \ of the cancellation subcarriers have to be\ncalculated for each OFDM symbol\
    \ separately since the\nindependent modulated data symbols cause different\nOOB\
    \ interference levels. Thus, several frequency-sam-\npling points are defined\
    \ in order to determine the values\nof the OOB signal spectrum at the corresponding\
    \ fre-\nquencies. These frequency-sampling points describe the\noptimization region\
    \ in which the estimates of the spec-\ntrum values resulting from the spectral\
    \ superposition of\nthe data subcarriers (DCs) and the CCs have to be cal-\nculated.\
    \ The optimization problem to be solved for each\nOFDM symbol can be defined as\
    \ follows:\nmin\nsc\n\b\b\bP(δ×γ )\nCC\nsc + P(δ×α)\nDC\nsd\n\b\b\b\n2\n,\n(3)\n\
    where P(δ×γ )\nCC\nis the matrix of dimensions (δ × g)\ntransforming the vector\
    \ of the CCs values sc of length 7\nto the spectrum estimates. For the DCs, the\

    \ role. However, as the authors of this\nmethod have found, such an optimization\
    \ approach may\nresult in a higher power level for the CCs relative to the\nDCs.\
    \ Consequently, the additional constraint has been\nintroduced to limit this effect:\n\
    ∥sc∥2 ≤ \aCC,\n(4)\nwhere ΠCC is the maximum allowable power for CCs.\nAlthough\
    \ the solution of (3) is widely known, and has\nbeen presented in [33,34], the\
    \ constraint (4) increases\nthe computational complexity of the optimization pro-\n\
    blem significantly, requiring us to solve the Lagrange\ninequality for each OFDM\
    \ symbol, which might become\ninfeasible for wideband transmissions possessing\
    \ a large\nnumber of subcarriers.\nAnother drawback of the CC method, apart from\
    \ the\ncomputational complexity, is the link-performance dete-\nrioration, i.e.,\
    \ an increase of the BER. This is due to the\nfact that an OFDM system usually\
    \ operates under the\ntotal power constraint. If part of an OFDM symbol\nenergy\
    \ is sacrificed to the CCs, the remaining energy\nthat can be used for data transmission\
    \ is reduced, and\nthis naturally results in an SNR loss and corresponding\nBER\
    \ degradation.\nNevertheless, the CC algorithm has been extensively\ninvestigated,\
    \ and a number of modifications and combi-\nnations of the CC algorithm with other\
    \ methods has\nbeen presented in the literature, e.g., refer to proposed\napproaches\
    \ in [35-37]. For example, active interference\ncancellation (AIC) [33] is a method\
    \ similar to CCs solu-\ntion, where in addition to the OFDM edge-subcarriers\n\
    several other subcarriers inside the PU transmission\nband are also used to minimize\
    \ the OOB radiation.\nHowever, as shown in the aforementioned paper, the\nAIC\
    \ subcarriers inside the PU transmission band pos-\nsess a negligible influence\
    \ on the OOB interference.\nMoreover, they can significantly increase the computa-\n\
    tional complexity of the resulting implementation. The\nCCs method is very flexible\
    \ in terms of defining the\nnumber of cancellation subcarriers and their power\n\
    levels. Moreover, some of its shortcomings can be effi-\nciently equalized if\
    \ the W method with a parameter-\ndefined window duration is also applied.\nIn\
    \ Table 1, the main properties of the OOB power\nreduction methods discussed in\
    \ this section are sum-\nmarized. From this summary, we can conclude that the\n\
    methods best-suited for the application in CR and the\nDSA networks are the CC\
    \ and W methods. Moreover,\nthe combination of these two methods have the poten-\n\
    tial for some promising performance improvements in\nterms of flexibility. In\
    \ the next section, we discuss the\ncombination of these methods in detail, and\
    \ propose\nnew algorithm that allows for reduction of its computa-\ntional complexity,\
    \ reduction of the power assigned to\nthe CCs (considered wasted for the transmission\
    \ of sym-\nbols bearing no information), improvement of BER and\nthus, for the\

    \ band on the frequency axis, the CCs\nmethod has the same behavior for components\
    \ closer to\nthe OFDM nominal band as shown in [34]. Thus, the\ncombination of\
    \ both methods, which was also presented\nin [34], provides additional degrees\
    \ of freedom as the\nnumber of CCs and window shapes can be altered to\nfulfill\
    \ the transmission requirements. In this section, we\npresent several additional\
    \ enhancements to this com-\nbined approach, thus yielding a reduction in the\
    \ compu-\ntational complexity, reduction of the energy-loss (energy\ninefficiency)\
    \ due to the use of the CCs, and an improve-\nment of the BER performance.\nThe\
    \ system that we consider in this research consists\nof a conventional OFDM modulator,\
    \ where the CCs\nunit, which performs the CCs algorithm, is employed\nprior to\
    \ the N-size IFFT block, and windowing is\napplied to the time domain signal after\
    \ extending it with\nthe CP. The resulting OFDM-modulated signal after the\nOOB\
    \ interference reduction process is then fed to the\ndigital-to-analog converter\
    \ and the IF/RF (Intermediate\nFrequency/Radio Frequency) front-end.\nThe CCs\
    \ optimization formula must be designed for\nthe time domain windowed signal y.\
    \ Suppose we denote\nthe input of the IFFT as the vector s = {s-N/2, ..., sN/2-1},\n\
    which contains zeros except for the elements indexed as\nc = {c1,..., cg} and\
    \ d = {d1,..., da}, where the CCs symbol\nvalues and the data symbols are inserted,\
    \ respectively.\nThe optimization of cancellation symbols is based on\nthe estimation\
    \ of the spectrum values resulting from the\nsuperposition of the spectra of each\
    \ CC and DC. The\ntime-domain OFDM symbol vector y elements can be\nmathematically\
    \ expressed as:\nyk = wk\nN/2−1\n\t\nn=−N/2\nsn exp\n\x06\nj2π nk\nN\n\a\n,\n\
    (5)\nwhere this OFDM-symbol spectrum estimate at fre-\nquency bin l can be derived\
    \ by preforming the M-times\nupsampled FFT for this point bl using the following\n\

    The commonly used optimization problem definition\ncan be expressed using the\

    Page 7 of 20\nFirst, as shown in [32], several parts of the OFDM\nsymbol power\
    \ will need to be allocated to the CCs.\nThus, in practical systems with an appropriately\
    \ chosen\npower constraint, the SNR for the data carriers is\nreduced by the estimated\
    \ value:\nξ = 10log10\n\x06||sc||2 + ||sd||2\n||sd||2\n\a\n.\n(9)\nThe reference\
    \ system in this case is the one that\nemploys the nulled guard sub carriers on\
    \ the subcarriers\nused by the CCs method in the proposed system.\nAnother significant\
    \ drawback is a substantial increase of\nthe PAPR that is caused by the high power\
    \ values trans-\nmitted on the CCs correlated with the DCs. Apart from\nthe PAPR\
    \ value, usually the probability of peaks occur-\nrence is also taken into account\
    \ since it is conceivable\nthat the time-domain peaks possessing moderate instan-\n\
    taneous power can cause nonlinear distortions and per-\nformance deterioration\
    \ that can prove to be much\nworse than the high power (strong) peaks occurring\n\
    relatively infrequently. On the basis of this observation,\nthe PAPR is measured\
    \ with a certain probability pPSPR.\nWe will determine this metric later in this\
    \ section when\nproviding simulation results for a probability of pPAPR\n= 10-3.\n\
    Finally, an important phenomenon when applying the\nCC method for OOB interference\
    \ reduction is the\noccurrence of frequency-domain power peaks for fre-\nquencies\
    \ assigned to the CCs. This is due to the fact\nthat the CCs have to compensate\
    \ for a number of DC\nsidelobes. A large power increase at the edges of the\n\
    NC-OFDM frequency spectrum (where CCs are located)\nmay be unacceptable according\
    \ to the existing regula-\ntions that impose constraints on the transmission spec-\n\
    tral masks. In order to provide some metric reflecting\nthis problem, let us define\
    \ the spectrum overshooting\nratio (SOR) for a given probability psor of exceeding\n\
    level ϱ of the spectrum mask by the CCs power:\nSOR = 10log10\n⎛\n⎜⎜⎝\nargϱ[Pr(S(fCC)\
    \ > ϱ) = pSOR]\n1\nBSU - CC\n\x0F\nBSU - CC S(f)df\n⎞\n⎟⎟⎠ , (10)\nwhere S(f)\
    \ is the power spectral density (PSD) function\nof the considered NC-OFDM secondary-user\
    \ signal,\nBSU-CC is the ba ndwidth of the considered NC-OFDM\nsecondary-user\
    \ transmission used by the data subcar-\nriers (excluding cancellation subcarriers\
    \ frequency\nbands), and fCC is any one of the frequencies belonging\nto CCs bands.\
    \ This definition for the SOR can be inter-\npreted as the logarithm of the PSD\
    \ peaks of CCs with\nrespect to the mean power level in data carriers band.\n\
    The occurrence of these peaks is measured with\nprobability pSOR. Note that in\
    \ simulation results pre-\nsented in the next subsection, pSOR = 10-1 will be\
    \ con-\nsidered. This probabilistic approach is required to take a\nvarying characteristic\
    \ of the PSD estimate into account.\nTo overcome the aforementioned problem with\n\
    respect to an unacceptable power increase, we propose\nto supplement the optimization\
    \ problem described by\n(7) with an additional, indirect constraint whose aim\
    \ is\nto minimize the CCs power. The optimization problem\nis now defined as follows:\n\
    min\nsc\n\x13\b\b\bP(δ×γ )\nCC\nsc + P(δ×α)\nDC\nsd\n\b\b\b\n2\n+ μ||sc||2\n\x14\
    \n,\n(11)\nwhere μ factor is used to balance between the CCs\npower and resulting\
    \ OOB power reduction. The solu-\ntion of this problem can be derived by merging\
    \ both\nconditions and related matrix operations, and results in\nthe following\
    \ vector of CCs, namely:\nsc = −\n\x15\nP(δ×γ )\nCC\n√μI(γ ×γ )\n\x16+ \x06\n\
    P(δ×α)\nCC\n0\n\a\nsd = Wsd,\n(12)\nwhere I(g × g) is a g-size identity matrix,\
    \ and W results\nfrom multiplication of the first two matrices in the\nabove equation.\
    \ Such an optimization has similar com-\nputational complexity to the optimization\
    \ problem of\n(7), as only once for a given spectrum mask, and after\nthe number\
    \ of DCs and CCs are determined, the opti-\nmization (calculation of matrix W)\
    \ is implemented.\nThen, for each OFDM symbol, matrix-by-vector multi-\nplication\
    \ is carried out with pre-calculated matrix W\nelements. The performance and influence\
    \ on various\nsystem parameters will be evaluated in the next section.\nThe optimization\
    \ procedure described above signifi-\ncantly reduces the SNR loss typically found\
    \ for a CCs\nmethod. This is obtained as a result of imposing a con-\nstraint\
    \ on the value of the SOR, which consequently\nreduces the power assigned to CCs\
    \ and increases power\nreserved for the DCs. Nevertheless, the reduced power\n\
    available for data subcarriers still cause some deteriora-\ntion of the reception\
    \ quality. Therefore, we propose the\nfollowing reception technique that makes\
    \ use of the\nCCs inherent redundancy.\nAs the CCs are correlated with data symbols,\
    \ these\nadditional subcarriers can be used in the signal recep-\ntion that might\
    \ not only regain the power devoted to\nthese subcarriers in the first place,\
    \ but also make use of\nthe frequency diversity for achieving a higher degree\
    \ of\nrobustness with respect to the frequency-selective fad-\ning. Let us consider\
    \ Equation (12) as a process of gener-\nating redundancy symbols sc transmitted\
    \ in parallel to\ndata symbols sd. This operation is conducted on the\ncomplex\
    \ symbols, thus allowing us to employ the theory\nKryszkiewicz et al. EURASIP\

    \ To do so, let us rewrite Equation (12) in\norder to determine the systematic\
    \ code generation\nmatrix G of size (g + a × a), namely:\nG =\n\x06Iα×α\nW\n\a\
    \n.\n(13)\nBy changing the row order of presented matrix, the\norder of data and\
    \ cancellation symbols can be kept, but\nfor simplicity we will skip this operation.\
    \ A simple\nreception mechanism designed for such codes is based\non the zero-forcing\
    \ criterion, for which the reception\nmatrix is defined as:\nR = (HG)+,\n(14)\n\
    where H is (g + a × g + a) diagonal matrix with chan-\nnel coefficients for each\
    \ of used subcarriers on its diago-\nnal. This matrix should be used in the receiver\
    \ after the\nFFT processing instead of an equalizer used in standard\nreception\
    \ chain. The estimate of the data symbols ˆsd is\nachieved by the following operation:\n\
    ˆsd = Rˆsd+c,\n(15)\nwhere ˜sd+c is a received vertical vector at the output\n\
    of FFT block containing distorted and noisy values of\ndata and cancellation subcarriers.\
    \ Although the calcula-\ntion of matrix R can be quite complex, it needs to be\n\
    performed only once for each channel instance and sub-\ncarrier pattern. Moreover,\
    \ with a systematic code imple-\nmentation, this method may be treated as optional,\n\
    reserved only for high performance, high quality\nreception.\nFinally, let us\
    \ derive a metric that indicates the potential\nthroughput loss caused by introduction\
    \ of CCs, window-\ning or the combination of CCs and W. This throughput\nloss\
    \ can be assessed in comparison to a system not\nemploying any OOB interference\
    \ reduction method, in\nwhich all subcarriers are occupied by the DCs. Note that\n\
    the actual system throughput depends not only on the\nnumber of data subcarriers\
    \ but also on the power assigned\nto these subcarriers and the channel characteristic\n\
    observed. Therefore, this metric indicates only potential\nthroughput loss that\
    \ results from the information signal\nbandwidth reduction due to introduction\
    \ of the CCs and\nwindow duration extension, thus assuming the same\ntransmit\
    \ power and channel quality at each subcarrier. It\nis described by the following\
    \ expression:\nRloss =\n⎛\n⎜⎜⎝1 −\n1 −\nγ\nγ + α\n1 +\nβ\nN + NCP\n⎞\n⎟⎟⎠ .100%.\n\
    (16)\nNote that the reference system for this definition, i.e.,\nall subcarriers\
    \ employed for data transmission, is pro-\nhibited from operating in the considered\
    \ scenario,\nwhere the PU transmission protection is required and\nthe SU sidelobes\
    \ have to be reduced.\n4.1.1 Simulation results\nBelow, we present the Monte Carlo\
    \ simulation results\nusing MATLAB and showing that our introduced modi-\nfications\
    \ of the combined CC and W method improves\nthe overall performance of the NC-OFDM\
    \ system in\nseveral ways. In our experiments, we assumed N = 256\nsubcarriers,\
    \ where the subcarriers possessing the indices\nd = {- 100,..., -62} ∪ {-41,...,\
    \ -11} ∪ {10,..., 40} ∪ {61,...,\n101} are occupied by the QPSK data symbols,\
    \ and there\nare three CCs placed on each side of data carriers\nblocks, i.e.\
    \ c = {- 103, -102, -101} ∪ {- 10, -9, -8}∪{7, 8,\n9}∪{41, 42, 43}∪{58, 59, 60}∪{102,\
    \ 103, 104}. The subcar-\nriers pattern of four data subcarrier blocks is separated\n\
    with narrowband PUs, e.g., program making and special\nevents (PMSE) devices such\
    \ as professional wireless\nmicrophones with bandwidth of 200 kHz. Note that an\n\
    explanation of the wideband and narrowband PU signals\nand scenarios under consideration\
    \ with respect to the\ncoexistence of the PU and SU transmissions are given in\n\
    the next section, with the real-world experimental\nresults. The duration of the\
    \ CP equals NCP = 16 sam-\nples, but the b = 16 samples of the Hanning window\n\
    extension (equal to CS) are also used on each side of an\nOFDM symbol. The number\
    \ of CCs and shaping win-\ndow duration was chosen in such a way that the mean\n\
    OOB interference power level is achieved at least 40 dB\nbelow the mean in-band\
    \ power level for reasonable\nvalue of μ, i.e., μ = 0.01. This OOB power attenuation\
    \ is\nsufficient in order to respect several regulatory spectrum\nmasks, e.g.,\
    \ IEEE802.11 g [39] or LTE user-equipment\n[40] Spectrum Emission Mask (SEM).\n\
    First, in Figure 3, we show the results of the OOB\npower reduction obtained for\
    \ the following three meth-\nods under consideration: CC method, windowing, and\n\
    combined CC and W scheme. The comparison has been\nperformed for the schemes that\
    \ present the same poten-\ntial throughput loss metric, which for our evaluation\n\
    system equals Rloss = 19.2%. Such a potential throughput\nloss is obtained either\
    \ from the CC method with ge = 4\nCCs per edge of the DCs band, from the W method\n\
    with Hanning window extension of b = 65 samples, or\nfrom the combined CCs and\
    \ W method with ge = 3 and\nb = 16, i.e. the scenario described above. The PSDs\
    \ were\nobtained for the signal before HPA using Welch’s\nmethod after transmitting\
    \ 10,000 random OFDM sym-\nbols. The spectrum was estimated in 4N frequency sam-\n\
    pling points using 3N-length Hanning windows. Note,\nthat the windowing method\
    \ achieves a high OOB power\nKryszkiewicz et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\n\

    \ the OOB attenuation slope. Thus, it is poten-\ntially unsuitable for protecting\
    \ narrowband PU signals\nfrom unintentional secondary OB interference. Conver-\n\
    sely, the CC method alone results in a relatively steep\nOOB power reduction,\
    \ but the resulting OOB attenua-\ntion is not very high. The combination of both\
    \ methods\nprovides decent performance in terms of high and steep\nOOB attenuation,\
    \ thus confirming that such a combina-\ntion of these methods possesses the potential\
    \ for pro-\ntecting both wideband and narrowband PU signals\nemploying strict\
    \ requirements with respect to the sig-\nnal-to-interference-power ratio. According\
    \ to our other\nexperiments for QAM/PSK schemes and to their results\nnot presented\
    \ here, the normalized PSD plots are very\nsimilar.\nIn Figure 4, several of the\
    \ system performance metrics\ndescribed above, such as the SOR for psor = 10-1,\
    \ PAPR\nincrease for pPAPR = 10-3, SNR loss for BER = 10-4, and\nOOB power attenuation,\
    \ are presented in relation to the\noptimization constraint parameter μ Î 〈10-6,100〉.\
    \ Thus,\nthe optimization procedure is considered in the range of\nμ, defining\
    \ scenarios from a weak constraint on the CCs\npower, close to no power-constraint,\
    \ to a constraint on\nthe strictly limited CCs power. For these performance\n\
    metrics under consideration, measurements have been\nobtained after the transmission\
    \ of 2 × 105 OFDM sym-\nbols. The SNR loss has been calculated at the receiver,\n\
    for an example 4-paths Rayleigh-fading channel defined\nin Case 3 test scenario\
    \ for UMTS user equipment [41].\nAveraging of the results has been done using\
    \ 10,000\nchannel realizations.\nIt can be observed in Figure 4 that the OOB power\n\
    attenuation decreases slowly with an increase of μ for\nsmall values of μ. Thus,\
    \ when μ is low, there is no use\nin spending additional power on CCs since the\
    \ spurious\nOOB emissions remain the same. On the other hand,\nlow-power CCs (for\
    \ high μ values) do not provide\nimprovement in OOB power over results obtained\
    \ for\nwindowing method without the application of CCs.\nHowever, the other metrics\
    \ improve when μ increases.\nFor example, the fluctuation of SOR ranges from 13.7\
    \ to\n–3.9 dB. It is worth mentioning that the rest of the sys-\ntem performance\
    \ metrics are calculated with respect to\nthe reference system, which does not\
    \ use windowing\nand CCs for OOB power reduction. Instead, the CCs\nare replaced\
    \ with zeros. The significant improvement is\nobserved in PAPR-increase value\
    \ that approaches zero,\nwhen μ becomes high. Both new optimization goal\ndefined\
    \ by (11), and proposed reception algorithm have\ninfluence on the values of an\
    \ SNR loss with standard\ndetection and with our proposed detection making use\n\
    of the CCs redundancy. The stronger the limit is on the\nCCs power (the higher\
    \ μ) the DCs power is not wasted\nas much on the CCs. Thus, the SNR loss changes\
    \ from\n4.8 dB for μ = 10-6 to nearly 0 dB for μ = 100.\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n\

    \ that not only do the DC power levels\nreassigned to the CCs was recovered, but\
    \ also an addi-\ntional improvement was achieved thanks in part to the\nfrequency\
    \ diversity introduced by CCs treated as parity\nsymbols of the block code. We\
    \ observe that the coding\ngain for BER = 10-4 (with respect to system without\n\
    CCs) varies from 6.42 dB for μ = 4 × 10-6 to 0.7 dB for\nμ = 1. For very low values\
    \ of μ(μ < 4 × 10-6), the SNR\nloss caused by the introduction of CCs becomes\
    \ higher\nthan can be compensated for even by using high power\nCCs, which yields\
    \ a coding gain decrease. The results\npresented in Figure 4 show that our reception\
    \ algorithm\nmaking use of the CCs redundancy yields decent perfor-\nmance even\
    \ in the assumed case of large fragmentation\nof available (not occupied by the\
    \ PUs) frequency bands.\n5 Real-world experimental results\n5.1 Implementation\
    \ setup\nOne application for the deployment of CR systems and\nDSA networks is\
    \ the opportunistic spectral usage of\nunoccupied portions of the TV frequency\
    \ bands by\nfuture mobile radio systems such as long term evolution\n(LTE) mobile\
    \ radio communication [42]. A television\nwhitespace (TVWS) is a region of wireless\
    \ frequencies\nwhere several digital video broadcasting-terrestrial\n(DVB-T) channels\
    \ are not used by a licensed transmis-\nsion, and therefore can be temporarily\
    \ borrowed by\nTVWS devices capable of operating in these bands as\nlong as they\
    \ respect the limits concerning the maximum\nallowable transmit power in this\
    \ area, as well as the\nlevel of their OOB interference power.\nMoreover, it is\
    \ envisioned that wireless microphones\nwill be operating in these TVWS regions\
    \ and associated\nfrequency bands, as well as other wireless devices used\nfor\
    \ PMSE [43]. Although several spectrum regulators\nanticipate reserving one TV\
    \ channel for the exclusive\naccess by PMSE equipment (e.g., U.K. Ofcom reserves\n\
    channel 38), it is anticipated to be not sufficient for\nlarge events that commonly\
    \ use over 100 wireless\nmicrophones. Hence, PMSE devices may be using other\n\
    channels as well. In order to address this application\nscenario, we consider\
    \ the PU signals in this scenario to\nconsist of a DVB-T transmission using an\
    \ 8 MHz chan-\nnel and a PMSE transmission possessing a 200 kHz\nbandwith. Moreover,\
    \ the LTE transmissions are consid-\nered to be SU signals in these frequency\
    \ bands. In parti-\ncular, our tested system implements the LTE-like\ntransmission\
    \ with N = 512 subcarriers, with the possibi-\nlity of turning some of the subcarriers\
    \ off, as well as\nusing some of them as the CCs for OOB interference\nreduction.\
    \ The subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz, and the\nuseful spanned band is 7.68 MHz.\
    \ The CP duration in\nsamples NCP = N/16 has been used, and the binary\nphase\
    \ shift keying (BPSK) signalling has been applied at\neach subcarrier.\nNote that\

    \ is considered as narrowband PU signal. If\nwe consider channelization of the\
    \ available subcarriers\nin blocks of 16 subcarriers, one block of subcarriers\
    \ has\nto be deactivated in order to protect such a narrowband\nPU signal when\
    \ detected. Our second type of PU signal,\nthe DVB-T system uses at minimum 8\
    \ MHz channel,\nand thus more than the assumed SU bandwidth of 7.68\nMHz. Therefore,\
    \ it is considered to be a wideband PU\nsignal, and if such a PU signal is detected,\
    \ its channel\nmust remain unoccupied by the SU system.\nEmploying the assumption\
    \ that the LTE system is\nconsidered to be an SU signal, we investigate the OOB\n\
    interference suppression taken from this system SEM. In\nparticular, our goal\
    \ is to achieve a 59 dB OOB interfer-\nence power attenuation below the PSD level\
    \ of data car-\nriers for the first use-case of the high-power transmitter\nand\
    \ call it use-case 1. Note, that the minimum required\nsuppression defined in\
    \ the LTE Base Station (BS) SEM\nemploys this value, i.e., 59 dB. In our second\
    \ use-case,\ncalled use-case 2, 26 dB will be the required OOB power\nattenuation,\
    \ which is the typical value for the LTE user\nequipment transmitter that has\
    \ to be obeyed in adjacent\nchannels. Note that in order to protect various types\
    \ of\nPU signals present in the spectrum, their required sig-\nnal-to-interference\
    \ ratio must be considered together\nwith the signal attenuation between the SU\
    \ transmitter\nand the PU receiver. Moreover, the PU receive filters\nparameters\
    \ and their sensitivity have to be taken into\naccount.\nIt is envisioned that\
    \ the TVWS geolocation databases\nwill provide the information on the maximum\
    \ in-band\nand OOB power allowable at the specific location for\nthe specific\
    \ devices and services. Here, we assume that\nthe PU signals and SU signals are\
    \ located at a distance\nthat allows the use of the standard SEMs for the\nreduction\
    \ of the OOB interference. Nevertheless, our\nproposed shaping mechanism is designed\
    \ so that it can\nfit flexibly to any existing SEM requirement and the\nOOB power\
    \ suppression requirements can be changed\ndynamically when a new PU is detected\
    \ in the adja-\ncent channel or in the middle of transmission band of\nthe SU.\n\
    In order to evaluate the flexibility of our spectrum\nshaping algorithms, we consider\
    \ the following four sce-\nnarios of the PU and SU coexistence, namely:\n• Scenario\
    \ 1: The SU system occupies continuous\nbandwidth, with only DC carrier turned\
    \ off. The\nDVB-T systems or densely located PMSE devices\n(the PUs) are detected\
    \ to operate on both sides of\nthe SU’s band, which uses subcarriers of indices:\n\
    {-100, ..., -1}∪{1,..., 50}. The OOB power reduction\nmechanisms have to be used\
    \ on both sides of the\nSU band.\n• Scenario 2: Outer wide-band PUs (DVB-T) are\n\
    detected and one narrow-band PU (PMSE device) in\nthe middle of the SU transmission\
    \ band (16 subcar-\nriers turned off). The indices of the SU’s used sub-\ncarriers\
    \ are: {-100,..., -8} ∪ {9,..., 50}.\n• Scenario 3: Outer wide-band PUs (DVB-T)\
    \ are\ndetected and two narrow-band PU using and non-\ncontiguous bands (PMSE\
    \ devices) inside the SU’s\nband. The indices of the SU’s used subcarriers are:\
    \ {-\n100,..., -8} ∪ {9,..., 50} ∪ {67,..., 100}.\nIn each scenario, the same\
    \ number of CCs are com-\nmitted to each edge of the data subcarriers blocks,\
    \ e.g.,\ntwo CCs are used at each edge of the data block in sce-\nnario 2, thus\
    \ the indices of the CCs are: {- 100, -99, -9,\n-8, 9,10, 49, 50}. For the purpose\
    \ of the spectrum win-\ndowing, the Hanning window has been chosen due to\nits\
    \ relatively high OOB interference attenuation. The\nparameters of our experimental\
    \ OFDM-based secondary\nwireless access system implemented for this project are\n\
    given in Table 2. The potential rate-loss values due to\nthe usage of the CCs\
    \ (defined by (16)) are also\npresented.\n5.2 Experiment outcomes\nThe spectrally\
    \ agile OFDM experimental testbed devel-\noped at Poznan University of Technology\
    \ utilizes the\nIRIS SDR platform [44]. IRIS was developed at Trinity\nCollege\
    \ Dublin, and is a GPP-based rapid prototyping\nand deployment system. The building\
    \ blocks of the\nradio components in a transceiver chain are written in\nC++.\
    \ Extensible Markup Language (XML) is used to\nspecify the signal chain construction\
    \ and characteristics.\nThe usability of this platform for demonstration of the\n\
    OFDM signal spectrum shaping based on filtering has\nbeen described in [45]. Using\
    \ this testbed, the IRIS SDR\nplatform has been used in conjunction with the RF\n\
    hardware front-end USRP N210 and its daughterboard\nXCVR2450. The transmitted\
    \ signal spectrum at the out-\nput of the USRP front-end has been measured using\
    \ a\nRhode & Schwarz spectrum analyzer. Additionally, the\ntransmit signal PSD\
    \ at the output of the IRIS SW plat-\nform (at the input of the USRP) has been\
    \ analyzed in\nMATLAB. The implementation setup of this testbed is\nshown in Figure\
    \ 5.\nIn order to allow for the online reconfiguration, com-\nputationally efficient\
    \ fast algorithm for optimization\ndescribed in Section 4 has been applied, whose\
    \ solution\nis given by formula (12). The most computationally\ncomplex operation,\
    \ the matrix pseudoinverse, has been\nperformed using CLAPACK [46] library. Other\
    \ opera-\ntions, i.e., matrix-matrix or matrix-vector multiplication,\nhave been\
    \ performed using self-built functions. How-\never, their performance can be improved\
    \ using low level\nKryszkiewicz et al. EURASIP Journal on Wireless Communications\n\

    \ constructed to be fully reconfigurable, i.e., the\nindices of used data carriers,\
    \ the numbers of CCs at\neach subcarriers block edge ge, or the window duration\n\
    can be changed through the XML file.\nThe USRP interpolates the transmit signal\
    \ in the field\nprogrammable gate array (FPGA) unit, but the interpo-\nlation\
    \ filters are not very flat in their passband, espe-\ncially when higher sampling\
    \ rates are used, and\ntherefore, some stages of the interpolation filters have\
    \ to\nbe turned off. To present reliable results, this threat had\nto be avoided,\
    \ and thus the sampling rate was limited to\n5 MSps. This changes the subcarriers\
    \ spacing to about\n9.8 kHz while other parameters of OFDM modulation,\ne.g.,\
    \ CP length or number of subcarriers, are kept the\nsame. Moreover, the PU bandwidth\
    \ was also proportion-\nally downscaled. Thus, the subcarriers block that needs\n\
    to be turned off to protect the PMSE device (our nar-\nrow-band PU) still consisted\
    \ of 16 subcarriers. The\nparameters of our CR transmitter implemented on the\n\
    IRIS platform and of the Rhode & Schwarz spectrum\nanalyzer used in the experiments\
    \ are shown in Table 3.\nIn Figures 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and 11, we present the results\n\

    \ The red curves\npresent the PSD of the NC-OFDM signals with deacti-\nvated subcarriers,\

    \ relatively high power levels, i.e., only\n20 dB below the power level in useful\

    \ at the output of the SW platform (the input\nto the USRP front-end) with our\
    \ OOB reduction algo-\nrithm based on modified CC method with reduced com-\nplexity\

    \ required OOB power levels\n(either 59 dB or 26 dB below the power level in the\n\
    nominal band) is achieved using adjustable parameters\n(the values of which are\
    \ presented in Table 2). The\nsame signal PSD at the output of the USRP front-end\n\
    taken from the spectrum analyzer is plotted in black.\nThe green line relates\
    \ to the noise PSD observed in the\nspectrum analyzer. Note, that the USRP front-end\
    \ intro-\nduces several nonlinearities that restrict the effectiveness\nof the\

    Page 16 of 20\nthe transmit power nor the PAPR reduction has resulted\nin any\
    \ positive effect to reduce these nonlinear distor-\ntions in this experimental\
    \ testbed. This is due to the\nfact that the amplifier does not operate in its\
    \ saturation\nregion with respect to its input-output characteristic,\nbut it\
    \ is still highly nonlinear. However, the quality of\nthe USRP platform is not\
    \ at the same caliber as an\nactual commercial base station, where higher-quality\n\
    equipment is installed, and where there are high\nrequirements for the OOB power\
    \ attenuation.\n5.3 Complexity versus interference suppression\nperformance\n\
    The complexity of the proposed combination of CCs\nand a windowing algorithm is\
    \ evaluated in this subsec-\ntion. At the transmitter side, the complexity is\
    \ signifi-\ncantly reduced in comparison with the standard\nimplementation of\
    \ the CC method. It is achieved via\npre-computation of the W(g × a) matrix, which\
    \ has the\nindirect constraint on the computational complexity\nembedded. Thus,\
    \ the optimization procedure (which is\nparticulary complex) does not have to\
    \ be performed on-\nline for every OFDM-symbol. Instead it is implemented\nby\
    \ multiplication of the data vector by the pre-com-\nputed matrix, as described\
    \ in Section 4. The most com-\nplex operation is the computation of the pseudoinverse\n\
    of a δ +g × g complex matrix. To achieve required accu-\nracy of this task it\
    \ is done by means of singular value\ndecomposition whose complexity is 26g3 +\
    \ 8δg2 + 4δ2g\n[47]. As g is a number of CCs, which is usually much\nlower than\
    \ the number of sampling points 8 in the opti-\nmization region and lower than\
    \ the number of DCs a,\nthis operation is feasible for the implementation even\n\
    for portable devices.\nThe most important in our implementation was to\nreduce\
    \ the number of computations needed for each\nOFDM symbol. This aim was achieved\
    \ as calculation of\nCCs requires only ag complex multiplications and (a –\n1)g\
    \ additions. The second part of shaping is achieved by\nwindowing that requires\
    \ extending each OFDM symbol.\nOn each side of this symbol b samples are multiplied\
    \ by\nwindowing slopes, and thus 2b complex-by-real multi-\nplications are required.\
    \ As subsequent OFDM symbols\noverlap by b samples, b pairs of complex numbers\
    \ have\nto be added.\nThe proposed receiver discussed in Section 4 intro-\nduces\
    \ some additional complexity over the standard\nOFDM reception. This proposed\
    \ reception algorithm\nresults in noticeable performance improvement compen-\n\
    sating for the power-loss (power wastage) related to the\nuse of CCs. Nevertheless\
    \ it is optional, and plausible to\nbe used by more powerful devices where the\
    \ highest\nquality is required even at the cost of reasonably\nincreased computational\
    \ complexity. In such a case, the\nmatrix-by-vector multiplication using a(a +\
    \ g - 1) addi-\ntions and (a + g)a multiplications is required for each\n−250\n\

    \ 20\nOFDM symbol. The calculation of the reception (decod-\ning) matrix is more\
    \ complex as it requires computation\nof the pseudoinverse of the dimension (a\
    \ + g) × a com-\nplex matrix. Based on [47], one can evaluate the com-\nplexity\
    \ of such an operation as 4(a + g)2a + 22a3\ncomplex operations. In case of a\
    \ slowly varying channel,\nthe update of this matrix can be performed in long\
    \ peri-\nodic time intervals. Efficient algorithms for updating the\npseudoinverse\
    \ on the basis of a previously computed\npseudoinverse also exist, and can be\
    \ used for the\nimproved reception of the NC-OFDM signal with CCs.\nThe computational\
    \ complexity per an OFDM symbol\nis summarized in Table 4. For clear comparison\
    \ a sum-\nmarized number of complex additions and multiplica-\ntions for each\
    \ of our used test scenarios and use-cases is\nshown. We can observe that in all\
    \ investigated scenarios\nand test cases the contribution of the CC method to\
    \ the\ncomputational complexity of the OOB power reduction\nmethod at the transmitter\
    \ is the highest. In particular,\nin scenario 3 and use-case 1, when strong OOB\
    \ radia-\ntion suppression is required and many DCs are used the\ncomplexity of\
    \ the method becomes high. The only way\nto obtain similar results in terms of\
    \ the signal PSD with\nlower computational complexity is to balance window-\n\
    ing and CCs share in the proposed method, i.e. increase\nthe window extenssion\
    \ b and decrease the number of\nCCs g. Though, according to results of Section\
    \ 4.1.1 this\nwill provide significantly higher throughput loss required\nto maintain\
    \ the same OOB power level. Note, that the\nparameters of the applied OOB power\
    \ reduction method\ndepends on the use-case and scenario to be addressed,\nwhich\
    \ in turn depend on the type of a PU neighboring\nthe SU transmission on the frequency\
    \ axis and their\nused frequency bands.\nThe receiver complexity in our system\
    \ depends\nstrongly on the applied configuration. Our proposed\ndecoding method\
    \ decreases the BER significantly, but is\napproximately 300 times more computationally\
    \ complex\nthan standard detection. In addition, matrix-based\nreception depends\
    \ strongly on number of DCs, so the\nworst result is observed in scenario 3. Nevetheless\
    \ our\nproposed decoding is optional, as explained previously,\nand thus, it can\
    \ be used only by more powerful devices.\n6 Conclusion\nIn this article, practical\
    \ considerations with respect to\nthe protection of primary user transmissions\
    \ using CR\nsystems performing DSA have been presented. In parti-\ncular, we have\
    \ identified NC-OFDM technique as a\nviable transmission technology capable of\
    \ supporting\nspectrally agile communications within the context of\nDSA. We have\
    \ also presented several methods for hand-\nling the OOB interference generated\
    \ by NC-OFDM SU\ntransmissions, observing that this type of interference\ncan\
    \ be reduced down to a level required to protect the\ntransmission quality of\
    \ the PU signals.\nMoreover, we have identified the combination of the\nCCs and\
    \ windowing methods to be particularly efficient\nin terms of the OOB interference\
    \ power reduction, an\nin terms of its flexibility to adjust the SU spectrum to\n\
    the required spectrum emission mask. Our proposed\nimprovements and modifications\
    \ have resulted in a\nreduction in the computational complexity of the energy\n\
    consumption of the OOB interference reduction meth-\nods, regaining the power\
    \ “wasted” by the CCs at the\nreceiver by making use of the CCs correlation with\
    \ the\ndata carriers. The so-called spectrum overshooting pro-\nblem has been\

    Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for optimizing the overall
    performance of vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA) networks. Due to the high
    level of mobility for vehicles operating under highway conditions, coupled with
    spatially variant spectrum allocation across a large geographical region, we envision
    that future vehicular communications will employ a form of dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) in order to facilitate wireless transmissions between vehicles and with
    roadside infrastructure. In particular, the VDSA concept will be enabled by a
    combination of software-defined radio (SDR) technology, spectral occupancy databases,
    and machine learning techniques for enabling network automation. A vehicular networking
    scenario is substantially different relative to a generic mobile scenario with
    respect to the high level of mobility involved, the predictable trajectories of
    the vehicular traffic, and the overall scale of the network range. Consequently,
    the proposed architecture is designed to enable VDSA in a more flexible wireless
    spectrum environment by leveraging the cognitive radio concept and existing wireless
    spectrum databases actively being developed while simultaneously being compatible
    with current spectrum regulations. Regarding practical issues for vehicular communications,
    vehicle mobility is taken into account in order to ensure primary user protection,
    databases and channel priority schemes are used in order to record temporal and
    spatial channel heterogeneity, and vehicle path prediction techniques are employed
    in order to enhance channel access in this operating environment. Specifically,
    we show the advantages of employing the proposed learning architecture via a case
    study where reinforcement learning is used in order to achieve intelligent channel
    selection within a realistic VDSA environment. Moreover, performance enhancements
    in terms of channel switching times, interference, and throughput are shown via
    computer simulations. (Show More) Published in: 2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands I. Introduction Vehicular
    networking possesses significant potential for enabling diverse applications associated
    with traffic safety, traffic efficiency and information provisioning [1]. Recently,
    there has been a rapid accumulation of knowledge in this exciting area propelled
    by a highly active research community consisting of both academia and industry.
    Ever since 1999, when the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
    allocated 75 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for dedicated short-range communications
    (DSRC) to be used by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), applications involving
    one-way and two-way vehicle-oriented communications have evolved into many various
    forms. As the automotive sector continues to evolve and electronic devices become
    smaller and more powerful, new features are being introduced into the next generation
    of vehicles. Consequently, we can expect that vehicular communications will become
    ubiquitous in the foreseeable future, resulting in a significant increase in the
    bandwidth required by various applications. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive Radio research has been focusing mostly on
    Dynamic Spectrum Access concepts, and one of the key architectural components
    there is the capability to express and regulate Policies. In this paper we will
    report on our work of extending the existing policy language and server concepts
    to a wider context. As cognitive radios will eventually become software defined
    radios, there is a number of non-spectrum related policies that require management.
    In fact, there is a rich interplay between spectrum and other policies, and they
    can influence each other in the final policy reasoning. We discuss the rationale
    on extending policy languages to include functional description of utilities that
    users and applications perceive. We add also various ways to express priorities
    and preferences between technologies and services. Further we report on the on-going
    work and results, which we have obtained on implementing such extensions as a
    part of CoRaL language that has been proposed earlier by SRI. We also outline
    policy implications of such extensions. Published in: 2010 IEEE Symposium on New

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: Wireless multi-vision applications for home entertainment
    are becoming an important trend in consumer electronics domain. Currently, most
    of the existing applications rely on the 802.11g/n standards, capable to seamlessly
    stream HD video contents. These standards are operating in the license-free ISM
    band, which, due to the rapid revolution in wireless communication in past years,
    is becoming overexploited and experiences serious coexistence problems. The spectrum
    overcrowding in the free bands puts in a new light the VHF and UHF bands that
    are currently seen as a promising alternative spectrum resource, especially in
    the perspective of the worldwide switchover from analog to digital TV and in the
    light of the new emerging dynamic spectrum access techniques. Within this framework,
    this paper presents an unlicensed cognitive radio indoor multi-vision system operating
    in the UHF TV band for short-range indoor transmission of high definition TV contents.
    The system relies on a combined exclusive approach of spectrum sensing and geo-location
    database and is compliant with the DVB-T2 broadcasting standard. A proof-of-concept
    digital terrestrial television (DTT) compliant prototype has been implemented
    on a test-bed based on commercial DTT receivers in combination with software defined
    radio hardware devices. Extended measurements performed in a real indoor environment
    assessed the feasibility of the proposed system in terms of coverage and protection
    of the incumbent users. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics

    The evolution of wireless communication systems and networks in recent years has
    been explosive. This trend had an enormous impact also on short-range indoor consumer
    applications. Within this field, several new means for delivering services, such
    as TV video streaming over IP (IPTV) based either on XDSL or in the forthcoming
    near future on WiMAX, LTE or LTE-A access, are arising beside traditional terrestrial
    and satellite systems [1]. All these new access techniques are providing broadband
    services, enabling the streaming of high definition video and audio information
    [2]. The new generation set-top boxes are provided with the multiple access feature
    being able to decode heterogeneous TV input signals (e.g., DVB-T, DVB-S, IPTV)
    whereas the promise of multi-room digital video recording, as well as the ability
    to deliver commercial content to more devices within the same domestic environment,
    excites both consumers and service providers. Within this context, the Digital
    Living Network Alliance (DLNA) has developed a robust set of technical guidelines
    for high-quality streaming of multimedia content over both wireless and wired
    network connections between home entertainment and mobile devices [3]. The DLNA
    guidelines provide for a homogeneous and universal infrastructure through Wi-Fi
    802.11 for wireless connectivity and Multimedia over Coax Alliance (MoCA) for
    wired connections. MoCA uses an infrastructure based on coaxial cable for providing
    reliable distribution of video content [4]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    An integrated spectrum analyzer is useful for built-in self-test purposes, software-defined

    a noise floor below − 169 dBm/Hz, an IIP 3 of + 25 dBm, and more than 20 dB of

    Publisher: IEEE I. Introduction Wideband integrated receivers for software-defined
    radios (SDRs) face several significant challenges due to the required wideband
    operation. Limited filtering before the signal enters the chip causes strong interferers
    in combination with the circuit''s nonlinearity to create distortion products.
    These same interferers impose gain limitations on the receiver chain, causing
    thermal noise to degrade the performance as well. Furthermore, widely tunable
    frequency generation generally results in higher phase noise. Reciprocal mixing

    4 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract Technologies such as cognitive radio and dynamic
    spectrum access rely on spectrum sensing which provides wireless devices with
    information about the radio spectrum in the surrounding environment. One of the
    main challenges in wireless communications is the interference caused by malicious
    users on the shared spectrum. In this manuscript, an artificial intelligence enabled
    cognitive radio framework is proposed at system-level as part of a cyclic spectrum
    intelligence algorithm for interference mitigation in wideband radios. It exploits
    the cyclostationary feature of signals to differentiate users with different modulation
    schemes and an artificial neural network as classifier to detect potential malicious
    users. A dataset consisting of experimental modulated and dynamic signals is recorded
    by spectrum measurements with an in-house software defined radio testbed and then
    processed. Cyclostationary features are extracted for each detected signal and
    fed to a neural network classifier as training and testing data in a complex and
    dynamic scenario. Results highlight a classification rate of in most of cases,
    even at low transmission power. A comparison with two previous works with hand-crafted
    features, which employ an energy detector-based classifier and a naive Bayes-based
    classifier, respectively, is discussed. 1 Introduction Recent advances in software
    defined radio (SDR) and machine learning, in addition to results obtained in computational
    neuroscience [1], open new horizons towards innovative technologies in different
    fields including cognitive radio (CR) [2]. Basically, CR deals with the growing
    demand and shortage of the wireless spectrum. In order to utilise the spectrum
    efficiently, TV white spaces (TVWS) [3-7] allows secondary users to use licensed
    spectrum bands provided that they change their access strategies to avoid or reduce
    interference to the primary users. Dynamic spectrum access, or dynamic channel
    access, assumes an important role in both TVWS CR networks [8] and the recent
    5G technology [9]. On the other hand, though, signals can be transmitted in the
    shared spectrum with different objectives which means that legitimate signals
    use the spectrum in a legitimate way complying with the security requirements
    and avoiding interference to other users, while malicious signals are transmitted
    with the objective of causing interference or disrupting legitimate communications
    of the targeted system. Indeed, radio communications in wireless environments
    introduce security issues due to external attacks from malicious devices owing
    to the broadcast nature of radio propagation. In particular, the physical-layer
    (or PHY-layer) is extremely vulnerable to jamming attacks. Nowadays, the need
    for measurable security in the context of interoperating services, applications,
    systems, and devices in a cyber-physical systems and internet-of-things [10] framework
    requires the development of an appropriate paradigm. A step forward in that direction
    is made by SHIELD which consists of methodologies for building secure embedded
    systems [11]. Recently, the problem of malicious user detection has also been
    addressed by TVWS research in [12]. Spectrum sensing information plays a key role
    in anti-jamming systems. This information may be used to detect potential jamming
    entities [13] and to take proactive measures, as the channel hopping strategy
    in [14], to ensure communication continuity and security [15]. Moreover, a history
    of observations can be maintained and used to devise more effective anti-jamming
    tactics. In literature, various spectrum sensing techniques have been proposed
    for CRs [16], such as energy detector (ED) [17], cyclostationary feature detector
    (CFD) [18], matched filtering detector (MFD) [19], and wavelet transform (WT)-based
    detector [20]. Among these methods, the CFD is capable of detecting the primary
    signal from the interference and noise even in very low signal-to-noise ratio
    (SNR) regions. This detection performance is achieved at the cost of increased
    implementation complexity. The Federal Communications Commission of the USA has
    suggested CFD as an alternative to improve the detection sensitivity in CR networks.
    Generally, ED fails at low SNRs while MFD requires a dedicated receiver structure
    which may not be possible in a practical CR terminal. CFD exploits the cyclostationarity
    of modulated signals by detecting spectral peaks in spectral correlation function
    (SCF) or spectral coherence function [21-23], which are sparse in both angular
    (f) and cyclic () frequency domain. Major advantage of CFD based detector lies
    on its abilities to perform better than ED at low SNR values and to distinguish
    different modulated signals. Furthermore, the cyclic spectral analysis has been
    used as a robust tool for signal classification when the carrier frequency and
    bandwidth information is unavailable [24, 25]. Compressed sensing, investigated
    in wideband (WB) cognitive networks [26], has also been applied to a cyclostationary
    based detector in [27]. A comparison among the most common sensing methods (energy
    detection, cyclostationary, radio identification, match filtering, and waveform-based
    sensing) in terms of complexity and accuracy is made in [28]. Features-based algorithms
    require classification methods to evaluate the most probable class where the observed
    features belong to. Choosing the most suitable classification algorithm is not
    the only challenge to obtain satisfying performance and classification accuracy.
    Indeed, selection of features and the feature extraction algorithm play a fundamental
    role as they strongly influence the accuracy on the classified signals. Spectrum
    intelligence algorithms in [29, 30] utilise hand-crafted features such as bandwidth,
    magnitude, and variance for each of the signals. The former employs an ED-based
    classifier with a hypothesis test, while the latter proposes a Bayes-based classifier.
    The main drawback related to these two approaches is that both the variability
    of the extracted features and noise prevent to obtain accurate classification
    especially at low SNR level. A cyclic spectrum intelligence (CSI) algorithm (Fig.
    1) is proposed in this manuscript in an artificial intelligence enabled (AI-enabled)
    CR framework as an alternative to the existing solutions in [29, 30] and based
    on a cognitive cycle to acquire self-awareness from spectrum measurements. First,
    instantaneous spectrum data is collected at sensing stage through a SDR testbed
    and, then, the WB spectrum is processed to identify fast Fourier transform (FFT)
    bins corresponding to single waveforms and group them. Afterwards, analysis is
    applied. Unlike the spectrum intelligence in [29, 30], CSI employs a CFD to extract
    more advanced features and an artificial neural network (ANN) [31] to classify
    the observed signals and perform interference mitigation in a WB spectrum. Specifically,
    the cyclostationary feature, called -profile, of each detected signal in the band-of-interest
    is classified through the ANN-based recogniser. Results are promising and show
    high classification rate even for low transmission power case. Moreover, CSI produces
    better or comparable classification rates with respect to the existing approaches.
    Cyclic spectral analysis and complexity are discussed throughout the manuscript.
    For the sake of completeness, learning and acting blocks are also introduced.
    Fig. 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Proposed AI-enabled CR framework with
    CSI algorithm The main novelty is then the newly proposed analysis block as part
    of a new CSI algorithm for interference mitigation in WB radios at system level.
    This improves the resulting performance of two major previous works in the literature
    for spectrum intelligence algorithms. Moreover, unlike previous work, our classification
    scheme is tested in a complex dynamic environment which is the most probable scenario
    in CR applications. The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. The proposed
    CSI algorithm and the experimental set-up for the sensing block are described
    in Section 2. Data acquisition and the processing block are introduced in Section
    3; while cyclostationary feature analysis and the neural network classifier in
    the analysis block are described in Section 6 which also includes a discussion
    on cyclic spectral analysis and complexity. In Section 11, Learning and Acting
    blocks conclude the cognitive cycle. Validation of the proposed approach with
    experimental data is analysed in Section 14 along with a comparison with two previous
    works. Some conclusive considerations and future work can be found in Section
    15. 2 CSI algorithm and experimental set-up The principal idea behind the CSI
    algorithm is to continuously monitor relevant radio-frequency (RF) spectrum activities,
    identify potential threats to the communication, and take proactive measures to
    ensure communication robustness and secrecy. For doing so, the algorithm relies
    on the reliable spectrum sensing mechanism, correct identification and extraction
    of the relevant parameters, and secure software unsubjected to tampering. In comparison
    with the spectrum intelligence algorithm in [29], the proposed CSI algorithm employs
    a cyclostationary feature algorithm to extract the -profile feature from the detected
    signals which is then fed to a neural network to classify the waveforms present
    into the observed spectrum. The functional process of the CSI algorithm can be
    represented in the form of the cognitive cycle, as shown in Fig. 1, consisting
    of five blocks: Sensing, Processing, Analysis, Learning, and Acting. Sensing and
    Acting blocks represent the interface with the external radio environment. The
    cognitive cycle is described throughout the manuscript. At the sensing phase,
    data acquisition systems consisting of physical devices such as antennas, sensors,
    and processing units are used as interface. Hardware architectures have been used
    in the literature to implement spectrum sensing in CR systems, such as the universal
    software radio peripheral in a GNU-Radio framework in [32, 33]. While, to validate
    the proposed CSI algorithm, a SDR hardware platform has been employed to generate
    modulated signals in a specified band, namely 0–120 MHz which includes the very
    high frequency (VHF) band at 30–88 MHz. Alternatively, the ultra high frequency
    (UHF) band can be selected. The testbed is remotely controlled and can be employed
    in on-line applications. Although previous work based on the aforementioned testbed
    was carried out in anti-jamming scenarios such in [30], it has never been collected
    a large amount of experimental data in dynamic environments in which signals change
    either their carrier frequency or their transmission power (or both of them),
    stored in a complex dataset with a wide range of signal characteristics and shapes,
    and organised for off-line applications. The testbed employed to generate real-data
    is a SDR platform which consists of two secure WB multi-role - single-channel
    handheld radios (SWAVE HHs) shown in Fig. 2, the first one is the transmitter
    while the second one receives the WB signal, connected through a dual directional
    coupler. Fig. 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint SDR testbed utilised to generate
    the dataset with WB spectrum measurements: hardware platform The fully operational
    SDR radio terminal SelexES (2013), SWAVE HH (from now on referred to as HH), is
    capable of generating a multitude of WB and narrowband waveforms. Currently, two
    functional waveforms are installed on the radio: SelfNET Soldier Broadband Waveform
    (SBW), whose channel bandwidth is adjustable in the range 1.25–5 MHz with channel
    spacing of 2 MHz and data is modulated using a fixed digital modulation technique,
    and VHF/UHF line of sight, which supports two analogue modulation techniques,
    amplitude modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM), while both channel bandwidth
    and channel spacing are adjustable up to 25 kHz [34]. The radio provides operability
    in both VHF (30–88 MHz) and UHF (225–512 MHz) bands. When VHF is selected, analogue-to-digital
    conversion is performed directly at RF and the frequency band scanned is always
    0–120 MHz; while in the case of UHF, the conversion is performed at intermediate
    frequency and the frequency band scanned depends on the centre carrier frequency
    of the radio ( MHz). No selective filtering is applied before analogue-to-digital
    conversion. Broadband digitised signal is then issued to the field-programmable
    gate array, where it undergoes digital down conversion, matched filtering, and
    demodulation. Several interfaces are provided by the hypertach expansion placed
    at the bottom of each HH, specifically, 10/100 Ethernet, USB 2.0, RS-485 serial,
    DC power interface (max 12.7 V), and PTT. The software architecture of the radio
    is compliant with the Software Communications Architecture (SCA) 2.2.2 standard.
    Maximum transmission power of the HH is 5 W, with the harmonics suppression at
    the transmitter side over . Superheterodyne receiver has specified image rejection
    better than . Due to the high output power of the radios, one programmable attenuator
    is included in the communication path and programmed to their maximum attenuation
    value . Agilent 778D 100MHz–2 GHz dual directional coupler with 20 dB nominal
    coupling is used as communication medium between the two HHs. Guided propagation
    exhibits several important advantages with respect to the over-the-air implementation:
    accurate and stable RF levels, repeatability of the experiments without the uncertainties
    characteristic to wireless transmission, possibility to connect test instruments
    and generators, avoiding regulatory issues related to transmitting outside of
    the allowed frequency bands. The testbed provides support for remote control of
    HH''s transmission and reception parameters through Ethernet and the Simple Network
    Management Protocol (SNMP v3). The general diagram of the testbed is shown in
    Fig. 3. Full details on the testbed architecture may be found in [34]. Fig. 3
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Diagram of the main components of the testbed
    and their connections Concerning the spectrum sensing process, the HH''s 14-bit
    analogue-to-digital-converter performs sampling at 250 Msamples/s. Every 3 s,
    a burst of 8192 consecutive samples is buffered, and then output over the serial
    port at 115200 bauds. The samples are then parsed and transformed into the frequency
    domain using the FFT. The bandwidth of the corresponding spectrum is 120 MHz wide
    around the centre carrier frequency of the radio. Consequently, the effective
    resolution is 29.3 kHz/sample. In order to obtain higher frequency resolutions,
    two possible changes to the testbed are increasing the buffer size on the HHs,
    and finding ways to transfer spectrum data at higher baud rate. Further details
    can be found in [34]. 3 Data acquisition and processing Acquisition of the WB
    RF spectrum is performed periodically for the frequency band of interest. This
    may be done by taking either a quiet or an active approach, depending on the implementation
    of the architecture. Quiet approach implies that the radio is able to perform
    sensing simultaneously with transmitting/receiving, whereas in active sensing,
    the radio needs to stop transmitting/receiving while sensing takes place. 3.1
    Data acquisition By means of the testbed described in the previous section, real-data
    is collected and stored in a dataset. To this end, the VHF transmission band where
    the radios are operable has been utilised, meaning that the spectrum sensing is
    performed for the frequency band of 0–120 MHz. The data consists of a large amount
    of spectrum observations containing a number of narrowband signals. More specifically,
    as shown in Fig. 4 (thin solid blue line), each spectrum consists of a SBW signal
    (digitally modulated signal) transmitted by the transmitting HH device and a number
    of signals (from the environment) such as the FM signal (in the 88–108 MHz band)
    and an unknown signal at 0–7 MHz. Two interference signals at 20 and 80 MHz, respectively,
    are also observed. Further details are given in Section 6. The parameters of the
    SBW signal can be set remotely and, in particular, the transmission power and
    the carrier frequency of the transmitted SBW signal have been considered which
    are given three different values (7 dBm-full, 4 dBm-half, and -one-tenth for the
    transmission power; 51 MHz–61 MHz–71 MHz for the carrier frequency). Consequently,
    the dataset consists of spectrum measurements grouped in nine different configurations,
    as shown in Table 1. Each configuration consists of more than 2500 bursts. The
    corresponding time-domain samples have also been stored in the dataset. The experimental
    step is discussed in Section 14. Table 1. Configurations for the values of the
    transmission parameters (carrierfrequency and transmission power) of the SBW signal

    in the 0–120 MHz band (1 burst) which includes the SBW signal at 61 MHz and with
    transmission power equal to as well as other signals from external environment
    3.2 Processing This section describes the pre-processing block of real-data to
    detect frequency bins belonging to the different waveforms inside the spectrum.
    The main parameters for the pre-processing are also described. First of all, the
    received spectrum observations are smoothed in the frequency domain through a
    simple moving average applied to the samples in order to reduce the sharp fluctuations
    due to noise which can be seen in each received spectrum. Then, based on a sensible
    choice for a specific threshold, the background noise is eliminated, keeping only
    the FFT bins corresponding to actual signals. Basically, this process can be thought
    as an energy detection and formally corresponds to solving the decision problem
    between the following two hypotheses: (1) where , , and are the received signal,
    the transmitted signal, and the noise samples, respectively. is the null hypothesis
    corresponding to the absence of the signal (in this case, received signal consists
    only of noise), and is the alternative hypothesis corresponding to the presence
    of the signal, while is the number of samples acquired during the sampling process.
    Based on the Neyman–Pearson lemma, the most common approaches to finding the appropriate
    threshold are the constant detection rate (CDR) and constant false alarm rate
    (CFAR) detectors, where threshold is set adaptively depending on the SNR regime
    and the characteristics of the sensed WB signal. However, even in adaptive thresholding,
    presence of interference may make the ED come to incorrect decisions. In most
    applications, the analysed spectrum is underutilised (usage of licensed bands
    is an example [35, 36]) which means that there is only a limited number of actual
    narrowband signals in the scanned WB signal at any instant of time. In this scenario,
    suboptimal thresholding algorithms with low computational complexity, where CFAR
    or CDR performance is not necessarily achieved, can be considered. Indeed, it
    has been shown that the threshold may be adaptively set based only on the mean
    value of the magnitudes of the scanned WB signal [29], and given by (2) K frequency
    bins are identified as a result of the thresholding process. In a WB and sparse
    spectrum observation there are L actual signals () each of them consists of a
    number of bins. For this reason, frequency bins corresponding to the same signal
    need to be grouped together. In high-SNR environments, consecutive samples can
    be grouped together and classified as single waveforms. However, in practical
    situations, some frequency bins may have erroneous magnitude values as a result
    of imperfect sampling and would thus be discarded during the thresholding phase.
    In this case, the bin grouping process considers two (or more) groups of consecutive
    bins as a single signal if they are close enough each other. More formally, the
    maximum acceptable distance (in Hz) between the two samples belonging to the same
    waveform is defined as (3) M is the maximum number of consecutive samples that
    could be erroneously disregarded, and is the frequency resolution of the FFT,
    given by (4) where is the maximum resolvable frequency (which in case of Nyquist
    sampling equals to half of the sampling frequency). After the thresholding step,
    grouped waveforms undergo smoothing, in order to reduce impacts of the imperfect
    and erroneous sampling. For achieving this, a second stage moving average filter
    has been implemented. For a waveform that consists of nG grouped bins with magnitudes
    , filtering with the window length W results in the filtered bins given by [30]
    (5) Consequently, each element in (5) is an average of the preceding P points.
    Fig. 5 illustrates the difference between the original transmitted SBW signal,
    the corresponding smoothed signal, the sensed FFT bins, and the estimated signal
    after performing thresholding/bin grouping. The smoothed group corresponding to
    the SBW signal is also shown. Fig. 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Pre-processing

    smoothed signal, thresholding and bin grouping, threshold, and waveform after

    WB spectrum measurement before pre-processing (thin dotted blue line) and after
    pre-processing (thick dash-dotted red line) This concludes the frequency domain
    pre-processing phase which is applied to the collected WB signals. After this
    phase, the inverse Fourier transform is applied to produce the corresponding time
    domain signals from the pre-processed WB spectrum measurements and, then, the
    CFD algorithm produces the -profile from the time-domain sub-signals as described
    in the following section. 4 Cyclostationary feature analysis and neural network
    In this section, the classification process is described in order to present an
    application of the dataset to theoretical framework. After the pre-processing
    phase in Section 4, the waveforms are classified as either ‘potentially malicious’
    (PM) or ‘friendly’ (FR). The former class refers to signals which aim to disrupt
    or degrade communications among legitimate users (belonging to the latter class).
    In the 0–120 MHz WB spectrum, the jammer is supposed to be the SBW signal (which
    is capable of changing its transmission parameters), while legitimate waveforms
    as in Fig. 6 are the base-band (BB) signal, interference at 20 MHz (we call it
    medium-band, MB, interference) and 80 MHz (we call it high-band, HB, interference),
    and the FM signal. In order to differentiate them, a cyclostationary feature based
    algorithm with an ANN as classifier is applied to the dataset. 4.1 Cyclostationary
    feature analysis When signal processing techniques assume communication signals
    as being stationary, their statistical parameters such as mean and variance do
    not vary with time. In this case, signals are modelled as one-dimensional (1D)
    autocorrelation function and the corresponding power spectrum density (PSD) can
    be obtained through Fourier transform of the autocorrelation function [37]. On
    the other hand, most of the signals in communication systems are in fact cyclostationary
    [38]. This means that their statistical parameters are periodically or cyclically
    stationary. A 2D autocorrelation function is used to model cyclostationary signals
    where the additional dimension is the cycle frequency, denoted as , at which the
    1D autocorrelation function is computed. For each , a cyclic-spectrum-cut is produced
    which is a function of the parameter and denoted as , namely a cyclic-spectrum-cut
    at . Considering the whole set of values for , a 3D cyclic spectrum function is
    obtained where the three dimensions are: f, , and magnitude of the SCF. When ,
    the cyclic-spectrum-cut corresponds to the conventional PSD since the spectrum
    completely correlates with itself. Specifically, a process is said to be wide-sense
    cyclostationary with period if its mean and autocorrelation are both periodic
    with period , in such case, they can be defined, respectively, as (6) The autocorrelation
    function of a wide-sense cyclostationary process can be expressed in terms of
    its Fourier series components (7) where with a integer, is the expectation operator,
    is the set of Fourier components, and represents the cyclic autocorrelation function
    (CAF) and gives Fourier components. CAF is given by (8) When is periodic in t
    with period , (7) can be expressed as (9) The Fourier transform of the CAF is
    known as SCF and is given by (10) where is the cyclic frequency and f the angular
    frequency. The major benefit of spectral correlation is its insensitivity to background
    noises. Since the temporal correlation of different spectral components are measured,
    and the spectral components of noise are completely uncorrelated in time due to
    the fact that noise is wide-sense stationary process, such noise does not play
    significant factor in the SCF. In other words, the existence of correlation between
    separated spectral components, with separation equal to , is called spectral redundancy
    [37] which is found in cyclostationary signals, while it is not usually observed
    in noise. This fact allows the spectral correlation of a signal to be accurately
    calculated even at low SNRs. Furthermore, different types of modulated signals
    - AM, FM, phase shift keying (PSK), frequency shift keying, minimum-shift keying,
    quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), pulse-amplitude modulation, and so forth
    – with overlapping power spectral densities have highly distinct SCFs. The SCF
    of the SBW signal and the 3–7 MHz BB signal in the 0–120 MHz spectrum are shown
    in Figs. 7a and b, respectively. Fig. 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint SCF of
    two of the detected signals in the WB spectrum (a) SCF of the 3–7 MHz BB signal,
    (b) SCF of the SBW signal Since SCF computation requires large amount of data,
    which makes it unreasonable for a classifier to operate on it in real time, the
    cycle frequency profile (-profile) has been employed in this paper as feature
    for classification. Specifically, the -profile of SCF for a signal x is given
    by (11) The -profile of signals in the WB spectrum of interest is shown in Section
    14, while a more detailed description about SCF of some modulated signals can
    be found in Section 8 addressing the theoretical framework. 4.2 Neural network
    classifier Our proposed system uses an ANN as classifier due to its ease of implementation
    and potential to generalise any carrier frequency, symbol rate, and phase offset.
    The system was designed to classify PM and FR signals. We trained the ANN to identify
    the two classes of signals defined at the beginning of this section. The SCF of
    the detected signals produces a large amount of data, which makes impossible for
    a classifier to work on it in real time. In order to reduce the amount of data
    for a classification stage, we used the -profile as input feature for an ANN.
    Accordingly, the proposed ANN in Fig. 8 is composed of inputs related to the dimensionality
    of -profile, a single hidden layer whose neurons use the hyperbolic tangent sigmoid
    as neural transfer function, and an output layer of two neurons related to each
    class of signal considered in this work. Each output value is in the range . Accordingly,
    the output class with the highest value between is considered as the signal class.
    An ANN training based on the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) back-propagation
    (BP) [39] is adopted. Fig. 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Proposed ANN used
    as classifier in the CSI algorithm with I inputs, one hidden layer with N neurons,
    and 2 outputs The selection of a single hidden layer is proposed due to the classification
    process simplicity of this particular problem, it was found that with a single
    layer results over the of true positive classification were obtained for the two
    types of signal classes considered in this work. Employing more hidden layers
    would increment the training time and overall results would not be significantly
    improved. The corresponding pseudo-code of the proposed algorithm is outlined
    in Algorithm 1 (see Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Algorithm
    1: Pseudo-code for the proposed algorithm It can be summarised as follows: the
    receiver observes a WB signal and then energy detection and pre-processing are
    performed. The -profile of SCF for each detected sub-signal is subsequently extracted.
    After that, detected signals go through the classification process. The -profile
    of detected signals are fed to a previously trained ANN. The ANN classifies the
    received narrowband signal, in the WB spectrum, as either a licit or a potential
    malicious user. 4.3 Cyclic spectral analysis Theoretical analysis of cyclic spectrum
    for a number of different modulation types (both analogue and digital) can be
    found in the literature [40-42]. From the spectrum representation in Fig. 6, signals
    with different modulation schemes can be observed. For example, the BB signal
    found at low-frequency band 3–7 MHz is an AM signal, while the SBW is a digitally
    modulated signal with quaternary-PSK (QPSK) scheme. The two interferences are
    also digital modulated signals. Finally, the FM signal is observed on the right
    side of the spectrum. In the following, SCF of QPSK, AM, and FM signals is detailed
    as an example. QPSK: A PSK signal can be thought either as a binary amplitude-shift
    keying for or as a QAM when (M is the number of points in the signal constellation),
    namely (12) with in-phase and quadrature components and . is the carrier frequency
    and is a phase factor. In the specific case of QPSK signal, phases are separated
    by rad and the in-phase and quadrature components are time-aligned as follows:
    (13) and (14) respectively; the keying rate is defined by , while is a fixed pulse-timing
    phase parameter. The carrier function is a deterministic finite-energy pulse and
    modulated by and which are random sequences assumed to be purely stationary. Consequently,
    the SCF can be written as [41] (15) where the in-phase and quadrature components
    are assumed to be balanced such that . In this way, if , and if . The function
    is defined in [40] for a linear periodically time-variant system. AM: When a random
    lowpass signal with PSD is used to modulate the amplitude of a sine wave, the
    resulting amplitude modulated signal is given by [43] (16) and the general formula
    of its SCF is given by (17) FM: In many cases, the transmitted signal is modulated
    as (18) where is the phase of the FM signal, a is the carrier amplitude, and is
    the carrier frequency. The corresponding SCF is given by [44] (19) where is the
    Fourier transform of the joint characteristic function for and given in [37].
    Further details and SCF of other modulation schemes (both analogue and digital)
    can be found in [37, 40, 41, 43, 44]. 4.4 Complexity analysis SCF computation
    complexity: Efficient algorithms to compute SCF are defined as FFT time smoothing
    algorithms. In this work, the strip spectral correlation algorithm (SSCA) has
    been considered. Basically, SSCA is computed by multiplying the complex envelope
    with the conjugate of the received signal. The corresponding block diagram is
    discussed in [45] where two FFT blocks are employed. The complex envelope is a
    function of the frequency f, thus, the number of the first FFT points is inversely
    related to the frequency resolution . While, the SCF formula is a 2D function
    in terms of f and and the number of the second FFT points N is inversely proportional
    to the cyclic frequency resolution . This mean that an increase in the values
    of and will result in larger computational complexity although random effects
    are reduced and, consequently, the SCF reliability increases. The complexity of
    the SSCA algorithm is summarised in Table 2 in terms of the number of complex
    multiplications required to estimate the cyclic cross spectrum of two complex
    signals [45]. Table 2. Computational complexity for SSCA algorithm [45] The total
    complexity is then given by NN. The SSCA is a highly parallel algorithm. ANN computation
    complexity: A feedforward neural network is characterised by the total number
    of weights and biases, N, which form a weight vector . In the conventional BP
    algorithm, a global error function can be computed with one forward step, while
    its gradient with one forward and one backward step. The complexity of calculating
    the error function and its gradient is and , respectively. The BP algorithm often
    behaves very badly on large-scale problems and user dependent parameters, like
    learning rate, determine its performance. Alternatively, conjugate direction methods,
    such as the conjugate gradients (CG) method, exploit second-order approximation
    of the error function which, in addition to the gradient, utilises the Hessian
    matrix denoted as . There exists a unique global minimum only if the Hessian matrix
    is positive definite. But in many cases, it has shown to be indefinite in different
    areas of the weight space and the CG fails in the attempt to minimise the error
    function. Further details can be found in [39] which also proposes the SCG BP
    algorithm. As mentioned in Section 7, the SCG is adopted to train the ANN used
    as classifier. In this case, a calculation complexity per iteration of has been
    determined. When the algorithm is implemented, this complexity can be reduced
    to . 5 Learning and acting algorithms After the new Analysis block proposed in
    this manuscript and belonging to the cognitive cycle, Leaning and Acting blocks
    presented in [30] conclude the proposed CSI algorithm. 5.1 Learning After having
    identified occupied channels and spectrum holes in the 0–120 MHz band, and classified
    the detected signals through the cyclostationary feature algorithm with an ANN
    as classifier, the CSI algorithm is thought to include a learning process strategy
    based on a temporal frequency map which summarises previous occurrences of waveforms
    inside the band-of-interest (Fig. 10). The 0–120 MHz band is divided into n channels.
    In each cycle of the cognitive strategy, the proposed algorithm accesses the temporal
    frequency map which is a matrix where the number of occurrences of FR waveforms
    (), PM waveforms (), defined in Section 6, and spectrum holes () for each of the
    n channels are stored. Then previous values are updated with the newly acquired
    and processed information. The learning process can implement temporal forgiveness
    in order to include into the computation only the spectrum activities corresponding
    to the last k spectrum observations which are used to predict future activities
    and make suitable decisions. This reduces the probability of data becoming obsolete,
    at the expense of the lower amount of accessible information. Fig. 10 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Temporal frequency map in the learning block which summarises
    previous occurrences of waveforms inside the band-of-interest 5.2 Acting Finally,
    based on the processed spectrum information, current transmission parameters (channel
    and transmission power) and the history obtained from the temporal frequency map,
    the CR device may decide to act in order to improve its chances of reliable transmission.
    The actions consist of proactive changes of the transmission frequency (channel
    surfing), or the transmission power whenever a threat is detected. The system
    is considered ‘under threat’ when a ‘PM’ waveform is identified on the channel
    close to the channel currently used for transmission. The new channel for the
    transmission is then chosen according to (20) This means that the new channel
    is selected among all the channels that are currently spectrum holes, such that
    the is minimum. represents the expected channel occupancy, defined as (21) where
    , , and represent the occurrences of the PM waveforms, FR waveforms, and spectrum
    holes on the channel over the last l steps, respectively. The coefficients and
    () are assigned in order to give highest priority to actions which avoid channels
    with history of occurrences of PM waveforms, followed by the channels with history
    of occurrences of FR waveforms. In this way, it is ensured that each possible
    channel occupancy corresponds to a unique combination of FR waveforms, PM waveforms,
    and spectrum holes. The new transmission power is chosen according to (22) where
    is the threshold of the ED defined in (2). Further applications include the capability
    of the cognitive system to learn from the actions of a human operator through
    a graphical user interface (GUI) allowing the human operator to overrule the decision
    of the cognitive algorithm and change transmission parameters such as the operating
    frequency and the transmission power. The role of the GUI is then to allow the
    human operator to take decisions irrespectively of the decisions of the CSI algorithm.
    However, it also presents an interesting motivation for considering principles
    of cognitive refinement, i.e. refining the reasoning behaviour of the algorithm,
    which is currently policy-based, by learning from the actions of the human operator.
    6 Validation of the proposed algorithm In order to evaluate the performance of
    the newly introduced analysis block of the cognitive cycle in the CSI algorithm
    (based on spectral correlation detector and neural network classifier for interference
    mitigation), a set of experiments is performed using the SDR testbed architecture
    described in Section 2. The sampling rate is set at Nyquist rate for each type
    of detected signals. In our experiments, the SBW signal represents the ‘PM’ waveform
    and is transmitted by the transmitting HH. Its transmission parameters are given
    different values according to Table 1 in Section 3, namely the carrier frequency
    and the transmission power of the SBW signal assume one among the nine configurations
    with full, half, and one-tenth transmission power. All other detected signals
    mentioned in Section 3 are considered as ‘friendly’. The objective of this section
    is to show the performance of the proposed algorithm in classifying the signals
    detected in the 0–120 MHz band-of-interest based on the -profile which is extracted
    from each detected waveform in the WB spectrum and then fed to the neural network
    used as classifier. Each detected waveform in the WB spectrum, obtained after
    the pre-processing block in Section 4, is characterised by its own -profile which
    encompasses the cyclostationary feature. Specifically, each generated -profile
    consists of 200 cyclic frequency points which are the input of the ANN ( in Fig.
    8). Figs. 11a–d show the -profiles for four of the different signals detected
    in the 0–120 MHz band: the 3–7 MHz signal, SBW signal, interference at 80 MHz,
    and one peak of the FM signal. Fig. 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint -profiles
    extracted from four different detected signals in the WB spectrum (a) 3–7 MHz
    signal - BB, (b) SBW signal, (c) 80 MHz signal - HB, (d) One peak of the FM signal
    It is worth noticing that the frequency content of a single cyclostationary signal
    is mainly characterised by both its fundamental frequency and its cyclic frequency
    (the former is usually higher than the latter for RF signals). It can be expected
    that the cyclic frequency is independent of the fundamental frequency and, consequently,
    the shape of the -profile of that signal does not change with the fundamental
    frequency and the ANN is able to classify the signal independently of the part
    of the spectrum in which it is detected. Future work will analyse signals located
    at RF, TVWS, or ISM (industrial, scientific, and medical) band, for example, and
    the effective applicability of the proposed approach to signals in a spectrum
    beyond 120 MHz could be demonstrated. The ANN architecture employed to validate
    the analysis block of the CSI algorithm consists of with 10 neurons in the hidden
    layer ( in Fig. 8). For our experiments, a dataset composed of 4.500 samples (500
    for each configurations) is used in order to train (70), validate (15), and test
    (15) the ANN architecture. The overall performance can be observed in the 2-classes
    confusion matrix of Fig. 12 corresponding to the testing phase of the ANN which
    highlights a classification rate approximately equal to 1. In this confusion matrix,
    the tested waveforms are 15 of the all waveforms fed to the ANN in order to train
    it. Fig. 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Confusion matrix of the proposed
    ANN with two target and two output classes: FR and PM After having trained and
    tested the ANN with 4500 samples, further assessment of the performance is obtained
    with a different set of waveforms which are tested by using the trained neural
    network. Specifically, the performance of the system is evaluated for 1000 independent
    testing samples for each of the configuration with different carrier frequencies
    (51–61–71 MHz) and transmission powers (7, 4, and ). The confusion matrices in
    Table 3 show the classification accuracy for the nine different configurations.
    The proposed method based on the cyclostationary feature algorithm combined with
    an ANN provides good performance with high classification rate in most of the
    configurations, even for low transmission power case. Table 3. Confusion matrices
    with absolute values from testing on independentsamples applied to the neural
    network; each configuration (from I to IX) has beentested separately A comparison
    with results in the literature is also presented. For example, in [29] spectrum
    sensing is performed through an ED to identify the occupied bands in the widedand
    spectrum. Centre frequency, bandwidth, and maximum value of magnitude are extracted
    for each of the identified narrowband waveforms. To perform classification, these
    parameters extracted from the identified waveforms are compared to parameters
    stored in a dataset containing pre-defined parameters of the FR and/or PM waveforms.
    This results in classification of each waveform as either FR or PM. For the sake
    of clarify, comparison is made on the percentage values in the confusion matrices.
    In Table 4, the percentage values relative to all the configurations analysed
    in this manuscript, from I to IX, are shown, while in Table 5 results from [29]
    can be seen where observed WB spectrum, corresponding to both 61 and 71 MHz centre
    frequencies, have been contemporary tested with 200 independent samples (or bursts).
    Two different feature vectors have been investigated, namely bandwidths of the
    detected waveforms in Table 5(a), while both bandwidths and magnitudes in Table
    5(b). Specifically, different confusion matrices are obtained for each of the
    two type of feature vector by varying the number of bursts () – over three levels
    (1, 3, and 5) – which are averaged in order to increase the frequency resolution
    of the observed spectrum and to investigate its influence to the classification
    accuracy. Table 4. Confusion matrices with percentage values corresponding to
    the absolutevalues in Table 3 for all the analysed configurations, I–IX. Using
    the notationin the comparison with previous work, these confusion matrices are
    obtained with Table 5. Confusion matrices with percentage values corresponding
    to the resultsin [29] obtained with ED-based classifier. Two different feature
    variablesare considered: (a) only bandwidth of each signal and (b) bandwidth +magnitude
    for each signal. Bursts corresponding to two transmission frequencies,61–71 MHz,
    are used together as input data. Each of these two tablesconsists of three different
    levels (1, 3, and 5) for the amount of bursts averaged ()to increase the frequency
    resolution From comparison between these confusion matrices computed in [29] and
    the percentage values in Table 4 (considering only 61 and 71 MHz) obtained with
    the CFD and ANN implemented for the proposed algorithm, our results either outperform
    or are comparable with the ones in the literature, unless one specific case, for
    several reasons as discussed below. First of all, the percentage values are better
    or comparable in most of the cases. In addition, for the case of only bandwidths
    in the confusion matrices of Table 5, high PM and FR classification accuracies
    cannot be contemporary obtained with the same value, namely good accuracy for
    PM classification is reached with high , while low values are recommended for
    better FR classification accuracy. While, in case of both bandwidths and magnitudes,
    results that could be comparable with our percentage values are reached with .
    This produces an increased complexity of their algorithm and computational time
    as shown in [29]. Moreover, it should be noticed that by increasing the amount
    of testing bursts is dramatically reduced (from 200 to 40) which may reduce the
    reliability of the obtained classification rates. While in our case (which would
    correspond to ), first all the 1000 samples are used to perform the testing step
    with better reliability of classification results and, second, high FR classification
    and PM classification are contemporary obtained for each of the analysed configurations.
    The only configuration in our results that produces minor PM classification accuracy
    than the other configurations, and then slightly smaller accuracy than the corresponding
    results for ED-based classifier, is VIII which corresponds to at 61 MHz. This
    could be due to a possible reduced quality of the SBW waveform in our newly created
    dataset for this configuration which could produce weaker performance of the classifier.
    Nevertheless, even if the SNR level becomes low, the performance relative to configurations
    from IV to IX is still sufficient to guarantee good accuracy of the classification
    rate. It is also worth noticing that, unlike the previous work in [29], in this
    manuscript the proposed feature-based classifier is validated on a dynamic environment
    in which signals change either their carrier frequency or their transmission power
    (or both of them) in different cognitive cycles. Consequently, the training step
    is performed on a more complex dataset with a wider range of signal characteristics
    and shapes than in the previous work employing ED-based classifier in an almost
    stationary environment. This means that higher classification capability is required
    for dynamic scenarios. From the literature, [30] proposes an interference mitigation
    algorithm for spectrum intelligence employing a naive Bayes classifier to discriminate
    FR from PM waveforms in a stationary environment. In Table 6, the corresponding
    results are shown in percentage values. Specifically, the SBW signal, which is
    considered as PM waveform, is transmitted with one-tenth ( dBm) power at 51 MHz
    central frequency. Table 6. Confusion matrices in [30] for the parameter configuration
     dBm/ 51 MHz (corresponding to configuration VII, if notation in this paperis
    considered). Combinations of the considered features are: (i) bandwidth +amplitude
    + variance, (ii) bandwidth + amplitude, (iii) amplitude + variance, (iv)bandwidth
    + variance Different combinations of available features are used to evaluate the
    performance of the classifier. Namely, four combinations of bandwidth, maximum
    magnitude, and variance for each of the extracted waveform (both PM and FR) from
    the spectrum of interest as shown in the confusion matrices in Table 6: (i) classification
    rates when the classifier combines all the three features, (ii), (iii), and (iv)
    classification rates when classifier combines bandwidth and maximum magnitude,
    maximum magnitude and variance, and bandwidth and variance, respectively. The
    naive Bayes classifier is trained with 50 bursts while additional 50 bursts, independent
    from the training data, are used for the testing step. For each burst there is
    just one PM signal (the SBW) and several FR waveforms. Consequently, the classifier
    is tested on 50 PM samples and almost 2000 FR samples. By comparison with our
    results with one-tenth power and 51 MHz, in the FR classification case the CFD
    and ANN-based algorithm produces better or comparable percentage classification
    rates than the naive Bayes-classifier in Table 6 for all the four combinations
    of features. Concerning the PM classification, the performance of our algorithm
    for configuration VII, namely  dBm / 51 MHz, is not as good as in the other configurations
    and, consequently, lower values when compared with the percentage rates in Table
    6. This has been discussed previously for configuration VIII and may be due to
    a possible reduced quality of the SBW waveform. In addition, it is worth noticing
    that for classifier in [30], only 50 samples corresponding to SBW vaweform in
    a stationary environment are used both during training step and during testing
    step which could produce unreliably classification rates. Again, dynamic scenarios
    require higher classification capability than stationary ones, which means that
    results in this paper could be underestimated with respect to the previous work.
    Considering that, the newly implemented analysis block in our proposed work shows
    promising performance for the CSI processing in complex dynamic environments that
    also include signals with low SNR level. 7 Conclusion and future work In the manuscript,
    a new AI-enabled CR framework is proposed as part of a CSI algorithm to enable
    interference mitigation in WB radios. The CSI algorithm is based on a cognitive
    cycle consisting of five blocks: Sensing, Processing, Analysis, Learning, and
    Acting. The cognitive cycle interacts with the radio environment through the sensing
    block which obtains instantaneous spectrum data in the band of interest and the
    acting block whose task is to decide and change the transmission parameters such
    as the carrier frequency and the transmission power. The main novelty introduced
    by our work is the analysis block. After having identified occupied channels and
    spectrum holes in the observed WB signal, the stationary spectral analysis is
    performed, based on the cyclostationary feature of modulated signals, to extract
    the -profile from the SCF of the detected signals. Afterwards, the extracted -profile
    of a number of samples of the different waveforms detected in the WB spectrum
    are fed to a pre-trained ANN to classify the waveforms as ‘friendly’ or ‘potential
    malicious’. In addition, a SDR testbed has been employed to generate an experimental
    dateset and validate the analysis block. Real data consists of spectrum measurements
    in the 0–120 MHz in which there are different signals including the SBW signal
    whose carrier frequency and transmission power are given different values. Consequently,
    a large amount of experimental data in a dynamic environment is collected and
    stored in a complex dataset with a wide range of signal characteristics and shapes,
    and organised for off-line research applications. Nine different configurations
    of these values have been used in the validation step of the proposed analysis
    block. Results show high classification rate in most of the configurations even
    for low transmission power case making the new block based on CFD with ANN a promising
    methodology for the CSI processing in complex dynamic environments that also include
    signals with low SNR level. In support of this claim, a comparison with existing
    works has also been carried out. The main drawback related to these two previous
    approaches is that the variability of both the hand-crafted features and noise
    do not guarantee accurate classification especially at low SNR level. While, the
    proposed approach overcomes that thanks to better extracted features and the neural
    network classifier. In one of the considered previous works, an ED-based classifier
    was employed to differentiate FR class from PM class in an almost stationary environment.
    Our algorithm for dynamic environments proposed in this paper produces better
    (in some cases) and comparable (in other cases) results than the ED-based algorithm.
    However, it is worth noticing that these results are obtained without resorting
    to multiple-bursts average (namely with ) necessary to improve the performance
    of the classifier in the previous work. This avoids, consequently, an increased
    complexity and computational time as well as a reduced data-samples set for both
    training and testing which could reduce the reliability of the resulting classification
    rates. A naive Bayes-based classifier has also been previously investigated in
    a stationary spectrum. Although our CFD and ANN-based algorithm is trained and
    tested on a large number of samples from a dynamic scenario, it still produces
    better or comparable classification rates with respect to the existing approach
    for the FR class. Concerning the PM class, a possible loss of quality in the SBW
    signal in the newly created dataset may be the cause of obtaining not as good
    results as the ones obtained for all the other configurations. However, since
    the Bayes-based classifier is trained and tested by using much less samples concerning
    the PM class, the corresponding results may be not enough accurate. In addition,
    our classifier is analysed in a dynamic environment which means higher classification
    capability is required. Future work includes analysis of fully autonomous systems
    capable of dynamically access the spectrum in a CR framework for applications
    such as PHY-layer security against jamming attacks as well as TVWS. The effective
    applicability of the proposed approach to signals in a spectrum beyond 120 MHz
    can also be investigated and demonstrated, although it is expected that the shape
    of the -profile of a signal is independent of its fundamental frequency. In addition,
    stealthy jammer detection algorithm investigated in [46] and in [47] can be validated
    on the experimental dataset described in this manuscript. 8 Acknowledgments A.

    \ has led to a \ndire shortage of this indispensable resource. Furthermore, with\
    \ \nthe tremendous growth of wireless applications, this problem is \nintensified\
    \ as the unlicensed frequency spectrum becomes \novercrowded and unable to meet\
    \ the requirement of emerging \nradio devices operating at higher data rates.\
    \ Additionally, the \nalready assigned spectrum is underutilized. That has prompted\
    \ \nresearchers to look for a way to address spectrum scarcity and \nenable efficient\
    \ use of the available spectrum. In this context, \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\

    \ spectrum represents a scarce and finite \nresource that is used for transmitting\
    \ information in the radio \nenvironment. This resource is used by several services,\
    \ \nincluding radiocommunication, radio broadcasting, maritime \nradio, and satellite\
    \ communications. \nAt the national level, the assignment of this spectrum to\
    \ \nthese services is managed and regulated by local authorities \n(governmental\
    \ agencies) that are responsible for determining \nthe appropriate frequency band,\
    \ the geographical extent of the \nuse of this band, the maximum transmission\
    \ power, etc. One of \nthe fundamental purposes of these agencies is to ensure\
    \ a \nminimum interference level between the different radio \ntechnologies. \n\
    At the global level, the International Telecommunication \nUnion (ITU) organizes,\
    \ every three to four years, the world \nradiocommunication conferences (WRC)\
    \ 1so as to examine and \nrevise the treaties governing the use of the radio frequency\
    \ \nspectrum. \nNevertheless, the static spectrum allocation strategy \nadopted,\
    \ where spectral frequency bands allocated to a wireless \ncommunication system\
    \ can only be used by that system, has \ncaused the shortage of frequencies. This\
    \ shortage is confronted \nwith a strong demand for spectrum resulting from the\
    \ \nemergence and abundance of wireless technologies and the \nextremely rapid\
    \ proliferation of radio applications developed in \nthe scope of the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT). \nIn addition, while unlicensed bands like ISM (Industrial,\
    \ \nScientific, and Medical) bands can be freely used by all radios \nrespecting\
    \ a specific set of rules, such as a shared channel \naccess mechanism and a maximum\
    \ power per Hertz , they have \nbecome very crowded and can’t accommodate more\
    \ wireless \napplications [1]. \nOn the other hand, the already assigned spectrum\
    \ is \ninefficiently used in all domains, such as the time domain, the \nspace\
    \ domain, and the frequency domain, as shown in Fig. 1. \nThis was confirmed by\
    \ the Federal Communications \nCommission (FCC), which reported in 2002 that the\
    \ radio \nspectrum, in most of the time, was from 15% up to 85% \nunderutilized\
    \ [2]. \nAs a result, it has been found that while some bands are \novercrowded,\
    \ such as those bands used by cellular base \nstations, many other bands are not\
    \ in use or are used only for \nshort periods [2]. \nCognitive Radio (CR) technology\
    \ has been commonly \nregarded as an efficient solution to address the above-\n\
    mentioned issues by enabling the opportunistic usage of the \nfrequency bands\
    \ that are not heavily occupied by licensed users \n[3,4]. \n1 https://www.ntia.doc.gov/category/wrc-19\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 1. Spectrum Utilization\
    \ [3]. \nA Cognitive Radio represents a Software Defined Radio \n(SDR) system\
    \ [5] capable of exploring the radio environment, \nlearning, and deciding to\
    \ use the unoccupied portions of the \nspectrum, called \"spectrum holes\" or\
    \ \"white spaces\", and \nconsequently \nof \ndynamically \nadjusting \nits \n\
    operating \nparameters, based on the decisions made. These decisions must \nimperatively\
    \ take into account the impact on the primary users \n(PUs), which have a license\
    \ on the chosen spectrum and have \nthe higher priority to access it, in order\
    \ not to cause them \nharmful interference. Unlicensed users, which use Cognitive\
    \ \nRadio to access the spectrum, are referred to as secondary users \n(SUs).\
    \ \nFurthermore, the transition from analog to digital television \nhas released\
    \ many frequencies, known as TV white spaces, \nwhich have too high propagation\
    \ and penetration qualities [6]. \nFor this reason, the FCC authorized in 2008\
    \ the use of these \nfrequencies by non-licensed users following a list of rules\
    \ like \nusing the geo-location capability to obtain the available TV \nbands,\
    \ from White Space DataBase (WSDB), before operating \n[7–9]. That has created\
    \ a lot of opportunities for Cognitive \nradio users. \nThe remarkable contribution\
    \ of this promising technology \nto the efficient use of spectrum, the minimization\
    \ of \ninterference, the reduction of cost, etc., has pushed its use in \nseveral\
    \ areas, namely the Internet of Things (IoT). \nThe main objective of this paper\
    \ is to provide a \ncomprehensive survey of Cognitive radio with a particular\
    \ \nfocus given to: \n• Software Defined Radio, as it is the building block of\
    \ \nCognitive Radio system; \n• Spectrum sensing, as one of the most important\
    \ pillars \nto set up a Cognitive Radio system; \n• CR-Based IoT, given that Cognitive\
    \ Radio is one of the \nimportant enabler technologies of IoT. \nTo the best of\
    \ our knowledge, in the literature, there is no \nsuch work that gives a comprehensive\
    \ survey of the three \naforementioned aspects, highlights the relation between\
    \ them, \nand exhibits the future research directions to handle their \nchallenges\
    \ in a single paper. The existing surveys dealt only \nwith a particular aspect.\
    \ \nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows: \nSection II gives the\
    \ fundamentals of Cognitive Radio \ntechnology. Section III exhibits an overview\
    \ of Software \nDefined Radio and its different challenges. Section IV provides\
    \ \na detailed view of spectrum sensing and its challenges. Section \nV highlights\
    \ the use of Cognitive Radio in IoT. Finally, this \narticle is concluded in Section\
    \ VI. \nII. COGNITIVE RADIO FUNDAMENTALS \nCognitive Radio technology was first\
    \ introduced by Joseph \nMitola in 1999 to depict an intelligent radio system\
    \ capable of \nreconfiguring dynamically its radio parameters according to its\
    \ \noperational environment and to the user’s QoS requirements \n[4]. Afterward,\
    \ Cognitive Radio has been defined in many \nways by different entities and researchers.\
    \ The Federal \nCommunications Commission defined CR as follows: \n“Cognitive\
    \ radio: A radio or system that senses its operational \nelectromagnetic environment\
    \ and can dynamically and \nautonomously adjust its radio operating parameters\
    \ to modify \nsystem operation, such as maximize throughput, mitigate \ninterference,\
    \ facilitate interoperability, access secondary \nmarkets.” [10]. \nMoreover,\
    \ Simon Haykin defined CR as “an intelligent \nwireless communication system,\
    \ capable of being aware of its \nenvironment, learning, and adaptively changing\
    \ its operating \nparameters (e.g., transmit-power, carrier-frequency, and \n\
    modulation strategy) in real-time for providing reliable \ncommunication (anytime\
    \ and anywhere) and efficient \nutilization of the radio spectrum” [11]. \nAs\
    \ mentioned in the above definitions, the main \ncharacteristics of Cognitive\
    \ Radio are cognitive capability and \nreconfigurability [3,11]. \nThanks to the\
    \ cognitive capability feature, the CR user can \nsense and collect information\
    \ related to its radio environment \nand choose the best channel to use. The collected\
    \ information \nmainly involves transmission frequency, power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. \nThe reconfigurability feature allows CR users to adjust \nautomatically\
    \ its operating parameters (transmission frequency, \nmodulation, power, etc.)\
    \ based on the gathered information and \nwithout the need to change the hardware.\
    \ Hence an efficient \nand effective Cognitive Radio system is imperatively built\
    \ on \nSoftware Defined Radio platform. The latter will be briefly \nreviewed\
    \ in the next section. \nA. Dynamic Spectrum Access \nBy means of Dynamic Spectrum\
    \ Access (DSA) techniques, \nCognitive Radio enables secondary users to use the\
    \ unoccupied \nportions of licensed spectrum which are known as spectrum \nholes\
    \ or white spaces. When a primary user appears, the \nsecondary user vacates the\
    \ current band and moves to another \nspectrum hole or keeps transmitting on the\
    \ same band and \nadjusting its transmission power level or modulation scheme\
    \ in \norder not to cause any harmful interference to the licensed user \nor affect\
    \ its QoS as illustrated in Fig. 2 [3]. \n101 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 2. Spectrum Hole Concept [3]. \nThere are three\
    \ DSA approaches that the SUs can use to \ndynamically access the available spectral\
    \ opportunities: \nunderlay, interweave, and overlay [12]. \n1) Spectrum underlay:\
    \ In the underlay transmission mode, \nthe SU can coexist with the PU as long\
    \ as the SU operates \nbelow the noise floor of the PU. In other words, the \n\
    coexistence between the SU and the PU may occur if only the \ninterference caused\
    \ by the SU at the PU receiver remains \nunder a predefined threshold, known as\
    \ the “interference \ntemperature” [13,14]. To meet the interference threshold\
    \ \nrequirement, SU can use some techniques such as spreading \nits signal over\
    \ a wide bandwidth below the noise floor of the \nPU or using multiple antennas\
    \ to direct its signals away from \nthe PU receiver [15]. \nMoreover, in the case\
    \ of the underlay approach, the \nspectrum sensing process is not required and\
    \ the SUs can \ntransmit the data over the spectrum even if it is occupied all\
    \ the \ntime by the PUs. Therefore, this paradigm is more appropriate \nto use\
    \ in situations when the spectrum usage status of PUs \nchanges rapidly [12].\
    \ \nNevertheless, meeting the interference constraint forces the \nSU to limit\
    \ its transmission power and consequently to operate \nover a small coverage.\
    \ \n2) Spectrum interweave: As regards the interweave \ntransmission mode, it\
    \ stands for the opportunistic usage of the \navailable spectrum holes which was\
    \ the major motivation \nbehind the introduction of the Cognitive Radio technology\
    \ \n[16]. This paradigm mandates that SUs should have only \naccess to the unoccupied\
    \ spectrum resources. Thus, spectrum \nsensing is needed to identify the vacant\
    \ spectrum bands that \nare not currently occupied by the PUs. \nFurthermore,\
    \ in this case, harmful interferences to PUs are \navoided due to the fact that\
    \ SUs do not transmit concurrently \nwith the PUs. Whereas, the constant tracking\
    \ of spectrum \nopportunities is a challenging task, especially in rapidly \n\
    changing environments in terms of spectrum occupancy. \nHence, this approach is\
    \ more adequate for slowly changing \nenvironments [12,17]. \nConcerning power\
    \ resources, they are only limited by the \nrange of the identified spectrum holes.\
    \ \nIt is also worth noting that this class of dynamic spectrum \naccess is also\
    \ referred to as opportunistic spectrum access [18]. \n3) Spectrum \noverlay:\
    \ \nIn \nrespect \nto \nthe \noverlay \ntransmission mode, it is like the underlay\
    \ approach in that \nboth approaches allow SUs to simultaneously transmit with\
    \ \nPUs. However, in the overlay mode, SUs can transmit at any \npower without\
    \ a predefined interference threshold constraint. \nMoreover, in this paradigm,\
    \ the performance of the PU \nshouldn't be negatively affected by the presence\
    \ of the SU. To \nmeet this requirement, SUs use a variety of techniques that\
    \ \nrequire prior knowledge about PUs' codebooks and messages \n[19]. For instance,\
    \ SUs can divide their power into two parts: \none is assigned to transmit their\
    \ packets and the other is \nallocated to support the PUs’ transmissions. In that\
    \ way, the \ninterference caused by the SU at the PU receiver can be \ncompensated\
    \ by the enhancement of the PU’s signal-to-noise \npower ratio (SNR), by dint\
    \ of the part of SU’s power that is \nused to relay the PU packets. \nAdditionally,\
    \ SUs can exploit knowledge about PUs' \ncodebooks and messages to cancel the\
    \ interference caused by \nPUs, using techniques such as dirty paper coding [19].\
    \ \nFinally, hybrid schemes that combine these transmission \nmodes can be conceived\
    \ to increase the overall throughput of \nthe wireless networks [20]. \nB. Cognitive\
    \ Radio Functions \nThe various tasks performed by a Cognitive Radio, \nincluding\
    \ detecting spectrum holes, selecting the best available \nchannel, determining\
    \ the transmission parameters, sharing \nspectrum with other users, and moving\
    \ to another frequency \nband when a licensed user appears are referred to as\
    \ the \ncognitive cycle (See Fig. 3) [21]. \nIn general, the cognitive cycle can\
    \ be divided into three \nfunctional steps, namely spectrum sensing and analysis,\
    \ \nspectrum management and handoff, and spectrum allocation \nand sharing [21]:\
    \ \n• Spectrum sensing and analysis: in this phase, CR \nmonitors the radio environment,\
    \ detects the spectrum \nholes, and estimates its different characteristics. \n\
    • Spectrum management and handoff: at this stage, CR \nchooses the best spectrum\
    \ white space, determines the \ntransmission parameters, and hops among different\
    \ \nbands based on the channel characteristics and user \nrequirements [3,21].\
    \ \n• Spectrum allocation and sharing: through these \nfunctions, CR can share\
    \ and coordinate the spectrum \naccess with other users. The coexistence with\
    \ licensed \nusers is restricted by their allowable interference level. \nThus,\
    \ secondary users should adjust their transmission \nparameters accordingly. As\
    \ for sharing spectrum access \nwith CR users, efficient spectrum access coordination\
    \ is \nrequired so as to avoid collisions and interferences [21]. \n102 | P a\

    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n \nFig. 3. Cognitive Cycle\
    \ [21]. \nWith respect to the layer they are in, the aforesaid functions \ncan\
    \ be classified into three groups namely physical layer \n(PHY) functions, the\
    \ medium access control layer (MAC) \nfunctions, and network layer functions as\
    \ shown in Fig. 4 [22]: \n \nFig. 4. Key Functions of the PHY, MAC, and Network\

    \ through spectrum sensing and acquiring \nadvanced radio environment knowledge,\
    \ such as the channel \ngain from the CR transmitter to the primary receiver and\
    \ \nchannel-state information (CSI), via environmental learning \n[22]. Based\
    \ on the gathered information, cognitive spectrum \naccess is performed by using\
    \ transceiver optimization and \nreconfiguration. \n2) Medium access control layer\

    \ and \nmanage spectrum sensing operations as well as access to the \nidentified\
    \ spectrum opportunities. The first function is known \nas sensing scheduling,\
    \ whereas the second is referred to as \nspectrum-aware access control. The operations\
    \ of these \nfunctions are controlled by the sensing-access coordinator, on \n\
    a time basis, by taking into consideration the compromise \nbetween the sensing\
    \ requirement and the availability of the \nspectrum access opportunity. \nIn\
    \ \ncomparison \nwith \nthe \nconventional \nwireless \ncommunications MAC layer,\
    \ the CR MAC layer is more \ncomplicated to implement because of the dynamic nature\
    \ of the \nradio environment and the constant adaptation process that the \nCR\
    \ should perform. More detailed information about the CR \nMAC layer can be found\
    \ in [23,24]. \n3) Network layer functions: CR network layer provides \nthree\
    \ main functions: network tomography, quality of service \n(QoS) and error control,\
    \ and spectrum-aware routing [22]. \nNetwork tomography refers to the operation\
    \ by which the \nCR nodes sense the traffic patterns of the primary and the \n\
    coexisting networks. The output of this operation provides \nimportant baseline\
    \ data that allows a better understanding of \nthe routing design and the network\
    \ utilization at the packet \nlevel. \nQuality of service (QoS) control and error\
    \ control are of \nparamount importance to build a successful CR network. \nStatistical\
    \ control can be used to address these tasks over \nCRNs that are characterized\
    \ by opportunistic links. \nFurthermore, In CR networks, data routing is a challenging\
    \ \nproblem due to varying link quality, frequent topology \nchanges, and sporadic\
    \ connectivity caused by the movement of \nPUs in the network [25]. In such a\
    \ changing environment, the \nspectrum-aware routing function should be enabled\
    \ in order to \nfind optimal routes and paths while avoiding PUs. This \nfunction\
    \ has two problems to handle [21]: the first problem \nrelates to the fact that\
    \ routing algorithms and protocols should \nbe aware of the various network characteristics\
    \ such as \nspectrum availability, PU activity, channel switching delay, \nand\
    \ link qualities and take them into consideration while \nexecuting their different\
    \ operations. The second problem deals \nwith the setting up of interaction between\
    \ routing algorithms \nand dynamic spectrum allocation routines so as to select\
    \ \nrouting paths with minimum interferences. \nMoreover, the optimization of\
    \ the energy consumption, the \ndesired QoS, and the spectrum management should\
    \ be \nconsidered while designing routing algorithms and protocols \nfor CR networks.\
    \ Routing protocols are further detailed in [26]. \nFinally, the spectrum manager\
    \ serves as the means of \nestablishing a connection between the three aforementioned\
    \ \nlayers and ensuring dynamic and efficient access to the \navailable spectrum.\
    \ \nC. Cognitive Radio Networks \nA Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) consists of\
    \ a number of \nCR nodes with or without a secondary base station. \nBased on\
    \ the presence of infrastructure support, CRNs can \nbe classified as either an\
    \ Infrastructure-based network \n(centralized) or an Ad-Hoc network (distributed).\
    \ Moreover, \nCRNs can be also deployed in another architecture known as \nMesh\
    \ architecture that combines Infrastructure-based and Ad-\nHoc modes. A brief\
    \ description of these architectures is given \nbelow. \n1) Infrastructure-based\
    \ CR network: It is a centralized \narchitecture which contains a CR base station\
    \ that is \nresponsible for controlling and coordinating the transmission \nactivities\
    \ of the CR nodes. In this architecture, the CR base \nstation retrieves the spectrum\
    \ related information from all the \nSUs in the network and on the basis of the\
    \ gathered \ninformation, it makes decisions on spectrum access and \nsharing\
    \ for all CR nodes. \n103 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nCompared to Ad-hoc network, infrastructure-based network \nprovides many advantages\
    \ including, the reliability of the \nsensing process, collision avoidance, and\
    \ a high data right for \nSUs. However, an infrastructure is required to build\
    \ such a \nnetwork. \nSome examples of centralized networks include: \n• The IEEE\
    \ 802.22 network: it is the first wireless \nregional \narea \nnetwork \nstandard\
    \ \nthat \ndefines \nspecifications for broadband wireless access using CR \n\
    technology in TVWS bands [27]; \n• Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services\
    \ Over \nDynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments \n(Over DRiVE) [28];\
    \ \n• European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular \nEnvironment (DRiVE)\
    \ [29]; \n• Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) [30]. \n2) Ad-hoc mode CR network: In Ad-hoc CRNs,\
    \ there is no \nneed for base stations or access points to coordinate the SUs.\
    \ \nThus, in the absence of a central controlling entity, SUs in \nsuch a distributed\
    \ network, make independent decisions \nconcerning spectrum access and transmission\
    \ parameters. \nAdditionally, SUs must use distributed DSA protocols so as to\
    \ \nmanage the spectrum access operation. Designing distributed \nDSA protocols\
    \ for Ad-hoc CRNs is a challenging task because \nof the absence of central control\
    \ entities and the completely \ndistributed networking architecture [12]. These\
    \ protocols \nshould support a set of functions including, transparency for \n\
    PUs, collision avoidance, accurate spectrum sensing, and \nefficient dynamic spectrum\
    \ allocation [12]. \nIII. SOFTWARE DEFINED RADIO: OVERVIEW \nGiven that SDR is\
    \ considered as an enabling technology \nthat handles the implementation of Cognitive\
    \ Radio, this \nsection will be dedicated to a brief overview of SDR. \nA. Definition\
    \ of SDR \nSoftware Defined Radio [31,32] is referred to as a \nprogrammable radio\
    \ transceiver where digital signal processing \nfunctions, such as modulation/demodulation,\
    \ coding/decoding, \nerror \ncontrol, \ninterleaving/deinterleaving, \nand \n\
    scrambling/descrambling are implemented by means of \nsoftware instead of hardware\
    \ as it has been used in traditional \nradio \ncommunication \nsystems. \nThat\
    \ \nenables \nthe \nimplementation of different waveform standards in a single\
    \ \nplatform and switching between them without any change in \nthe hardware components.\
    \ In some cases, there is just the need \nof a simple software upgrade to support\
    \ other modes, bands, \nand functions. \nMany hardware platforms are used to implement\
    \ the \nsoftware part of SDR, mainly, General Purpose Processor \n(GPP), Digital\
    \ Signal Processor (DSP), Field Programmable \nGate Arrays (FPGA), and Application\
    \ Specific Integrated \nCircuit (ASIC) [33]. \nEach of the above-mentioned platforms\
    \ has its own \nchallenges, limitations, and strengths in terms of computational\
    \ \npower, power consumption, implementation cost, flexibility \nand reconfigurability,\
    \ and complexity of design (See Table I). \nB. SDR Architecture \nJoseph Mitola\
    \ proposed the architecture of an ideal \nsoftware radio transceiver that includes\
    \ three components, \nnamely an antenna, a Digital-to-Analog/Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nconverter, and a processing unit as illustrated in Fig. 5. The \nprocessing\
    \ unit allows performing, in software, all the digital \nsignal \nprocessing \n\
    functions, \nincluding \nmodulation/demodulation, coding/decoding, and error control\
    \ \n[3]. \n \nFig. 5. Ideal Software Radio [16]. \nMany factors impede the real\
    \ implementation of this \nproposed architecture such as the technology limitations,\
    \ more \nparticularly those related to ADC’s performance, computing \npower, and\
    \ power consumption of the processing unit. \nUnlike the ideal software radio\
    \ transceiver, the SDR \ntransceiver is feasible. Indeed, the general architecture\
    \ of SDRs \ncontains more components that make its real implementation \npossible.\
    \ \nAs shown in Fig. 6, the SDR transceiver includes mainly \nfour parts which\
    \ are an antenna, an analog RF front end, a \ndigital RF front end, and the signal\
    \ processing unit. \n1) Antenna: One of the main tasks expected from an SDR \n\
    platform is its ability to cover multiple frequency bands. Thus, \nSDR platforms\
    \ often use Intelligent/Smart antennas so as to \nfulfill the aforementioned task.\
    \ \nA smart antenna consists of an antenna array combined \nwith signal processing\
    \ blocks that allow to smartly exploit the \nspatial diversity in order to select\
    \ the appropriate frequency \nband and adapt with interference nulling, and mobile\
    \ tracking \n[34,35]. \nAn antenna for SDR should ideally integrate some features\
    \ \nsuch as self-adaptation, self-alignment and self-healing [35]. \nThese characteristics\
    \ can be defined as follows: \n• Self-adaptation: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to \nadapt its parameters according to the selected band and \nthe system requirements\
    \ (gain…); \n• Self-alignment: it is the capability of an antenna to \ncontrol\
    \ its radiation pattern; \n• Self-healing: it is the capability of an antenna\
    \ to avoid \ninterferences. \n104 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \n2) Analog RF front end: The RF front end part [34] \nrepresents\
    \ an analog circuitry where the following operations \nare performed: \nIn the\
    \ transmission path, Digital-to-Analogue Converter \n(DAC) converts digital samples\
    \ into an analog signal which \nrepresents the input of the RF Front End. After\
    \ that, the analog \nsignal is mixed with high frequency carriers, modulated to\
    \ a \npreset RF frequency, and then transmitted. \nIn the receiving path, the\
    \ RF signal captured by the antenna \nis fed to the RF Front end section through\
    \ a matching circuitry \nwhich allows achieving an optimum signal power transfer.\
    \ \nThen, in order to amplify very low-power signals while \nguaranteeing a minimum\
    \ noise level, the RF signal passes \nthrough a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) which\
    \ is often mounted \nvery close to the antenna. Afterward, the output of the LNA\
    \ is \nmixed with a signal from the Local Oscillator (LO) so as to \nshift to\
    \ a lower fixed frequency known as intermediate \nfrequency (IF). \nThe frequency\
    \ generated by the Local Oscillator is \nadjustable to ensure that the mixer produces\
    \ a lower fixed \nintermediate frequency independent of the incoming RF signal.\
    \ \nThe intermediate frequency presents several advantages: it \nimproves the\
    \ selectivity due to the fact of being fixed and it \nincreases the performance\
    \ of the processing unit and the global \ngain of the receiver owing to be lower\
    \ than the incoming \nfrequency. \n3) Digital front end: The Digital Front end\
    \ section [34] \ncontains a set of blocks that are responsible for performing\
    \ all \nof the succeeding functions: \nIn the transmission path, the digital baseband\
    \ signal (near-\nzero frequency range) is shifted into the IF frequency by the\
    \ \nDigital Up Converter (DUC) then it passes through the Digital \nAnalog Converter\
    \ (DAC) that converts it to the analog IF \nsignal. The analog IF signal is later\
    \ up-converted to RF signal. \nIn the receiving path, the analog IF signal is\
    \ converted to \ndigital IF samples by the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC).\
    \ \nNext, the Digital Down Converter (DDC) changes the IF \nsamples to a baseband\
    \ signal which is then resampled and \nfiltered before being processed by the\
    \ signal processing unit. \nThese above-mentioned tasks can be divided into two\
    \ \nprincipal functions which are Resampling and Channelization. \nResampling\
    \ or Sample Rate Conversion (SRC) is the process \nof converting samples from\
    \ one sample rate to another. As for \nChannelization, it involves up/down conversion\
    \ and channel \nfiltering. \n4) Signal processing unit: This block is regarded\
    \ as the \nmain part of SDR architecture which is designed to perform \nDigital\
    \ \nSignal \nProcessing \nfunctions \nsuch \nas \nmodulation/demodulation and\
    \ encoding/decoding. \nAs already mentioned in this paper many hardware \nplatforms\
    \ are used to implement this section, namely DSP, \nGPP, GPU, ASIC, and FPGA [36–39].\
    \ The real challenge is \ndetermining which of these platforms is best to achieve\
    \ SDR \ngoals and which design approach is appropriate to meet the \nrequested\
    \ quality of service. \nTable I shows the strengths and weaknesses of some \n\
    hardware platforms and highlights certain techniques used to \nimprove their performance.\

    \ \nadaptability, cost, and complexity. \nTo exploit the advantages of each platform,\
    \ researchers \nhave proposed the co-design (hybrid) approach as a solution. \n\
    This approach consists of regrouping design schemes that \nemploy hardware techniques,\
    \ such as FPGAs and ASICs, and \nthose that use software solutions including GPPs,\
    \ into one \nplatform. \nThis approach presents some issues, the most known are\
    \ \nthe problem related to the shared access of the internal memory \nby different\
    \ units (FPGAs, Processors ...) and the very \nexpensive cost of the whole implementation.\
    \ \nOne of the interesting readings that give a detailed review \nof the aforementioned\
    \ platforms, can be found in [35]. \nC. SDR Advantages \nSoftware Defined Radio\
    \ technology has brought a lot of \nadvantages to the world of wireless communications,\
    \ such as \nreconfigurability and flexibility, interoperability, and cost \nreduction\
    \ [34,37]: \n• Reconfigurability and Flexibility: The main feature of \nSDR is\
    \ its capacity to handle wireless standards newly \ndeveloped by simply changing\
    \ or upgrading the \nreconfigurable software instead of replacing the \nhardware\
    \ platform or its analog components. \n• Interoperability: One of the most important\
    \ benefits of \nSDR is its ability to resolve interoperability problems \nbetween\
    \ incompatible radios that work with different \nwireless standards. \n• Cost\
    \ \nreduction: \nSeveral \nexpensive \nhardware \ncomponents disappeared due to\
    \ the fact that in SDR \nmany \ndigital \nsignal \nprocessing \nfunctions \nare\
    \ \nimplemented by means of software. \nIn addition to the forenamed benefits,\
    \ SDR allows to test \nand study several communication standards by using the\
    \ same \nplatform. Furthermore, SDR is regarded as the block building \nof a Cognitive\
    \ Radio system and as already mentioned in this \npaper, SDR enables the reconfigurability\
    \ of Cognitive Radio. \nD. SDR Tools \nThere are different commercial and open-source\
    \ tools that \ncan be used for SDR development. Choosing the more \nappropriate\
    \ \ndevelopment \ntool \nfor \na \nspecific \ndesign \nmethodology requires prior\
    \ knowledge of the available tools’ \nfeatures. Examples of these tools include\
    \ GNU Radio, \nUniversal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP), MATLAB, \nLabVIEW,\
    \ and CUDA. \nGNU Radio and USRP are the most widely used tools to \ndevelop SDR\
    \ systems [40]. A brief description of these two \ntools is given below: \nGNU\
    \ Radio: GNU Radio is a free & open-source software \ntoolkit for building software\
    \ radios [35]. It runs on host \n106 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA)\
    \ International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol.\
    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \ncomputers and it provides many signal processing blocks such\
    \ \nas filters, decoders, and demodulators which are required to \nimplement software\
    \ radios. These blocks are programmed in \nC++ and they are often connected using\
    \ Python script that has \nthe advantage of allowing the data flow to be at the\
    \ maximum \nrate, without being interpreted [41]. In addition, this tool offers\
    \ \nthe possibility of easily programming and adding new blocks \nfor supporting\
    \ unavailable functions. GNU Radio can be used \njointly with Universal Software\
    \ Radio Peripheral systems or \nother alternatives to set up complete SDR platforms.\
    \ \nUSRP: Universal Software Radio Peripheral is the most \ncommonly used transceiver\
    \ for SDR platforms, developed by \nEttus2 Research under GPL license. USRPs are\
    \ available in \nseveral series and versions, differentiated by their hardware\
    \ \nperformances and their connection method to a host computer. \nGenerally,\
    \ USRP is a board that integrates the following \ncomponents: ADC/ DAC, an FPGA\
    \ board, an RF front end, \nand a PC host interface [42]. Based on the USRP series,\
    \ a \ncertain number of daughterboards can also be held. \nDaughterboards perform\
    \ functions such as filtering and \nconversion between RF and baseband signals\
    \ (up/down \nconversions) and may support applications operating up to 6 \nGHz\
    \ due to being modular. Concerning the other signal \nprocessing functions, the\
    \ majority of them are performed at the \nhost machine and only some operations\
    \ are processed by the \nFPGA board [42]. USRP platforms offer several advantages,\
    \ \nincluding ease-of-use, affordability, and flexibility. However, \nbandwidth\
    \ limitations of USRP components have an impact on \nsystem throughput. That makes\
    \ USRP platforms only suitable \nfor research experiments and rapid prototyping\
    \ [35,42]. \nE. SDR Challenges \nIn this subsection, the challenges that still\
    \ remain to be \naddressed for implementing efficient and practical SDR \nsystems\
    \ are presented. \n1) Security and attack issues: Although SDR has brought \n\
    many powerful advantages to the field of wireless \ncommunication, it has introduced\
    \ new types of security threats \nand attack issues. Indeed, in addition to the\
    \ known threats that \nexist in conventional wireless communication systems such\
    \ as \ndenial of service attacks, misconfiguration issues, listening \nand capturing\
    \ data that can be used to perform malicious \nactions, there are several threats\
    \ that are specific to SDR, \nincluding downloading and running malicious software.\
    \ \nIn the absence of authentication and verification \ntechniques, unauthorized\
    \ software can easily be installed and \nactivated on SDR terminals. The challenge\
    \ of implementing \nprotection techniques and security mechanisms, to prevent\
    \ this \nissue, has been addressed by many researchers. For instance, in \n[43]\
    \ a framework for establishing secure download for SDR is \npresented. This framework\
    \ uses a public/private key scheme to \nverify the authenticity of the software.\
    \ The digital signature is \nconsidered as a good solution to keep malicious and\
    \ \nunauthorized software from being activated on SDR nodes, \nnevertheless, it\
    \ greatly increases the complexity of the \n2 https://www.ettus.com/ \nframework\
    \ due to the fact that for each combination of \nwaveform and terminal, a digital\
    \ signature should be created. \nFurthermore, the data configuration of SDR components\
    \ \ncan be prone to extraction, alteration, or destruction. Those \nissues can\
    \ be prevented by guaranteeing the integrity of the \nsecurity administrative\
    \ module (SAM) and implementing data \nintegrity and protection techniques [44].\
    \ \n2) Energy efficiency: Addressing the power consumption \nissue is of primary\
    \ importance especially when designing \nsolutions that are intended for battery-powered\
    \ devices and \nlow power objects in an IoT network. Several reasons are \nbehind\
    \ the importance of addressing power consumption \nmanagement, including limited\
    \ size and battery, ensuring a \nlonger lifetime of IoT objects, and enabling\
    \ Green Computing \n[17,45]. In SDR, many factors contribute to the loss of energy\
    \ \nefficiency, namely signal processing complexity and the \nincreased hardware\
    \ requirements. To alleviate this loss, the \nauthors of [46] proposed a cooperative\
    \ wireless network \nscheme that is based on resource sharing (Battery, processing\
    \ \nunit, memory…). \n3) Antenna requirements for SDR: One of the major \nchallenges\
    \ in SDR is to design wideband antennas that support \ndifferent technologies\
    \ and standards. Although smart and \nreconfigurable antennas are used to resolve\
    \ this concern, \nseveral constraints still hamper the SDR implementation in \n\
    portable handsets and other systems, such as bandwidth and \ngain limitations,\
    \ which are imposed by the antenna size, and \nthe complexity of a design that\
    \ meets all the antenna \nrequirements for SDR [47]. \n4) Hybrid design: Implementing\
    \ an optimal SDR design, \nthat meets the real-time requirements at low power\
    \ and cost \nwhile maintaining flexibility and programmability, represents \n\
    a great challenge. Researchers address this issue by using the \nhybrid approach\
    \ which enables the use of hardware schemes \n(ASICs…) along with software schemes\
    \ (GPP...) in the same \nplatform in order to take advantage of their different\
    \ benefits. \nThe hybrid design has also its own challenges in both \nphysical\
    \ and MAC layers, including partitioning and \nscheduling problems [35]. \n5)\
    \ ADC and DAC limitations: The concept of an ideal \nsoftware defined radio transceiver\
    \ consists in placing the \nADC/DAC as close as possible to the antenna. That\
    \ requires a \nvery high-speed ADC/DAC with sampling capability up to \nGiga Samples\
    \ per second which is actually not feasible. To \novercome this issue, an RF front\
    \ end block is placed right after \nthe antenna so as to shift the incoming frequency\
    \ to an \nintermediate frequency that can be supported by the currently \navailable\
    \ ADC/DAC. \nIV. SPECTRUM SENSING \nSensing is considered as the most important\
    \ and critical \nphase in the Cognitive Radio cycle. It refers to the operation\
    \ by \nwhich the CR users can be aware of the channel occupancy, the \npresence\
    \ of the primary user, the quality of the radio channel, \n107 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n                                                           \n(IJACSA) International\
    \ Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021\
    \ \nand other parameters such as transmission power, bandwidth, \nmodulation,\
    \ etc. Based on this gathered information, the CR \nusers can determine the vacant\
    \ portion of the spectrum and \nchoose the white spaces which meet its QoS. \n\
    This section gives a detailed view of sensing spectrum \nfunction in Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks. \nA. Multi-dimensional Spectrum Sensing \nThrough the sensing\
    \ function, Cognitive radio can identify \nthe existing spectrum opportunities\
    \ in its surrounding \nenvironment by using different sensing techniques. Spectrum\
    \ \nopportunity is conventionally defined as “a band of frequencies \nthat are\
    \ not being used by the primary user of that band at a \nparticular time in a\
    \ particular geographic area” [48,49]. This \ndefinition takes into consideration\
    \ only three dimensions, \nnamely frequency, time, and space. However, there are\
    \ other \ndimensions that can be exploited to create new opportunities \nsuch\
    \ as code dimension and angle dimension. Developing \nsensing algorithms that\
    \ take into account all those dimensions \nencounters more complex and challenging\
    \ issues. \nA radio environment in which all the aforementioned \ndimensions are\
    \ exploited to share spectrum access among \nmultiple users is known by several\
    \ names including, \nhyperspace, electro space, and radio spectrum space. Table\
    \ II \nshows parameters that are needed to be sensed for each \ndimension and\
    \ highlights its main idea [49]. \nB. Types of Spectrum Sensing \nSpectrum sensing\
    \ approaches can be divided into several \ntypes on the basis of specific aspects,\
    \ including the cooperation \nbetween secondary users, the bands of interest,\
    \ the sensing \nexecution time, and the number of sensed channels at a time \n\
    (See Fig. 7) [50]: \nBased on the bands of interest for the Cognitive Radio \n\
    system, spectrum sensing falls into two groups: in-band \nsensing and out-of-band\
    \ sensing. In-band sensing consists in \nsensing the channel that is already transmitting,\
    \ in the aim of \ndetecting primary user signals and avoiding harmful \ninterferences\
    \ [51,52]. As to out-of-band sensing, CR senses \nbands other than the band on\
    \ which it is transmitting so as to \ndiscover new spectrum holes [51]. \nBased\
    \ on the sensing execution time, two classes of \nspectrum sensing can be distinguished:\
    \ reactive (on-demand) \nand proactive(periodic) sensing. The reactive sensing\
    \ takes \nplace when the secondary user intends to transmit or as a result \n\
    of radio environmental changes. In proactive sensing, CR users \nsense the radio\
    \ environment persistently so as to detect \nspectrum opportunities. Reactive\
    \ sensing is more energy \nefficient but the time to identify an unoccupied channel\
    \ may be \nlonger than proactive sensing. \nAmong the types of spectrum sensing,\
    \ we also find \nsynchronous \nsensing \nand \nasynchronous \nsensing. \nIn \n\
    synchronous sensing, all CRs respect the same schedule to \nsense a frequency\
    \ band. In that case, a high synchronization \nbetween CRs represents a challenging\
    \ task. \nTABLE II. \nMULTI-DIMENSIONAL SPECTRUM SENSING \nDimension \nParameters\

    \ 12, No. 6, 2021 \nIn the case of asynchronous sensing, each CR has its own \n\
    schedule to sense a frequency band. Distinguishing between \nSU signals and PU\
    \ signals is a challenging problem. \nIn respect to the cooperation aspect, there\
    \ are two classes of \nspectrum sensing: cooperative and non-cooperative (local)\
    \ \nSensing. In non-cooperative sensing, each CR settles for its \nown sensing\
    \ data and independently decides on the channel \nstate, i.e. the presence or\
    \ the absence of the primary user. \nDecisions that are made through this sensing\
    \ type are \nunreliable and error prone under bad channel conditions, \nmultipath\
    \ fading and shadowing effects, and hidden node \nissues [53]. \nThe aforementioned\
    \ issues can be avoided by using \ncooperative sensing [21,53]. Indeed, when cooperative\
    \ sensing \nis enabled, CR users share their local observations and sensing \n\
    data with others and exploit the shared sensing outcomes of \nother users to decide\
    \ on the presence or absence of the primary \nuser. Several works have been carried\
    \ out on this topic and it \nhas been shown that cooperative sensing contributes\
    \ to the \nimprovement of detection accuracy and reliability on the cost \nof\
    \ increased latency and traffic overhead. It has also been \nproven that cooperation\
    \ between secondary users can solve \nhidden primary user problem and decrease\
    \ sensing time [53]. \nThere are two types of cooperative sensing: centralized\
    \ \nsensing and distributed sensing [3,54]. In centralized sensing \n[55], a central\
    \ unit gathers local sensing information from CR \nusers through a control channel,\
    \ fuses them by means of one of \nthe fusion decision rules [56], identifies spectrum\
    \ holes by \nperforming binary hypothesis testing algorithm such as \nNeyman-Pearson\
    \ test or Bayesian test, and shares the result \namong other cognitive users or\
    \ directly controls the cognitive \nradio traffic. In distributed sensing [54],\
    \ cognitive nodes \nexchange their local observations among each other and make\
    \ \ntheir own decisions on channel state. Distributed sensing \ndoesn’t require\
    \ a backbone infrastructure or a centralized base \nstation. \nOn the basis of\
    \ interference detection, spectrum sensing is \ncategorized as primary transmitter\
    \ detection, primary receiver \ndetection, and interference temperature [51].\
    \ In primary \ntransmitter detection approaches, spectrum holes are identified\
    \ \nby processing received signals at the PU receiver. This class \nincludes several\
    \ techniques such as energy detection and \nmatched filter detection. In primary\
    \ receiver detection, the \nstatus of primary channels is detected based on the\
    \ local \noscillator leakage power of the PU receiver [57]. This power is \nemitted\
    \ by the PU receiver’s RF front end while receiving the \ndata from the PU transmitter\
    \ [58]. As for interference \ntemperature, secondary users transmit simultaneously\
    \ with \nprimary users as long as the interference caused by the SU at \nthe PU\
    \ receiver remains under a specified interference limit. In \nthis case, the underlay\
    \ DSA model is considered. \nIn regard to the requirement of the PU’s information,\
    \ \nspectrum sensing schemes can be categorized into two classes: \nblind and\
    \ feature detection techniques [50]. The blind detection \ntechniques serve to\
    \ blindly determine the channel state without \nany prior knowledge about the\
    \ primary user signals. This type \nincludes, among others, energy detection and\
    \ Higher-Order-\nStatistics detection. The feature detection techniques allow\
    \ \nperforming signal classification to the detected signal. They are \nmore advantageous\
    \ than blind detection techniques in the sense \nthat it is possible to distinguish\
    \ between PU and SU signals and \nto characterize the different types of PU and\
    \ SU signals. \nMatched filter and cyclostationarity detection techniques are\
    \ \nexamples of feature detection techniques. \nDepending on the bandwidth (number\
    \ of sensed channels at \na time), spectrum sensing schemes are classified into\
    \ two broad \ngroups which are narrowband and wideband sensing \ntechniques [59]:\
    \ in the narrowband sensing, only one channel \nis analyzed at a time to detect\
    \ available opportunities. The most \nwidely and commonly known narrowband methods\
    \ are energy \ndetection, matched filter detection, cyclostationary feature \n\
    detection, covariance-based detection, and waveform detection \n[59]. \nAs for\
    \ wideband sensing, multiple frequency bands are \nexplored at a time so as to\
    \ discover spectrum holes. In this \ncase, the available spectrum is usually divided\
    \ into narrower \nsub-bands which are sensed either concurrently or sequentially\
    \ \nby using narrowband sensing techniques. Wideband sensing \ntechniques contain\
    \ two groups: Nyquist-based and Sub-\nNyquist wideband sensing. The former type\
    \ processes digital \nsignals at the rate equal to or greater than the Nyquist\
    \ rate, \nwhereas the latter type processes the signals with a sampling \nrate\
    \ lower than the Nyquist rate [59]. \nWideband sensing allows to exploit the available\
    \ spectrum \nmore efficiently but it brings about new challenges related to \n\
    its implementation. \nOn the basis of the latest mentioned classification of \n\
    spectrum sensing schemes (Narrowband sensing/ Wideband \nsensing), the next subsection\
    \ will review some of the most \ncommon spectrum sensing methods as well as the\
    \ recent \nadvanced spectrum sensing techniques. \n \nFig. 7. Types of Spectrum\
    \ Sensing. \n109 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal\
    \ of Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nC. Spectrum\
    \ Sensing Techniques \nBefore reviewing in detail spectrum sensing techniques,\
    \ \nmore particularly narrowband sensing techniques, the system \nmodel for spectrum\
    \ sensing is given below. \n1) System Model for spectrum sensing: The fundamental\
    \ \nobjective of spectrum sensing is to make a choice between two \nhypotheses:\
    \ \n• H0: Channel is temporarily available for opportunistic \nusage i.e. no primary\
    \ user signal is present; \n• H1: Channel is occupied i.e. a primary user signal\
    \ is \npresent. \nThese hypotheses can be expressed as under: \nH0: Y(n)= N(n)\
    \ when PU’s signal is absent  \n         (1) \nH1: Y(n)= h.X(n)+ N(n) when PU’s\
    \ signal is present          (2) \nWhere Y(n) represents the received signal by\
    \ SU, X(n) \nrepresents the transmitted PU signal, N(n) denotes Additive \nWhite\
    \ Gaussian Noise (AWGN) with mean zero and variance \n\U0001D70E\U0001D70E2.h\
    \ represents the channel gain, n= 1,2,3…N where n is the \nsample index, and N\
    \ is the number of samples. \nGenerally, a test statistic of Y(n) is compared\
    \ against a \ndecision threshold value \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide\
    \ between the two \nhypotheses. If the test statistic is greater than the threshold,\
    \ H1 \nis assumed to be true and thus PU’s signal is declared present. \nin contrast,\
    \ if the test statistic is less than the threshold, H0 is \nassumed to be true\
    \ and then PU’s signal is declared absent. Fig. \n8 presents the general model\
    \ of spectrum detection. \n \nFig. 8. Spectrum Sensing Model. \nSensing accuracy\
    \ is typically evaluated using the Receiver \nOperating Characteristic (ROC) curves.\
    \ These curves are the \nplot of the detection probability versus the false alarm\
    \ \nprobability or plot of the probability of miss detection against \nthe probability\
    \ of false alarm [60,61]. These probabilities are \ndefined as: \nProbability\
    \ of detection (Pd): It is the probability that the \nSU declares the presence\
    \ of PU signal when it is actually \npresent. \nPd = Pr(H1/H1)   \n \n \n \n \
    \        (3) \nA \nhigh \nProbability \nof \ndetection \nallows \navoiding \n\
    interference impact on primary receivers. Hence a high Pd is \neminently desirable.\
    \ \nProbability of false alarm (Pfa): It is the probability that the \nSU declares\
    \ the presence of PU signal when it doesn’t truly \nexist. \nPfa= Pr(H1/H0)  \
    \ \n \n \n \n         (4) \nA high Probability of false alarm decreases the efficiency\
    \ \nspectral due to the loss of spectrum access opportunities. In \naddition,\
    \ the QoS may be negatively affected as a result of this \nloss. Thus, Pfa should\
    \ be low to avoid the under-use of \npotential spectrum holes. \nProbability of\
    \ miss detection (Pm): It is the probability of \nmissing a PU signal when it\
    \ is present. \nPm= Pr(H0/H1)   \n \n \n \n         (5) \nA high Probability of\
    \ miss detection causes a harmful \ninterference on primary users because, in\
    \ the case of a miss \ndetection, SUs may transmit simultaneously with PUs in\
    \ the \nsame band. So, to avoid interference to and from license holder \nusers,\
    \ Pm should be low. \n2) Narrowband sensing techniques: In this subsection, we\
    \ \ndiscuss several narrowband sensing techniques, focusing on \ntheir \nfunctions,\
    \ \nmathematical \nmodels, \nstrengths, \nand \ndrawbacks. \na) Energy detection\
    \ scheme: Energy detection [1,62–64] \ncalled also Radiometry or Periodogram,\
    \ is the most widely \nused sensing scheme due to its low computational complexity,\
    \ \nthe simplicity of its implementation, and the absence of need \nfor PU signal\
    \ information. \nIn this sensing technique, the received signal energy is \ncomputed\
    \ and compared with a threshold value. If the \nmeasured energy is higher than\
    \ the threshold, the target \nfrequency band is considered to be occupied by a\
    \ PU; \notherwise, the target frequency band is considered to be vacant. \nThe\
    \ block diagram of the energy detection method is illustrated \nin Fig. 9 and\
    \ its decision metric can be written as: \nT= \n1\nN ∑\n(Y(n))\nN\nn=1\nⁿ  \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (6) \nDespite its aforementioned advantages, energy detection\
    \ \nhas several drawbacks, including the degradation of detection \naccuracy as\
    \ a result of noise uncertainty (NU). The latter refers \nto the noise power fluctuations\
    \ with time caused by the effects \nof various factors such as thermal noise,\
    \ filtering effects, radio-\nfrequency circuits, and interference from other signals\
    \ [65]. \nAuthors of [65] analyzed the impact of NU on energy detection \nperformance\
    \ using different OFDM system designs. The \nresults of their analyses show that,\
    \ for all OFDM system \ndesigns, the probability of detection is higher for signals,\
    \ with \nlower NU and higher SNR, which are transmitted at higher PU \ntransmit\
    \ power and detected with a higher number of samples. \nMoreover, energy detection\
    \ is unreliable at low SNR values \n[66], ineffective in detecting spread signals\
    \ [60], and unable to \ndistinguish between PU signals from other signals. \n\
    To enhance the performance and the accuracy of energy \ndetection, several methods\
    \ based on the use of dynamics \nthresholds are investigated in [67–70]. \n \n\

    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nb) Matched filter detection: The matched filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique is viewed as the best method for identifying the \nunutilized bands\
    \ when the PU transmission characteristics are \nknown a priori, e.g., bandwidth,\
    \ operating frequency, the \nmodulation type and order, packet format, and pulse\
    \ shaping \n[70–72]. In this technique, the received signal is correlated \nwith\
    \ the known PU signal and the result is compared with a \nthreshold to decide\
    \ on the presence of the PU. The block \ndiagram of matched filter detection is\
    \ shown in Fig. 10 and its \ntest statistic is given by: \nT=∑\nY(n)X∗(n)\nN\n\
    n=1\n23T \n \n \n \n         (7) \n \nFig. 10. Block Diagram of Matched Filter\
    \ Detection [70–73]. \nThe main advantage of this sensing scheme is that it \n\
    requires only a small number of samples and thus less sensing \ntime to achieve\
    \ good detection performance due to its \nresilience against noise uncertainty\
    \ [73]. Nevertheless, it has \nseveral drawbacks. First, there is a need for precise\
    \ and \naccurate prior information about the primary user signal, which \nmay\
    \ not always be available [65]. Second, the performance of \nthe matched filter\
    \ technique drops when the prior information \nis incorrect. Third, to detect\
    \ different types of PUs, a dedicated \nmatched filter structure for each type\
    \ must be used, which \nincreases the complexity of the system. \nc) Cyclostationary\
    \ Feature Detection: Cyclostationary \nFeature Detection [74–76] depends on cyclostationary\
    \ \ncharacteristics of the received signals. Indeed, in wireless \ncommunications,\
    \ the transmitted signals are typically \ncharacterized by the periodicity of\
    \ some of their statistics such \nas mean and autocorrelation[76,77].This periodicity\
    \ results \nfrom the fact that signals are modulated and coupled with \ncyclic\
    \ prefixes, hopping sequences, pulse trains, sinusoidal \nwave carrier, and other\
    \ features before being transmitted \n[76,77]. Furthermore, additive noise signals\
    \ are stationary \nwith no correlation. Therefore, Cyclostationary Feature \n\
    Detection schemes are very robust to noise uncertainties and \ncan distinguish\
    \ between the signal and noise by calculating \nand analyzing the cyclic autocorrelation\
    \ of the received \nsignals. \nThe periodicity of the mean and the autocorrelation,\
    \ of a \ncyclostationary signal y(t), can be expressed mathematically \nby: \n\
    my(t) = E[y(t)] = my(t + T0) \n \n \n         (8) \nRy(t, τ) = Ry(t + T0, τ) \n\
    \ \n \n \n         (9) \nWhere T0 represents the period of the signal \U0001D466\
    \U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461), \U0001D70F\U0001D70F \nrepresents the time\
    \ offset, \U0001D438\U0001D438 denotes the expectation operator, \nand \U0001D445\
    \U0001D445\U0001D466\U0001D466 is the autocorrelation function of \U0001D466\U0001D466\
    \ (\U0001D461\U0001D461) and it is given \nby: \nR\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D70F\
    \U0001D70F) = \U0001D438\U0001D438 [\U0001D466\U0001D466 (\U0001D461\U0001D461\
    \ + \U0001D70F\U0001D70F) \U0001D466\U0001D466∗(\U0001D461\U0001D461 − \U0001D70F\

    \U0001D6FC\U0001D461\U0001D461]  \n \n       (10) \nThe block diagram of Cyclostationary\
    \ Detection scheme is \nillustrated in Fig. 11, in which The Analog-to-Digital\
    \ \nConverter (ADC) digitizes the received analog signal y(t) into \ndigital samples\
    \ and then it is fed into the N-point FFT block \nwhich computes its Fast Fourier\
    \ Transform. Next, these FFT \nvalues are correlated with themselves and then\
    \ averaged over \nthe number of samples. Finally, in the feature detection block,\
    \ \nthe sensing decision is obtained by detecting the features of the \naverage\
    \ outcome. \nThis scheme has also the advantage of being able to \ndistinguish\
    \ between various types of PU signals that are \ncharacterized by different transmit\
    \ features [78]. \nHowever, this detector also presents some limitations such\
    \ \nas the need for a large number of samples and high sampling \nrate which results\
    \ in an increase in sensing time, power \nconsumption, and complexity [76,78].\
    \ \nIn order to reduce computation complexity while \nmaintaining sufficient detection\
    \ sensitivity, authors of [79] \nproposed an improved Cyclostationary Detector\
    \ with SLC \nDiversity over Nakagami-m Fading channels, where the test \nstatistic\
    \ of conventional Cyclostationary detector is reliably \nsimplified. For the same\
    \ purpose, in [80], an improved \nCyclostationary Feature Detection Algorithm\
    \ is presented, in \nwhich authors proved that the cyclic spectrum is conjugate\
    \ \nsymmetry about the relevant axis, which decreases the \ncomputational complexity.\
    \ \n \nFig. 11. Block Diagram of Cyclostationary Feature Detection [74–76]. \n\
    d) Covariance Based Detection: Covariance-based \ndetection methods exploit the\
    \ correlation structure inherent in \nthe received data and the noticeable differences\
    \ between the \nstatistical covariances of signal and noise to decide on the \n\
    presence of primary signals in background noise without the \nneed for prior knowledge\
    \ about signal, channel, or noise \npower [81]. \nDifferent statistical tests\
    \ can be extracted from the \ncovariance matrix of the received signal and used\
    \ to detect the \npresence of the signal like the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue\
    \ \nto minimum eigenvalue in the case of Eigenvalue-Based \nDetection Method [82].\
    \ The steps of the latter can be \nsummarized as follows: First, the sample covariance\
    \ matrix of \nthe received signal is built from the received signal samples. \n\
    Then, the eigenvalues of this matrix are computed using \ntechniques such as singular\
    \ value decomposition (SVD). \nFinally, a decision on the presence of the signal\
    \ is taken by \ncomparing the ratio between the maximum eigenvalue and the \n\
    minimum eigenvalue with a threshold. The block diagram of \nthis method is shown\
    \ in Fig. 12. \n \nFig. 12. Block Diagram of Covariance-Based Detection [82].\
    \ \n111 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nThe sample\
    \ covariance matrix of the received signal can be \nexpressed as [82]: \nRy (Ns)=\n\
    1\nNₛ ∑\nL−2+Nₛ ŷ(n) ŷH(n) \nn=L−1\n \n \n \n       (11) \nWhere Ns is the number\
    \ of collected samples, L is a \npositive integer called “smoothing factor\",\
    \ ŷ(n) is the received \nsignal vector at sampling instance n, and ŷH(n) is its\
    \ conjugate-\ntranspose. \nThe test statistic can be written as: \nT= \nλ\U0001D45A\
    \U0001D456\U0001D45B\nλ\U0001D45A\U0001D44E\U0001D465  \n \n \n \n \n       (12)\
    \ \nWhere \U0001D706\U0001D706max and \U0001D706\U0001D706min are respectively\
    \ the maximum and \nminimum eigenvalues of Ry (Ns); \nUsing a predefined threshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706, the decision can be made as \nfollows: if T> \U0001D706\
    \U0001D706, H1 is considered to be true, otherwise, H0 is \nconsidered to be true.\
    \ \nIt is noteworthy that, despite the robustness of covariance \ntechniques against\
    \ noise uncertainty, they have a high \ncomputational complexity due to two factors,\
    \ namely \ncovariance matrix computation and eigenvalue decomposition \n[82].\
    \ \ne) Waveform-based \ndetection: \nWaveform-based \ndetection method, also known\
    \ as coherent detection [49], can \nbe considered as a simplified version of the\
    \ matched filter \nscheme. Although, unlike the latter, this method doesn’t need\
    \ \ncomplete information about the PU signals. It simply exploits \nknown patterns,\
    \ that are used in wireless communication \nsystems to support many functions\
    \ such as synchronization, \ncontrol, and equalization so as to execute coherent\
    \ detection. \nThese patterns involve but not limited to the following: \n• Preambles:\
    \ a preamble is a known sequence that is sent \nbefore each burst; \n• Midambles:\
    \ a midamble is a known sequence that is \nsent in the middle of a slot or burst;\
    \ \n• Pilot symbols: pilot symbols are an extra overhead \nadded to the transmitted\
    \ signal. \nWhen such patterns are available, the received signal is \ncorrelated\
    \ with a known copy of itself to perform signal \ndetection. As such, the test\
    \ statistic can be expressed as: \nT=R [∑\ny(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n] \n \n \n \n  \
    \     (13) \nwhere R[.] denotes the real part, y(n) is the received signal \n\
    by SU, x(n)* is the complex conjugate of the signal transmitted \nby PU, and n=\
    \ [1,2…. N] is the sample index. \nIn the absence of the primary user’s signal,\
    \ the given \nexpression can be written as follows: \nT=R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\nN\nn=1\n\
    ] \n \n \n \n       (14) \nWhereas in the presence of the primary user, the test\
    \ static \ncan be simplified as under: \nT= ∑\n(|x[n]|)2\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B\
    =1\n+R [∑\nn(n)x(n)∗\n\U0001D441\n\U0001D45B=1\n] \n \n       (15) \nWhere n(n)\
    \ denotes Additive White Gaussian Noise \n(AWGN) with mean zero and variance \U0001D70E\
    \U0001D70E2. \nThe value of the test statistic T is compared to a fixed \nthreshold\
    \ \U0001D706\U0001D706 in order to decide on the presence of a primary user \n\
    signal. H1 is considered to be true if T > \U0001D706\U0001D706, and H0 is \n\
    considered to be true otherwise. \nIt is noteworthy that the waveform-based sensing\
    \ scheme \ncan only be applied to wireless systems having known signal \npatterns,\
    \ such as Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11b) [83] and WIMAX [84]. \nIn [85], it is demonstrated\
    \ that compared to energy detector \ntechnique, this method is more reliable and\
    \ has less sensing \ntime. In addition, it is demonstrated that the accuracy of\
    \ this \nsensing scheme increases with the length of the known primary \nsignal\
    \ pattern. \nIn [86], the authors have opted for waveform-based sensing \nscheme\
    \ to analyze the sensing performance of the simultaneous \ntransmission-and-sensing\
    \ (TS) mode, which has proven its \neffectiveness under imperfect self-interference\
    \ signal (SIS), \nunlike energy detection that cannot differentiate between a\
    \ PU \nsignal and a residual SIS. \nIn spite of the aforementioned advantages,\
    \ there are some \ndownsides to this scheme, mainly the need for complete and\
    \ \naccurate information concerning waveform patterns as well as \nhigh synchronization\
    \ between PU and SU, which is not always \npossible to attain. \nConcerning the\
    \ implementation complexity, coherent \ndetection is more complex than Energy\
    \ detection method and \nhas a lower complexity compared to match filter detection\
    \ \ntechnique. \nTable III provides a performance comparison of the \npreviously\
    \ described narrowband sensing methods based on a \nset of performance criteria,\
    \ namely detection accuracy, \ncomplexity, need for prior information about the\
    \ primary user, \nrobustness against noise uncertainty, and sensing time required\
    \ \nto achieve a good performance. \n3) Wideband sensing techniques: Wideband\
    \ spectrum \nsensing enables detecting spectral opportunities that lie within\
    \ \nfrequency bands greater than the coherence bandwidth of the \nchannel. One\
    \ application of this class of sensing is to exploit \nthe available spectrum\
    \ holes in the UHF (ultra-high-\nfrequency) TV band ranging from 300 MHz to 3\
    \ GHz. \nAs have been discussed earlier, narrowband sensing \nschemes make a single\
    \ binary decision for the whole frequency \nband. That makes these schemes incapable\
    \ to perform directly \nwideband sensing, since the latter intends to determine\
    \ the \noccupancy of several sub-channels that are involved in a given \nwideband\
    \ spectrum at a time. \nThe two types of wideband sensing techniques (Nyquist\
    \ / \nSub-Nyquist) will be briefly reviewed in this subsection. \n \n \n112 |\

    \ \nwideband \nsensing: \nNyquist \nwideband \nsensing is carried out using a\
    \ standard ADC operating at \nNyquist rate to digitize the wideband signal and\
    \ digital signal \nprocessing methods to detect spectral opportunities. It \n\
    includes, among other, wavelet-based detection, multi-band \njoint detection,\
    \ and filter bank detection: \nWavelet-based detection [87] determines spectrum\
    \ holes \nover a wide frequency band, which is assumed to be composed \nof a multitude\
    \ of sub-bands whose locations and power spectral \ndensities are unknown, by\
    \ using the wavelet transform. The \nlatter serves to identify discontinuities\
    \ that are located at the \nboundaries (edges) of each sub-band. The discontinuous\
    \ \nchanges on the edges correspond to irregularities in power \nspectral density.\
    \ As such, information about the locations and \nintensities of the sub-bands\
    \ can be retrieved through the \nwavelet transform and then their status (occupied\
    \ or \nunoccupied) can be deduced. \nConcerning the multiband joint detection\
    \ algorithm [88], it \nsenses the primary signal over multiple frequency channels\
    \ by \nperforming the following procedures: first, sampling the \nwideband signal\
    \ using a high sampling rate analog to digital \nconverter. Second, dividing the\
    \ sampled data into parallel data \nstreams by a serial-to-parallel converter.\
    \ Third, computing the \nFast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the digital signal. Fourth,\
    \ \ndividing the wideband spectrum into multiple sub-bands that \nare occupied\
    \ by narrowband signals. Finally, detecting \nspectrum opportunities over each\
    \ sub-band by using a \nnarrowband sensing scheme such as energy detection. \n\
    Furthermore, this technique allows to jointly determine the \noptimal threshold,\
    \ that maximizes the accuracy of sensing for \nall the sub-channels, by formulating\
    \ an optimization problem. \nAs for filter bank detection [89], a filter bank,\
    \ consisting of \na set of bandpass filters, is used to separate the wideband\
    \ signal \ninto multiple sub-bands. The bandpass filters are realized \nthrough\
    \ modulation (Poly-phase decomposition) of a prototype \nfilter. The prototype\
    \ filter is a lowpass filter that is used to \nimplement the zeroth band of the\
    \ filter bank. The obtained sub-\nbands are then sensed separately via a narrowband\
    \ sensing \nscheme. In this type of sensing, the sub-bands can be down-\nconverted\
    \ and consequently re-sampled at a lower sampling \nrate. However, a large number\
    \ of RF components will be \nadded, resulting in a high implementation complexity\
    \ [90]. \nWhile Nyquist wideband sensing allows to exploit \nefficiently the available\
    \ spectrum, it has certain limitations, \nincluding the requirement of a high\
    \ sampling rate (Wavelet-\nbased detection and multiband joint detection) and\
    \ the high \nimplementation complexity (Filter bank). \nb) Sub-Nyquist \nwideband\
    \ \nsensing: \nSub-Nyquist \nwideband sensing offers solutions to the challenges\
    \ facing \nNyquist-based sensing, more particularly high sampling rate \nand high\
    \ implementation complexity concerns. Sub-Nyquist \napproaches aim to identify\
    \ spectral opportunities by exploiting \nonly a few measurements derived from\
    \ processing wideband \nsignals at sampling rates less than the Nyquist rate.\
    \ \nAmong the most important Sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \ntypes is compressive-based\
    \ sensing [91–93]. The latter refers to \nthe process of recovering a sparse signal\
    \ from a few \nmeasurements by following a three-step procedure (sparse \nrepresentation,\
    \ measurement, and sparse recovery). In the first \nstep, the sparsity of the\
    \ signal is derived by projecting the \nsignal on an appropriate basis. In second,\
    \ only a reduced \nnumber of measurements are retrieved by multiplying the \n\
    sparse signal by a measurement matrix. In third, the signal is \nrecovered by\
    \ using the few collected measurements. Finally, \nthe sensing operation is performed\
    \ to identify the spectral \nopportunities. \nIt is noteworthy that the use of\
    \ comprehensive sensing, in \nthe context of wideband sensing, is enabled due\
    \ to the sparsity \nfeature that characterizes the wideband signal in the frequency\
    \ \ndomain. \nFurthermore, the reliability of sub-Nyquist wideband \nsensing schemes\
    \ depends largely on the accuracy of sparsity \nlevel estimation. Although, the\
    \ latter suffers from uncertainty \nbecause of various factors, mainly the dynamic\
    \ nature of PUs \ntransmission activities as well as wireless channel impairments.\
    \ \nD. Machine Learning for Spectrum Sensing \nAs pointed out earlier, CR is an\
    \ intelligent radio system that \nincorporates the three main components which\
    \ any intelligent \nsystem should have, namely perception, learning, and \nreasoning\
    \ [94]. Perception refers to the ability of the system to \nsense its radio environment\
    \ and it can be realized by means of \nsensing measurements of the spectrum. Learning\
    \ refers to the \nability of the system to convert the gathered information into\
    \ \nknowledge and it can be achieved through classification and \n113 | P a g\
    \ e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \ngeneralization algorithms.\
    \ Finally, knowledge is exploited by \nthe system to attain its objectives via\
    \ reasoning ability \n[94].Considering this intelligent design, machine learning\
    \ \nbased spectrum sensing presents itself as a good alternative to \ndetermine\
    \ the channel occupancy in Cognitive Radio Networks \nby addressing two main issues\
    \ which are classification and \ndecision making [94]. \nMachine learning algorithms\
    \ can be classified into two \nbroad groups: supervised learning and unsupervised\
    \ learning. \nIn supervised learning, a classifier learns from a training \ndataset\
    \ to make predictions on unforeseen data. According to \nthe training dataset,\
    \ supervised machine learning problems can \nbe further grouped into classification\
    \ and regression problems. \nIf the input variables are mapped to discrete output\
    \ values \n(categories, labels, classes…), then it is a classification \nproblem.\
    \ If the input variables are mapped to continuous \noutput values, then it is\
    \ a regression problem. Some examples \nof supervised algorithms include support\
    \ vector machines \n(SVM), Random forest, and naive Bayesian classifier (NBC).\
    \ \nAs for unsupervised learning, its main function consists in \nfinding patterns\
    \ in a set of untagged data. K-means is one of \nthe simplest and most widely\
    \ used unsupervised machine \nlearning algorithms. \nIn the context of Cognitive\
    \ Radio Networks, several papers \nhave dealt with the use of machine learning\
    \ algorithms to \npredict the availability of frequency channels. For instance,\
    \ in \n[95], the authors performed a comparative analysis of different \nsupervised\
    \ and unsupervised machine learning algorithms \nbased on computational time and\
    \ classification accuracy. They \nalso proposed a new method that combines support\
    \ vector \nmachines with the firefly algorithm. The authors of [96] \nproposed\
    \ a deep learning approach to learn channel activities \nand predict its availability\
    \ in future time slots. The ability to \npredict the channel occupancy in the\
    \ next time slots may \nincrease the efficiency of selecting the more appropriate\
    \ \nchannel at the instant t (For example, choosing the channel \nhaving the highest\
    \ probability of being unoccupied in the next \ntime slots). \nGenerally, in the\
    \ case of spectrum sensing, researchers \nadopt a two-phase machine learning approach\
    \ [95,97]. In the \nfirst phase, an unsupervised learning technique, such as K-\n\
    means algorithm, is applied to discover the transmission \npatterns of primary\
    \ users. In the second phase, the discovered \nclusters (channel busy or free)\
    \ are used to train supervised \nlearning classifiers like support vector machine\
    \ (SVM) and \nthen to assign the new input data to the suitable cluster. it is\
    \ \nworth mentioning that in several works, the sensing clusters are \nassumed\
    \ to be known and thus the first phase is omitted. In this \ncase, the researchers\
    \ adopt a one-phase machine learning \napproach in which supervised learning techniques\
    \ are trained \nwith the already known clusters [98,99]. \nIn building machine\
    \ learning models for spectrum sensing, \nseveral features are used, including\
    \ energy statistic, probability \nvector, and occupancy over time. Obviously,\
    \ the accuracy of \ndetecting the primary users may be affected by the selected\
    \ \nfeatures. \nFinally, to evaluate the performance of a given model, a set \n\
    of metrics can be used mainly, probability of detection, \nprobability of false\
    \ alarm, total error rate, sensing time, and \naccuracy. \nE. Sensing Challenges\
    \ \nThis subsection is devoted to discussing the various \nchallenges related\
    \ to the spectrum sensing process in Cognitive \nRadio Networks as well as highlighting\
    \ some possible future \nresearch directions in this field. \n1) Hidden PU problem:\
    \ As the Carrier Sense Multiple \nAccessing (CSMA), which is characterized by\
    \ the presence of \nhidden node problem, spectrum sensing suffers also from \n\
    hidden primary user problem. The latter refers to the situation \nin which the\
    \ secondary user misses the primary user presence \ndue to many issues, including\
    \ severe multipath fading and \nshadowing effects experienced by primary signals,\
    \ during \npropagation from PU transmitter to SU receiver. As such, the \nsecondary\
    \ user may induce undesirable interference to \nprimary user receivers. In several\
    \ research papers, cooperative \nsensing has been proposed as a successful approach\
    \ to handle \nthis issue by exploiting spatial diversity [49,100]. \n2) Challenges\
    \ related to cooperative sensing: Cooperative \nsensing has proven to be effective\
    \ in improving the reliability \nand accuracy of detection, especially in the\
    \ case of the \npresence of channel impairments. Moreover, it has also been \n\
    shown to be useful in decreasing individual sensing durations \nand local processing\
    \ requirements [21,53]. \nDespite its different advantages, cooperation among\
    \ CR \nusers also brought many challenges and invoked significant \nresearches.\
    \ One of these challenges is mitigating the additional \nsignaling overhead and\
    \ reducing delays that are induced by the \ncooperation process [101]. \nAnother\
    \ challenge is to find a tradeoff between the number \nof users participating\
    \ in cooperation and additional processing \nrequirements. Indeed, a large number\
    \ of cooperative nodes can \nensure a high probability of detection, even in the\
    \ presence of \nchannel uncertainties and detectors with less sensitivity, but\
    \ it \nintroduces a considerable amount of extra overhead which \nleads to an\
    \ increase in the sensing time and processing. Hence, \nthere exists a compromise.\
    \ \nAnother challenge consists in developing asynchronous \ncooperative spectrum\
    \ sensing algorithms [102,103]. In fact, CR \nnodes are located at different positions\
    \ and may perform \nspectrum sensing at different times [104]. Therefore, CR nodes\
    \ \ncannot report their local sensing results to the fusion center at \nthe same\
    \ time and thus some of the reported information may \nnot be up to date [103].\
    \ Furthermore, there is always a time \noffset between the local observation and\
    \ the final decision \nwhich may incur performance degradation. In addition, \n\
    reporting channel uncertainties may impact negatively the \nsensing accuracy.\
    \ \n3) Spectrum sensing duration: Admittedly, a long sensing \nduration can guarantee\
    \ a higher accuracy for spectrum sensing \nresults, but it can compromise with\
    \ interference avoidance, \nenergy efficiency, and throughput. \n114 | P a g e\
    \  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer\
    \ Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nRegarding interference avoidance,\
    \ secondary users must be \naware promptly of the presence of the primary user\
    \ and vacate \nthe frequency band rapidly when the incumbent user resumes \nits\
    \ transmission in that band. Thus, a real trade-off arises \nbetween the quickness\
    \ with which the secondary user must \nperform the aforementioned tasks and the\
    \ required sensing \nduration to ensure more reliable results. \nConcerning energy\
    \ efficiency, the gain in accuracy \nachieved by a long sensing duration comes\
    \ at the expense of \nenergy. Hence, sensing duration and energy efficiency should\
    \ \nbe optimized. \nAs for throughput, it is inversely related to sensing time.\
    \ \nTherefore, there is a compromise between longer sensing \nduration for higher\
    \ performance and lower sensing duration for \ngood throughput. \nThese trade-offs\
    \ should be addressed jointly to find an \noptimum solution that ensure a higher\
    \ performance under \ncertain constraints. \n4) Noise \nuncertainty: \nSeveral\
    \ \nspectrum \nsensing \ntechniques rely on a threshold value to decide on the\
    \ presence \nof primary user signals. Hence, selecting the optimum \nthreshold\
    \ is crucial and important to ensure high accuracy of \nsensing results. To determine\
    \ the best threshold value, many \nparameters should be taken into consideration\
    \ such as noise \npower. The latter is uncertain and developing techniques that\
    \ \nare robust to noise uncertainty is still a challenging task. Some \nresearch\
    \ papers have addressed this issue using different \napproaches. For instance,\
    \ in [105] a blind spectrum sensing \ntechnique based on goodness of fit testing\
    \ of t‐distribution \nhas been proposed to cope with the noise uncertainty problem.\
    \ \n5) Complexity and hardware requirements: Several issues \nneed to be addressed\
    \ to bridge the gap between the theory and \nthe hardware implementation realities\
    \ of spectrum sensing \nschemes from both types, narrowband and wideband sensing.\
    \ \nThese include the complexity of narrowband sensing \ntechniques, mainly covariance-based\
    \ and cyclostationary \nfeature detection schemes, which require large processing\
    \ \npower that is unsuitable for portable devices. Hence, \nAdditional efforts\
    \ are required to reduce the complexity of \nthese techniques and take advantage\
    \ of their various benefits \nin real-life application. Besides, meeting the hardware\
    \ \nrequirements of wideband sensing schemes, like high-\nresolution ADCs and\
    \ high-speed signal processors, while \nmaintaining acceptable complexity and\
    \ moderate computation \npower, is a challenging task. \n6) Sparsity level uncertainty:\
    \ In wideband compressive \nsensing, estimating the accurate sparsity level is\
    \ of paramount \nimportance, since it is a prerequisite for determining the \n\
    optimal number of measurements. However, achieving this \nresult is very difficult,\
    \ especially in rapidly changing \nenvironments, due to random changes in spectrum\
    \ activities \nand time-varying fading channels. That may lead to calculate \n\
    the number of measurements using the worst-case sparsity \nlevel assumption, resulting\
    \ in high energy consumption and \ninefficient use of sub-Nyquist sampling technologies.\
    \ \nTherefore, developing blind sub-Nyquist wideband sensing \nschemes, in which\
    \ the estimation of sparsity level isn’t \nneeded, still a challenging task [90].\
    \ \nIn the literature, only a few papers have dealt with the issue \nof sparsity\
    \ level uncertainty. For instance, the authors of [106] \nproposed an algorithm\
    \ for estimating the sparsity level of the \nchannel over a learned dictionary\
    \ using Machine Learning \nalgorithms. \n7) Security: As with any wireless network,\
    \ Cognitive \nRadio Networks are vulnerable to various cybersecurity \nattacks\
    \ that can be performed by selfish or malicious users and \ninduce disruptive\
    \ effects on network operation. Selfish users \nexploit network facilities for\
    \ their interests, namely \nmonopolizing the use of available spectrum opportunities\
    \ and \nthus depriving legitimate Secondary users of their fair share of \nspectrum.\
    \ As for malicious users, they abuse network facilities \nby exploiting the existing\
    \ vulnerabilities and thereby \nhindering legitimate SUs from using the spectrum.\
    \ \nSome of the cybersecurity attacks in Cognitive Radio \nNetworks include most\
    \ active band (MAB), primary user \nemulation (PUE), and spectrum sensing data\
    \ falsification \n(SSDF) attacks. \nMost active band (MAB) attack aims at detecting\
    \ and \nmaking the most active band, in a multi-band CR network, \nunavailable\
    \ by targeting it via a denial of service (DoS) attack \nand consequently preventing\
    \ the other users (PU and SU) from \nusing it. The authors of [107] proposed a\
    \ coordinated \nconcealment strategy to counter this attack. In this strategy,\
    \ a \nset of SUs cooperate and transmit useless data in a free band to \nmake\
    \ it the most active and therefore the attacker's target. \nPrimary user emulation\
    \ (PUE) attack is an attack where a \nselfish or malicious node adjusts its air\
    \ interface to emulate \nprimary user characteristics and thus mislead secondary\
    \ users \nconcerning the availability of the spectrum holes [108]. During \nthe\
    \ sensing process, SUs, under this attack, may detect attacker \nsignals as primary\
    \ user signals and then refrain from using the \nspectrum. A range of countermeasures\
    \ against PUE attack has \nbeen \ninvestigated \nin \nthe \nliterature \n[109].\
    \ \nThese \ncountermeasures can be categorized into four types: \ncountermeasures\
    \ based on cryptography, countermeasures \nbased on fingerprint, countermeasures\
    \ based on game theory, \nand hybrid countermeasures that combine the three other\
    \ types \n[109]. \nSpectrum sensing data falsification (SSDF) attack, also \n\
    known as Byzantine attack, specially targets cooperative \nspectrum sensing and\
    \ consists in compromising the fusion \ncenter with false spectrum sensing results\
    \ to deceive decision-\nmaking. In [110], a reputation-based approach, in which\
    \ the \nfusion center recognizes the malicious attackers and eliminates \nthem\
    \ from the data fusion process, was proposed to counter \nSSDF attack. \nWhile\
    \ significant efforts have been carried out to detect and \ncope with cybersecurity\
    \ issues, there are still several challenges \nthat need to be addressed, including\
    \ developing advanced \ntechniques that do not need prior knowledge about PU location\
    \ \n115 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n(IJACSA) International Journal of\
    \ Advanced Computer Science and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \n, as this\
    \ is not always available in real-world scenarios, \ndeveloping detection and\
    \ counter-measures methods based on \ncryptography that take into account resource\
    \ constraint (e.g., \npower and bandwidth), and developing spectrum sensing \n\
    techniques capable of differentiating between PU signals and \nmalicious user\
    \ signals. \nV. CR-BASED IOT \nThe wide variety of IoT technologies have led to\
    \ a rapidly \nincreasing number of networked devices that are expected to \nreach\
    \ 51.11 billion by 2023, according to research from Cisco \nstates (See Fig. 13).\
    \ Such devices involve daily tech gadgets \nsuch as smartphones and smart home\
    \ devices, as well as \nindustrial devices like smart machines and robots. These\
    \ smart \nconnected devices are capable of gathering, sharing, and \nanalyzing\
    \ information and creating actions accordingly. By \n2023, global spending on\
    \ IoT will reach 1.1 trillion U.S. dollar \n[111]. This puts IoT at the core of\
    \ current and future social and \neconomic transformation. \nFurthermore, with\
    \ the massive proliferation of these \nconnected objects, there is an increased\
    \ demand for spectrum \nresources. Cognitive Radio proves to be a promising \n\
    technology to cater to current and future IoT devices in terms \nof spectrum access.\
    \ In this section, the integration of the \nInternet of Things and Cognitive Radio\
    \ is explored. \n \nFig. 13. IoT Connected Devices Installed base Worldwide from\
    \ 2015 to 2025 \n(in billions)3. \nA. Definition of IoT \nThe term \"Internet\
    \ of Things\" was coined by Kevin Ashton \nto depict “a system in which the Internet\
    \ is connected to the \nphysical world by ubiquitous sensors”4. \nInternet of\
    \ Things (IoT) can be defined as a network of \nobjects connected to the Internet\
    \ and can communicate with \neach other using different communication technologies.\
    \ These \nobjects are equipped with sensors, that allow interaction with \nthe\
    \ environment, and communication modules [112–114]. \nSome of those sensors include\
    \ temperature sensors, pressure \nsensors, proximity sensors, and humidity sensors.\
    \ \nToday, the IoT enables the real world and the virtual/or \ndigital world interconnection.\
    \ Thanks to IoT, things will \n3 https://www.statista.com/statistics/668996/worldwide-expenditures-for-\n\
    the-internet-of-things/ \n4 https://www.historyofinformation.com/detail.php?id=3411\
    \ \ncommunicate with each other and develop their own \nintelligence. Televisions,\
    \ cars, kitchen appliances, surveillance \ncameras, smartphones, utility meters,\
    \ cardiac monitors, \nthermostats, and almost anything that we can imagine will\
    \ be \nconnected every day, everywhere and every time. \nThe idea of the IoT dates\
    \ back to 1999 [115] and became a \nreality due to several technologies and protocols,\
    \ including \nMachine to Machine (M2M), Wireless Sensor Networks \n(WSN), Radio\
    \ frequency Dentification (RFID), Internet \nProtocol version 6 (IPv6), IPv6 Low\
    \ power Wireless Personal \nArea Networks (6LoWPAN), Routing Protocol for Low-Power\
    \ \nand \nLossy \nNetworks \n(RPL), \nConstrained \nApplication \nProtocol(CoAP),\
    \ and Cognitive Radio that comes to empower \nthe IoT revolution. This revolution\
    \ gives birth to the \nproliferation of small devices such as sensors and actuators,\
    \ \nwith low consumption at lower cost, and a large number of \nplatforms allowing\
    \ users to develop their own applications. \nThus, the number of connected « things\
    \ » is increasing \nexponentially in the world (See Fig. 13). \nB. Motivations\
    \ behind the use of Cognitive Radio in the IoT \nCognitive Radio has a great potential\
    \ to address several \nissues and challenges related to the deployment of IoT\
    \ \nnetworks, namely, resource scarcity, interferences problem, \nlimited communication\
    \ range, purchasing license, storing and \nanalyzing the data generated by IoT\
    \ objects, heterogeneity, and \nreconfigurability and autonomicity. Dealing with\
    \ these issues \npresents the prime motivation behind the use of Cognitive \n\
    Radio in IoT. \nRegarding spectrum resources, it is difficult to allocate \nfrequency\
    \ bands to all the ever-increasing number of IoT \nobjects. CR address this issue\
    \ by enabling frequency reuse. \n As for the interference problem, most IoT technologies\
    \ \nsuch as RFID, IEEE 802.15.4 (ZigBee) operates in UHF and \nISM frequency bands\
    \ which are already saturated and can’t \naccommodate more applications. Thus,\
    \ sharing these bands \nbetween a large number of objects creates inevitable \n\
    interferences. CR deal with this issue by enabling dynamic \nspectrum access to\
    \ interference-free channels. \nConcerning communication range, ISM unlicensed\
    \ bands \nallow wireless technologies to operate only over a limited \nrange.\
    \ Acquiring a frequency spectrum, that ensures \ncommunications over long distances,\
    \ requires the purchase of \nlicenses which generates superfluous expenses. CR\
    \ avoids the \npurchase of license and allows the opportunistic usage of \nunoccupied\
    \ bands that enables long-distance communications. \nIn terms of storing and analyzing\
    \ the data generated by IoT \nobjects, the objects must find communication links\
    \ to transmit \nthe generated information to numerous servers (Cloud servers).\
    \ \nCR is a proper solution to resolve this issue. \nWith respect to heterogeneity\
    \ problems, IoT applications \nrepresent a wide range of design options (resources,\
    \ \ndeployment, connectivity, energy, communication modality, \ninfrastructure,\
    \ network size, network topology...). Thus, new \ncommunication paradigms should\
    \ be designed to support this \nheterogeneity by providing environmental discovery,\
    \ self-\norganization, and self-management capabilities [116]. CR is \n116 | P\
    \ a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org \n                                          \
    \                 \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science\
    \ and Applications, \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \none of these paradigms that can be\
    \ used to tackle heterogeneity \nissues. \nAnother reason is related to reconfigurability\
    \ and \nautonomicity. In fact, smart objects are expected to have the \ncapacity\
    \ to reconfigure. themselves without any external \naction. Thus, objects need\
    \ to be able to recognize and analyze \ntheir environment, detect neighboring\
    \ objects, and then \nreconfigure. themselves. CR proves to be a suitable solution\
    \ to \nfit these circumstances. \nTaking into account all of the above, it can\
    \ be concluded \nthat Cognitive Radio is genuinely a promising enabler \ntechnology\
    \ for IoT. \nC. IoT Applications and CR \nThe deployment of IoT products and services\
    \ will be \npresent in all sectors and industries, from the smart home to the\
    \ \nsmart city, education, health care, manufacturing, energy, \nutilities, commerce,\
    \ transportation, monitoring, supply chain, \nand logistics as illustrated in\
    \ Fig. 14. In general, the \nopportunities offered by IoT are unlimited and its\
    \ full impact \nand potential will be realized in the near future as more and\
    \ \nmore devices connect to the Internet. At present, there are few \nworks in\
    \ the literature dealing with potential applications of \nCR technology for IoT,\
    \ including military applications, \ncognitive radio-vehicular ad hoc networks\
    \ (CR-VANET), \nemergency networks, smart grids, smart metering, and medical \n\
    applications [117–123]. Table IV describes some IoT \napplications while demonstrating\
    \ how CR can be used to \naddress a number of their concerns. \nD. Open Research\
    \ Issues in CR-Based IoT \nSeveral open research issues need to be addressed in\
    \ order \nto take advantage of the full potential of Cognitive Radio for \nIoT\
    \ networks. In this subsection, some of these issues will be \ndiscussed. \n1)\
    \ Optimization of network resources: Efficient spectrum \nutilization, in the\
    \ context of a network composed of CR IoT \nnodes, requires the joint optimization\
    \ of a set of parameters \nsuch as transmission power, energy efficiency, transmission\
    \ \ndelay, and transmission data rate, which is a challenging task. \nThe authors\
    \ of [125] formulated an optimization problem to \nconverge to an optimal solution,\
    \ in a constrained environment, \nby taking into account three variables namely;\
    \ transmission \npower, transmission rate, and transmission delay. To solve this\
    \ \nproblem, they applied a branch-and-cut polyhedral approach. \nThe results\
    \ show that an increase in network and packet size \nleads to an increase in transmission\
    \ delay, power, rate, and \ninterference. \nFormulating and solving multi-objective\
    \ optimization \nproblems, considering a large number of factors, still need to\
    \ \nbe addressed. \n2) Energy efficiency: One of the main challenges that \nneed\
    \ to be addressed in CR-based IoT networks is energy \nefficiency. IoT objects\
    \ with cognitive radio capabilities \nconsume more energy due to performing additional\
    \ functions \nmainly spectrum sensing, which intensifies the power \nconsumption\
    \ issue, especially for energy-constrained nodes \nand battery-powered devices.\
    \ \n \nFig. 14. Applications of IoT. \nTABLE IV. \nCR CONTRIBUTION IN IOT APPLICATIONS\
    \ \nIoT application \nDescription and CR contribution \nSmart Grids [120,121]\
    \ \nSmart Grid is an electricity distribution network that allows the flow of\
    \ information between producers and consumers in order to \ncontrol and regulate\
    \ the flow of electricity in real time and enable more efficient management of\
    \ the electricity grid. The major \nchallenge of this technology is the transmission\
    \ of data through long distances without investing in the purchase of licenses\
    \ or the \ninstallation of cable trays. Cognitive radio offers a good solution\
    \ to this problem. \nSmart Homes [117] \nHomes will be equipped with smart objects,\
    \ allowing to carry out all daily task, such as smart lamps and smart fridges.\
    \ These \nobjects will integrate sensors endowed with cognitive capabilities that\
    \ help to avoid interference in the ISM band. \nHealthcare and Medical \nApplications\
    \ [122,123] \nSmart sensors are deployed to monitor critical data like blood pressure,\
    \ glucose levels, and temperature. With Cognitive Radio \nthis information can\
    \ be transmitted to medical staff in real time, over long distances without worrying\
    \ about spectrum availability. \nSmart Cities [119] \nThe smart city is a paradigm\
    \ of urban development which integrates information and communication technology\
    \ (ICT) and IoT \nsystems. In this paradigm, continuous connectivity should be\
    \ maintained. CRNs can be a good solution to support this \nrequirement. \nInternet\
    \ of Vehicles (IoV) \n[124] \nToday, the trends toward less dependence on human\
    \ beings have led us to the IoV paradigm in which vehicle control is achieved\
    \ \nthrough the integration of communications and embedded systems. The IoV is\
    \ supposed to be an autonomous travel decision-\nmaker. Safe navigation may be\
    \ possible in the future through vehicle-to-vehicle information exchange, vehicle-mounted\
    \ sensors, \nand user intentions. The challenge in IoVs is the availability of\
    \ spectrum for mobile vehicles. CRNs may be a good solution \nbecause of their\
    \ long-range and interference-free spectrum sensing. \n \n117 | P a g e  \nwww.ijacsa.thesai.org\
    \ \n(IJACSA) International Journal of Advanced Computer Science and Applications,\
    \ \nVol. 12, No. 6, 2021 \nAmong the solutions that have been introduced to deal\
    \ with \nenergy efficiency concerns are energy harvesting or scavenging \nand\
    \ Cooperative Wireless Networks. Energy harvesting is \ndefined as the process\
    \ through which energy is extracted from \nexternal sources, such as wind and\
    \ solar energies, and then \nstored so as to be used as a source of power [126].\
    \ Energy \nharvesting is considered as one of the most enabling \ntechnologies\
    \ \nfor \nGreen \nComputing \nand \nreal-world \nimplementation of IoT. In [127]\
    \ a differential game model has \nbeen proposed to resolve the resource allocation\
    \ problem in \ncognitive WSN using energy harvesting. Optimal resource \nallocation\
    \ strategies for all SUs are obtained by determining \nthe loop Nash equilibrium\
    \ and the feedback Nash equilibrium \nsolutions of the proposed model. In [128],\
    \ a CR-based energy \nharvesting approach has been used to extend the battery’s\
    \ \nlifetime for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) under reliability \nand secrecy\
    \ constraints. To reduce energy consumption, the \nenergy harvested is maximized\
    \ and the transmission energy \nconsumption \nis \nminimized \nby \nsolving \n\
    a \nformulated \noptimization problem. \nCurrently, Cognitive Radio networks based\
    \ on energy \nefficiency approaches are considered an important research \ndirection.\
    \ \n3) Security: Addressing security issues in CR-Based IoT \nnetworks is a prime\
    \ concern and a challenging task as most \nIoT objects are inherently heterogeneous\
    \ and have their proper \nuniform security standards. These standards are not\
    \ adequate \nfor all heterogeneous networks. Several privacy and security \naspects\
    \ should be taken into account in designing IoT systems, \nincluding authentication,\
    \ security assurance, and intrusion \nsoft-ware [117]. Worthy efforts have been\
    \ done to tackle \nsecurity issues in some IoT applications with cognitive radio\
    \ \ncapabilities. For instance, the authors of [129] proposed a \ndistributed\
    \ cooperative spectrum sensing approach to deal \nwith the security problem in\
    \ CR-VANETs. This approach uses \na weighted consensus-based spectrum sensing\
    \ technique with \ntrust assistance to ensure the reliability of spectrum sensing\
    \ \noperation in a hostile CR-VANET. The validity of the \nproposed approach was\
    \ approved by extensive simulations. In \n[128], the proposed CR-Based energy\
    \ management scheme for \nUAVs has been designed in such a way that the secrecy\
    \ and \nreliability of the system are ensured. This is illustrated by \nconsidering\
    \ the scenario for the eavesdroppers. \nSecurity remains an open issue to be addressed\
    \ as \ncybersecurity attacks and threats are emerging and increasing \nin parallel\
    \ with new technologies. Therefore, developing \ninnovative countermeasures is\
    \ demanded. \nVI. CONCLUSION \nNowadays, wireless network devices are emerging\
    \ at an \nunprecedented rate, which will further exacerbate spectrum \nshortages.\
    \ Therefore, addressing the spectrum scarcity problem \nbecomes more urgent. Cognitive\
    \ Radio is a promising \ntechnology to overcome this issue for futuristic networks\
    \ (IoT \nand 5G) by enabling an efficient, flexible, and opportunistic \nusage\
    \ of the scarce frequency spectrum. This paper provides a \nreview of Cognitive\
    \ Radio with emphasis is put on SDR, \nspectrum sensing, and CR-Based IoT. Concerning\
    \ SDR, this \narticle highlights its architecture, tools, advantages, and some\
    \ \nof its ongoing challenges. As for spectrum sensing, it is \nextensively reviewed:\
    \ spectrum opportunities considering \nmultiple dimensions are discussed, classification\
    \ of spectrum \nsensing based on several aspects is presented, Narrowband and\
    \ \nWideband sensing techniques are analyzed, ML-based \nspectrum sensing is studied,\
    \ and challenges and open research \ndirections are reviewed. Regarding CR-Based\
    \ IoT, the focus \nwas on explaining the motivations behind the use of CR in IoT\
    \ \nnetworks and reviewing some of the open issues related to CR-\nBased IoT.\

    access surely represents a solution in order to fight the problem of spectrum
    scarcity. Cognitive radios are flexible communication terminals that can change
    their receiving and transmitting features and consequently implement dynamic spectrum
    access. To be sure not to cause harmful interference to the licensed users, fast
    and reliable spectrum sensing techniques must be adopted. Among several standardization
    activities, Spectrum Characterization and Occupancy Sensing (SCOS) system is a
    spectrum sensor network that has among its aims the execution of spectrum sensing
    tasks and publication of sensing results on spectrum sharing database.In this
    paper a spectrum occupancy sensor, to be employed in such a kind of network, is
    proposed. It is implemented on a software defined radio device. It has been developed
    in order to obtain fast and reliable measures also in situations characterized
    by a very low signal-to-noise ratio. Preliminary hardware characterization and
    performance assessment confirm the goodness of the proposal. Published in: 2019

    Very fast and reliable Internet access is crucial for network providers. Every
    day, many of us use their Internet–connected devices, like smartphone, laptop,
    smart TV, and so on, in order to access to services provided through the web.
    As a consequence, fast Internet access represents a way for common users to access
    to many services crucial for our life. Furthermore, it represents also an important
    development factor for least–developed and developing countries, LDCs and DCs
    respectively. Unfortunately, nowadays the percentage of the population living
    in these countries and using the Internet is only 17.5% (LDCs) and 41.3% (DCs)

    Daniel Elenius, Grit Denker & Mark-Oliver Stehr  Part of the book series: Lecture
    Notes in Computer Science ((LNISA,volume 5341)) Included in the following conference
    series: International Conference on Web Reasoning and Rule Systems 407 Accesses
    3 Citations Abstract We describe a reasoner for OWL ontologies and SWRL policies
    used on cognitive radios to control dynamic spectrum access. In addition to rules
    and ontologies, the reasoner needs to handle user-defined operations (e.g., temporal
    and geospatial). Furthermore, the reasoner must perform sophisticated constraint
    simplification because any unresolved constraints can be used by a cognitive radio
    to plan and reason about its spectrum usage. No existing reasoner supported all
    these features. However, the term rewriting engine Maude, augmented with narrowing,
    provides a promising reasoning mechanism. This allows for a behavior similar to
    that of a logic programming system, while constraint simplification rules as well
    as operations can easily be defined and processed. Our system and general approach
    will be useful for other problems that need sophisticated constraint processing
    in addition to rule-based reasoning, or where new operations need to be added.
    The implementation is efficient enough to run on resource-constrained embedded
    systems such as software-defined radios. Access provided by University of Nebraska-Lincoln.

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: In recent times, wireless communications has established
    itself as a popular access technology due to the user preference for the flexibility
    of untethered communication. The single biggest problem that still impedes broader
    uptake of wireless technology is scarceness of wireless capacity. The lack of
    wireless capacity scaling is primarily due to two factors: firstly, wireless interference
    that limits a wireless channel to only possible transmission at any given time,
    and secondly, the current radio spectrum management scheme based on licensing
    frequency spectrum which is known to be very inefficient. Two well-known techniques
    that address parts of our considered problem space in wireless networks include:
    1) cognitive radio networks (CR) or dynamic-spectrum-access (DSA) networks that
    utilize programmable software defined radios to address the wireless standards
    interoperability problem, and 2) multi-radiomulti-channel (MRMC) technology, which
    addresses the wireless scalability problem, in which each node is equipped with
    multiple radio interfaces (that can tune to any one of the available orthogonal
    channel) to allow multiple overlapping transmissions. In this work, we aim to
    investigate the benefits of a hybrid of these approaches: an approach that call
    C-MRMC technology. In C-MRMC wireless networks, each node is equipped with multiple
    cognitive radio interfaces. We investigate in our work the potential improvement
    in performance (which we gauge in metrics such as throughput, packet delivery
    ratio) gained by such an approach through extensive simulations. Our results demonstrate
    that having such an approach is viable and can lead to significant performance
    gains. Published in: 2013 27th International Conference on Advanced Information

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Barcelona, Spain SECTION I. Introduction
    While wireless communications has firmly established itself as a very popular
    access technology due to the user preference for the flexibility of untethered
    communication, scarceness of wireless capacity is the single biggest problem that
    impedes broader uptake of wireless technology. The lack of wireless capacity scaling
    is primarily due to two factors [1]: wireless interference and the command and
    control based radio spectrum management scheme based on licensing the available
    spectrum which has shown to be very inefficient. Apart from the wireless capacity
    scaling problem, the interoperability of numerous wireless standards is also a
    problem. Two well-known techniques have been devised to address these problems.
    Firstly, cognitive radio networks (CR) that utilize programmable software defined
    radios to address the wireless standards interoperability problem while also using
    dynamic-spectrum-access (DSA) techniques to allow efficient usage of spectrum.
    DSA allows a secondary user (SU) to access wireless spectrum licensed to a primary
    user (PU) when the spectrum is unused. Secondly, multi-radio multi-channel (MRMC)
    technology in which each node is equipped with multiple radio interfaces (that
    can tune to anyone of the available orthogonal channel) to allow multiple overlapping
    transmissions; MRMC technology has also been proposed as a solution to the wireless
    scalability problem. We believe that wireless scalability and efficient spectrum
    usage are closely tied, and therefore we propose to investigate networks which
    employ a novel hybrid of CR and MRMC technologies which we call C-MRMC (Cognitive
    Multiple-Radio Multiple-Channel) technology. In a C-MRMC wireless mesh network,
    each node is equipped with multiple cognitive radio interfaces-that can dynamically
    find and use unused spectrum for the most efficient usage of the available spectrum.
    In this work, we aim to quantify the possible capacity or throughput improvement
    in wireless networks using C-MRMC technology. While previous work has focused
    on quantifying the advantages of multiple-radio interfaces [2], to the best of
    our knowledge, the utility of multiple cognitive radio interfaces has not been
    studied earlier. Our hypothesis is that CRNs with multiple cognitive radio interfaces
    at each node (which we refer to as C-MRMC technology) should improve the capacity
    by coping more flexibly with PU arrivals because of increased interfaces. It is
    also expected intuitively that C-MRMC technology would be able to offset the limitations
    of transmission and sensing at a single interface by allowing a SU to sense on
    one interface and to send data on another interface hence increasing individual
    throughput of the node as well as aggregate throughput of the whole network. In
    this paper, we utilize extensive simulations to scientifically evaluate our hypothesis,
    outlined above based on intuitive arguments, that C-MRMC technology should provide
    increased wireless capacity. We will evaluate the performance of C-MRMC CRNs in
    metrics such as throughput, packet delivery ratio (PDR). In our work, we introduce
    sensing decision block (SDB) in order to sense the primary user at an interface
    with minimum traffic load, resulting in an increase in network throughput. The
    rest of the paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we discuss the related
    work in detail, whereas in Section III we describe the sensing decision block.
    In Section IV, we describe our network model and system assumptions. In Section
    V, we provide a thorough analysis of our simulation results and describe the insights
    we gained therefrom in Section VI. Finally, we conclude this paper in Section
    VI. SECTION II. Literature Review Gupta and Kumar [3] did pioneering work on capacity
    characterization of wireless network, in which they derive throughput capacity
    and transport capacity for single channel wireless network. Through their results,
    they found that the capacity of a wireless networks is inversely proportional
    to the number of nodes in the network, causing a decrease in capacity of network
    as the network size increases. Gupta and Kumar''s work was further extended by
    Nitin Vaidya [4] to derive the capacity of MRMC wireless networks. Through mathematical
    results, it is shown that the capacity of wireless networks depends on ratio of
    channels and interfaces and interface switching delay has no impact on the capacity
    of wireless network. Another work proposed use of multiple radios in wireless
    mesh networks to solve the scalability issues for 802.11 wireless local area networks
    (WLAN) [5], where authors list the advantages of multi-radio in comparison to
    single-radio with examples. Through simulation results, they established the fact
    that performance of multi-radio mesh networks scales well as the network size
    increases. Advantages of multiple radios in multi-hop wireless networks are formulated
    by studying the different parameters of network with multiple radios nodes like
    diameter of a network, link connectivity, diameter sensitivity, shortest path
    length, network resilience [2]. Distributed and localized channel assignment framework
    [6] for C-MRMC CRNs has been introduced and it is established that by using their
    channel assignment framework, throughput improves considerably as compared to
    common channel assignment. While the authors of [6] have focused on devising a
    channel assignment framework assuming that C-MRMC technology is viable and leads
    to throughput performance improvement, we focus on the fundamental problem of
    quantifying the benefits of using C-MRMC technology. Scaling laws of single channel
    CRNs were discussed by Mai Vu [7] et al., in which authors mainly address two
    issues. Firstly, they aim to determine the way throughput of single-radio SUs
    scales with increase in network size in the presence of PUs; secondly, they formulate
    a method to derive the upper and lower bounds for the PU region, such that SUs
    present outside this region can continue their transmission without harming transmissions
    of PUs. In other work, formulas for throughput scaling of coexisting CRN networks
    are derived in literature, where authors obtain formulas for multi-hop CRNs [8].
    Chengzhi Li [9], studied the capacity scaling for coexistence of SUs network and
    PUs network, and the per node throughput for secondary network and primary network.
    Fig. 1. Sensing Decision Block Show All Strategies to develop techniques to enable
    both PU and SU network to achieve asymptotic capacity in specific conditions are
    proposed by C. Wang et al. [10] by studying multicast capacity for CRNs. Researchers
    have also studied delay and capacity scaling for CRNs by studying the impact of
    PU activity, when PUs are deployed in sparse and dense environment [11]. Capacity
    scaling laws for CRNs have also been derived, authors study the capacity of CRN
    under physical and protocol model [12]. While previous work on capacity scaling
    in CRN is largely based on asymptotic analysis and mathematical modeling with
    researchers focusing on mathematical expressions for upper bounds and lower bounds
    of capacity of the network, our focus in this work is on simulation-based evaluation
    of C-MRMC technology. In our work, we vary the number of cognitive interfaces
    to quantify their utility by studying their impact on metrics such as PDR, throughput.
    We also study the effect interface diversity (having multiple radio interfaces)
    on throughput capacity of network. SECTION III. Sensing Decision Block In CRNs,
    efficient detection of PUs is critical so that radio spectrum may be accessed
    opportunistically without harmful interference to PUs. Different methods have
    been proposed in literature to detect PUs. A prominent approach in this regard
    is spectrum sensing [13], which is a cheap and easy to deploy approach, in which
    SU senses the channel for the PU signal. Sensing algorithms can be of different
    types [14]. A critical issue in sensing is to determine optimal sensing time to
    maximize throughput under the constraint that the primary users are sufficiently
    protected. Previous work has focused on this issue and have determined this optimal
    sensing time to be close to 14.2 ms [15]. In our work, we have used the value
    of 20 ms as the sensing time. In our work, we also need to define a criteria for
    selecting the interface to be sensed since our work utilizes C-MRMC technology
    which implies the usage of multiple radio interfaces. We use the simple intuitive
    method of choosing the interface carrying the least traffic load as the interface
    to be sensed. This arrangement can be seen in Fig. 1 which shows the basic function
    of SDB which helps decide the interface to be sensed when using C-MRMC technology.
    We note here that the interface to be sensed will change dynamically as traffic
    on each interface might change quickly with time. We have set the sensing interval
    to be 1s. Fig. 2. Base results for default number PUs and SUs (a) Packet delivery

    Area=1000×1000  m 2 , Number of SUs=10, Number of Channels=5, Number of PUs=15,  λ
    ON =5, Show All SECTION IV. Network Model and Assumptions In our network model,
    we consider cognitive radio adhoc network (CRAHN) [16], where there is no central
    entity controlling the network and all the network nodes are in distributed mode.
    We assume that the network consists of static SUs and PUs, where every SU has
    multiple interfaces and multiple channels for communication. As CRN channel conditions
    are dynamic, we assume that every SU node has the capability of sensing, to detect
    presence of a PU signal on a channel at a particular interface. We assume overlay
    network [17] in which SU stops transmitting at a particular channel, in case PU
    arrives. PUs are uniformly distributed in space and their activity is modeled
    using an exponential ON/OFF process [18]. As PU arrival rate is modeled exponentially
    we can vary PU OFF and ON duration parameter (λ) . Common channel assignment (CCA)
    [19] is assumed initially but it keeps on dynamic assignment after arrival of
    PU on the channel. We used position based routing framework [20], also known as
    Geographic based routing, as the routing model in our work in which a node forwards
    a packet after reception to the neighbour that is closer to the destination. SECTION
    V. Simulation and Performance Evaluation We simulate the C-MRMC CRN in OMNeT++
    [21], which is an open source simulator. We incorporate CRN support in OMNeT++
    and import INET-MANET framework [22] in OMNeT++ for MRMC networks. Extensive simulations
    were carried out under different scenarios and network settings. To evaluate if
    multiple cognitive radio interfaces do indeed return any benefit, we compare the
    results of C-MRMC and single-radio CRNs for the following network parameters:
    1): Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR)PDR is the ratio of the number of packets received
    to number of packets sent. We average out PDRs of all the flows in the network
    to determine overall PDR for the network. 2): ThroughputThroughput is defined
    as the average number of bits received of all the flows in the network divided
    by simulation period. Default Network Settings Nodes in the network are deployed
    in area of 1000×1000  m 2 . In the default case, there are 3 interfaces and 5
    channels available at every SU node. We vary the number of interfaces (to a maximum
    of 5) and channels (to a maximum of 8) to find the effect of increased interfaces
    on network throughput. Sensing duration for an SU on a channel is assumed to be
    0.02s [15] and sensing interval is set to Is. We assume that multiple unicast
    flows are running in the network. Number of SUs and PUs may vary as per different
    network configurations. By default PU ON duration parameter ( λ ON ) is set to
    5 and PU OFF duration parameter ( λ OFF ) is set to double the ON duration (i.e
    10), but we vary λ OFF to determine the impact of varying PU traffic intensity.
    All the results presented are averages over 15 different topologies. A. Base results
    for default number PUs and SUs First, results are obtained for default number
    of PUs and SUs (15 and 10, respectively) in which number of cognitive interfaces
    is varied from 1 to 3 to determine the utility of using multiple cognitive radio
    interfaces. Fig. 2(a) shows results of PDR and Fig. 2(b) shows results of throughput
    for this network setting. The results show that the PDR and throughput of network
    increases as the number of interfaces increase. This observation can be explained
    in the following way: in the case of single interface, a node has to sense and
    send packets at the same interface which increases the transmission delay due
    to sensing and decreases the PDR. This leads to significant degradation in throughput
    of the network. While in the case of multiple interfaces, sensing and data transmission
    is carried out in parallel, resulting in significant increase in network throughput.

    of varying number of PUs In this subsection, we discuss results comparing the
    performance of C-MRMC CRNs vs. single-radio CRNs. We assume that there are 10
    SUs while the number of PUs is varied from 0 to 25. Fig. 3(a) shows results of
    PDR and Fig. 3(b) shows results of throughput. The results show that PDR and throughput
    of network increases as number of interfaces increase. The increase in PUs, on
    the other hand, will lead to decrease in network throughput and PDR. However,
    it is observed that C-MRMC CRNs fares better than single-radio CRNs. In the case
    of C-MRMC CRNs, if a PU arrives at a channel on one interface, node has opportunity
    to transmit data from the other interface, but as we increase the number of PUs,
    these opportunities for data transmission from other interfaces become scarce
    so throughput of the network decreases. It is observed clearly in our results
    that throughput of the network depends heavily on PU intensity (in number of PUs
    and in PU activity) for both C-MRMC CRNs and for single-radio CRNs since a SU
    has to relinquish the channel for a PU on its arrival in both cases. C. Effect
    of varying PU traffic intensity In this subsection, we quantify the impact of
    varying the PU traffic intensity on PDR and throughput of the network in case
    of single-radio CRNs and C-MRMC CRNs. PU ON duration parameter ( λ ON ) value
    is assumed fixed at 5 units while PU OFF duration parameter ( λ OFF ) is varied
    from 0.5 (tenth of the PU ON time) to 5, 25, and 50 units (ten times the PU ON
    time). We assume that the number of SUs is 10. We obtain these results for both
    low PU density (where we assume that there are 5 PUs). Multiple flows exist in
    the network. Fig. 4(a) and Fig. 4(b) shows results of PDR and throughput of the
    low PU density network for varying λ OFF of PU. Results shows that for all values
    of λ OFF , C-MRMC CRNs outperform single-radio CRNs, but as the value of λ OFF
    gets smaller the there is a significant decrease in PDR and throughput of the
    network because PU arrival rate in network increases as λ OFF decreases, which
    lessens the chances of transmission using other interfaces. D. Effect of varying
    number of SUs We assume that the number of PUs are fixed at 5 and flows at 20.
    We vary number of SUs (to 20, 30, 40, 50 nodes). Fig. 5(a) shows results of PDR
    and Fig. 5(b) shows results of throughput for single, double, triple radios, while
    SUs are varied. Results show that C-MRMC CRNs performs better than single-radio
    CRNs regardless of increase in SUs. In case of PDR, if we increase the number
    of SUs, single-radio CRNs do not perform well in comparison with C-MRMC CRNs.
    However, we also notice that as the network size increases, throughput of network
    decreases slightly in all cases (as topologies were randomly deployed so increasing
    the number of SUs may lead to delayed packet reception due to multi-hop packet
    forwarding thereby slightly decreasing throughput). Fig. 5. Effect varying number

    number of flows Scalability of a network can be defined as the ability to accommodate
    network growth. Capacity scaling is related to throughput scaling. We study throughput
    scaling of C-MRMC CRNs in comparison with single-radio CRNs in congested network
    environment. We assume that the number of PUs are fixed at 5 and number of SUs
    are fixed at 50. We vary number of flows (to 10, 20, 30, 40, 50). Fig. 7 shows
    result of throughput for varying number of flows. Results shows that as we increase
    the number of flows in CRNs throughput decrease significantly in C-MRMC CRNs as
    well as in single-radio CRNs due to congested network environment, but still C-MRMC
    CRNs give better throughput performance rather then single-radio CRNs in case
    of congested environment. We also test the worst case scenario considering maximum
    number of unicast flows that can occur in our network at same time to check how
    throughput scales for C-MRMC CRNs. In case of worst case, throughput of C-MRMC
    CRNs is much better than single-radio CRNs. This result also shows throughput
    scaling by using C-MRMC technology rather than using single radio in congested
    network environment. F. Increasing Interface Diversity In the results above, we
    assume that three interfaces are available at every SU node in a network. We show
    the results of throughput and PDR of network for increasing number of interfaces.
    However, a fundamental question arises that how many interfaces should be used
    per node to increase the network throughput, as increasing number of interfaces
    can be a burden on the users in terms of hardware cost. We increase the number
    of interfaces to four and five to check effect of varying number of interfaces
    on the throughput and PDR of the network, keeping number of flows, SUs, PUs and
    channels constant in the network. Fig. 6(a) shows results for PDR of the network
    and Fig. 6(b) shows results for throughput of the network for varying number of
    interfaces to five. Simulation results show that using interfaces more then three
    causes a slight increase in the throughput and PDR of the network rather than
    a significant improvement. Therefore we conclude that using three interfaces per
    SU node is optimal and further increase in number of interfaces increase the network
    throughput and PDR, but complexity and hardware cost of network also increases.
    SECTION VI. Insights Major insights that we gained through this work are as follow:
    1) How many interfaces should be used? In our work, we have investigated the use
    of multiple cognitive interfaces. The benefit of going from one radio to two radio
    interfaces per node is quite significant with our simulation results showing significant
    improvement in throughput. With an increase from two to three radios, the throughput
    increases marginally at the cost of increased system complexity. Using more than
    three radios returns diminishing gains with significant increase in hardware cost
    and system complexity. 2) Impact of Multiple Interfaces on Capacity Capacity of
    a network is closely tied to the throughput of the network. We investigate the
    impact on throughput capacity in case of multiple interfaces in CRN with varying
    network configurations. We notice that in all network configurations which we
    tested, C-MRMC CRNs result in significant increase in throughput of the network
    in comparison to single-radio CRNs. We also check the throughput by varying the
    network size and found out that throughput scales well for C-MRMC CRNs. We study
    the throughput scaling in congested CRNs and find out that as the number of flows
    increases there is a significant decrease in throughput of C-MRMC CRNs and single-radio
    CRNs, however in case of C-MRMC technology throughput of network scales better
    as compare to single-radio CRNs. In case of CRNs, throughput performance of the
    network depends critically upon PU density; in case of intense PU traffic, the
    throughput of the network decreases even we use multiple interfaces but nonetheless
    C-MRMC CRNs performs better than single-radio CRNs comparatively. SECTION VII.
    Conclusion In this paper, we quantify the advantages of having multiple cognitive
    radio interfaces on a node in CRNs in metrics of throughput and packet delivery
    ratio (PDR). We have taken results of PDR and throughput for varying network configurations.
    Our results show that by using multiple cognitive interfaces in CRNs, there is
    a significant improvement in throughput capacity and PDR of CRNs. It has been
    observed that PUs affect C-MRMC CRNs less drastically than they impact CRNs having
    single radio interfaces on each node which is another benefit of C-MRMC technology.
    Throughput results depends upon PU density, PU traffic intensity, network traffic
    load; any changes in these network settings affects the throughput capacity of
    the network. While our simulation-based results indicate that performance keeps
    improving even as the number of cognitive radio interfaces on each CRN node is
    increased above three, system challenges and pragmatic concerns may limit the
    number of cognitive interfaces on a CRN node especially keeping in view marginal
    incremental gains achieved with increasing radio interfaces above a certain threshold.

    12 PDF TOOLS SHARE Today''s wireless services have come a long way since the roll
    out of the conventional voice-centric cellular systems. The demand for wireless
    access in voice and high rate data multi-media applications has been increasing.
    New generation wireless communication systems are aimed at accommodating this
    demand through better resource management and improved transmission technologies.
    Pushing the adaptive system design further by introducing multi-dimensional awareness,
    sensing, and learning from its experiences to reason, plan, and decide future
    actions to meet user needs brings the ‘Cognitive Radio’ concept into the wireless
    world. Even though there is no consensus on the formal definition of cognitive
    radio as of now, the concept has evolved recently to include various meanings
    in several contexts. One main aspect concerns autonomously exploiting locally
    unused spectrum to provide new paths to spectrum access. Other aspects include
    interoperability across several networks; roaming across borders while staying
    in compliance with local regulations; adapting the system, transmission, and reception
    parameters without user intervention; and having the ability to understand and
    follow actions and choices taken by their users, learning to become more responsive
    over time. The interest in increasing spectrum access and improving spectrum efficiency
    combined with both the introduction of software-defined radios (SDR) and the realization
    that machine learning can be applied to radios has created intriguing new possibilities
    for wireless radio research. This special issue discusses the cognitive radio,
    SDR, and adaptive radio concepts from several directions. There are many fundamental
    and practical issues that need to be studied more to ensure the success of these
    concepts in wireless communication markets. We are delighted that this special
    issue addresses some of these issues with eight papers selected through a competitive
    peer review process. In addition to the peer-reviewed papers, one invited paper
    is included. First, the invited paper discusses the practical implementation of
    cognitive radio including passing environmental information from the radio to
    the cognitive engine, using this information and performing real-time control
    of the radio platform by the cognitive engine. This paper provides a broad view
    to the readers and relates other technical papers to the larger themes of cognitive
    radio. A central value proposition of cognitive radio is to use limited radio
    spectrum resources as efficiently as possible. Opportunistic spectrum usage exploits
    the unused part of the spectrum to increase capacity. However, this requires spectrum
    awareness and new techniques for efficient utilization of densely occupied spectrum.
    The paper entitled ‘Spectrum sensing in cognitive radio networks: The cooperation-processing
    tradeoff’ discusses spectral awareness. Local and cooperative spectrum sensing
    and related issues are discussed under realistic radio channel conditions with
    fading. Next, in the paper entitled ‘Spectrum sharing through distributed coordination
    in dynamic spectrum access networks,’ techniques for the sharing of available
    spectrum are discussed. Coordination of the spectrum usage to support fair access
    to spectrum with minimum mutual interference is discussed. Related to these two
    papers, the fourth paper ‘Formalizing the interference temperature model’ defines
    the interference temperature model, and derives algorithms for computing radio
    frequency (RF) transmission parameters that maximize both capacity and spectral
    efficiency for a given RF environment. Similar to radio spectrum, radiated power
    is also a very important resource in wireless communications, especially for wireless
    sensor networks. The battery power is limited in small wireless devices, so it
    must be used very efficiently. One important consideration in cognitive radio
    is system design to adaptively use power as efficiently as possible. The fifth
    paper ‘Efficient duty cycling through prediction and sampling in wireless sensor
    networks’ deals with this issue through an innovative medium-access-control (MAC)
    layer protocol for wireless sensor networks for an adaptive interface to achieve
    ultra-low power operation. The next two papers address SDR implementation of cognitive
    radio. The paper entitled ‘Automatic antenna tuning unit for software-defined
    and cognitive radio’ discusses the implementation of an automatic antenna tuning
    unit system (ATU). Antennas for true SDR and cognitive radio realizations must
    cover a variety of frequency bands with radiation and reception parameters suited
    to different wireless standards. This paper covers recent progress in reconfigurable
    antenna technology. On the other hand, the paper entitled ‘DSP implementation
    of a bit loading algorithm for adaptive wireless multicarrier transceivers’ studies
    fixed-point DSP hardware implementations of an adaptive bit loading algorithm
    that can increase the capacity of the multicarrier systems like OFDM efficiently
    via implementation with reasonable computational complexity. The last two papers
    are related to the optimization of the radio resource and transmission parameters.
    The paper entitled ‘Cognitive engine implementation for wireless multicarrier
    transceivers’ presents a genetic algorithm (GA) driven cognitive engine for single
    carrier and multicarrier systems. The last paper entitled ‘Install or invoke:
    The optimal trade-off between performance and cost in the design of multi-standard
    reconfigurable radios’ finds the optimal trade-off between performance and cost,
    via a mathematical model of the design choices represented in a graph of progressively
    simpler functional modules. We thank the contributors of this special issue for
    their excellent contributions and for working with us to publish their work. Also,
    we extend our great appreciation to the reviewers who dedicated their valuable
    time to provide constructive comments, suggestions, and corrections. Finally,
    we thank the Editor-in-Chief, Professor Mohsen Guizani, and the staff at Wiley
    for their guidance. With such support, we believe that this special issue offers
    a considerable and timely contribution in the area of cognitive radio, and we
    hope that our readers will benefit from these papers and find them interesting.

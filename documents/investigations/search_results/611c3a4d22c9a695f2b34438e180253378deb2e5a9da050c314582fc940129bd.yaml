    Precision management has become vital in agriculture with possibilities growing\
    \ alongside developments in \ninformation and communication, robotics and sensor\
    \ technologies. On the other side of expected benefits of precision \nmanagement\
    \ in terms of environmental friendliness, yield margin, input efficiency, etc.,\
    \ is the upfront expensiveness of \nsuch technologies. There is hence a need to\
    \ quantitatively assess expected net benefits and provide useful information \n\
    for farmers and stakeholders to enable informed choice on the potential adoption\
    \ of precision technologies and \nmanagement practices. This study presents economic\
    \ assessment of precision irrigation and harvest management \nsystem with integrated\
    \ use of sensor technologies and Farm Management Information System (FMIS) as\
    \ compared \nto conventional practice applying partial budgeting as a tool. Relevant\
    \ scenarios are defined based on data from an \nexperimental apple orchard field\
    \ situated in Prangins, Switzerland. The precision management system is found\
    \ to be \neconomically justifiable in situations of high demand for irrigation\
    \ characterized by limited rainfall and considerable \nvariabilities in weather\
    \ conditions. Its economic feasibility is found to be sensitive to changes in\
    \ fruit price and capital \ncost. \nKeywords: apple orchard, economic assessment,\
    \ irrigation management, partial budget analysis, precision agriculture \nINTRODUCTION\n\
    Agriculture is being increasingly challenged by \nincreasing competition, declining\
    \ availability of key \nnatural resources and growing demand for high quality\
    \ \nproduce. Farmers are also being increasingly challenged \nto consider environmental\
    \ and social impacts of their \nbusiness besides economic return (Janssen et al.,\
    \ 2010). \nTo survive amidst these challenges, farm businesses \nneed to improve\
    \ productivity, competitiveness, resource \nuse efficiency and environmental friendliness.\
    \ Precision \nfarming has been regarded as a means of achieving these \nmultiple\
    \ objectives (Mondal and Tewari, 2007; Adeyemi \net al., 2017). \nNowadays, marketable\
    \ quality as well as environmental \nfriendliness of production systems has become\
    \ a \ncompetitive edge in the farming business. Fruticulture \nis a typical area\
    \ where competition is fierce and there is \nincreasing demand for high quality\
    \ fruits produced with \nminimal environmental footprint. In the case of apple\
    \ \norchards, fruit quality along with yield level and production \ncost is found\
    \ to be main determinant of economic success \n(Bravin et al., 2009). Irrigation\
    \ and harvest management, \namong other operations, are fundamental to producing\
    \ \nhigh quality fruits. \nGiven that agriculture is the dominant consumer \n\
    of water worldwide, efficient application of water is a \ncritical aspect of precision\
    \ agriculture (Jiang et al., 2011). \nOriginal scientific paper\nDOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.3.2160\n\
    Journal of Central European Agriculture, 2019, 20(3), p.1009-1022\n1009\nIt could\
    \ be possible to save agricultural water use without \nsignificant impact on yield\
    \ (Greaves and Wang, 2017). \nAccording to Perea et al. (2017), precision irrigation\
    \ is \nparticularly important in high value fruits where quality \nassurance is\
    \ a major determinant of profitability. In Europe, \nwater availability is expected\
    \ to drastically decrease \nbecause of increased demand, effects of climate change\
    \ \nand regulatory requirements (Tarjueloa et al., 2015; \nGiannakis et al., 2016).\
    \ There is hence an incessant need \nto optimally manage water use mainly with\
    \ irrigation. \nStudies show that final fruit quality is also highly \ninfluenced\
    \ by the optimality of harvesting time (Muhtaseb, \n2007; Kviklienė and Valiuškaitė,\
    \ 2009). Management of \nirrigation coupled with the method and timing of harvest\
    \ \nis reported to have an important bearing on final oil quality \nof olive trees\
    \ (Dag et al., 2008). Promisingly, developments \nin Information and Communication\
    \ Technologies (ICT) \nincluding sensors and robotics provide the potential for\
    \ \nprecise measurement of crop water status for irrigation \nmanagement and precise\
    \ estimation of optimal harvest \ntiming, among others. Plant water stress indicators\
    \ are \nrecognized to having promising potential for irrigation \nmanagement under\
    \ water stress conditions (Paço et al., \n2013).\nTo make informed and timely\
    \ management decisions, \nFarm Management Information Systems (FMIS) with \ndecision\
    \ support capabilities are essential tools. In \nEurope, FMIS are becoming indispensable\
    \ tools in farm \nmanagement in the face of increased attention for \neconomic\
    \ viability and interaction with the surroundings \n(Sørensen et al., 2010). However,\
    \ lack of appropriate \ndecision support systems (DSS) customized for farm \n\
    decision makers has still been a limiting factor against \nwidespread adoption\
    \ of precision management. FMIS \nhelps improve allocation of managerial time\
    \ (Vaughan et \nal., 2013), for example, geo-referenced information and \ndecision\
    \ aids reduce the burden of field monitoring and \nspare labor time which can\
    \ be spent on better planning.\nThe project “USability of Environmentally sound\
    \ and \nReliable technologies in Precision Agriculture” (USERPA), \nin the framework\
    \ of the European Research Area \nNetwork Information and Communication Technologies\
    \ \nin Agriculture, proposes integration of canopy and \nfruit sensors with mobile\
    \ vehicles and wireless sensor \nnetworks together with a Farm Management Information\
    \ \nSystem (FMIS) for providing spatial data for high value \ncrops (vineyards\
    \ and apple orchards). USERPA aims at \ndeveloping an integrated precision agriculture\
    \ solution \nfor orchards and vineyards focusing primarily on irrigation \nand\
    \ harvest management to produce high quality fruits \nby optimal input use without\
    \ jeopardizing environmental \nsustainability. \nIt is expected that precision\
    \ irrigation and harvest \nmanagement investments that improve yield and fruit\
    \ \nquality payoff by receiving higher price in a competitive \nmarket. For example,\
    \ studies show that consumers having \nconcern for health and environmental sustainability\
    \ reveal \npositive willingness to pay price premium for eco-friendly \napple\
    \ fruits (Loureiro et al., 2002; Durham et al., 2012). \nHowever, such precision\
    \ technologies are expensive \nupfront (Giannakis et al., 2016) and involve several\
    \ \nuncertainties (Tozer, 2009). To this end, it is crucial to \nquantitatively\
    \ assess expected net benefits and provide \nuseful information for farmers and\
    \ other stakeholders \ninterested in potential adoption of the technologies and\
    \ \nmanagement practices. Attempts to quantify economic \nfeasibility of irrigation\
    \ management systems are mostly \nbased on case studies on small experimental\
    \ fields and \nthe conclusions tend to reflect that precision irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ technologies are not as such economically \nviable. In a case study on cotton\
    \ production in Texas \nHigh Plains, Seo et al. (2008), concluded that a critical\
    \ \nlevel of output price is required for precision irrigation \nto be economically\
    \ justified. As noted in Lu et al. (2005), \nvariable rate application of irrigation\
    \ would potentially \nbe profitable in the future as many farmers adopt the \n\
    technologies. \nThis study is concerned with assessment of \npotential economic\
    \ feasibility of precision irrigation \nand harvest management system proposed\
    \ by USERPA \ncompared to conventional practice. A partial budget \nanalysis methodology\
    \ is employed based on data from \nOriginal scientific paper\nDOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.3.2160\n\

    Switzerland.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStudy site and experiment setup \nFor testing\
    \ and demonstrating the USERPA system, \nfield experiments were held on a commercial\
    \ apple \norchard of Gala Brookfield (specie: maus) with 1,357 \ntrees (2,500\
    \ trees/ha) in the district of Nyon in the canton \nof Vaud in Prangins, Switzerland.\
    \ Description of the study \nfield is given in Table 1 below. \nTable 1. Description\

    Installed capacity\n3.6 liters / tree / hour \nHarvest technology\nBy hand\nConventional\
    \ irrigation is initiated from mid-May until \nthe end of August or later on a\
    \ daily basis for two hours. \nWhen the rain is believed to be enough to cover\
    \ the water \nrequirements of the orchard, irrigation is suspended. \nThough Evapotranspiration\
    \ (ETP) estimates are provided \nonline and free of charge by the Swiss meteorological\
    \ \nagency – Agrometeo, the farmer mentioned that he only \nconsidered it for\
    \ a short while and usually irrigates based \non his experience, expectations\
    \ about weather conditions, \ntree phenology and perceptions about tree water\
    \ \nrequirements. The amount of irrigation the farmer applies \nduring rainy,\
    \ moderate precipitation and dry seasons \nrespectively is 200, 800 and 1,500\
    \ m3/ha (where 10m3/\nha is equivalent to 1 mm of rainfall). In 2014, irrigation\
    \ \nwas applied on a daily basis from 16 to 30 June while \nin 2015 it was applied\
    \ from 27 May until 4 September. \nEven if the general level of precipitation\
    \ seems to have \nbeen observed in the irrigation decision, the amount and \n\
    timing of irrigation has been calendar-based without \ntaking full consideration\
    \ of variabilities in relevant within \nfield features and weather attributes.\
    \ It could be possible \nto save more water by precisely managing variabilities.\
    \ It \nwas also reflected by the case farmer that current practice \nmay not be\
    \ efficient and better can be done by combining \ntechnology and farmer experience.\n\
    As for fruit harvest, it is normally done in two rounds \none in late August (early\
    \ September) and a second round \nin approximately a week or two later. Within\
    \ two days \nof harvest, fruits are transported, sorted, stored and \nmarketed\
    \ by a cooperative called Le’man fruits Fenaco \nCooperative Society to which\
    \ the farmer is a member. \nThe coop classifies apple fruits into three quality\
    \ groups; \nnamely, premium, first-class, and second-class based \nmainly on fruit\
    \ weight, color and sugar content given \ncultivar (fruit variety). The coop uses\
    \ several cameras to \nmeasure fruit color. Besides, 35 randomly chosen apples\
    \ \nare passed through Perenelle to be individually measured \nfor acidity, fruit\
    \ flesh firmness, and brix and five of them \nare then smashed and measured for\
    \ juice content. The \ncooperative sends out information on expected price of\
    \ \nall apple fruit varieties by quality category before harvest \n(often in August)\
    \ to all members but price adjustments \ncan be done based on aggregate supply\
    \ and market \nconditions.\nWith the purpose of improving management of \nirrigation\
    \ and harvest by integrated use of sensor \ntechnologies, USERPA experiment setup\
    \ was prepared \nand necessary fixed sensors (on fruits, canopy and in-soil to\
    \ \nmake real-time measurements throughout the production \nseason) deployed in\
    \ 2013 whereas measurements \nOriginal scientific paper\nDOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.3.2160\n\

    ERPA project portal, ‘Selected Results’ compiled by ARO, 2016)\nwith all the sensors\
    \ were done in 2014 and 2015. The \nexperiment setup consists four irrigation\
    \ plans with three \nrepetitions (rows) each: no irrigation (0%), half-irrigation\
    \ \n(50%), full-irrigation (100%) and ‘farmer practice’ where \n‘full-irrigation’\
    \ means irrigation amount according to best \npractice and ‘farmer-practice’ is\
    \ left for farmer decision \nthat is assumed not to be influenced by the experiment.\
    \ \nThe idea is to compare the three irrigation levels against \nfarmer-practice\
    \ in terms of potential economic gains. \nDespite the original plan, ‘Farmer practice’\
    \ and ‘100%’ \nirrigation zones received the same amount of irrigation \nthroughout\
    \ the experiment period. \nFigure 1 depicts USERPA’s experimental setup of the\
    \ \napple orchard field in Prangins, Switzerland (diagram \non the left is the\
    \ field setup during 2014 experimental \nseason whereas the two diagrams to the\
    \ right show \nadjustments made during 2015). To prevent rainfall water \nfrom\
    \ sinking into the soil, plastic cover (rectangular area \nin Figure 1 with red\
    \ boundary) was placed on part of the \n‘no-irrigation’ zone on 1 June 2015. Half\
    \ of the cover was \nremoved on 14 July 2015 and then irrigated as the 100% \n\
    treatment (stage 2 in Figure 1).\nThe plan with the experiment was to capture\
    \ stress \neffects from deficit irrigation treatments (0% and 50%) \nusing the\
    \ imaging systems and apply 'sensor-based' \nreaction based on that information\
    \ during the end of \nJune and the beginning of July. Due to lack of stress \n\
    effects owing to heavy rainfall especially in the summer \nof 2014, 'sensor-based'\
    \ reaction was not accomplished. \nTable 2 presents description of the sensors\
    \ involved in \nthe USERPA system.\nUSERPA intends to provide decision support\
    \ \nby FMIS-automated analysis of data from various \nimaging and bio-physical\
    \ measurements such as soil \nconductivity, canopy cover, canopy vigour, chlorophyll\
    \ \ncontent, canopy temperature, leaf/stem water potential, \nstomatal conductance\
    \ and maximal daily shrinkage \nof tree diameter. Within the FMIS, Crop Water\
    \ Stress \nIndex (CWSI) is calculated both from metrological data \nand thermal\
    \ imaging data and statistically associated \nwith leaf/stem water potential measurements\
    \ taken \nsimultaneously. CSWI based on canopy temperature and \nmetrological\
    \ conditions was reported as a good indicator \nof crop water status in the case\
    \ of potato fields in Israel \n(Rud et al., 2014). The study claims that CWSI\
    \ estimated \nfrom thermal imagery can be reliably used for precise \nirrigation\
    \ management. Decision rules to trigger irrigation \ncan be determined by combining\
    \ information on CWSI \nand other bio-physical measurements (e.g. trunk diameter\
    \ \nshrinkage, stomatal conductance) and soil water status \ndata.\nFor \nimproving\

    \ done on fruits while on tree \nand harvested using non-destructive sensor technologies\
    \ \n(Torricelli et al., 2015). Measurements of fruit quality \nattributes using\
    \ mobile and handheld sensors were done \nthree times (end of June, end of July\
    \ and beginning of \nSeptember) in a growing season mainly due to a minimum \n\
    size required to make measurements with the various \nsensor technologies employed.\
    \ In 2014, three rounds \nof field campaigns (June 23-28, July 27-1 August and\
    \ \nSeptember 1-5) were made during which measurements \non fruit physiology and\
    \ quality attributes, leaf physiology \nand water content, microclimate, among\

    \ purpose of providing decision support for \nthe timing of harvest, fruit status\

    \ where \ndecision rules are generated within the FMIS by automated \nanalysis\
    \ of field data, market information, agronomic \nand economic data. The main idea\
    \ is to assist farmers \nto answer two basic questions of ‘when’ and ‘where’ to\
    \ \ntake an action to have an optimal irrigation for maximum \nbenefit from yield\
    \ at harvest time (USERPA, 2013). In this \nstudy, the farm manager is regarded\
    \ as the final decision \nmaker based on suggestions provided by the decision\
    \ \nsupport tools in the FMIS. Handheld and potentially \ntractor-mountable TRS\
    \ sensors adapted for fieldwork will \nprovide good potential for the determination\
    \ of optimal \nharvest time. Analyses of data acquired during the field \nmeasurements\
    \ is undergoing while some results have \nbeen published (Seiferta et al., 2015;\
    \ Torricelli et al., \n2015; Käthner and Zude-Sasse, 2015). \nMobile sensors are\
    \ mounted on a portable platform \n(robotic vehicle) that can be remotely guided\
    \ in the field \nto make imaging by several sensors such as thermal \ncamera,\
    \ RGB, hyperspectral camera and laser scanner, \nsimultaneously. \nDuring \ndata\
    \ \ncollection, \nportable \ncomputer and wet reference bath are attached to the\
    \ \nmobile platform. A picture of the mobile platform with \nsensors mounted on\
    \ it during in-field data collection is \nshown in Figure 2.\nAssumptions and\
    \ scenario definition\nIn this study, the following working assumptions have \n\
    been made.\n1. Yield level and quality of fruits under USERPA is \nat least as\
    \ good as conventional practice. Yield \namount: presuming that precision management\
    \ as \npropounded by USERPA is to improve fruit quality \nwith optimal resource\
    \ allocation and management \nthan it is to increase yield volume, yield per hectare\
    \ \nis assumed to be the same under the two systems.\n2. The fruit market is competitive\
    \ where better quality \nfruits receive better price premium.\n3. Cost of management\
    \ tasks apart from irrigation and \nharvest (e.g., thinning, pruning, trimming,\
    \ etc.) do \nnot change with adoption of USERPA. In reality, as \nfarmers become\
    \ well aware of the specific needs of \ntheir crop through the use of spatially\
    \ referenced \ndata, it is likely that farmers also adjust their overall \nmanagement\
    \ and hence costs and benefits of other \nmanagement tasks can be changed.\n4.\
    \ Assets of conventional practice including farmer \nexperience and physical assets\
    \ can be used in \nUSERPA without loss of value.\n5. USERPA physical devices bought\
    \ by a farmer \ncan be used to their full capacity by renting out \nindividually\
    \ or as a package. \nIn order to reflect the importance of spatial and \ntemporal\
    \ variability, precipitation, weather variability and \nwith-in field variability\
    \ are considered in the scenario \ndefinition. In areas of high weather uncertainty\
    \ and field \nvariability added to generally scarce water resource and \nscanty\
    \ precipitation, well-managed irrigation is so crucial. \nAt the experimental\
    \ field, variability in weather condition \nis considerable; spatial variation\
    \ in ground water within \nthe farm and differences in soil thickness and fertility\
    \ \nare moderate; the amount of precipitation varies from \naverage to high; and\
    \ availability and cost of water does \nnot seem to be a constraint.\nFor the\
    \ analysis, three scenarios were defined as \nfollows:\nOriginal scientific paper\n\
    DOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.3.2160\nTamirat and Pedersen: Precision irrigation and\
    \ harvest management in orchards: an economic...\n1014\nLOW scenario: here precipitation\
    \ is high; no \nconsiderable field variability; and weather condition is not \n\
    as such variable. In such a case, irrigation may not relatively \nbe much of a\
    \ concern; relatively less number of samples in \nthe field may suffice implying\
    \ lower capital and operating \ncosts. On the benefit side, marginal improvements\
    \ can be \nexpected as compared to conventional practice. \nMODERATE scenario:\
    \ characterized by moderate \nprecipitation, moderate field variability and modest\
    \ \nweather variability. Cost and potential benefit under \nthis scenario lie\
    \ between the two boundaries scenarios \ndefined before.\nHIGH scenario: is characterized\
    \ by scanty precipitation \nwith high weather variability and high variability\
    \ in \nfield features. Under these circumstances, irrigation \nmanagement according\
    \ to the specific needs of sub-fields \nis so crucial. There is greater need for\
    \ employing precision \ntechnologies including farm management information \n\
    systems with decision support capabilities. However, in \neconomic terms, what\
    \ matters for farmers is whether the \nextra benefit would justify such high investment.\
    \ \nIn this study, benefits from the USERPA system as \ncompared to conventional\
    \ practice as characterized by \nlabor and water saving as well as improved quality\
    \ of fruit.\nYield quality: average proportion of yield on the case \nfarm by\
    \ fruit quality class is 5-10% premium, about 60% \nfirst class and 15-20% second\
    \ class. In the analysis, for \nconventional practice 5% premium, 60% first class,\
    \ \n20% second class, and 15% third choice are considered \nbased on data from\
    \ the case farm (e.g., during 2014 \nharvest season, about 14% of yield was reported\
    \ to be \n‘third-choice’ that is generally considered as waste from \nfarmers’\
    \ point of view). Full potential benefit in terms of \nfruit quality improvement\
    \ is assumed to be exploited from \nyear 3 with 50% gain in the first two years\
    \ of adoption.\nLabor \nsaving: \nsemi-automated \ndata \ncollection, \nmanagement\
    \ and analysis along with minimum labor \nhold-up in irrigation reduces labor\
    \ need. This would \nbring considerable benefit in high wage countries like \n\
    Switzerland. Işik et al. (2017) reported that precision \nirrigation system enables\
    \ about 60% reduction in labor \nforce. \nTable 3 shows assumed potential labor\
    \ cost by task \nunder conventional versus USERPA systems.\nTable 3. Labor hours\

    \ in farms of significant \nwithin-field variability and with much variability\
    \ in \nweather conditions, precision management of water \nwould entail tremendous\
    \ value. In the case of Switzerland \nwhere precipitation is generally plenty,\
    \ a 50% reduction \nin irrigation water would ideally produce the same level of\
    \ \nyield without impairing quality (personal communication \nwith Reynald Pasche\
    \ and Ronit Rud). Table 4 presents \nfruit quality gain and water saving assumptions\
    \ by \nscenario. Other precision irrigation projects also show \nup to 50% water\

    \ (to make \neconomic assessment of the USERPA system), Partial \nBudget Analysis\
    \ (PBA) appears a suitable tool as it enables \nthe evaluation of the effect of\
    \ change in farm technology \non net income without knowing all the cost structures\
    \ of \nthe farm (Horton, 1982). PBA involves identifying costs \nand benefits,\
    \ converting identified quantities into costs \nand returns, and then calculating\
    \ the change in cost and \nrevenue between the technologies in question to get\
    \ the \nnet effect on income. \nTo evaluate economic rationality of the USERPA\
    \ \nsystem, relevant performance indicators; namely, Net \nPresent Value (NPV),\
    \ Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and \nBenefit-Cost Ratio (B/C) are presented.\
    \ Present value \nof P_i  amount of monetary investment at period n is \ncalculated\
    \ as follows:\nwhere Pi is the amount of money outlay at period i;\nPV(n)\nPi\
    \ = present value of Pi at period n; and IR = real interest \nrate. NPV is the\
    \ difference between present value of \nrevenue and present value of cost. IRR\
    \ represents the \nrate of return required for an investment to break-even \n\
    (i.e., NPV becomes zero) whereas B/C is ratio of benefit \nto cost. Besides, NPV\
    \ estimates are annualized applying \nthe standard annuity factor payment formula:\n\
    ANB = NPV * r (1 + R)\n-T\nwhere ANB stands for annualized net benefit, NPV is\
    \ the \nestimated net present value, r is discount factor, and T is \nthe project\
    \ life over which the NPV calculation is done. In \nthis case, ANB represents\
    \ estimated net value per hectare \nper year from USERPA system relative to conventional\
    \ \npractice.\nData on the following variables has been collected: \ncapital and\
    \ operating costs, quantities and prices of inputs \nthat vary between the two\
    \ systems (labor, water and \nenergy), fruit price, and yield data from the technologies\
    \ \nin comparison. Even if it is challenging to assign monetary \nvalue to inputs\
    \ and outputs from a trial as noted in (Ehui \nand Rey) an attempt has been made\
    \ to calculate relevant \nbenefits and costs. \nRESULTS \nThe first part of this\
    \ section presents estimated cost of \nthe USERPA system along with price and\
    \ yield data. The \nsecond part presents result from partial budget analysis \n\
    of USERPA drawing from data on the experimental field \nof apple orchard in Switzerland.\
    \ \nCost and revenue estimation\nTo be able to use the full functionality of USERPA\
    \ \nFMIS requires several sensors (Tsiropoulos and Fountas, \n2016). Cost estimates\
    \ based on data for the experimental \nsite based on measurements taken in 2014\

    \ With 10 hours per day and 5 days a \nweek available for lab measurements, a\
    \ unit of lab sensor \nis estimated to be enough for about 203 hectares of \n\
    orchard at 90% use efficiency. \nFrom the reported purchase price of the physical\
    \ \ntechnologies in USERPA, a 30% reduction is assumed \nin the analysis based\
    \ on project partners’ reflection \nthat the price of those devices will decline\
    \ in the future \nwith wide market penetration. Useful lifetime of the \ntechnologies\
    \ is assumed to be 10 years. Cost per hectare \nis estimated combining information\
    \ on actual/expected/ \ncost of devices, literature, intuition and assumptions.\
    \ In \nthe analysis, relevant operating costs are also included. \nFollowing the\
    \ guidelines in (Kime et al., 2016), ownership \n(fixed) cost items of insurance,\
    \ housing, and repair and \nmaintenance are estimated as 0.5%, 1% and 5% of \n\
    average value of investment. Housing and insurance costs \nare added only for\
    \ the mobile platform. Staff training cost \nand changes in energy consumption\
    \ in relation to data \ncollection, irrigation and harvest due to the proposed\
    \ \nsystem are also considered. In Table 5, fixed cost includes \nrepair and maintenance,\
    \ insurance and housing cost.\nFor the revenue estimation, price data obtained\
    \ \nfrom the case farm owner and yield assumption based \non information provided\
    \ by project partners are used. In \n2013 the price of premium, first and second\
    \ choice apple \nfruits was 1.134, 1.044, 0.378 €/kg (equivalent of 1.26, \n1.16\
    \ and 0.42 CHF/kg at an exchange rate of 0.9 €/CHF) \nrespectively. According\
    \ to Dominique Fluery, on average \nper hectare apple yield in Switzerland is\
    \ 45 hectares \n(email correspondence on 1 July 2015). In the analysis, a \nconservative\
    \ estimate of 35 kg per hectare is used. \nResults from partial budget analysis\n\
    Chosen performance indicators to evaluate the \neconomic viability of the proposed\
    \ technology as \ncompared to farmer practice are NPV, IRR and Benefit-\nCost\
    \ Ratio. Annualized net benefit estimates (ANB) are \nalso presented where necessary.\
    \ USERPA under the \nMODERATE scenario is estimated to have an IRR of 6.12 \n\
    % and generate a net benefit of €843 in present value \nover a period of ten years\
    \ equivalent to 69 € per hectare \nper year in annualized terms.\nIn Table 6,\
    \ comparison of results for selected use \ncapacity of non-fixed sensors is provided.\n\
    The PBA results from estimated use capacity by \nsensor type and that of 75 ha\
    \ for all portable devices \nalike are comparable. Comparison of results by scenario\
    \ \nfor a hypothetical 75 ha farm is presented in Table 7 \nas an example. To\
    \ break-even under the MODERATE \nscenario, a unit of portable sensor needs to\
    \ be used for \na minimum of about 53 hectares of orchard. USERPA is \nnot economically\
    \ justifiable under the LOW scenario as \nreflected by the negative net present\
    \ value and an IRR \nless than the discount rate.\nSensitivity of the PBA results\
    \ (MODERATE scenario) \nto key parameters of interest, i.e., wage rate, water\
    \ price, \nfruit price and cost of sensor devices was assessed. \nTable 6. Comparison\

    1018\nFigure 3. Sensitivity of NPV for change in parameters of interest \nFigure\
    \ 3 depicts estimated change in NPV due to \nspecified percentage changes in three\
    \ parameters, i.e., \nwater price, sensor cost and fruit price. A small change\
    \ in \nthe use capacity of fixed sensors results in a considerably \nbig effect\
    \ on the economic feasibility of the proposed \nsystem. A 1% increase (decrease)\
    \ in wage rate resulted \nin about 2.3% decrease (increase) in net present value\
    \ \nof adopting USERPA relative to conventional practice. \nThe negative sign\
    \ for the effect of wage is because the \nestimated present value of labor cost\
    \ in USERPA is positive \nunlike that of water cost. On the other hand, marginal\
    \ \nchanges in the cost of sensors and price of fruit are found \nto have an important\
    \ bearing on the PBA results. A 1% \nincrease in sensor cost reduces NPV by about\
    \ 16%. This \nbig impact of change in sensor cost on the NPV reflects \nthat the\
    \ USER-PA system is capital-intensive in relation \nto other costs. High capital\
    \ cost is of course a main issue \nin economic feasibility of irrigation systems\
    \ (DeJonge et \nal., 2007).\nUnder \nMODERATE \nscenario, \nthe \nproposed \n\
    technology is only marginally economically justified if \nthe cost of sensors\

    \ net benefit of the proposed system. As for the \neffect of change in fruit price,\
    \ a 1% change brings about \n20% change in NPV. Given that a quality differentiated\
    \ \nprice regime instead of an average price is used, the \neffect of change in\
    \ price needs to be closely considered \nin relation to assumptions on quality\
    \ gain while making \ncomparisons across scenarios.\nDISCUSSION \nSome encouraging\
    \ results have been observed from \nthe project particularly in increasing awareness\
    \ on the \npotential of FMIS to improve farm management. Results \nfrom a survey\
    \ intended to elicit user satisfaction of the \nUSERPA FMIS show promising potential\
    \ for commercial \nadoption of the project’s FMIS (Tsiropoulos and Fountas, \n\
    2016). The owner and manager of the experimental farm \nalso adjusted his irrigation\
    \ with 20% up and down from \nETP recommendations provided by local metrological\
    \ \nagency in the 2015 production season after having \nstopped except trying\
    \ with it for a while. Though the \noptimality of this adjustment is still questionable,\
    \ it is \nencouraging that the farmer combined decision support \nwith own perception\
    \ and experience in his irrigation \nmanagement. This change in management behavior\
    \ is \nmore likely triggered by increased awareness through \nrepeated discussions\
    \ with the USERPA project partners \nabout the potential benefit of decision support\
    \ tools. \nIn this study it is expected that precise data analyzed \nwith adaptive\
    \ decision support tools enables precise \nmanagement which can be inferred mainly\
    \ from yield \nOriginal scientific paper\nDOI: /10.5513/JCEA01/20.3.2160\nTamirat\

    1019\nquality and optimal resource use. Based on evidence for \norganic farming\
    \ (Bravin et al., 2009), it could reasonably \nbe expected that for a given quality\
    \ level, apple fruits \nproduced in a precision management framework \nwould receive\
    \ higher prices than those by conventional \nsystem partly for environmental friendliness\
    \ of their \nproduction and partly for perceived ‘healthiness of the \nfruits’\
    \ by optimum input use. In Switzerland, the existing \nconsiderable difference\
    \ in price across quality grades \ncould be an incentive for farmers to hit the\
    \ margin and \nget their produce in a desired quality regime. From the \ncost\
    \ side, optimal resource use contributes to minimizing \ncost. \nIn the case of\
    \ Switzerland, where farmers tend to \nover-irrigate possibly due to relatively\
    \ plenty rainfall \nadded to availability of cheap and easily accessible \nwater,\
    \ direct economic value from water cost saving may \nnot be considerable to an\
    \ individual farmer. However, \nin temperate and humid climates where irrigation\
    \ is \nsupplemental to rainfall, precision irrigation can offer other \nbenefits\
    \ such as scope for more effective use of rainfall, \nhelp reduce the non-beneficial\
    \ losses associated with \nirrigation (deep drainage, nitrate leaching) and provide\
    \ \nfarmers with evidence to demonstrate environmentally \nsustainable practices\
    \ to processors and retailer (Daccache \net al., 2015). On the other hand, in\
    \ dry areas like Turkey and \nIsrael, stringent deficit treatment may not be feasible\
    \ but \na marginal saving in water use could bring considerable \neconomic and\
    \ also environmental value and help release \nscarce water for other uses or other\
    \ farms. \nMajor share of the cost of the USERPA system is \ninitial investment\
    \ cost required to buy the sensors and \nthe robotic (mobile) platform and establish\
    \ the FMIS. \nLab sensors and mobile sensors could be used for \nlarger farm size.\
    \ Some of the handheld devices such as \nporometer and pressure-bomb are mainly\
    \ meant for \ncalibration and augmenting measurements done by other \nsensors\
    \ and hence may be excluded from the package. \nAs commented in the data section,\
    \ some of the sensors \nare yet to be adapted for agricultural use and they are\
    \ \nlikely to be cheaper. Net reduction in labor cost could \nalso be possible\
    \ from using the proposed management \nsystem. Furthermore, as many of the operating\
    \ costs \n(e.g., platform integration, testing and calibration, data \nmanagement\
    \ and data analysis time) are less dependent \non the size of the farm in question,\
    \ much benefit can \nbe expected from big farm sizes. Potential net benefits \n\
    from the USERPA system are likely higher than estimated \nin this study. However,\
    \ effectiveness of management \ndecision in improving yield and quality also depends\
    \ on \nother behavioral and weather factors that have not been \naccounted for\
    \ in this study. \nThe sensitivity analysis shows that economic viability \nof\
    \ the proposed change from conventional practice is \nstrongly sensitive to change\
    \ in fruit price and sensor \ncost but less sensitive to wage rate and water price.\
    \ The \nrelatively low sensitivity of the PBA results to change in \nwage rate\
    \ could be due to low share of labor cost. In a \ndiscussion with the farmer,\
    \ however, it was learnt that \nlabor is a main consideration given that wage\
    \ rate is \ngenerally high in the Swiss market. \nA couple of remarks on the prospect\
    \ of the new system \nare of interest to mention here. With further refined \n\
    sensor integration and decision rules, sensor-triggered \n(automated) irrigation\
    \ which helps to save considerable \nlabor time while at the same time minimizing\
    \ crop stress \n(e.g., labor time hold-up in field irrigation, manual data \n\
    collection, manual data analysis, interpreting DSS results \nand making decision)\
    \ will be possible. In addition, the \nsystem may be adapted to use in other crops\
    \ (e.g., grapes, \npeers, peach, lemon, potato), other areas, and include \nother\
    \ management operations like fertilizer management, \npest and weed management.\

    \ irrigation and harvest management in orchards: an economic...\n1020\nTo quantify\
    \ the changes in benefit and cost associated \nwith the USERPA technology as compared\
    \ to conventional \npractice, partial budget analysis in a standard discounted\
    \ \ncash flow framework is adopted. The analysis considers \nonly private economic\
    \ benefit accruing to the farmer. At \na large scale, environmental benefits and\
    \ peer-learning \neffects among farmers would generate extra social \nbenefits\
    \ which have not been accounted for in this study.\nMainly focusing on irrigation\
    \ management, relevant \nscenarios were developed considering precipitation, \n\
    weather variability and within field variabilities. Under \nthe assumptions maintained\
    \ and based on data from the \nexperimental field, the proposed technology is\
    \ found to \nproduce a positive and considerable net benefit under \nMODERATE\
    \ and HIGH scenarios. Hence, decisions to \nadopt the system should account for\
    \ particular features \nof the farm and the weather condition assuming same \n\
    cost of capital investment. Besides, given that the net \neconomic benefit of\
    \ the proposed system is very sensitive \nto fruit price and capital cost of investment,\
    \ target market \nconditions need be closely considered in the decision to \n\
    adopt this system.\nThe fact that initial investment cost occurs at the \nbeginning\
    \ of the adoption of a technology or change in \npractice whereas benefits are\
    \ distributed across project \nlife makes it difficult to precisely estimate the\
    \ net benefit \nfrom going for a proposed change. An effort has been \nmade to\
    \ incorporate important aspects in the analysis \nmaking working assumptions where\
    \ necessary. The \nresults provide important insight into what on average \ncan\
    \ be expected of from using the technology and how \nit compares with conventional\
    \ practice. The authors wish \nto remind the reader that the results are dependent\
    \ on \nthe working assumptions made behind the estimation. \nTherefore, the results\
    \ presented need be treated with \ncare and within the context analyzed.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\

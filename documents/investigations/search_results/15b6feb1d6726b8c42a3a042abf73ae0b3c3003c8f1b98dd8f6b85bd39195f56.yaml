    have invested in the agriculture sector, specifically in agricultural technology.
    Irrigation remains a crucial input to agriculture, and the lack of access to supplemental
    irrigation aggravates the distress of farmers, particularly, smallholders. Crop
    simulation models use parameters like crop characteristics, environmental conditions
    and management practices in combination with the local input data, to compute
    the ''yield response of crops to water'', to better inform irrigation decision-making,
    for saving resources and/or increasing yield. Soil moisture data can be critical
    to develop more representative crop models by influencing soil hydraulic parameter
    estimation, and consequently improving the simulation of soil water movement.
    The dearth of cost-effective soil moisture sensors is a limitation to their effective
    incorporation in crop modelling, but calibrating them against primary or secondary
    standards can expand their scope of application. This study applies different
    calibration techniques on the low-cost capacitance based soil moisture sensor,
    Spectrum SM100. Calibration techniques include segmented linear regression, polynomial
    regression, spline regression, and machine learning algorithms such as support
    vector regression, random forest regression, multi-layer perceptron, extreme learning
    machine and support vector categorization. Independent soil moisture data are
    taken as both continuous and categorical variables, are calibrated both in the
    laboratory and field, and validated using field data. Field data is obtained from
    an experimental field in Kanpur (India) during a wheat cropping season in 2018.
    The experimental site is representative of an intensively managed rural landscape
    in the Ganga river basin, India. The calibrated soil moisture data are subsequently
    used in the  crop-water productivity model FAO Aquacrop to tune its soil hydraulic
    properties. Various models are developed with soil hydraulic parameter sets estimated
    using the calibrated soil moisture data. The respective performances of these
    models are compared with the default model performance (with parameters derived
    from the literature), based on outputs of interest such as above ground biomass,
    crop yield and water use efficiency. A representative crop model is then used
    to develop scenarios of irrigation scheduling, with varying degrees of water stress.
    Results indicate that calibrating the soil moisture sensors in laboratory conditions
    alone is not sufficient to parameterize soil hydraulic properties, and adequate
    parameterization requires sensor calibration in field conditions. Further, a cost-benefit
    analysis is conducted to assess and critically discuss the tradeoffs between the
    cost of soil moisture monitoring and the obtained crop yield. How to cite: Adla,

    Get rights and content Highlights • The study examined whether morphophysiological
    traits (e.g., Ψ) of drought stressed grapevines might be assessed by imaging.
    • Non-destructive image-based method for the prediction of leaf area in drought
    stressed vines (R2 = 0.92) is presented. • The Dark Green fraction colour class
    correlates (R2 = 0.71) with Ψ. • Data presented support the development of affordable
    phenotyping and standardization of protocols. Abstract This study examined whether
    morphophysiological traits (i.e., leaf area, plant water consumption, leaf water
    potential) of drought stressed grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) might be determined
    through the use of non-destructive RGB and NIR image-based analysis techniques
    for possible implementation of affordable phenotyping. The study was carried out
    at a centre which is part of the European Plant Phenotyping Network (EPPN) also
    aiming at contribute to the standardisation of phenotyping protocols. Four groups
    of 20 potted vines each were subjected to various irrigation treatments restoring
    100% (control), 75% (IRR75%), 50% (IRR50%) and 25% (IRR25%) of their daily water
    consumption within a 22-day period of drought imposition. Leaf gas exchanges,
    leaf water potential (Ψ), photosystem II efficiency (Fv/Fm), RGB and NIR data
    were simultaneously collected during drought imposition. Values of Ψ in IRR25%
    vines reached −1.2 MPa pre-dawn, in turn stomatal conductance and net photosynthetic
    rate reached values as low as approx. 0.02 mol H2O m−2 s–1 and 1.0 μmol CO2 m−2 s–1,
    respectively. Through a cross-validation analysis, this study modelled (R2 = 0.78)
    the estimation of plant canopy area based on the number of pixel of RGB images
    of vines under various drought levels. Estimated leaf area was employed to calculate
    water consumption per unit leaf area, which resulted correlated (R2 = 0.86) with
    Ψ. Results revealed a correlation between Ψ and Dark Green colour class (R2 = 0.71)
    and suggest a new working hypothesis concerning the phenotyping of leaf (or petiole)
    angle. NIR and Dark Green colour fraction decreased with increasing levels of
    drought while the Yellow one increased. The outcomes presented may strengthen
    the role of RGB and NIR based images to identify the occurrence of water-stress
    in Vitis spp. and contribute to both the standardisation of phenotyping protocols
    pursued by the global phenotyping community and the possible development of new
    tools for precision irrigation in a HTP domain. Previous article in issue Next

    gas exchangesWater potentialWater stress 1. Introduction Drought occurrence is
    expected to increase in some cultivated areas due to future uncertainty in precipitations
    resulting mainly from climate changes, this in turn will reduce stock of freshwater
    for irrigated agricultural sector (IPCC, 2013; Ronco et al., 2017) requiring adaptation
    strategies including improved on-farm irrigation management. Although drought
    occurrence negatively influence certain plant performances (e.g., fruit size,
    carbon gain) (Miller et al., 1998; Shackel, 2007), the exposure of plant to drought
    might favour fruit quality traits depending on timing, intensity, duration of
    drought and crop species (Chaves et al., 2010; Herrero-Langreo et al., 2018).
    For instance, in grape berries the amount of key quality pigments (e.g., total
    anthocyanins) measured at harvest is higher in drought stressed vines compared
    to well irrigated ones (Acevedo-Opazo et al., 2010). Hence, irrigation management
    might potentially be relevant for both the conservation of natural resources (through
    water saving) and increased quality of product. In addition to real time soil
    moisture probes, the measurements of several in vivo plant physiological parameters
    have been proposed for irrigation schedule including sap flow, stomatal conductance,
    leaf turgor pressure, shrinkage of stem/fruit, leaf (or stem) water potential
    (Ψ) (Fernández, 2017). Some of these crop (i.e., soil and plant) parameters are
    collectively feeding most of the irrigation decision support systems now increasingly
    accepted by growers due to their decreasing price; however sensor reliability
    is still perceived as a weakness (Lichtenberg et al., 2015). Leaf water potential
    is a reliable plant water status indicator for irrigation scheduling but its application
    at large scale (e.g., commercial field) is hampered by the high costs (including
    time) needed for timely and adequately representative Ψ determinations (Girona
    et al., 2006; De Bei et al., 2011). Hence, a wider adoption of Ψ as irrigation
    schedule tool might be boosted by the development of easy accessible, accurate
    and low-cost proxy of Ψ. Precision agriculture is challenging the reduction of
    environmental impact of practices and the improvement of product quality through
    a series of smart tools including plant phenotyping as supported by image analysis
    techniques (Fiorani and Schurr, 2013). In this context, some recently developed
    high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) innovations including unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAV), robotised platforms and colour image-derived indices are promising tools
    for irrigation managing purpose (Berger et al., 2010; Gago et al., 2017; Diago
    et al., 2018). However, the infrastructure and man-labour cost as well as skills
    for operational HTP are debatable highlighting the importance of “affordable phenotyping”
    (Reynolds et al., 2018). Recently, the estimation of the vineyard water status
    using multispectral imagery from an UAV platform and machine learning algorithm
    based on artificial neural networks have been proposed (Poblete et al., 2017;
    Romero et al., 2018; Fernández-Novales et al., 2018) but encompassing relatively
    complex procedures to the extent that the combination of several (up to 13) vegetation
    indices were needed. This complexity might slow its large scale diffusion (Rinaldi
    and He, 2014). According to this view it makes sense to evoke Rapaport et al.
    (2015) who developed water balance indices able to predict Ψ based on reflectance
    values at specific wavelengths (1 nm spectral resolution). However, it seems there
    is room to expand affordable phenotyping of Ψ. Automated phenotyping of plant
    stress responses are mainly based on red-green-blue (RGB), fluorescence, near
    infrared (NIR) (e.g. Casadesús et al., 2017; Harbinson et al., 2012; Diago et
    al., 2018) and thermal IR imaging systems (e.g. Grant et al., 2007; Cohen et al.,
    2015; Bellvert et al., 2016; Gutiérrez et al., 2018), with RGB the most frequently
    used imaging module (Ge et al., 2016). In addition, RGB images have been used
    also at field scale to model canopy structure, plant growth, irrigation schedule,
    etc. thanks to their relatively low-cost and wide accessibility as seen by the
    use of even smartphone cameras (see Reynolds et al., 2018 for review). However
    specific information on RGB-based images and Ψ correlation in Vitis spp. are not
    adequately explored. Therefore, this study examined whether Ψ of grapevines subjected
    to drought would be correlated to RGB and NIR images. Nowadays phenotyping biotic
    and abiotic stress is growing fast and standardisation of phenotyping protocols
    is becoming a common challenge (van Eeuwijk et al., 2019) where making parallel
    measurements of physiological and phenomic traits are highly desirable particularly
    under drought stress. Hence, in this study physiological traits (e.g., leaf gas
    exchanges, efficiency of photosystem II, plant water consumption) were simultaneously
    monitored along with Ψ and RGB and NIR images acquisition. Leaf area (LA) represents
    almost the entire plant transpiring surface directly influencing plant water consumption
    and therefore it is a classical key parameter for irrigation management embedded
    as crop coefficient within crop water balance calculations (Doorenbos and Pruitt,
    1977). Hence, a non-destructive estimation of LA might assist in defining HTP-based
    protocols for drought management. For this reason this study also aimed at improving
    LA estimation through RGB-based images and to test whether water consumption per
    unit of estimated LA correlates with Ψ of progressively drought stressed vines.
    2. Materials and methods 2.1. Plant material and experimental design The experiment
    was carried out at the ALSIA ‘Metapontum Agrobios’ Research Centre, located at
    Metaponto, Southern Italy (N 40° 23′ E 16° 47′) during the 2017 growing season
    under unheated and not-conditioned greenhouse conditions. A total of 80 3-year
    old own-rooted vines (cv Aleatico) were grown in a white 3.5 l PVC pot covered
    with plastic film to minimise direct evaporation of water from soil. The substrate
    was a 3:1 v/v mixture of sandy loam soil (82% sand, 7% silt and 11% clay) and
    peat. At 15, 30 and 45 days after bud-break (early March) the vines were fertilised
    with a NPK fertiliser 14.7.14 (Slowenne 212, Valagro Spa, Atessa, Italy) at a
    dose of 3 g per pot. From bud-break till the first day of irrigation treatment
    application (21st of April, hereafter referred as “day 0”) all vines were fully
    irrigated. Vines were weighed every evening and 100% of the amount of water transpired
    daily was added to keep soil moisture at field capacity. The vines were trained
    with single main shoot and tied to a wooden stick supports, note that the wooden
    stick was painted blue in order facilitate image segmentation and data analysis.
    The vines had approx. 15–20 leaves each. Before the imposition of drought stress
    the reference weight at the field capacity was determined by fully irrigating
    each pot and then allowing the water to drain for 12 h until a stable weight was
    reached. At day 0, vines were grouped (×20 vines each) and for the 22 days after
    drought imposition (DADI), irrigation (IRR) was modulated by restoring 100% (control),
    75% (IRR75%), 50% (IRR50%) and 25% (IRR25%) of the daily water consumption. Air
    temperature (°C) and relative humidity (%RH) (HUMITER 50Y, Vaisala, Helsinki,
    Finland) and PAR (PPFD, μmol m−2 s–1) (quantum sensor Model SKP 215, Skye Instruments
    LTD, Llandrindod, Wells, UK) were measured inside the greenhouse at 15 min intervals,
    having hourly averages recorded (CR200, Campbell Scientific Inc., Utah, USA).
    The air vapour pressure deficit (VPD) was then calculated from the records of
    air temperature and relative humidity, according to Goudriaan and van Laar (1994).
    2.2. Plant-phenotyping A group of 4–5 vines per irrigation treatment (the same
    used for the physiological determinations, see below) were imaged pre-dawn (04:00-05:00 h
    solar time) and midday (12:00-13:00 h) at 0, 3, 6, 11, 14, 19 and 22 DADI using
    a LemnaTec 3D Scanalyzer phenotyping platform (LemnaTec GmbH, Aachen, Germany).
    Vines were automatically conveyed into the imaging chambers in which they were
    stopped for image acquisition. The NIR chamber was equipped with NIR cameras sensitive
    to wavelength 900–1700 nm (Vosskühler GmbH NIR-300PGE) with the 790 kilopixel
    resolution. The Visible light chamber for the RGB image acquisition was equipped
    with 2 megapixel Visible light cameras (Basler Scout scA1600-14gc). Lighting conditions
    inside the chambers were achieved by halogen lamps (Radium Ralogen PAR16 35 W)
    for the NIR chamber and fluorescent tubes (Osram T5FH 21 W 865 HE) for the Visible
    light chamber. A schematic representation of the plant phenotyping platform set
    up is reported in Fig. 1. For each chamber 3 images were acquired, one from above
    the plant (Top View, TV) and 2 from the lateral at an orthogonal angle (0° and
    90 °Side View, SV). The image segmentation and analysis were performed using the
    software LemnaGrid v5 following Arvidsson et al. (2011). The LemnaGrid software
    v5 operated a colour classification of the RGB images in Dark Green, Green, Yellow
    and Brown colour class according to Acosta-Gamboa et al. (2017). Two anchor points
    (RGB colour values) per colour class were identified as follow: Dark Green R126
    G134 B68, R116 G123 B75; Green R156 G170 B87, R150 G177 B73; Yellow R255 G242

    and conveyor is reported. 2.3. Leaf gas exchange and chlorophyll a (Chl-a) fluorescence
    Net photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs) and transpiration (E) rate
    per unit leaf area were measured midday (11:30-12:30 h) at day 0, 3, 6, 8, 10,
    11, 13, 14, 20 and 22 DADI using a portable photosynthesis system Li-Cor 6400
    (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). During leaf gas exchange measurements temperature
    and CO2 concentration were maintained at the prevailing environmental condition,
    PAR inside the cuvette fixed at 800 μmol m−2 s–1 and the operating flow rate at
    500 μmol s−1. Gas exchange measurements were performed on 4–5 vines per irrigation
    treatment on two fully expanded leaves per vine selected from the mid-region (fourth/fifth
    node) of shoot. On the same leaf used for leaf gas exchange measurements, Chl-a
    fluorescence was measured pre-dawn (04:00–05:00 h) and midday (11:30–12:30 h)
    through a portable chlorophyll fluorometer (PAM- 2500, Heinz Walz GmbH, Effeltrich,
    Germany). Leaves were 45 min dark-adapted (leaf clip DLC-8 Walz GmbH, Effeltrich,
    Germany) before midday measurements. The basal (F0) and maximal (Fm) Chl-a fluorescence
    were collected by applying a brief saturating light pulse (5000 μmol m−2 s–1 PAR)
    and used to calculate the variable fluorescence (Fv = Fm − F0). The maximum quantum
    yield of photosystem (PS) II (Fv/Fm) was then calculated (Maxwell and Johnson,
    2000). 2.4. Stem water potential and soil moisture At 0, 3, 11, 14 and 22 DADI
    the stem water potential (Ψ) was measured pre-dawn (ΨPD) (04:00–05:00 h) and at
    midday (ΨMD) (12:00–13:00 h) on fully expanded leaves (2 per vine) immediately
    above those used for gas exchanges by means of a pressure chamber (Model 600,
    PMS Instruments, Corvallis, OR), pressurised with N2 according to the protocol
    by Turner (1981). For the ΨMD determination leaves were covered with aluminium
    foil at least 90 min before measurements were taken. The leaves used for the Ψ
    determinations were then collected for leaf area measurement (see below). After
    the ΨMD measurements, from the same pots soil samples were collected for soil
    moisture determination (% of dry weight) according to Black (1965). 2.5. Estimation
    and evolution of leaf area Leaf area of vines was modelled using the RGB images
    collected for plant phenotyping (see above) determining the number of “plant object
    pixels” here referred as the projected shoot area (PSA) following a procedure
    similar to that of Hairmansis et al. (2014): (1) PSA = Npix 0 °SV + Npix 90 °SV + 0.3 × Npix
    TV(pixel) where “Npix 0 °SV” and “Npix 90 °SV” is the number of pixels corresponding
    to the plant object area of two orthogonal side-view images, while TV represents
    the number of pixel of the top view image. The pixel numbers were retrieved from
    the RGB images employing an image analysis pipeline developed using the LemnaGrid
    v5 software (Petrozza et al., 2014). The RGB images for the PSA determination
    were collected midday on a total of 61 vines randomly selected within each irrigation
    treatment at day 3, 11, 14 and 22 after the initiation of drought stress. After
    the image collection vines were manually defoliated and leaf area measured (LA)
    (LI-3100 leaf area meter, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Note that pixel number and
    area of leaves used for Ψ determination were also included for PSA and LA determinations.
    The estimated plant leaf area (LA’) was modelled using a linear model (LA’ = a
    × PSA+b) developed from the paired PSA and LA data subjected to a cross-validation
    analysis. That is, from the whole set of 45 paired values of LA and PSA, 10-fold
    were selected at random with replacement, each fold containing 36 paired values
    (i.e. 80% of the total) on which the model was trained. The remaining 20% was
    used for testing purposes. According to Diago et al. (2012) the LA’ model was
    then validated using another set of grapevine RGB images collected on additional
    16 vines and its accuracy determined through the correlation coefficient R2 between
    actual leaf area and LA’. Evolution of LA’ in each irrigation treatment was non-destructively
    determined via imaging using the same 4–5 individual vines per irrigation treatment
    at 0, 3, 6, 9, 11, 14, 19, and 22 DADI and calculating the mean PSA per treatment
    through eq. 1. 2.6. Specific vine water consumption On the same vine used for
    Ψ determination the vine water consumption was determined by weighing the pots
    every evening. The weight of the previous day was used as a reference to determine
    daily water loss from each plant. Then values were normalised per unit of LA’
    and reported as g H2O cm−2 d-1. 2.7. Data analysis The statistical analysis was
    performed using R software (3.3.2 version) package ‘agricolae’ (de Mendiburu,
    2016), plotting and fitting were by OriginPro 9.3 (OriginLab Corporation, USA).
    Data were reported as mean and standard error of the mean (±SE). A one-way ANOVA
    was used to examine the differences between irrigation treatments at each sampling
    date, the differences among means were identified by Tukey’s Honest Significance
    Difference (HSD) post-hoc tests; p values <0.05 were considered significant. 3.
    Results and discussion This study was carried out at a robotised plant phenotyping
    platform and examined the influence of vine water status (as assessed through
    Ψ) on simultaneously measured physiological and phenomic traits of grapevine expanding
    knowledge on HTP tools for vine performance assessment sensu Großkinsky et al.
    (2015). 3.1. Physiological and morphometric drought response Soil moisture in
    well watered pots was stable around 35% dw during the experiment, while it progressively
    declined in drought stressed pots from the 3rd DADI becoming significantly different
    from that of control ones by 11 DADI (Fig. 2). At the end of experiment, soil
    moisture reached values close to 10% (IRR25%), 14% (IRR50%) and 21% (IRR75%) (Fig.
    2). Such soil moisture variation among treatments is similar to that observed
    by Sivilotti et al. (2005) in a pot experiment. Values of ΨPD ranged from approx.
    −0.2 (control vine) to a minimum of approx. −0.8 (IRR50%) and −1.15 MPa (IRR25%)
    detected at 22 DADI, while in vines receiving 75% of daily water consumption ΨPD
    remained close to −0.2 MPa throughout the experiment similarly to that of control
    vines (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download

    sign of drought imposition at 11 DADI as at this stage the ΨMD of various treatments
    differed significantly from that of control while at the same day the ΨPD was
    significantly differentiated only for the IRR25% treatment (Fig. 3). Hence, it
    appears that ΨMD is more informative than ΨPD in revealing changes in vine water
    status at least under the present experimental conditions. From the 11th DADI
    onward ΨMD further decreased reaching the lowest value in IRR25% (−1.3 MPa) at
    the last day of the experiment when both IRR50% and IRR75% were close to −1 MPa
    (Fig. 3). For the IRR75% treatment, the amount of water restored each day allowed
    an over-night recovery of plant water status as documented by their ΨPD that approached
    the values of well irrigated vines. Likely a longer or drier drought period would
    be required to induce a significant decline of ΨPD in IRR75% compared to control
    vine. Both ΨPD and ΨMD patterns recall similar trends previously observed in grapevines
    subjected to water stress (Poni et al., 2014). Despite this being an “in-pot experiment”,
    based on the trends of Ψ the water withhold procedure should be considered slow
    enough to let vines to adapt to soil moisture depletion in terms of drought related
    changes to leaf water content and pigments (e.g., chlorophyll, xanthophylls) which
    may influence leaf reflectance (Palliotti et al., 2015). The level of net photosynthetic
    rate recorded in well irrigated vines was similar to that of 6-8-year old field
    grown grapevines (Chaves et al., 2010) oscillating around the mean value of 12.3
    μmol CO2 m−2 s–1 throughout the experiment (Fig. 4A). Drought-induced variations
    of A were considerably in accordance with that of gs, however for the IRR25% group
    the initial decline of A detected within the early 11 DADI was more smooth than
    that of gs (Fig. 4A and C). This was likely due to an improved intrinsic water
    use efficiency occurred for the most drought stressed treatment (Poni et al.,
    2007). Download : Download high-res image (409KB) Download : Download full-size

    3.8 (6 DADI) to 9.9 mmol H2O m−2 s–1 (22 DADI) (Fig. 4B) mainly due to changes
    in VPD that peaked at ∼2 and ∼4 kPa at 6 and 22 DADI, respectively (Fig. 5). Particularly,
    at the beginning of drought imposition (between 6 and 11 DADI) values of E for
    control, IRR75% and IRR50% treatments transiently declined because of lower VPD
    (Fig. 5). On average maximum air temperature ranged from approx. 26 to 28 °C even
    though it was 3–4 °C lower at 0, 6, 8 and 20 DADI, maximum midday irradiance level
    was always above 1000 μmol m−2 s–1 PAR is day 8 and 20 DADI are excepted (Fig.

    differences in leaf transpiration detected among treatments reflect a typical
    down-regulated behaviour of E dependent upon the imposed irrigation treatment
    (Fig. 4B) (Medrano et al., 2003). Stomatal conductance in well irrigated grapevines
    was stable at approx. 0.3 mol H2O m−2 s–1 throughout the experiment excepting
    a transient decrease at 11 DADI (Fig. 4C). In severely drought stressed grapevines
    (IRR25%) the gs significantly declined after the 3rd DADI and it sharply reached
    a value ∼80% lower than that of control vines at 6 DADI. Thereafter the gs of
    IRR25% further declined toward the minimum value reached by 11 DADI where it remained
    until the end of the experiment (Fig. 4C). The influence of reduced irrigation
    on gs was similar for IRR50% and IRR75% showing a gradual reduction during the
    early 10 DADI when a gs value of ∼35% of that of well irrigated was reached (Fig.
    4C). During the remaining period of the experiment (from 11 to 22 DADI) gs values
    recorded in IRR75% grapevines were approx. 40% of that of control ones, while
    in IRR50% vines the gs was similar to that of IRR25% ones (Fig. 4C) remaining
    below the threshold of 0.05 mol H2O m−2 s–1 that identifies severe drought condition
    sensu Cifre et al. (2005). Interpretation of leaf gas exchange variations induced
    by different irrigation supply should also include the variations of plant water
    status in order to comprehensively argue key drought-related physiological issues
    and allow a wider usefulness of data. Hence, here leaf gas exchanges are also
    discussed in parallel with ΨMD allowing construction of a more comprehensive data
    set to potentially be associated to vine phenotyping. The decline of gs was able
    to regulate leaf transpiration and net photosynthetic rate across the ΨMD range
    recorded (Fig. 6A, B) confirming water loss and carbon gain mechanisms observed
    in drought stressed grapevines (Medrano et al., 2003). The reduction of gs determined
    by drought imposition followed the changes of ΨMD (Fig. 6C) accordingly to similar
    correlative information reported for both pot and open-field studies (Medrano
    et al., 2003; Cifre et al., 2005). In this study the efficiency of the PSII was
    not impaired by the drought imposition as suggested by the stable chlorophyll
    fluorescence (Fv/Fm) recorded throughout the experiment which were independent
    of the Ψ changes (Fig. 6D). That is, values of Fv/Fm measured across the approx.
    -0.15/-1.5 MPa range of Ψ remained close to 0.8 (Fig. 6D) which is believed the
    threshold for efficient PSII indicating that the reduction of net photosynthetic
    rates detected in drought stressed vines (Fig. 4A) was not metabolic as discussed
    in Montanaro et al. (2009). Hence, the unchanged Fv/Fm despite the worsening of
    Ψ confirms that fluorescence-based HTP has some limitations for the detection
    of water stress (Berger et al., 2010). Download : Download high-res image (346KB)

    Estimation of grapevine LA through non-destructive techniques has been the subject
    of several HTP studies mainly devoted to segmentation of various plant organs
    (e.g., bunch, leaf) for crop monitoring and breeding purposes (Diago et al., 2012;
    Costa et al., 2016). The present study expands information on LA estimation in
    grapevines subjected to various irrigation treatments being potentially useful
    at least in plant phenotyping platforms contributing to the definition of “standard
    conditions” (Pieruschka and Poorter, 2012). In order to continuously evaluate
    the impact of drought on vegetation development and in turn on vine water consumption
    a RGB-based methodology was implemented to estimate the growth of leaf area which
    is a morphometric trait intimately related to soil moisture and Ψ (Koundouras
    et al., 2008). Results show that the actual leaf area of vines and the number
    of pixels corresponding to the leaf surface determined through Eq. (1) were linearly
    correlated (R2 = 0.78) (Fig. 7). The resulting linear model (y = 416.11 + 0.915
    × PSA) was capable to predict (R2 = 0.92) the leaf area of a different set of
    grapevines (n = 16) (see the inset in Fig. 7). The cross-validated estimation
    of LA performed in this study consisted of data collected from vines under various
    irrigation levels improving previous similar models (e.g., Diago et al., 2012).

    the upper and lower 95% CI about the model. In the inset, predicted (LA’) vs measured
    leaf area (LA). Values of LA’ were calculated using the fitting linear equation
    resulting from the main plot on a different set of 16 vines. The LA’ of various
    irrigation treatments was not influenced early after drought application (Fig.
    8). At day 11 DADI, some significant differences were envisaged at least between
    IRR75% and the more severely drought stressed vines (IRR25%) (Fig. 8), unfortunately
    LA’ data for well irrigated vines were not available due to technical difficulties.
    Thereafter, control vine canopies showed significantly higher values than that
    of IRR25% and tend to be higher than that of IRR75% however differences were not
    always significant. At the end of the experimental period LA’ in well irrigated
    vines increased by approx. 85% of the initial value, while IRR75% vines consistently
    showed a growth as low as approx. 45% of the initial LA’ (Fig. 8). The IRR25%
    and IRR50% treatments had their highest LA’ increased similarly by approx. 20%
    of the initial value at 19 DADI (Fig. 8). However, LA’ was 6–9% at the end of
    experiment likely due to a sharp leaf fall triggered by the severe drought (Munné-Bosch
    and Alegre, 2004). Download : Download high-res image (182KB) Download : Download

    The slowdown of leaf growth in grapevines under drought is an adaptive trait (Poni
    et al., 2007) which was non-destructively detected in this study through the modelled
    leaf area allowing the identification of paired vine groups according to their
    ΨPD (i.e., control coupled with IRR75% versus IRR50% coupled with IRR25%). This
    study was not designed to detect the growth responses of various vegetative components
    (e.g., shoot, leaf) (see Pellegrino et al., 2008). However, results on the influence
    of water shortage on the overall leaf area growth are consistent with those reported
    by Gomez-del-Campo et al. (2002) for a similar experiment that was conducted using
    larger pots (35 L). Lanari et al. (2015) report a ∼70% reduced leaf area (destructively
    determined) in potted (4 L) grapevines receiving 40% of full irrigation after
    18 DADI. In the present experiment, leaf area in IRR25% vines was 40% lower than
    control 22 DADI when ΨMD was -1.3 MPa (Fig. 3, Fig. 8), unfortunately data on
    Ψ are not provided by Lanari et al. (2015) making deep comparisons challenging.
    The estimated leaf area was involved in the determination of daily water consumption
    which was on average 0.16 g H2O cm−2 d-1 in well irrigated vines and in drought
    stressed ones at the beginning of the experiment when ΨMD was in the -0.5/-0.3 MPa
    region, thereafter it declined by 85% when ΨMD reached -1.2 MPa (Fig. 9). Such
    a reduction is comparable to that reported by Medrano et al. (2012) for non-irrigated,
    field grown grapevines. Results show that specific water consumption responded
    to the drought-induced decline of ΨMD following an exponential decay pattern (R2 = 0.86)
    (Fig. 9) suggesting it might be a promising HTP tool for both plant water status
    and consumption determination. In addition, considering that values of vine water
    consumption were calculated on a vine basis (see Method section) it might support
    the calculation of some functional traits at vine scale (e.g., water use efficiency)
    thus avoiding criticisms related to their single-leaf assessment (Poni et al.,
    2014). Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size

    Note that the estimated leaf area refers to LA’ determined through the equation
    LA’ = 0.915*PSA+416.11 reported in Fig. 7. 3.2. RGB and NIR response to drought
    The RGB images sourced by Visible light cameras have great potential for morphological
    studies including leaf area estimation as shown in this study, nevertheless they
    are known to have some limitations in serving as a proxy for plant physiological
    traits (Großkinsky et al., 2015). The relatively weak correspondence between Ψ
    and some specific RGB colour class obtained in the present research partly supports
    that conclusion. That is, the Brown and Green colours data showed a poor correlation
    with Ψ as indicated by the values of R2 of 0.24 and 0.04, respectively (Fig. 10A,
    B). However, an improved correlation was achieved considering the Yellow colour
    class whose fraction linearly increased with lowering Ψ (R2 = 0.5) when vines
    becoming more stressed (Fig. 10C). The yellowing of foliage is a regulatory process
    leading to leaf senescence in response to ageing or environmental stresses including
    drought (Munné-Bosch and Alegre, 2004). Recently, the yellowing (or the loss of
    greenness) of leaf has been discussed as a promising digital tool for identification
    of drought resistant (or sensitive) annual crops (e.g., rice and sorghum) (Harris
    et al., 2017; Lingfeng et al., 2018). This supports the interpretation of the
    increasing franction of Yellow colour class being related to increasing drought
    (i.e., more negative Ψ) (Fig. 10C). Interestingly, the fraction of the Dark Green
    colour class showed the highest correlation with Ψ reaching R2 = 0.71 (Fig. 10D).
    Such a close correspondence between reducing pattern of the Dark Green colour
    class under increasing drought might be explained considering the putative increased
    leaf angle and in turn the increased exposure of the abaxial (lower) leaf surface
    occurring with drought. It makes sense to remember that the abaxial surface has
    a lighter colour compared to the adaxial (upper) one due to the presence of trichomes
    (Boso et al., 2010 and references therein). Download : Download high-res image

    water potential and the fraction of (A) Brown, (B) Green, (C) Yellow and (D) Dark
    Green colour classes, of the visible spectrum measured (●) pre-dawn and (○) midday
    on canopy of potted grapevines under various water status. Note that fitting lines
    refer to pooled midday and pre-dawn data, and that Brown and Dark Green values
    are reported in Log10 scale. Increased leaf lamina angle is among the plant drought
    defence mechanisms activated for PSII and water conservation reducing direct insolation
    and in turn temperature, conductance and transpiration of leaf (Palliotti et al.,
    2008; Jones et al., 2009). Incidentally, the stable Fv/Fm values recorded in well
    irrigated and drought stressed vines (Fig. 6D) might conceivably be associated
    with the protective increased leaf angle (i.e., leaf tends to be more vertical)
    in drought stressed leaves that most probably had occurred (Chaves et al., 2010).
    Inclination of leaf petiole from the vertical axis in grapevine might increase
    from 60–70° in well irrigated vines up to 120° in drought stressed ones (approx.
    −1.8 MPa, early morning) (Nuzzo, pers. com.). This interpretation is in line with
    the idea that some RGB images are useful to track morphological changes (Großkinsky
    et al., 2015), however the causal chain “drought→increased leaf angle→reduced
    Dark Green colour” deserves further study. The change of relative water content
    in leaf (i.e., the percentage of water present at the time of sampling, relative
    to the amount of water in a saturated leaf) is a reliable index of plant water
    status that linearly and closely correlates with Ψ in several species including
    Vitis (Smart and Bingham, 1974; Bota et al., 2004). Relative leaf water content
    is known as the most prominent parameter influencing leaf spectral reflectance
    and therefore non-destructively technologies including those based on NIR wavelengths,
    which are useful for plant water status monitoring (Seelig et al., 2008; Berger
    et al., 2010; Diago et al., 2018). Recently, the Ψ in grapevines subjected to
    drought has been modelled using portable NIR equipment to record diffuse reflectance
    spectra of the leaf surfaces by means of contact probes (De Bei et al., 2011;
    Tardaguila et al., 2017). Rapaport et al. (2015) combine information on spectral
    signatures collected with both portable spectrometer and cameras equipped with
    specific narrow-band filters to model Ψ at canopy level using a set of 4-leaf
    images. In the present study a contactless and image-based methodology has been
    used to collect NIR colour class at plant canopy scale which were correlated with
    Ψ (R2 = 0.44) even if a certain variability of NIR reflectance at a specific Ψ
    remain (Fig. 11). The potential influence on NIR reflectance exerted by other
    leaf traits linked to decreasing leaf water content such as leaf thickness (Seelig
    et al., 2008) and different signature of abaxial and adaxial surface (see discussion
    above) might help to explain such a variability. Results confirm the potential
    suitability of NIR colour class to be a proxy of Ψ within affordable phenotyping,
    however hyperspectral whole-canopy image-based NIR reflectance measurements in
    drought phenotyping studies might further strength the relationship between Ψ
    and NIR signatures in grapevines (Berger et al., 2010 Diago et al., 2017). Download

    NIR colour class measured (●) pre-dawn and (○) midday in canopy of potted grapevines
    under different water status. Midday and pre-dawn stem water potential data were
    pooled before the exponential decay fitting (y = 55 + 1.1576 × X -6.5497 × X2;
    Levenberg Marquardt iteration algorithm). This study reports correlative information
    between physiological traits and image-based HTP analysis for grapevines experiencing
    water shortage at a robotised plant phenotyping platform which is part of the
    EPPN (European Plant Phenotyping Network, https://eppn2020.plant-phenotyping.eu/EPPN2020_home).
    EPPN and the global phenotyping community are doing efforts toward the standardisation
    of phenotyping protocols offering training in HTP, broaden access to shared-usage
    HTP facilities, developing common data storage and standards for the design, analysis,
    and reporting of HTP data sets (van Eeuwijk et al., 2019). 4. Conclusions This
    study documents the suitability of the Dark Green colour class of the RGB spectrum
    to be a proxy for a relatively wide range of Ψ (from -0.2 down to -1.6 MPa) which
    would suggest a new study with the working hypothesis that leaf lamina (or petiole)
    angle can act as a HTP drought-induced trait. The monitoring of the LA’ evolution
    in vines under various drought levels might be a promising HTP tool to identify
    occurrence of water-stress combining both morphometric (leaf area) and physiological
    (water consumption) responses. RGB and NIR sensors have been used in this study
    confirming that easily accessible sensors might support possible implementation
    of affordable phenotyping (sensu Reynolds et al., 2018) and assist in developing
    new tools for precision irrigation in a HTP domain. The parallel results on leaf
    gas exchange, plant water status and on efficiency of PSII collected along with
    RGB and NIR images under known environmental conditions might collectively favour
    the standardisation of phenotyping protocols. Funding GM was supported by a RTDb

    proposed and applied to guide crop irrigation under stress (Briglia et al., 2019;
    Gu et al., 2021; Han et al., 2018). A plant-centric supply-demand dynamic (SDD)
    irrigation scheme was proposed based on co-regulated pattern and model simulations

    allows the plant breeders to select the best performing genotypes for breeding
    purposes so as to enhance the desired trait in a plant variety [1–4]. For example,
    a key interest of plant breeders nowadays is to pre-screen genotypes that can
    tolerate drought stress [6–9] due to climate change depleting water resources
    and increasing unpredictable drought events [7,8]. To do this, the breeder needs
    to find the best genotypes by exploring several candidate genotypes [1,10]. Show

    a time variable are selected as predictors. • Good fitting of predicted Ψpd is
    obtained with B-MARS, GBM, GAM, and BRNN models. • Good performance of the models
    is obtained for diverse training/testing conditions. Abstract In this study, hyperspectral
    reflectance (HySR) data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer were used to
    assess the water status of three grapevine cultivars in two sub-regions of Douro
    wine region during two consecutive years. A large set of potential predictors
    derived from the HySR data were considered for modelling/predicting the predawn
    leaf water potential (Ψpd) through different statistical and machine learning
    techniques. Three HySR vegetation indices were selected as final predictors for
    the computation of the models and the in-season time trend was removed from data
    by using a time predictor. The vegetation indices selected were the Normalized
    Reflectance Index for the wavelengths 554 nm and 561 nm (NRI554;561), the water
    index (WI) for the wavelengths 900 nm and 970 nm, and the D1 index which is associated
    with the rate of reflectance increase in the wavelengths of 706 nm and 730 nm.
    These vegetation indices covered the green, red edge and the near infrared domains
    of the electromagnetic spectrum. A large set of state-of-the-art analysis and
    statistical and machine-learning modelling techniques were tested. Predictive
    modelling techniques based on generalized boosted model (GBM), bagged multivariate
    adaptive regression splines (B-MARS), generalized additive model (GAM), and Bayesian
    regularized neural networks (BRNN) showed the best performance for predicting
    Ψpd, with an average determination coefficient (R2) ranging between 0.78 and 0.80
    and RMSE varying between 0.11 and 0.12 MPa. When cultivar Touriga Nacional was
    used for training the models and the cultivars Touriga Franca and Tinta Barroca
    for testing (independent validation), the models performance was good, particularly
    for GBM (R2 = 0.85; RMSE = 0.09 MPa). Additionally, the comparison of Ψpd observed
    and predicted showed an equitable dispersion of data from the various cultivars.
    The results achieved show a good potential of these predictive models based on
    vegetation indices to support irrigation scheduling in vineyard. Graphical abstract

    water deficit 1. Introduction The increasing scarcity of water, associated to
    a rising pressure over its use, makes paramount the improvement of water management
    in agriculture. Although in many regions of the Mediterranean basin the grapevines
    are traditionally non-irrigated, irrigation has developed in the last decades.
    The water supply to vines, particularly at critical phenological stages and using
    deficit irrigation strategies, influence vegetative and reproductive growth, fruit
    development, canopy temperature, CO2 assimilation, and consequently all plant
    metabolism. Therefore, irrigation and crop water status impact grape ripening
    and composition and consequently the wine color and flavor (Chaves et al., 2010,
    Serrano et al., 2010, Serrano et al., 2012). The timing and intensity of the grapevine
    response to water deficit (WD), with implications in irrigation management, greatly
    depends on genotype due to the constitutive differences in leaf gas-exchange,
    plant capacity to osmoregulate, and plant hydraulics (Chaves et al., 2010). Vineyards
    irrigation schedule is often supported by eco-physiological indicators of the
    plants response to WD, including leaf and stem water potential and stomatal conductance
    to water vapor (De Bei et al., 2011). These eco-physiological indicators integrate
    both the influence of environment (soil and atmosphere) and plant (internal hydraulic
    resistance) on vine water status (Rodrigues et al., 2012). On the contrary, the
    relationship of these indicators with the soil water content is often limited
    to specific environment/plant conditions because it varies with the soil type,
    the water distribution in the soil profile, the evaporative demand of the atmosphere,
    and the hydraulic resistances within the soil-plant system (Schultz and Stoll,
    2010). The predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd), based on the quasi equilibrium
    between the water potential of plants and soil measured before the sunrise, is
    considered a reliable indicator of vines water status and therefore widely used
    for irrigation scheduling (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2007, Serrano et al., 2010).
    Nevertheless, the requirement of a large number of Ψpd observations, necessary
    to accurately characterize a single vineyard plot, and the limited period of the
    day for the measurements, makes this eco-physiological approach to grapevine water
    status labor-intensive and time-consuming. In the last decades, hyperspectral
    reflectance (HySR) measurements have been considered for the assessment of crop
    water status, including in perennial crops (De Bei et al., 2011, Pôças et al.,
    2015, Rallo et al., 2014, Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2007, Serrano et al., 2012,
    Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). The near and mid infrared regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum are often considered for assessing crop water status due to the strong
    water absorption of radiation at 970 nm, 1200 nm, 1450 nm, 1930 nm, and 2500 nm
    wavelengths (Clevers et al., 2010, Peñuelas et al., 1993, Peñuelas et al., 1997,
    Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2007). The shortwave infrared region has also been used
    because the canopy temperature is considered an indicator of WD (Bellvert et al.,
    2014). Additionally, several studies have considered the use of spectral data
    from visible and near infrared (NIR) regions for detecting water status and WD
    in vineyards and olive groves (Pôças et al., 2015, Rallo et al., 2014, Rodríguez-Pérez
    et al., 2007, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). Hyperspectral data from the visible
    and NIR domains are more easily accessible from commonly available handheld spectroradiometers,
    as well as from satellite sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles (Zarco-Tejada et
    al., 2013). When using data from the visible spectral domains, the plant physiological
    response related with the content of plant pigments and the stomatal conductance
    are used as proxy for crop water status (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). Most of the
    mentioned studies focused on a single genotype and few study areas. Nevertheless,
    differences in leaf morpho-anatomy and related biochemistry, affecting photosynthesis,
    stomatal conductance and water use efficiency, have been reported among grapevine
    cultivars, thus differently affecting the cultivars response to WD (Chaves et
    al., 2010) and potentially impacting their hyperspectral response. Several spectral
    based approaches have been considered to retrieve a great variety of biophysical
    parameters of vegetation, including relative to crop water status. The most widely
    and easily used approach is based on vegetation indices, integrating information
    from specific regions/wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, thus only applying
    a small part of the spectral information (Pôças et al., 2015, Rodríguez-Pérez
    et al., 2007, Serrano et al., 2010, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). Differently, other
    approaches exploit the full spectrum information (Clevers et al., 2010, Doktor
    et al., 2014). When using full-spectrum HySR data, high dimensionality and autocorrelation
    between adjacent bands can occur. Therefore, data processing with the application
    of machine learning techniques based on a subset of predictors has been used to
    overcome this issue (Doktor et al., 2014). Additionally, this type of techniques
    is based on non-parametric and semi-parametric structures, with validation relying
    on prediction accuracy. Unlike traditional statistical methods, machine learning
    do not assume any particular structure of the relationship between the response
    (predicted) variable and the predictors (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). This characteristic
    is very useful to model complex and non-linear patterns, such as modelling functions
    for crop water status. Partial least squares regression (Wold et al., 1983), support
    vector machine (Drucker et al., 1997) and artificial neural networks (Ripley,
    1996) are some of the statistical and machine learning techniques more commonly
    used for deriving crop biophysical parameters from HySR data (Atzberger et al.,
    2010, Clevers et al., 2010, Yao et al., 2015). Nevertheless, other statistical
    techniques (e.g., based on semi- or non-parametric smooth functions) and/or machine
    learning algorithms (e.g., based on regression trees and rule-based predictive
    models) are also potentially interesting to extract information from HySR data,
    as reported in the bibliography. Among these techniques are included random forests
    (Breiman, 2001), cubist regression (derived from studies by Quinlan, 1992, Quinlan,
    1993), generalized linear models – GLM – and generalized additive models − GAM
    (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990), generalized boosted models – GBM (Ridgeway, 2015),
    and bagged multivariate adaptive regression splines – B-MARS (derived from studies
    by Friedman, 1991, Friedman, 1993). These algorithms have been used for assessing
    and predicting several parameters in ecological modelling studies (Gonçalves et
    al., 2016) and for predicting several biophysical and biochemical characteristics
    of the crops using remote sensing data (Brosinsky et al., 2014, Doktor et al.,
    2014, Ismail and Mutanga, 2010). Table 1 summarizes some of the applications of
    predictive models in the assessment of parameters related with vegetation in agricultural
    and forestry studies. However, their application for assessing grapevine water
    status through HySR data has been insufficiently or not even exploited. Table

    The main goal of this study is therefore to assess grapevine water status using
    HySR data derived from a handheld spectroradiometer. Specific goals include: (i)
    identifying the best predictors for assessing multi-site and multi-year grapevine
    Ψpd, as water status indicator, using HySR data; (ii) comparing the performance
    of different predictive modelling approaches, including statistical and machine
    learning techniques, for predicting Ψpd through HySR data; and (iii) testing the
    predictive ability of the best approaches for different grapevine cultivars. For
    accomplishing these goals, two vineyard seasons in two test sites were surveyed
    and used for modelling different grapevines cultivars in two sub-regions of the
    Portuguese Douro wine region. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area The research
    was carried out in Douro Wine Region in the Northeast Portugal (Fig. 1), which
    has gained notoriety from the unique quality of its main product, the Port wine.
    The Douro region is classified as UNESCO World Heritage Cultural Landscape, where
    vineyards, mainly distributed on sloppy and terraced terrain, are a key element.

    Wine Region, Northeast Portugal, identifying the three sub-regions, and the representation
    of vineyard system. Broadly, the region is characterized by a climate of Mediterranean
    type. High water deficit is frequent during the summer period due to low rainfall,
    high vapor pressure deficit and low soil water content (Alves et al., 2013). The
    Douro wine region is divided into three climatic sub-regions: Baixo-Corgo, Cima-Corgo,
    and Douro-Superior (Fig. 1) whose main weather characteristics are presented in
    Fig. 2. The average annual precipitation in Douro-Superior and Cima-Corgo are
    respectively 540 and 658 mm, while it is of 856 mm in Baixo-Corgo. The winter
    precipitation (November through March) amounts approximately 59% (Douro-Superior),
    65% (Cima-Corgo) and 68% (Baixo-Corgo) of the annual total. Differences in precipitation
    among sub-regions are more pronounced during the autumn and winter seasons (Fig.
    2). The temperature range is higher in the Douro-Superior and the lowest range
    is observed in Baixo-Corgo. Download : Download high-res image (278KB) Download

    (INMG, 1965)). Two study areas were considered in this study (Fig. 1): (i) Study
    area 1 (SA1): “Quinta dos Aciprestes” (wine company Real Companhia Velha) in Soutelo
    do Douro (latitude 41.21°N; longitude: 7.43°W; 145 m a.s.l.), Cima-Corgo, and
    (ii) study area 2 (SA2): “Quinta do Ataíde” (wine company Symington) in Vila Flor
    (latitude: 41.25°N; longitude: 7.11°W; 161 m a.s.l.), Douro-Superior. Both study
    areas are integrated in commercial vineyards. The vineyard in SA1 has an area
    of 1.17 ha in undulated terrain with an average slope of 25%. The vines planting
    follows a bilateral Royat system, with orientation Northeast-Southwest, and the
    plant spacing is 2.2 m × 1 m. The maximum vines height is 1.5 m. Two cultivars
    were considered: Touriga Nacional (years 2014 and 2015) and Touriga Franca (year
    2015). For Touriga Nacional, two plots, with two replicate areas, were defined.
    Each plot included three irrigation treatments: non-irrigated (NI), irrigation
    treatment 1 (IT1), and irrigation treatment 2 (IT2) (Table 2). For Touriga Franca,
    only one plot with a single irrigation treatment (IT) was defined (Table 2). A
    drip irrigation system was used, with 1 m spacing between emitters and an emitter
    discharge of 2 L h−1. Table 2. Summary of the irrigation dates and irrigation

    – irrigation treatment. The SA2 was defined in a vineyard with a total area of
    6.5 ha and an average slope of 5.7%. The vineyard is planted according to the
    bilateral Royat system, with an orientation Northwest-Southeast. The plants spacing
    is 2.1 m × 1.1 m and the maximum plant height is 1.8 m. Four plots were sampled
    (in the year 2015) within the SA2, two of cultivar Touriga Nacional, one of cultivar
    Touriga Franca, and one of cultivar Tinta Barroca. Two irrigation treatments were
    considered for plots of Touriga Nacional and Touriga Franca: irrigated (IT) and
    non-irrigated (NI); for Tinta Barroca only an irrigation treatment (IT) was used
    (Table 2). A drip irrigation system was used, with 0.5 m of spacing between emitters
    and an emitter discharge of 1.6 L h−1. In both study areas, irrigation started
    when the predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd) reached values between −0.3 and −0.4
    MPa (late June–mid-July) and ended near 2 weeks before the harvest. The irrigation
    treatments were established according to the levels of WD adjusted for the quality
    criteria defined by each commercial company following the methodology by Deloire
    et al. (2005). The information about irrigation dates and irrigation amounts per
    study area, cultivar and irrigation treatment is presented in Table 2. The summary
    of the climatic conditions in SA1 and SA2, in both years of study in the winter-spring
    seasons and in the summer study period, is presented in Table 3. The year 2015
    was characterized by higher temperatures and lower precipitation than the year
    2014. Table 3. Summary of the climatic conditions for the years 2014 and 2015

    to assess the vines water status in the years 2014 and 2015. Measurements were
    done before sunrise. A minimum of 6 leaves per irrigation treatment in each plot
    were measured using a pressure chamber (Scholander et al., 1965) (PMS 600, Albany,
    OR, USA). Only the plot of cultivar Touriga Nacional in SA1 was studied in 2014
    while in 2015 all plots in both study areas were monitored. Ψpd was measured in
    several dates in both study areas and respective details are presented in Table

    (HySR) Measurements of HySR using a portable spectroradiometer (Handheld 2, ASD
    Instruments, Boulder, CO, USA) were performed in the same dates of the Ψpd measurements
    (Table 4). The spectroradiometer has a full conical angle field-of-view of 25
    ° and recorded spectral signatures between 325 nm and 1075 nm of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, with a wavelength interval of 1 nm. During the plant HySR acquisition,
    the sensor was maintained approximately 30 cm above the canopy, directed vertically
    downward (nadir view). The measurements were performed in cloud free conditions
    between 11 and 13 h (local time) aiming to minimize changes in solar zenith angle.
    A dark current correction was applied and the reflectance of a white standard
    panel (Spectralon) was measured before the canopy spectral data acquisition to
    obtain a reflectance output. The grapevine HySR measurements were performed in
    the same plants where Ψpd was measured. Ten repetitions per plant were performed
    and later averaged to minimize the effect of noise. Due to noise observed in the
    data at the limits of the electromagnetic spectrum, the HySR data below 400 nm
    and above 1010 nm were not considered for further analysis. 2.3. Model development
    2.3.1. Data processing and predawn leaf water potential predictors In order to
    minimize noise effects, the HySR and Ψpd data were averaged per plot in each irrigation
    treatment. Thus, the number of observed HySR and Ψpd data reduced to 137: 56 relative
    to cultivar Touriga Nacional (in SA1) in the year 2014 and 65 (41 in SA1 and 24
    in SA2) in 2015, and 16 observations of other cultivars (in SA2) in the year 2015.
    A preliminary analysis of outliers was performed through visual data inspection,
    using histograms and scatter-plots, and analyzing preliminary regression results.
    Ten observations were identified as outliers and removed from the study. Thus,
    a total number of 127 observations (55 in 2014 and 72 in 2015) were considered
    for model development, 111 relative to Touriga Nacional and 16 relative to the
    other cultivars. The Ψpd data, representing the grapevines water status, were
    used as response variable for the model development, while the HySR data were
    used as predictors. A large set of vegetation indices were used to extract HySR
    indicators from spectral signatures and thus also used as predictors. A total
    of 97 vegetation indices included in the “hsdar” package implemented in R software
    (Lehnert et al., 2016) were computed. A large diversity of vegetation indices
    is included in “hsdar” package, namely ratios of bands, normalized indices, and
    indices obtained from the derivatives of spectra. Additionally, a normalized reflectance
    index (NRIi,j) was computed according to Eq. (1). (1) where bi and bj correspond
    to all two-band combinations within the spectral range of 400–1010 nm (totaling
    186355 combinations). A downward trend of Ψpd data throughout the post-flowering
    period of the crop cycle is commonly observed mainly due to climatic conditions
    and vegetation phenology. A downward trend in the predictors based on the HySR
    data is also expected following the canopy development and vegetation phenology.
    Hence, we could assume that Ψpd and the predictors could share a time trend. This
    common trend may be problematic if the Ψpd is regressed against the HySR data,
    since the expected high value of explained variance may not reflect the true association
    between these variables but may simply reflect their common trend. Therefore,
    to avoid spurious association between Ψpd data and the predictors, the day of
    the year (DOY) was also included as a potential predictor. The selection of potential
    predictors to integrate the model was based on non-parametric Spearman correlations
    (ρ) and on metrics of predictor importance calculated from preliminary exploratory
    Random Forest (RF) models (Breiman, 2001). That selection aimed to simultaneously
    reduce the initial set of potential predictors and to decrease collinearity among
    predictors. A threshold of 0.70 for the pairwise absolute value of ρ was assumed
    to select among the potential predictors obtained from the preliminary exploratory
    models (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). An iterative process of predictors’ removal was
    implemented combining both techniques referred above. 2.3.2. Predictive models
    Several predictive models, including statistical and machine learning techniques
    applied in the regression mode, were tested in this study for assessing grapevine
    water status (Fig. 3): - Partial Least Squares Regression (PLS) (Rosipal and Krämer,
    2006); - Support Vector Machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998); - Random Forest (RF) (Breiman,
    2001); - Generalized Linear Models (GLM) (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989, Venables
    and Ripley, 1999); - Generalized Additive Models (GAM) (Hastie and Tibshirani,
    1986, Hastie and Tibshirani, 1990); - Generalized Boosted Models (GBM) (Ridgeway,
    2007, Ridgeway, 2015); - Cubist regression (CUB) (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013, Kuhn
    et al., 2015); - Bagged Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (B-MARS) (Friedman,
    1991, Friedman, 1993, Milborrow, 2016); - Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks
    (BRNN) (Rodriguez and Gianola, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (476KB)

    model, a grid search algorithm to test several combinations of parameterization
    values for the model parameters was used (Fig. 3). The combination of parameters
    values providing the best fit of observed Ψpd by each predictive model, defined
    by the coefficient of determination (R2), was retained. The grid-search optimized
    parameters and other pre-defined/non-optimized parameters used as input to each

    was applied to HySR data, while the other predictive models were built using as
    predictors selected vegetation indices and DOY. For PLS, we tested several number
    of components (which correspond to linear combinations of the original predictors),
    from 1 to 30, and those that maximized the test R2 (best fit) were retained. The
    flowchart of the modelling process is presented in Fig. 3. The modeling process
    encompassed the model parameters optimization and model performance evaluation
    aiming to find the reproducible structure of the data and thus avoid overfitting
    problems (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). The software R (R_Core_Team, 2016), combined
    with the caret package (Kuhn, 2016, Kuhn and Johnson, 2013), was used for computing
    all the predictive models considered in this study. 2.3.3. Design for model performance
    assessment The models were implemented for assessing grapevine water status using
    data of two contrasting climatic years, respectively a dry and warmer year (2015)
    and a wet and colder year (2014) (Table 3). Thus, data from both years were considered
    in the phases of training and testing of the models aiming to represent a broader
    set of climatic conditions. No separation between study areas was considered when
    implementing the models. The assessment of predictive performance was based on
    the comparison of Ψpd observations with the Ψpd predictions from HySR by each
    predictive model. Two different approaches were adopted for assessing models performance:
    (i) cross-validation; and (ii) independent validation. (i) Cross-validation For
    the cross-validation, two distinct procedures were applied: (a) a 10-fold cross-validation
    with 25 repeats, which used 90% of the observations for model training and the
    remaining 10% for model testing (ntraining = 114, ntesting = 13); (b) a holdout
    cross-validation using repeated training/testing splits with 250 repeats, using
    50% of the dataset for training and the other 50% for testing (ntraining = 64,
    ntestingn = 63). The two cross-validation procedures differ in the method of selecting
    the subsamples used for training and testing. In the k-fold cross-validation,
    samples were randomly partitioned into 10 subsets of roughly equal size. The fitting
    of the model was made using all samples except the first subset; the held-out
    subset was used for model prediction and to estimate model performance; subsequently,
    the procedure was repeated with a second subset and so on (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013).
    This procedure was repeated 25 times to reduce variance and bias in the estimates.
    In the holdout cross-validation, the full dataset was randomly split into a training
    subset and a testing subset. In this procedure, the proportion of data randomly
    allocated to each one of the subsets (50% in this study) is user-defined. A large
    number of repetitions (250) was considered in order to obtain stable estimates
    of the models performance as proposed by Kuhn and Johnson (2013). (ii) Independent
    validation For implementing the independent validation, data from cultivar Touriga
    Nacional (n = 111) were used for model training and data from the cultivars Touriga
    Franca and Tinta Barroca (n = 16) were used for testing. In both study areas,
    Touriga Nacional is considered a cultivar of major importance regarding wine quality,
    which justified the larger sampling of this cultivar when compared to the other
    two cultivars. In the cross-validation and independent validation approaches referred
    above, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) and the coefficient of determination
    (R2), obtained as the square of the Pearson’s correlation coefficient between
    observed and predicted Ψpd, were the statistics used for assessing models performance
    (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). For the predictive models showing better performance,
    the ρ was used to assess the relative importance of each predictor for modelling
    Ψpd for the various WD classes defined by Deloire et al. (2005) for vineyards.
    The predictive models were run iteratively varying one predictor and maintaining
    the remaining ones at their average value, which allowed assessing the variation
    in predicted values as related to the considered predictor (Elith et al., 2005).
    The ρ values relating observed and predicted values of Ψpd were calculated for
    each WD class. Higher ρ values were considered to indicate a larger contribution
    of a predictor to explain the variation of Ψpd. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Ground measurements results Fig. 4 shows the intra-annual and inter-annual variability
    and differences in WD conditions using all available data (n = 127 observations).
    The values of Ψpd recorded in the field during the year 2014 ranged from −0.05
    MPa to −0.91 MPa (averaging −0.40 MPa), while they ranged between −0.17 MPa and
    −0.95 MPa (averaging −0.57 MPa) in the year 2015. When compared to the year 2014,
    the lower average values of Ψpd in 2015 indicate that higher WD were detected,
    which is consistent with the drier and warmer conditions observed throughout the
    grapevine crop cycle of 2015 in both study areas (Table 3). Download : Download

    WD conditions defined by Deloire et al. (2005) for a vineyard: (i) none to mild
    WD (0 MPa > Ψpd > −0.2 MPa); (ii) mild to moderate WD (−0.2 MPa > Ψpd > −0.4 MPa);
    (iii) moderate to high WD (−0.4 MPa > Ψpd > −0.6 MPa); and (iv) high WD (−0.6
    MPa > Ψpd). Hereafter, these classes will be referred as nil, low, moderate and
    high WD, respectively. The average profiles of HySR per WD class in the study
    period are presented in Fig. 5. A confidence interval of 0.5 standard deviation
    was adopted to represent the dispersion of the spectral response; the regions
    where WD classes overlap are then observable. Download : Download high-res image

    per class of water deficit using data of 2014 and 2015 relative to all three cultivars.
    The confidence interval of 0.5 standard deviation is represented by the colored
    bands. Broadly, the average HySR patterns and respective dispersion allow identifying
    regions of the electromagnetic spectrum with better potential for discriminating
    between the WD classes. The average profiles in the visible domain of the electromagnetic
    spectrum (400 nm to 700 nm) show lower values of reflectance in conditions of
    moderate and high WD relative to nil and low WD. In the red edge region (680 nm–750
    nm) is possible to observe a large increase in the reflectance values, mainly
    in the high WD class (−0.6 MPa > Ψpd). Additionally, in the NIR region (above
    750 nm), high WD conditions are represented by the largest reflectance values
    (Fig. 5). The water absorption features are weak in the spectral domain of visible,
    with the reflectance values mainly influenced by plant structural features related
    with the content of plant pigments, leaf internal structure and dry matter content
    (Roberto et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the reflectance in this spectral domain
    is also related with physiological processes that are proxy of WD conditions,
    including the epoxidation state of xanthophyll cycle pigments (Gamon et al., 1992)
    and the chlorophyll fluorescence emission (Moya et al., 2004). Therefore, these
    regions of the spectrum have been used in studies relative to crop water status,
    particularly using vegetation indices (Pôças et al., 2015, Rodríguez-Pérez et
    al., 2007, Suárez et al., 2008, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). The reflectance pattern
    of the red edge is a well-recognized descriptor of the changes of chlorophyll
    absorption from the red to the NIR regions associated to leaf and canopy scattering
    (Filella and Penuelas, 1994). Additionally, the shape of the red edge is highlighted
    through the reflectance first derivative curve, which allow showing the effect
    of WD conditions (Peñuelas et al., 1993, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003); this effect
    is mainly associated with high WD conditions (Filella and Penuelas, 1994). Differently,
    the NIR region encompasses wavelengths where water strongly absorbs radiation,
    including the 970 nm, thus it is appropriate for providing information on crop
    water status (Jones and Vaughan, 2010, Peñuelas et al., 1993, Roberts et al.,
    2012). 3.2. Selection of predictors Three HySR vegetation indices and the day
    of the year (DOY) were selected as predictors to be used with the predictive models
    listed in Section 2.3.2; however, the PLS model was computed differently as referred
    in the same Section. The selected HySR vegetation indices included the normalized
    reflectance index that combines reflectance at 561 nm (R561) and 554 nm (R554),
    Eq. (2). (2) The NRI554;561 is solely based on HySR data from the green spectral
    domain (520–570 nm). The Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI), originally defined
    by Gamon et al. (1992) and often considered for assessing crop water status (Hernández-Clemente
    et al., 2011, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2012, Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013), has a formulation
    similar to NRI554;561 although combining wavelengths of 531 nm and 570 nm. An
    optimization of the PRI wavelengths, combining HySR of 545 nm and 567 nm, thus
    for wavelengths close to those considered in NRI554;561, was previously used by
    Pôças et al. (2015) for predicting vineyard water status in Douro region. The
    water index (Peñuelas et al., 1993), combining reflectance at 900 nm (R900) and
    970 nm (R970), was also selected as predictor. It is defined as: (3) WI = R900/R970
    WI was specifically designed for estimating plant water content by integrating
    HySR at 970 nm, but showing different sensitivity for different crops and WD conditions
    (Peñuelas et al., 1997). Although Fig. 5 shows a differentiation of high and moderate
    WD conditions for this wavelength, some overlap with classes of nil or low WD
    conditions then occurred. The index D1, proposed by Zarco-Tejada et al. (2003)
    was also selected. It consists of the ratio between the first derivatives of the
    HySR curve for the reflectance values at 730 nm (D730) and 706 nm (D706): (4)
    The use of the first derivative in the D1 index allows detecting subtle changes
    related with the fluorescence emission in the red-edge region, while minimizing
    other confounding effects; the fluorescence emission is a process affected by
    the occurrence of stress, including plant WD (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003). As shown
    in Fig. 5, the wavelengths considered in Eqs. (2)–(4) allow covering different
    patterns of the HySR profile considering various levels of the WD classes. The
    use of a time predictor allows removing spurious trends of data and thus improving
    the explanation of the response variable (Ψpd) by the other predictors. In view
    of this, DOY was selected as predictor. Previous studies have also shown good
    results when integrating a time predictor in predictive models to assess biophysical
    characteristics of vegetation (Brosinsky et al., 2014). The need to cope with
    common time trends between variables was discussed by Cunha et al. (2016). The
    best results of the analysis based on the ρ relating Ψpd and the selected predictors
    were for NRI554;561 followed by DOY (Table 5). These results highlight the potential
    predictive power of these two predictors. In addition, the correlation analysis
    showed ρ values lower than 0.69 (in absolute values) for all the pairwise combinations
    between predictors, thus below the threshold of collinearity (0.70) considered
    in the study. Table 5. Spearman correlation coefficients (ρ) matrix relative to
    the predictors selected to model the predawn leaf water potential (Ψpd). Empty

    0.86 −0.4 0.42 −0.68 Relative to PLS, the number of components selected for explaining
    Ψpd varied with the model evaluation approach – independent validation, repeated
    10-fold cross-validation or the holdout cross-validation with 50/50 split. The
    number of components selected was 18 for the repeated 10-fold cross-validation,
    11 for the holdout cross-validation, and 29 for the independent validation. Additionally,
    the loadings per component, representing the weight of each wavelength in the
    component, presented great variability between evaluation procedures (data not
    shown), likely affecting the transferability of the results when applied to different
    samples. 3.3. Assessment of the predictive models performance The results of the
    predictive models performance when using the 10-fold cross-validation, the holdout
    cross-validation 50/50 split, and the independent validation are presented in
    Table 6. The parameterization values selected for the best fit of each predictive
    model are given in Supplementary data (Table A.2). Table 6. Results of the models

    The ntraining and ntesting correspond to the number of observations in the set
    of training and testing, respectively. The cross-validation approaches used different
    sample sizes for training and testing the models but considering all cultivars
    together (Table 6). Differently, a separation by cultivars was adopted with the
    independent validation. Therefore, the performance of the models was tested for
    diverse training/testing conditions in order to improve models robustness and
    assess the transferability of the results. Broadly, the performance results expressed
    both by the R2 and RMSE were slightly better for the 10-fold cross-validation
    than for the holdout cross-validation (Table 6), which is likely related with
    the number of observations used in the training set (114 vs 64, respectively).
    Nevertheless, the standard deviation (sd) of the RMSE was equal to 0.02 MPa for
    all the predictive models when the 10-fold cross-validation was used and equal
    to 0.01 MPa for the holdout cross-validation (data not shown), thus slightly better
    for the latter. In the independent validation, the size of the training set (n
    = 111) was also larger than the testing set (n = 16). Moreover, the training set
    included only data from Touriga Nacional and the testing set integrated data from
    the other cultivars (Touriga Franca and Tinta Barroca). In this case, the GBM
    clearly outperformed the remaining predictive models (R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.09
    MPa; Table 6). The predictive models with better combination of R2 and RMSE, for
    the three approaches of validation, were GAM, B-MARS, GBM and BRNN (Table 6).
    The comparison between the Ψpd observed and predicted through the independent
    validation by the GAM, B-MARS, GBM and BRNN models is presented in Fig. 6. The
    results, referring to various cultivars sampled in this study, show a good fitting
    of the models, with all data close to the identity line (1:1) and a small dispersion
    for GBM. Download : Download high-res image (866KB) Download : Download full-size

    predicted by four different predictive models: (a) B-MARS, (b) GAM, (c) GBM, and
    (d) BRNN. The data of cultivar Touriga Nacional and other cultivars (Tinta Barroca
    and Touriga Franca) are represented with different colors. The GBM model presented
    the best performance when the results for the three approaches of validation were
    averaged (R2 = 0.80 and RMSE = 0.11 MPa) and in particular when the independent
    validation was applied (Table 6). This methodology uses an iterative process based
    on multiple regression trees to capture the nonlinear relationship between the
    response variable and the set of predictors, and a new regression tree is added
    to the model in each iteration. It results that each new tree provides a best
    fit to the residuals of the model relative to the previous iteration and an increased
    goodness of fit (McCaffrey et al., 2013, Ridgeway, 2015). These results indicate
    a good adequacy of this methodology for modelling the grapevine water status.
    However, when compared with the other predictive models (Table 6), the GBM showed
    a slightly large variation of the results among validation approaches, which may
    be related with some overfitting problems frequently associated to this technique
    (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). Results of evaluating the performance of B-MARS were
    also good, with RMSE varying between 0.11 and 0.12 MPa and R2 ranging from 0.77
    and 0.81, and with the lowest variation among validation approaches (Table 6).
    These results indicate a good robustness of the model for predicting Ψpd. The
    B-MARS methodology is an ensemble technique that combines several MARS models.
    This regression technique can be considered a piecewise linear model and a non-parametric
    extension of linear models that automatically addresses nonlinearities and interactions
    among variables (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013). In its implementation, B-MARS uses a
    bootstrap aggregation (or “bagging” approach) in conjunction with regression to
    construct an ensemble, so that each model of the ensemble is used to make a prediction
    for a new sample, and the set of predictions is then averaged in the final model.
    Such bagging approach reduces the variance of the prediction and improves model
    stability (Kuhn and Johnson, 2013) as reflected in the results of the present
    study. Both GAM and BRNN presented average R2 of 0.78 and RMSE of 0.12 MPa, thus
    with a performance just slightly lower than GBM and B-MARS; the variation of the
    results between the three validation types was slightly lower when using BRNN.
    Broadly, GAM is able to efficiently cope with non-linear data structures by incorporating
    a sum of smooth functions that define the relationship between the response variable
    and the linear combination of the predictors (Brosinsky et al., 2014, Hastie and
    Tibshirani, 1986). Thus, this methodology provides predictive models that represent
    well the underlying data. This ability likely contributed to the good performance
    of GAM in this study considering the climate differences in the two years studied
    (2014 and 2015; Fig. 4) and between both study areas (Fig. 2), and the variability
    inherent to the different cultivars tested. Brosinsky et al. (2014) also obtained
    good results when applying GAM for assessing the relationship between leaf water
    content and the predictors, which in that study included vegetation indices and
    a variable representing time. The good performance of BRNN, which combines a two-layer
    feed-forward neural network methodology with a Bayesian regularization algorithm,
    is likely related with the ability of Bayesian methods to tune neural network
    models that are robust and well matched to the data, so resulting lower overfitting
    and overtraining problems (Burden and Winkler, 2000, Gianola et al., 2011, Husmeier
    et al., 1999, Pérez-Rodríguez et al., 2013). The results obtained by the models
    B-MARS, GBM, GAM, and BRNN for predicting the Ψpd are improved relative to previous
    results obtained by Pôças et al. (2015) for a single cultivar, year, and study
    area SA1. In that study a simple linear regression model based on vegetation indices
    derived solely from HySR in the visible spectral domain was considered. However,
    the results of R2 in the present study (Table 6) were slightly worse than those
    obtained for a vineyard in California when correlating leaf water potential at
    midday and a normalized PRI (derived from airborne HySR data) through a linear
    regression model (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2013). However, in this latter case, a
    small sample size (n = 9) was considered, as well as a single study area and a
    single year, thus encompassing less variability in studied conditions. In our
    study, a preliminary analysis correlating the leaf water potential at midday with
    HySR vegetation indices did not produce good results (data not shown). Results
    in the current study showed better performance than results obtained by De Bei
    et al. (2011) when using data from spectral regions above 1000 nm for predicting
    the midday water potential in grapevine. Although water strongly absorbs radiation
    in the wavelengths of 970 nm, 1200 nm, 1450 nm, 1930 nm, and 2500 nm (Jones and
    Vaughan, 2010), the most commonly available field spectroradiometers, for applications
    at an operational level, do not reach this region of the spectrum. Therefore,
    the implementation of a methodology for predicting grapevine Ψpd based on HySR
    data from the regions of visible, red-edge, and lower part of NIR, as proposed
    in the current study, is desirable. By considering a dataset encompassing a large
    variability of conditions, associated to location, year, weather, and cultivar,
    the performance of the models based on information of NRI554;561, WI, D1 and DOY
    showed good potential for a broader application in the prediction of grapevine
    water status in Douro wine region. 3.4. Relative importance of each predictor
    for the models performance The relative importance of each selected predictor
    for the performance of the best predictive models (GBM, B-MARS, GAM and BRNN)
    per WD class is shown in Fig. 7. The relative importance is represented by the
    ρ obtained for the comparison of the Ψpd observed and predicted following an adaptation
    of the methodology proposed by Elith et al. (2005). The visualization of the relative
    importance of each predictor provided in Fig. 7 is contingent on the other predictors
    being held constant. Nevertheless, it is important to notice that the response
    of each predictor in the predictive models takes in consideration the interactions
    between predictors. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download : Download

    comparison of the predawn leaf water potential observed and predicted, relative
    to each predictor and water deficit class (nil, low, moderate and high) for the
    best predictive models (B-MARS, GAM, GBM, and BRNN). The NRI554;561 has shown
    to be the predictor having a higher ρ for moderate (n = 33 observations) and high
    (n = 47) WD classes in the four predictive models, while the NRI554;561 and D1
    had higher contribution for nil WD (n = 19), and the DOY and WI for low WD (n
    = 28) (Fig. 7). The results of relative importance of WI in this study are contrary
    to the results obtained by Peñuelas et al. (1997) for gerbera, beans and pepper,
    in which the WI presented better sensitivity to plant water content in high WD
    conditions. Nevertheless, in addition to the difference among these herbaceous
    crops and the vine woody crops, those authors observed different WI sensitivity
    for the three crops studied. This effect is likely related with differences in
    the cellular arrangement of leaf tissues among crops, with consequences over reflectance
    patterns in the NIR region (Gausman, 1977). Broadly, the results highlight the
    complementary response effect of the selected predictors regarding the various
    WD classes. The use of the predictive models based on the NRI554;561, WI, D1 and
    DOY is compatible with the current capabilities of handheld spectroradiometers
    as well as with the increasing capabilities of hyperspectral sensors, including
    airborne sensors. Overall, the integrative framework combining a sound biophysical
    understanding of WD remote detection and state-of-the-art modelling analytics
    allowed improving predictions and generating a greater understanding of this phenomenon.
    The information obtained can guide the development of improved technologies in
    support to intelligent systems dedicated to irrigation management. As previously
    mentioned, obtaining measurements of Ψpd, currently used to support irrigation
    scheduling, is labor-intensive and time-consuming (Rodríguez-Pérez et al., 2007),
    which makes the predictive models proposed an alternative to support improved
    irrigation management by wine producers. 4. Conclusions In this paper, we studied
    how grapevine water status in Douro region can be assessed using HySR measurements
    across different genotypes and environments. Three spectral-based vegetation indices,
    NRI554;561, WI, and D1, were selected to implement predictive models for assessing
    grapevine Ψpd. These vegetation indices covered different regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum, which likely allowed a better prediction of Ψpd in a large range of
    WD conditions. Additionally, the use of a time predictor allowed minimizing the
    effect of spurious trends shared by the variable response (Ψpd) and the other
    predictors. The predictors used in the predictive models have biophysical meaning
    and can be supported by the grapevine physiological processes related with the
    dynamics of water status throughout the crop cycle. The B-MARS, GAM, GBM, and
    BRNN methodologies presented the best performance for predicting the Ψpd, considering
    validation approaches with different sample sizes for training and testing datasets.
    These methodologies also presented good results when the types of cultivars were
    considered separately, namely by separating cultivar Touriga Nacional from the
    other cultivars (Touriga Franca and Tinta Barroca). The performance and robustness
    of the results of the predictive models justify their use for providing enhanced
    support to irrigation water management in vineyards from different cultivars in
    Douro wine region. Furthermore, the increasing availability and technological
    improvements in handheld spectroradiometers and hyperspectral sensors, including
    airborne sensors, facilitates the operational application of this type of approach.
    Future applications of the predictive models proposed in this study based on data
    collected with high resolution hyperspectral cameras onboard of unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAV) can be particularly interesting to provide spatial data of vines
    WD. Nevertheless, a larger number of cultivars and a larger sample size per cultivar
    should be tested in future work. Additionally, although the approach proposed
    is grounded in a statistical basis and thus can only provide an empirical indication
    of the causal relationships of the grapevine water status, it generates hypothesis
    about the interactions between the spectral response and crop physiological processes,

    Get rights and content Highlights • Consumed water was the most important factor
    affecting pistachio yield in the study area. • A permutation of 23 features was
    selected by the GA-ANN model as the determinate predictors. • Advantages and disadvantages
    of both simple model and process-based model were compared. • The relative importance
    of each variable used in pistachio yield estimation was calculated. Abstract In
    recent decades, the quantity and quality of irrigation water have been reduced
    due to a significant increase in pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled exploitation
    of groundwater resources as well as reduction in rainfall precipitation. Therefore,
    agricultural producers, researchers and policy makers need to pay more attention
    to appropriate land management as an important strategy to achieve greater yield
    per unit area and to use soil and water resources in an optimal way. So, the present
    study was conducted to model the relationships between pistachio yield and soil,
    water and management variables in Rafsanjan region, the southeast of Iran. One
    hundred and ninety nine mature orchards were selected and sampled in such a way
    that an acceptable range of soil and water quality and management were included.
    The data set consisted of a dependent variable (pistachio yield) and 67 independent
    variables including soil, water and management characteristics. The results of
    hybrid genetic algorithm-artificial neural network (GA-ANN) showed that the lowest
    error was related to the case in which the 23 features were used in modeling.
    Then, stepwise multiple linear regression (MLR) and artificial neural network
    (ANN) techniques were applied to estimate pistachio yield. The results indicated
    that MLR could explain only 28% of the pistachio yield variation, whereas its
    accuracy increased when the data became more homogeneous via geographically dividing
    the study area into four parts with the highest densities of pistachio orchards.
    ANN-based model had a 90% accuracy to predict pistachio yield in the study area.
    Thus, an accurate estimation of pistachio yield could be achieved by reducing
    the data dimensionality using feature selection techniques and modeling with ANN.
    As the models were highly sensitive to irrigation water features, special attention
    should be paid to new irrigation methods and management practices as an effective
    strategy to minimize water losses and increase water use efficiency. Previous

    network 1. Introduction Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) is one of the most important
    exportable products in arid and semi-arid areas of Iran. Although pistachio trees
    are tolerant to drought and salinity, optimum pistachio yield is not necessarily
    achieved in drought conditions (Hasheminasab and Assad, 2015). In recent decades,
    due to considerable increase of the areas under pistachio cultivation and uncontrolled
    exploitation of groundwater resources as well as reduction in atmospheric precipitation,
    groundwater resources have been depleted, and reduction in the quantity and quality
    of water has become a major concern of farmers (Bagheri et al., 2012). Therefore,
    optimum management as an important strategy to achieve acceptable pistachio yield
    and the efficient use of soil and water resources have been of interest to researchers
    and orchard owners. To develop management plans (e.g., planting, harvesting, productivity,
    transportation, etc.), the mathematical modeling has been used as a process for
    crops yield prediction (Soares et al., 2013). Some researchers have used a simple
    linear correlation between the crop yield and soil characteristics. The results
    of such researches were different from farm to farm and from one year to another.
    In some studies, crop yield was predicted by multiple linear regression (MLR)
    techniques (e.g., Hosseinifard et al., 2008; Khakural et al., 1999; Kravchenko
    and Bullock, 2000; Satir and Berberoglu, 2016; Zhou et al., 2017). Non-linear
    statistical methods have also been used by some researchers (e.g., Adams et al.,
    1999; Blanc, 2017; Hansen and Indeje, 2004). Recent developments in computational
    intelligence, in the area of machine learning in particular, have greatly expanded
    the capabilities of empirical modeling. A machine learning algorithm is used to
    determine the relationship between a system inputs and outputs using a training
    data set that is the representative of all the behavior found in the system (Solomatine
    et al., 2008). Artificial neural networks (ANNs), genetic algorithms (GAs) and
    approaches to model integration are among the most popular computational intelligence
    techniques. Many researchers are interested in identifying the most important
    factors influencing a certain outcome of interest. In addition, original datasets
    often contain features of which some are either redundant or irrelevant to the
    target concept (Fayyad et al., 1996). As one of the existing methods that deals
    with these problems, feature selection is a process of selecting an optimal subset
    of features according to some reasonable criteria. Feature selection gives a deeper
    insight into the driving forces of a prediction, and also reduces the feature
    space dimension (Behrens et al., 2010). GA (Goldberg, 1989) is an efficient tool
    for problems of model optimization and feature selection when the model space
    is complex and has many local minima (Beiko and Charlebois, 2005). Garcia-Gutierrez
    et al. (2014) showed a comparison between common methods for the selection of
    predictors and recommend the use of evolutionary selection approach. Besalatpour
    et al. (2014) reported that the optimal feature set obtained from the parallel
    GA resulted in increasing the coefficient of determination (R2) values between
    the measured and the predicted geometric mean diameter of soil aggregates using
    MLR and ANN by 20.0 and 8.8%, respectively. Shirani et al. (2015) introduced a
    permutation of five input features including soil organic matter, electrical conductivity,
    clay, sand, and bulk density as explanatory variables using the optimized decision
    tree with particle swarm optimization (ODT-PSO). In the present study, a GA-ANN
    model was applied to find a set of features that enable an accurate prediction
    to be achieved. ANNs are those dynamic systems which transmit the hidden knowledge
    behind the experimental data to the network structure by data processing. ANNs
    are useful when the diversity of data is very great and the relationships and
    interactions between variables are vague and complex (Schultz et al., 2000). Scientists
    have also used ANN to simulate parameters such as weekly evapotranspiration (Landeras
    et al., 2009), groundwater level fluctuations (Chitsazan et al., 2015), soil erosion
    (Kim and Gilley, 2008), soil water retention and saturated hydraulic conductivity
    (Merdun et al., 2006), land cover mapping (Foody, 2000), and fertilization rate
    (Yu et al., 2010). Many studies have estimated target yield as a major issue in
    precision farming using ANNs (Miao et al., 2006). Kaul et al. (2005) used the
    capabilities of ANNs to predict corn and soybean yield with rainfall data and
    the soil rating for plant growth (SRPG) values in Maryland. They emphasized that
    ANN models consistently provided accurate yield predictions. Norouzi et al. (2010)
    identified the most important terrain attributes and soil properties affecting
    wheat yield variability under rainfed conditions using an ANN model in the semi-arid
    and hilly regions of western Iran. Zeng et al. (2016) established a sunflower
    seed yield prediction model for saline soils directly from soil salinity and nitrogen
    application using ANN analysis (R2 = 0.51). A few studies have examined the factors
    affecting pistachio yield. Hosseinifard et al. (2008), after studying groundwater
    in Anar region, the southeast of Iran, pointed to significant negative correlation
    between the electrical conductivity and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) of irrigation
    water and pistachio yield. Salehi et al. (2010) indicated that sodium and boron
    concentrations in pistachio leaves and soil are the most important factors limiting
    pistachio yield in Rafsanjan region, the southeast of Iran. Salehi and Hosseinifard
    (2012) studied six pistachio orchards with the same management properties in Rafsanjan
    region and noted that salinity and soil clay content are the most important properties
    affecting pistachio yield. Roosta and Mohammadi (2013) concluded that manure,
    ammonium, and iron application to pistachio trees can improve some nut quality
    factors in alkaline soils of Iranian pistachio orchards. Ghorbani and Musavi (2015)
    studied pistachio orchards of Damghan, the north of Iran, and stated that 70%
    of the changes of pistachio yield can be explained by animal manure, tree age,
    soil texture, financial management and executive skills. Hasheminasab and Assad
    (2015) evaluated a statistical model for predicting pistachio yield stability
    based on physiological traits related to plant water status under drought stress
    condition. The findings of the model suggested relative water protection, relative
    water content and water retention capacity as reliable indicators for monitoring
    drought tolerance and predicting pistachio yield stability. A limited number of
    studies have been carried out regarding pistachio yield modeling using different
    features. On the other hand, some of features may be redundant or irrelevant to
    pistachio yield. The current study was conducted to: i) find a set of features
    that enable an accurate prediction to be achieved by a GA-ANN, ii) model the relationships
    between pistachio yield and soil, water and management variables in study area,
    and iii) verify when the MLR and ANN models are appropriate for the prediction
    of pistachio yield. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area This study was conducted
    in the irrigated pistachio orchards in Rafsanjan region (56° 41′ to 54° 56′ E
    and 29° 54′ to 31° 13′ N), Kerman province, the southeast of Iran (Fig. 1). The
    mean annual precipitation, temperature and potential evapotranspiration in the
    region are 90 mm, 19 °C and 3000 mm, respectively. The mean altitude of the area
    is 1500 m above sea level and irrigated pistachio orchards are the major land
    uses in this region. Download : Download high-res image (882KB) Download : Download

    sampling points. 2.2. Field studies and sampling One hundred and ninety nine sampling
    points were selected in such a way that an acceptable range of soil and water
    quality and management were included (Fig. 1). For this purpose, the orchards
    which were irrigated from the same well were marked. Then, management units (orchards
    with the same management) were identified. Soil samples were performed near the
    edge of the tree canopy and at three depths of 0 to 40, 40 to 80, and 80 to 120 cm.
    The irrigation water of all the orchards was also sampled. Moreover, a face to
    face questionnaire was prepared for every orchard to collect yield and management
    data including the amount of consumed water, irrigation interval, orchard area,
    tree age, male to female tree ratio, row width, row length, in-row tree spacing,
    amount of consumed manure, cultivars, number of winter leaching, tree age in grafting,
    and days per worker and per year. As pistachio is a strongly alternate bearing
    tree crop species (Ferguson et al., 1980), in the present study, pistachio yield
    was reported as four-year averages. 2.3. Soil and water analyses The soil samples
    were air-dried and ground to pass a 2 mm sieve before the analyses. The percentages
    of clay (<0.002 mm), silt (0.002–0.05 mm), and sand (0.05–2 mm) particles were
    measured by hydrometer method (Gee and Bauder, 1986). Soil pH was determined in
    saturated paste using a digital pH-meter (Model 220, Corning) (Thomas, 1996),
    and electrical conductivity (EC) was determined in the saturated paste extract
    using an EC-meter (Model 4520, Jenway) (Rhoades, 1996). Soil organic carbon (SOC)
    was measured by colorimetric method (Nelson and Sommers, 1996). Calcium carbonate
    equivalent (CCE) was determined by the back-titration method (Nelson, 1982), and
    gypsum was determined by precipitation in acetone (Nelson, 1982). Soluble calcium
    and soluble magnesium were determined titrimetrically using standard EDTA (Barrows
    and Simpson, 1962), and soluble sodium was measured by flame photometry (Knudsen
    et al., 1982). Available phosphorus was measured by Olsen method (Olsen and Sommers,
    1982), and available potassium was measured using ammonium acetate (Knudsen et
    al., 1982). Water quality parameters were determined based on Pansu and Gautheyrou
    (2007). While the pH and EC values were measured by a pH-meter (Model 220, Corning)
    and an EC-meter (Model 4520, Jenway), respectively, calcium and magnesium concentrations
    were determined titrimetrically using standard EDTA. Chloride was determined by
    the standard AgNO3 titration method. Carbonate and bicarbonate were determined
    by titration with HCl. Sodium was measured by flame photometry. 2.4. Feature selection
    using hybrid GA-ANN model In the proposed hybrid GA-ANN model, different permutations
    were first randomly produced by GA according to the number of input features (genes)
    where each permutation was a chromosome. The first feature was selected from each
    permutation. Next, ANN model was constructed using such candidate feature, and
    error decrease in estimating the pistachio yield was monitored. Therefore, the
    fitness value of each chromosome was determined by calculating a coast function.
    A three-layered feed-forward ANN was employed to fitness computation. Table 1
    shows the summary of the parameters used in hybrid GA-NN model. Table 1. Parameters
    of hybrid GA-ANN model. Parameter Setting Population size 30 Chromosome size 67

    0.7 Mutation operator rate 0.02 Number of generations 100 In the next step, a
    selection mechanism was employed for selecting the two fittest chromosomes for
    reproduction. A crossover operator was employed for introducing new chromosomes
    to the next generation and a mutation operator was employed for creating new information
    in the offspring (Table 1). Subsequently, the previous population was replaced
    by the new one and the steps above were repeated until the generation number reached
    its maximum. In this way, the best feature subset with one member was identified.
    This procedure was continued until the combination including 67 features was investigated.
    Finally, the combinations with 1–67 features were compared and the feature subset
    which had the lowest error and the minimum number of inputs was considered as
    the most effective one. 2.5. Pistachio yield modeling SPSS 22.0 software was used
    to develop the stepwise MLR model and to determine the descriptive statistics
    of the studied features. Then, the study area was divided geographically into
    4 parts (including Noogh, Anar, eastern suburbs and western suburbs) with the
    highest densities of pistachio orchards, and the regression models were run for
    each part, separately. ANN models were then performed using MATLAB software package
    (MATLAB R2013b). The data were randomly partitioned into three subsets: a training
    data set (70% of the total), a validation data set (15% of the total), and a test
    data set (15% of the total). Then, modeling was carried out using feed-forward
    multilayer perceptron network. Back propagation of error method with Levenberg-Marquardt
    function was used for network training. Sensitivity analysis was used to compare
    the importance of different parameters to the estimation of pistachio yield (Hill
    and Tiedeman, 2007). The ability of the models to yield prediction was evaluated
    using the relative root mean square error (%RMSE), adjusted coefficient of determination
    (adj-R2) and Durbin-Watson statistic (D–W) Eqs. (1), (2), (3). D–W statistic was
    used to determine the independence of the observations and its values always lie
    between 0 and 4. If there is no autocorrelation in the residuals, D–W’s value
    is close to 2. If D–W statistic tends to 0, there is a positive serial correlation,
    and if it tends to 4, successive error terms are negatively correlated (Durbin,
    1969). (1) (2) (3) where xi is the measured value of sample i, yi is the predicted
    value of sample i, n is the total number of samples, is the standard deviation
    of measured values, R2 is the coefficient of determination, p is the number of
    inputs and ei is the difference between the measured and predicted values. 2.6.
    Sensitivity analysis The relative importance of selected features was calculated
    using an ANN sensitivity analysis based on changing R2 (Shirani et al., 2015).
    The steps for this sensitivity analysis method can be briefly described as follows:
    (1) Initially, the coefficient of determination (R2) was calculated using all
    inputs. (2) One of the variables was eliminated from the inputs set. Then, modeling
    was carried out with the rest of the variables and the new model coefficient of
    determination (R2*) was calculated. (3) The difference between the calculated
    coefficients of determination in steps 1 and 2 ( ) was determined: (4) The importance
    of the eliminated variable (VI) was calculated as follows: (5) 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Statistics and data analysis Table 2 represents the details of
    the measured features used for modeling. The average yield in the study area was
    close to 1800 kg ha−1. According to FAO (2014), the average pistachio yield in
    the cultivated areas of Iran is 1312 kg ha−1 and its world average is near 1218 kg ha−1.
    Pistachio yield data have a high diversity with the coefficient of variation (CV)
    equal to 76.62%. CV values show that phosphorus concentration is more diverse
    than that of potassium which is probably due to low mobility of phosphorus (Brye
    et al., 2003). Also, the soil sodicity index (sodium adsorption ratio, i.e., SAR)
    showed more variability in comparison to soil salinity index (electrical conductivity,
    i.e., EC) (Table 2). Generally, the higher CV can be attributed to more impact
    of management factors (Dahiya et al., 1984; Wilding and Drees, 1983). Table 2.

    Accordingly, a permutation of 58 features with the lowest %RMSE was introduced
    as the most important combination of the variables affecting pistachio yield.
    However, a component containing 23 predictor variables had a relatively close
    %RMSE to the mentioned permutation. Therefore, by considering investments of time,
    laboratory works, and budget considerations, the permutation including 23 features
    was selected to estimate pistachio yield. Download : Download high-res image (138KB)

    accuracy in pistachio yield estimation for the whole study area was equal to 28%
    (Table 3). Factors affecting the yield could be identified using standardized
    regression coefficients (Table 4). According to this model, the amount of water
    used and SAR 40–80 cm had the greatest impact on pistachio yield in the study
    area. Rising SAR destroys soil structure, decreases water infiltration and increases
    the chance of sodium accumulation to toxic levels in plant tissue (Sanden et al.,
    2005a). Table 3. Evaluation indices related to the comparison of observed and

    so that the model adj-R2 for Noogh, Anar, eastern suburbs and western suburbs
    orchards rose to about 81.9, 86.4, 74.6 and 51.3%, respectively (Table 3). The
    modeling using samples collected from Anar area showed that the phosphorus concentration
    at depth of 40 to 80 cm was the most important factor increasing pistachio yield
    in this region (Table 3). Removed P in fruit and abscised leaves in On-year pistachio
    trees is averaged 6 times than in Off-year trees (Rosecrance et al., 1996). Shahriaripour
    et al. (2011) reported that P application significantly decreased root Na concentration.
    Irrigation frequency was another variable entered into the mentioned model. Goldhamer
    and Beede (2004) noted that irrigation cutoff during growing season can reduce
    the pistachio yield and quality. It was observed that with increasing irrigation
    frequency from 25 to 45 days in pistachio orchards, blankness fruits in all the
    treatments increased. In Kerman region, the best irrigation frequency can vary
    between 30 to 45 days for the months with low evaporation and between 20 to 35
    days for the warmer months, based on soil texture (Mohammadi Mohammadabadi and
    Sedaghati, 2010). Thus, reducing irrigation frequency via switching surface irrigation
    system to microirrigation and reducing the width of strips or furrows can be considered
    as one of the management recommendations. Topsoil’s clay content has a positive
    effect on pistachio yield in Anar area with the standardized coefficient equal
    to 0.37. Given that the soil texture in that area is often sandy loam and loamy
    sand, clay increase probably enhances water holding capacity and cation exchange
    capacity. Hosseinifard et al. (2010) by soil mineralogical assessing in Anar area
    indicated that mica is a dominant clay mineral, which in addition to high stability
    and limited expansibility, has interlayer potassium. Surapaneni et al. (2002)
    and Samadi (2011) also observed a significant positive correlation between nonexchangeable
    potassium and illite. Nonexchangeable potassium has proven role in plant nutrition
    (Richards et al., 1988). The pistachio yield in this area has a negative relationship
    with silt content in soil depth of 40–80 cm. The mineralogical composition and
    amount of silt fraction can affect the fertility and moisture availability of
    soil (Hawkins and Graham, 1950; Ismail, 1991; Najafi-Ghiri and Jaberi, 2013).
    The MLR model explained up to 75% of the yield variations in the eastern suburbs
    using the input variables including the amount of consumed water, soluble calcium
    and electrical conductivity in depth of 80–120 cm (Table 3, Table 4). Pistachio
    is resistant to drought, but the water supply is an essential requirement to achieve
    optimal yield. Evapotranspiration of pistachio trees in Rafsanjan is 9432 m3 ha−1 year−1.
    The amount of consumed water (regardless of the water losses) in Kerman region
    has been reported about 8,000–15,000 m3 ha−1 year−1 (Mohammadi Mohammadabadi and
    Sedaghati, 2010). Salinity in soil depth of 80–120 cm, with the standardized coefficient
    -0.67, was the most limiting variable for pistachio yield in the eastern suburbs.
    Soil salinity is one of the major problems in arid and semi-arid regions (Eskandari
    et al., 2014). Salehi and Hosseinifard (2012) stated that soil salinity has a
    significant impact on pistachio yield. In contrast, soluble calcium in soil depth
    of 80–120 cm (standardized coefficient = 0.36) had a positive effect on the increase
    in pistachio yield. Due to the high soluble sodium in the area, calcium can reduce
    the SAR. In addition, calcium plays an important role in pistachio nutrition (Adibfar
    et al., 2012; Agar, 2012; Hojjat Nooghi and Mozafari, 2012; Sajadian and Hokmabadi,
    2011). According to the mentioned issues, autumn/winter leaching with application
    of appropriate amendments such as gypsum and sulfuric acid can be recommended
    as a management practice in this area (Sanden et al., 2005a; Yazdanpanah et al.,
    2013). The soil available P at depth of 40–80 cm and amount of consumed water
    had a positive impact, and irrigation interval, soil soluble Mg and sand content
    at depth of 80–120 cm have a negative effect on the crop yield in Noogh area (Table
    4). High Mg levels in addition to toxicity for plants can destroy soil structure.
    In fact, the high density of positive charge increases magnesium hydrated radius,
    resulting in disaggregation (Zhang and Norton, 2002). Increasing soil magnesium
    disrupts potassium and calcium absorption, and a false lack of calcium in pistachio
    trees occurs (Sajadian and Hokmabadi, 2011). Therefore, treating these orchards
    with amendments increasing the soluble and exchangeable calcium has a positive
    impact on crop yield. Increasing sand content reduces soil ability to hold water
    and nutrients required for the plant. Table 4 shows that the soluble sodium in
    topsoil was the limiting factor for the pistachio yield in the western suburbs.
    Given that the SAR at 90% of the topsoil in this area is less than 13, the negative
    impact of sodium is probably related to its toxicity. Excessive sodium uptake
    by plant can lead to the appearance of toxicity symptoms that are similar to potassium
    deficiency symptoms (Beede et al., 2005). Over time and with leaching other cations,
    sodium can allocate a greater number of colloids exchange sites and therefore
    soil infiltration and aeration can decline (Qadir et al., 2003). Proper and on
    time management practices can prevent such problems (Sanden et al., 2005a). Pistachio
    trees are dioecious with male and female flowers borne on separate trees. As pistachio
    pollen is blown by wind, the male density within an orchard is important. Kallsen
    et al. (1980) reported that most new orchards with acceptable yield in the Central
    Valley of California are planted every fifth tree in every fifth row, a ratio
    of 24 female (cv. Kerman) to one male (cv. Peters). In some instances, in areas
    where few or no other pistachios are grown, the ratio of Kerman to Peters has
    been reduced to 14:1 to ensure adequate pollination. Given the different conditions
    such as relative humidity in Rafsanjan region, more researches are needed to obtain
    optimal male to female tree ratio. Generally, the parameters related to the irrigation
    water are among the most important variables affecting the pistachio yield in
    the study area. Among the four regression models, the only one in which none of
    the irrigation water features was significant was related to the western suburbs.
    The pistachio yield in the western suburbs was better than other zones so that
    in 90% of the studied orchards, the crop yield was more than 1200 kg ha−1. The
    region water balance is extremely negative because of low precipitation, high
    evaporation and uncontrolled exploitation of groundwater in recent years. Reducing
    water resources and increasing irrigation frequency in pistachio orchards can
    cause drought stresses and irreparable damages to the trees. Traditional irrigation
    techniques common in the region have low efficiency due to their inherent problems
    and improper management (Mohammadi Mohammadabadi and Sedaghati, 2010). Therefore,
    special attention should be paid to water management practices in order to increase
    irrigation efficiency. This can be achieved by changing the irrigation methods
    from surface methods to microirrigation, improving irrigation scheduling and reducing
    water use without affecting yields, a practice termed regulated deficit irrigation
    (Goldhamer, 2005; Iniesta et al., 2008). 3.4. Pistachio yield modeling using ANN
    ANN model was implemented with 23 selected attributes as inputs, as well as the
    amount of the yield as the target variable. Network architecture was formed by
    trial and error, and with 10 neurons in a hidden layer, 51 iterations (epochs),
    and tangent-sigmoid activation Levenberg-Marquardt training functions. %RMSE and
    adj-R2 values for the proposed ANN model for the yield prediction were 16.99 and
    0.90, respectively (Table 3). Values of %RMSE less than 40% indicate acceptable
    model accuracy (Hengl and Husnjak, 2006). The evaluation indices, presented in
    Table 3, indicated that ANN had higher accuracy compared to MLR for the pistachio
    yield modeling. In the case of using unstable data, ANN is not superior to linear
    regression, but with precise data application, it provides a more accurate model
    (Pachepsky et al., 1996). In many cases, the analyst may want to provide a measure
    of importance for each variable instead of just listing them. This would provide
    more information for modifying the selected list to accommodate other considerations
    of the data analysis (Shirani et al., 2015). Fig. 3 shows the sensitivities of
    the most important variables used in the developed ANN model to predict the pistachio
    yield. Over 70% of the model sensitivity was covered by top 10 features including
    the amount of consumed water, soil available P at depth of 40–80, irrigation interval,
    EC of irrigation water, silt content at depth of 40–80, sand content at depth
    of 80–120 cm, amount of consumed manure, in-row tree spacing, pH at depth of 80–120 cm
    and soluble calcium in topsoil. The amount of consumed water was the most determinant
    parameter influencing the pistachio yield (importance coefficient value of 17.40%,
    Fig. 3). It emphasizes the importance of irrigation parameters and the necessity
    of applying modern and efficient irrigation techniques. Download : Download high-res

    neural network (SOC 0–40: Soil organic carbon at depth of 0–40 cm, EC: Electrical
    conductivity, SAR: Sodium absorption ratio, CCE: Calcium carbonate equivalent).
    Soil texture is one of the important factors influencing nutritional characteristics
    and management practices. Pistachios can be successfully grown on a number of
    soil types, but typically deep, uniform loam soils produce the best yields (Ferguson
    et al., 1980). Although fine texture soils have high cation exchange and water
    holding capacity, they may encounter some problems such as low infiltration rate.
    On the other hand, the low cation exchange and water holding capacity leading
    to leaching of nutrients as well as drought stress are the main problems of coarse
    texture soils (Brady, 2008). The application of manure improves soil organic matter,
    which in turn can improve soil productivity as it enhances soil physical, chemical
    and biological properties. Indeed, soil organic matter may promote crop yields
    through supplying multiple nutrients, encouraging microbial activity and improving
    infiltration rate (Sanden et al., 2005b; Swift, 2001). Appropriate row spacing
    is particularly important in pistachio orchards. Kallsen et al. (1980) suggested
    a design with 4.6–5.5 meters between trees in deep soils with proper drainage.
    Less tree spacing leaves little room for tree growth or mechanical cross hedging
    and more expensive hand pruning will be required to keep trees separated from
    one another for harvest. Conversely, in a more widely spaced initial planting,
    the onset of economic bearing is delayed. Soil pH is one of the most important
    factors to assess the quality of soil and water. Most of the pistachio orchards
    in the study areas have high soil pH in range of calcareous soils (7–8.5). Soil
    pH has a substantial effect on soil nutrient availability and microbial processes.
    Higher soil pH limits the solubility of micronutrients such as Fe and Mn (Brady,
    2008). Generally, sensitivities show the importance of each variable but do not
    indicate how they affect pistachio yield. Thus, the results of a sensitivity analysis
    should be interpreted based on expert knowledge or results of other models such
    as linear regression. 4. Conclusions The results indicated the efficiency of a
    reasonable feature selection for the yield evaluation in pistachio orchards with
    different soil types, water quality and management systems. ANN achieved more
    accuracy in regional-scale prediction of the pistachio yield compared to MLR.
    MLR model did not accurately predict the pistachio yield for the whole the study
    area. However, when the study area was geographically divided into 4 parts, the
    evaluation indices of MLR significantly improved. It means that the data homogeneity
    and decreasing sources of the variations reduced the complexity of the relationships
    among the features. As the models were highly sensitive to the irrigation water
    features, special attention should be paid to new irrigation methods and management
    practices as an effective strategy to minimize water losses and increase water
    use efficiency. Although ANNs are more efficient compared to linear regression
    methods in regional-scale estimating, they are not necessarily better to illustrate
    the relationships among variables. Therefore, the application of other methods
    such as linear regression is recommended for planning appropriate farm management
    in local scales. Acknowledgments The present work was financially supported by

    Precision farming technologies have the potential to revolutionize agriculture
    by promoting eco-friendly practices. The review explores the potential advantages
    of precision farming technologies in achieving sustainable and environmentally
    conscious agriculture. The application of precision farming techniques allows
    for the targeted use of resources such as water, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    minimizing waste and reducing environmental impact. By incorporating advanced
    technologies like GPS, GIS, remote sensing, and data analytics, precision farming
    enables farmers to make informed decisions based on real-time data, leading to
    improved crop management and increased productivity. Additionally, precision farming
    promotes the adoption of site-specific management strategies, taking into account
    the unique characteristics of each field, optimizing resource allocation, and
    reducing the risk of environmental pollution. This review highlights the importance
    of precision farming in achieving eco-friendly agriculture and calls for further
    research and adoption of these technologies to promote sustainable farming practices.

    Water management is crucial for agriculture, as it is the primary source of irrigation
    for crops.  Effective water management can help farmers to improve crop yields,
    reduce water waste, and increase resilience to drought.  This can include practices
    such as precision irrigation, using sensors and technology to deliver water only
    where and when it is needed, and conservation tillage, which helps to reduce evaporation
    and retain moisture in the soil.  Additionally, farmers can implement water-saving
    techniques such as crop selection, crop rotation, and soil conservation to reduce
    their water use.  Thus, studies aimed at saving the use of water in the irrigation
    process have increased over the years.  This research suggests using advanced
    technologies such as IoT and AI to manage irrigation in a way that maximizes crop
    yield while minimizing water consumption, in line with Agriculture 4.0 principles.  Using
    sensors in controlled environments, data on plant growth was quickly collected.  Thanks
    to the analysis and training of these data between several models among them,
    we find the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive
    Bayes (NB), the KNN has shown interesting results with 98.4 accuracy rate and

    Accesses 12 Citations Explore all metrics Abstract Optimizing water management
    has become one of the biggest challenges for grapevine growers in California,
    especially during drought conditions. Monitoring grapevine water status and stress
    level across the whole vineyard is an essential step for precision irrigation
    management of vineyards to conserve water. We developed a unified machine learning
    model to map leaf water potential ( ), by combining high-resolution multispectral
    remote sensing imagery and weather data. We conducted six unmanned aerial vehicle
    (UAV) flights with a five-band multispectral camera from 2018 to 2020 over three
    commercial vineyards, concurrently with ground measurements of sampled vines.
    Using vegetation indices from the orthomosaiced UAV imagery and weather data as
    predictors, the random forest (RF) full model captured 77% of variance, with a
    root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.123 MPa, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of
    0.100 MPa, based on the validation datasets. Air temperature, vapor pressure deficit,
    and red edge indices such as the normalized difference red edge index (NDRE) were
    found as the most important variables in estimating across space and time. The
    reduced RF models excluding weather and red edge indices explained 52–48% of variance,
    respectively. Maps of the estimated from the RF full model captured well the patterns
    of both within- and cross-field spatial variability and the temporal change of
    vine water status, consistent with irrigation management and patterns observed
    from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the utility of UAV-based aerial
    multispectral imaging for supplementing and scaling up the traditional point-based
    ground sampling of . The pre-trained machine learning model, driven by UAV imagery
    and weather data, provides a cost-effective and scalable tool to facilitate data-driven
    precision irrigation management at individual vine levels in vineyards. Similar

    Introduction Wine grapes are one of the top five most valuable specialty crops
    in California, generating an annual retail value over $43.6 billion (CDFA 2020;
    Wine Institute 2020). With a total acreage of over 250,000 ha (620,000 acres),
    the industry produces above 3.5 million tons of wine grapes per year and over
    80% of wine in the US. The central valley, coastal regions and southern California
    are the major wine grape producing regions in California. Dominated by Mediterranean
    climate with a warm and dry growing season, most of vineyards in California are
    drip irrigated. Optimizing water management has become increasingly important
    for wine producers, due to the increasing water demand associated with the expansion
    of specialty crops in Central Valley (Mall and Herman 2019). Decrease in water
    availability is further exacerbated by warming and drying climate. The severe
    drought in recent years has led to excessive ground water pumping by growers,
    leading to rapid rates of groundwater depletion (Famiglietti 2014). As a result,
    more restricted groundwater usage is now being regulated in California via the
    Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) (Leahy 2015). This requires growers
    to increase water use efficiency. Deficit irrigation treatments have been widely
    applied in vineyard management in the late growing season, to conserve water,
    improve the quality of wines, and facilitate harvest (Kustas et al. 2018). Timely
    mapping of water status for whole blocks is critical for adaptive and precision
    irrigation management at zonal or individual vine levels to increase water use
    efficiency, especially with regard to initiating irrigation (Intrigliolo and Castel
    2007). Typically, vine physiological water status is most commonly assessed with
    stem and/or leaf water potentials ( and ) using pressure chambers (Choné et al.
    2001; Williams and Araujo 2002). However, these field measurements are labor-intensive
    and are usually conducted on a very limited number of vines, limiting their utility
    for mapping within-field variability and tracking temporal dynamics of vineyard
    blocks. Remote sensing techniques, including unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and
    satellite based imaging, on the other hand, provide valuable opportunities for
    mapping water stress level of grapevines in a cost effective way. A few small-scale
    UAV studies with multispectral imagery have found that various vegetation indices
    (VI) are significantly correlated with grapevine water stress level (Baluja et
    al. 2012; Espinoza et al. 2017). These included normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) and green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI) in a Cabernet
    Sauvignon orchard in Washington State (r = 0.56 and 0.65 respectively) (Espinoza
    et al. 2017), and the ratio of transformed chlorophyll absorption in the reflectance
    index (TCARI) over optimized soil-adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) (R2 = 0.84)
    over a commercial rain-fed Tempranillo vineyard in Spain (Baluja et al. 2012).
    The performance of several narrowband reflectance indices from spectroradiometers
    has also been evaluated for grapevine water status detection over a commercial
    Pinot noir vineyard in California (Rodríguez-Pérez et al. 2007), and red/green
    index (RGI) and structure intensive pigment index (SIPI) performed best for canopy-level
    water status estimation (R2 = 0.62 and 0.54). High resolution UAV thermal imagery
    has also been used to derive crop water stress index (CWSI) for mapping grapevine
    over a Pinot noir vineyard in Spain with a R2 of 0.83 (Bellvert et al. 2014).
    At a coarser spatial resolution, several studies have attempted to use multispectral
    and/or thermal satellite imagery for detecting grapevine water stress. Bellvert
    et al. (2020), for example, evaluated the feasibility of using Sentinel-2 optical
    and Sentinel-3 thermal imagery in the two-source energy balance model for determining
    spatially distributed vine water status via a CWSI– relationship. They found that
    CWSI at the satellite resolution, even after sharpening the thermal imagery, was
    not as reliable as those from finer resolution airborne thermal imagery. At the
    individual vineyard level, linear models were developed to estimate grapevine
    with time-series of vegetation indices (VIs) from 3 m PlanetScope satellite imageries
    (Helman et al. 2018), based on data from 82 vineyards in Israel. Kandylakis and
    Karantzalos (2016) found red-edge bands from WorldView-2 satellite imageries provided
    additional information in estimating vine biophysical and biochemical properties.
    Recently more sophisticated approaches such as artificial neural network (ANN)
    machine learning model have been developed to predict the temporal dynamics of
    vine water stress level over a vineyard in China (Romero et al. 2018) and in Chile
    (Poblete et al. 2017), by combining multiple VIs and spectral reflectance. The
    machine learning model had better performance for estimating with a R2 of  0.83
    over three dates (Romero et al. 2018). In contrast, models based on single VI
    could only capture less than 23% of variance in measured . This is mostly because
    various VIs and reflectance in individual bands carry complementary information
    about the structure, vigor, and physiology (Xue and Su 2017). Most of these studies
    were conducted within one single vineyard. It is not clear how robust those water
    stress mapping approaches are when being applied across vineyards with different
    cultivars, management practices, environmental and climate conditions (Helman
    et al. 2018). Physiological studies have shown that weather conditions, including
    air temperature, relative humidity, and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), regulate
    plant stomatal closure and water exchange with atmosphere, and thus directly affect
    plant water status significantly (Garnier and Berger 1985; Ortuño et al. 2006).
    However, previous studies haven’t incorporated weather data for plant water stress
    monitoring along with remotely sensed imagery. This study aims to develop a generalized
    remote sensing approach to monitor the spatial variability and temporal dynamics
    of in California’s vineyards, using high resolution multispectral UAV imagery
    and weather data. We leveraged the extensive field campaigns from the Grape Remote
    Sensing Atmospheric Profile and Evapotranspiration eXperiment (GRAPEX), a multi-year
    collaboration between E. & J. Gallo Winery, U.S. Department of Agricultural Research
    Service (USDA-ARS), and several universities (Kustas et al. 2018). Our specific
    objectives include (1) evaluating the capability and robustness of UAV-based multispectral
    models for monitoring grapevine water status across vineyards; (2) developing
    machine learning models to combine UAV imagery and weather data for improved monitoring;
    and (3) examining the added values of weather and red edge spectral band for mapping
    wine grape water status through time. Materials and methods Site description This
    study focused on three commercial mature drip-irrigated vineyards. Two of them
    were planted to Vitis vinifera cv. Petite Sirah (BAR007) and Vitis vinifera cv.
    Cabernet Sauvignon (BAR012) in 2013 and 2010 respectively, and located near Cloverdale,
    in Sonoma County. The third one is located more inland, near Fresno in the southern
    part of the Central Valley (RIP 720); the 16-ha vineyard was planted in 2013 to
    Vitis vinifera cv. Merlot (Fig. 1). The study region has a typical Mediterranean
    climate, characterized by mild winters and hot dry summers. The bud break typically
    occurs in mid-March to early April, followed by flowering and fruit set late spring
    to early summer. Veraison starts in mid to late July, after which deficit irrigation
    is usually applied to cut water use and improve grape quality. Grapes in these
    blocks are typically harvested in late September to early October. Fig. 1 Study

    sampled vines with ground measurements are shown as blue dots. Also shown are
    NDVI imageries of RIP720 before and after applying the non-vegetation mask in

    topography and gravelly loam soil. In both fields, vines are trellised and trained
    in a split canopy with 1.8 m vine spacing and 3.35 m row spacing. The vine rows
    are oriented differently in these two fields, along northwest to southeast in
    BAR007 vs. northeast-southwest direction in BAR012. The RIP720 vineyard is flat,
    dominated by sandy loam soil, and has much warmer climate than the BAR blocks
    (Kustas et al. 2018). The Merlot vines were planted with east–west row orientation
    and 3.35 m row spacing and 1.52 m vine spacing. This vineyard was split into 4
    blocks, allowing for different irrigation treatments to each block (T1, T2, T3,
    T4) (Fig. 1). In 2018, T1 and T2 blocks were under deficit irrigation (with applied
    water equivalent to only 75% of evapotranspiration), while T3 and T4 blocks had
    no water stress treatments. In 2020, T1 was well watered, while the irrigation
    in T2, T3 and T4 was reduced in late July to induce different water stress levels,
    and those three blocks were then intensively irrigated from late July to early
    August to achieve full recovery from water stress. Seven Intensive Observation
    Periods (IOPs) were conducted in 2018–2020, typically between early June and early
    August, and scheduled around 1 to 2 Landsat overpasses. Vine canopies were fully
    developed, and the phenological stages ranged from pea sized grape to various
    degrees of ripening depending on the IOP. During all the IOPs, the cover crop
    had been mowed or was already senesced (stubble). Various ground measurements
    and aerial imagery were collected during the IOP around Landsat and Sentinel satellite
    overpassing dates. UAV flights and image processing We acquired multispectral
    aerial imagery using the MicaSense RedEdge camera integrated to a DJI Matrice
    100 quadcopter during 2018–2020 growing seasons. The MicaSense RedEdge camera
    have five spectral bands to record reflected radiation at blue (centered at 475
    nm), green (560 nm), red (668 nm), red-edge (717 nm), and near infrared (840 nm)
    (MicaSense Inc. Washington, USA 1). A sun irradiance sensor was installed on the
    top of the quadcopter to measure the incoming solar irradiance for each spectral
    band. A total of eight flights were conducted over the study vineyards (Table
    1). The same flight plan was designed and executed with 80% front overlap and
    80% side overlap. The UAV system was flown at 120 m above ground level, resulting
    in aerial images at 8 cm resolution. All flights were conducted around solar noon
    to reduce the impacts of shadows. The photos of the calibrated reflectance panel
    were taken immediately before and after each flight for radiometric calibration.
    In each vineyard, we placed five ground control points (GCPs) for georeference,
    four at the corners and one at the center. The GPS coordinates were recorded using
    Trimble Geo 7x (Trimble, CA, USA). Table 1 Availability of the UAV imagery and
    concurrent ground measurements of leaf water potential during three IOPs in three
    vineyards Full size table The raw multispectral images were stitched and processed
    with the Pix4DMapper Pro photogrammetry software (Pix4D LLC, Swiss). The software
    generated the automatic tie points initially. The coordinates of the GCPs were
    then imported to ensure the geolocation accuracy, resulting a georeference error
    lower than 30 cm. At the second step, the point cloud and 3D textured mesh were
    constructed based on the automatic tie points, and the digital surface model was
    further created. Radiometric calibration was performed using the measurements
    of the calibration panel, to generate orthomosaics of reflectance maps at 8 cm
    for each spectral band. Image co-registration was further performed to ensure
    the spatial alignment among imagery acquired from multiple dates. We calculated
    multiple widely-used VIs with the reflectance from different bands from the orthomosaics
    as described above (see Table 2). NDVI is the most widely used vegetation index
    for monitoring plant growth, vigor, and structure (Rouse et al. 1974). Several
    studies have also found NDVI is significantly related to overall plant stress
    level, as a result of cumulative water deficit on plant growth (Acevedo-Opazo
    et al. 2008; Baluja et al. 2012; Poblete et al. 2017). However, there is latency
    in the response of NDVI and other spectral indices to the onset of vegetation
    stress, which thermal-infrared based approaches can readily detect as long as
    an image is available (Knipper et al. 2019). Various indexes were developed to
    reduce the noise from background soil, such as soil adjusted vegetation index
    (SAVI) and optimized soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI) (Huete 1988; Rondeaux
    et al. 1996), and to reduce the atmospheric effect, e.g., atmospherically resistant
    vegetation index (ARVI) (Kaufman and Tanre 1992). Enhanced vegetation index (EVI)
    was developed to improve sensitivity in high biomass conditions while minimizing
    soil and atmosphere influences (Huete et al. 2002). Another group of VIs take
    advantage of the green band, i.e., GNDVI, simple ratio green (SRgreen), green
    red vegetation index (GRVI), to enhance chlorophyll pigment concentration signal
    (Gitelson and Merzlyak 1998; Chen 1996; Motohka et al. 2010). By using reflectance
    from the red edge band, NDRE, plant senescence reflectance index (PSRI) and red
    edge green index (REGI) were also found to be good indicators of canopy chlorophyll
    content (Barnese et al. 2000; Tilling et al. 2007; Merzlyak et al. 1999). Table
    2 Vegetation indices used for this study Full size table To separate vine canopy
    and soil pixels, we applied the Otsu thresholding method (Otsu 1979) to the NDVI
    imagery from each flight. The NDVI histogram over all pixels showed a bimodal
    distribution, one representing plant canopy and the other representing soil background.
    The Otsu thresholding method determined the optimal thresholding value to maximize
    the between-class variance and minimize the within-class variance (Meyer and Neto
    2008). The soil background pixels were then masked out, and only the remaining
    vegetated pixels were used for further analysis (Fig. 1). Considering the typical
    vine canopy size is about 200 cm in our study vineyards, we further applied a
    60 cm buffer from the center of the canopy to further exclude potentially remaining
    mixed pixels at the canopy edge; the average reflectance and VIs within the buffer
    were then extracted to match the canopy of the sampled grapevines in the field
    as shown in the following section. Field measurements Biophysical measurements
    were collected over 4 vines for each of the four blocks in the RIP720 vineyard,
    and over 10 vines in both BAR007 and BAR012 (Fig. 1). Within each block, vines
    were selected at the upwind locations from each flux tower in the predominant
    wind direction, and we sampled as many vines as possible within an hour to ensure
    that measurements within a day were collected under similar weather and sunlight
    conditions. We collected the high precision GPS coordinates of all sampled vines
    with Trimble Geo 7x. Leaf water potentials ) were measured concurrently with the
    UAV flights, using pressure chambers (PMS Inc., Oregon, USA 2) during a 1-h time
    window centered at local solar noon. For each sampled vine, three mature and sun
    exposed leaves were selected for measurements. The number of measured sample vines
    concurrent with UAV flights, for each IOP is listed in Table 1, along with weather
    conditions. We downloaded the hourly weather data including air temperature and
    relative humidity from CIMIS station website (https://cimis.water.ca.gov/). The
    closest stations, the Fresno State (#80) and Sanel Valley (#106) CIMIS stations,
    were selected for the RIP720 and BAR007/012 vineyards, respectively. These stations
    were 12 and 20 km away from the nearby vineyards. A comparison with data from
    the weather stations in the field showed a pretty good agreement. We calculated
    hourly VPD and averaged air temperature and VPD around solar noon (12:00–14:00)
    to represent the corresponding weather condition for each flight. Statistical
    approaches for leaf water potential estimation We first examined the univariable
    relationships between the field measured and the VIs, using Pearson correlation
    coefficients (r). This provided a baseline evaluation about the capability of
    mapping with a simple remotely sensed VI. Correlation was done first for each
    vineyard and each flight date, respectively; data from all days for each vineyard
    (n = 40 for RIP720 and n = 6 for BAR007, n = 11 for BAR012) were then pooled together
    to quantify the correlation across dates and sampled vines within each vineyard.
    Finally, all data points (n = 57) were used for general correlation across all
    days and vineyards. To develop a robust model for estimation, we explored various
    statistical approaches to combine remote sensing metrics and weather data. In
    addition to stepwise linear regression (LR), we explored three machine learning
    algorithms to capture potential non-linear complex relationships, i.e., support
    vector regression (SVR) (Pasolli et al. 2011), random forest (RF) (Zhou et al.
    2016), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB) (Ghatkar et al. 2019). The predictors
    include the reflectance of 5 individual spectral bands, 11 vegetation indices,
    and 2 weather variables (air temperature and VPD). The SVR algorithm has been
    used in remote sensing applications for biophysical parameter estimation (Tuia
    et al. 2011), soil moisture estimation (Pasolli et al. 2011), land surface temperature
    estimation (Moser and Serpico 2009), etc. This algorithm aims to find the best
    fit hyperplane that has the maximum number of points without exceeding the margin.
    The major advantages of SVR include that it is less prone to overfitting problems
    and it has good generalization capability when training samples are very limited
    (Calderón et al. 2015). The RF algorithm has been the most widely used machine
    learning approach in remote sensing applications, such as biomass estimation (Zhou
    et al. 2016) and surface temperature retrieval (Yang et al. 2017). The RF algorithm
    is based on multiple decision trees and bootstrapping. Individual regression trees
    are fitted to each bootstrap sample. By combining the prediction of individual
    decision tree, the final RF model can yield optimal results (Sagi and Rokach 2018).
    The RF algorithm is proved to be robust when some predictors are highly correlated
    (Clark 2017). Similar with RF, the XGB algorithm is also an ensemble learner.
    It is an optimized implementation of the gradient boost algorithm, featuring speed,
    scalability, and high efficiency. Different from RF, the decision trees in XGB
    were not independent from each other. The new tree was built based on previous
    tree by minimizing the prediction residuals. The XGB algorithm was found to outperform
    RF and SVR in some remote sensing applications, with higher prediction accuracy
    and less overfitting problems (Ghatkar et al. 2019; Pham et al. 2020). We built
    the above machine learning models using the “Caret” package in R (Kuhn 2008).
    To improve the model performance and reduce the number of potentially correlated
    predictors, the recursive feature elimination method was applied for feature selection.
    This method iteratively follows these steps: fit the data with all features given
    the specific model, rank the importance of all features, remove the feature that
    is least important, and refit the model. These steps are performed iteratively
    until the model with the least RMSE is found (Kuhn, 2008). The recursive feature
    elimination was done independently for each machine learning algorithms, and only
    the selected variables were used for model building. A repeated k-fold cross-validation
    method (k = 5, repeat = 10) was applied for both model building and testing. For
    each of the five folds, 80% of the observations (n = 45) were randomly selected
    as the training set, and the rest 20% (n = 12) were used as the independent testing
    set. We evaluated the model performance using three statistical measures: the
    coefficient of determination (R2), the root mean squared error (RMSE), and the
    mean absolute error (MAE) for each fold. The process was repeated 10 times and
    the mean and standard deviations of the statistical measures were summarized from
    five folds results. To further evaluate the value of incorporating weather variables
    in the models, we also built and tested the reduced models with a subset of input
    variables, i.e., excluding the weather variables (NoWeather). Considering that
    many low cost sensors do not have the red edge band, another set of reduced models
    were tested by further excluding the red edge reflectance and all red-edge VIs
    from the list of the predictors (e.g., NoRedEdgeNoWeather). Variable importance
    and response functions We quantified the importance of each predictor in estimating
    leaf water potential, using a metric called mean increase in node purity (the
    randomForest package in R), which is the average residual sum of squares decreases
    from splitting on the variables over all trees (Strobl et al. 2008) and thus represents
    each variable’s contribution to the improvement of the final prediction. To further
    understand the effects of each key predictor on , we derived the individual conditional
    expectation (ICE) plots (Goldstein et al. 2015). Unlike the partial dependence
    plots (PDP), the ICE plots not only quantify the marginal effect of a feature
    on the predicted outcome of a fitted model over all samples (Lemmens and Croux
    2006), but also depict the dependence of the prediction on a feature for each
    sample separately (Goldstein et al. 2015). The ICE plots can thus show how the
    specific variable affects the final prediction and at which values the influence
    of the variable is stronger (Arribas-Bel et al. 2017). The heterogeneous relationships,
    that are typically obscured in the PDP plots, are thus revealed. Field mapping
    and analysis of predicted The model with the best performance was then used to
    map the over the entire orchard for each flight, using the corresponding weather
    and VIs as predicting variables. To examine whether the spatial and temporal pattern
    of the predicted matched the treatments in the RIP720 vineyard, we extracted the
    values of the predicted map for each block, and generated the boxplots of the
    predicted for each block across different dates. In addition, to compare with
    the measured , the distribution of the predicted for each date was plotted as
    histogram. Results Relationship between leaf water potential and VIs and weather
    variables Within each vineyard, was found significantly correlated with the majority
    of vegetation indices over all sampled vines across multiple days (Table 3). All
    VIs had a correlation coefficient higher than 0.8 (p < 0.01), based on the data
    acquired during the two available flights in 2019 over the two BAR vineyards (n = 17).
    VIs based on the reflectance contrasts in the NIR and red bands, such as NDVI,
    ARVI, EVI, SAVI and OSAVI, had higher correlation with (r > 0.88) than other indices.
    VIs based on green band, i.e., GNDVI, GRVI and SRgreen, were also highly correlated
    with , with r higher than 0.83. Among chlorophyll indices, NDRE was strongly correlated
    (r = 0.84) while REGI was the least correlated (r = 0.68). In the RIP720 vineyard,
    the correlation between VIs and when combining all four flights in 2018 and 2020,
    were lower than those from the two BAR blocks, although significant. Among them,
    NDRE had the highest correlation with r = 0.56 (p < 0.001). However, when combining
    all data from three vineyards (BAR007, BAR012 and RIP720), the correlations between
    most VIs and were much lower and statistically less significant. NDRE and GRVI
    were the only VIs that were significantly correlated with , with a correlation
    coefficient of −0.27 (p < 0.01) and 0.25 (p < 0.01) (n = 57), respectively (Fig.
    2). Table 3 The Pearson correlation coefficients (r) between each vegetation index
    derived from UAV imagery and measured leaf water potential ( ), calculated for
    each individual flights, for each vineyard, and for all data Full size table Fig.
    2 Relationship between Normalized Difference RedEdge Index (NDRE) and measured
    leaf water potential ( ) of the sampled vines over RIP720 (solid circles) and
    BAR007 (open squares) and BAR012 (open triangles). The linear regression lines
    are also shown for RIP720, BAR007 and BAR012 vineyard blocks, respectively Full
    size image When evaluating the correlation between spatial variability of VIs
    with the measured within each vineyard, the performance of any single VI varied
    among different days, especially over RIP720. Over BAR007 and BAR012, slightly
    higher correlations were found in late June than late July; chlorophyll indices
    performed better on 27 June 2019, as PSRI and REGI had correlation with higher
    than 0.9. The structural indices had better performance on the second date (29
    July 2019), e.g., structural indices had a correlation higher than 0.82. For RIP720,
    correlations were generally higher for data acquired on 2 Aug 2020, while no significant
    correlation between VIs and was found on 26 July 2020. Similarly, for the 2018
    RIP720 flights, data acquired in later growing season showed higher correlation
    than the earlier days. The structural indices were only highly correlated with
    on the second day (5 Aug 2018), with most correlations higher than 0.6, while
    greenness index, e.g. GNDVI, and chlorophyll index, e.g. NDRE, had stable performance
    in two days, with r > 0.64. This shows that canopy structure indices were less
    sensitive to the vine water stress status than chlorophyll indices. We also found
    that the weather variables including air temperature and VPD had a significant
    linear relationship with across multiple vineyards and days (Fig. 3). The R2 between
    them versus were highest for air temperature (R2 = 0.59). For this particular
    scenario, higher air temperature was found to enhance water stress by 0.055 in
    (MPa) per °C increase in temperature based on the univariate regression. VPD also
    explained more than 50% of variations across days and vineyards. Higher VPD lead
    to higher water stress in grapevines. 1 kPa increase of VPD would increase by
    0.214 MPa. Fig. 3 Relationships between the measured leaf water potential ( )
    and a air temperature and b vapor pressure deficit averaged at noon (12:00–14:00)
    from the nearby weather stations. The linear regression lines from all site-dates
    were shown as solid lines Full size image Estimating based on machine learning
    models When pooling the data across all days and over the three vineyard blocks,
    the recursive feature elimination process resulted in a total of 10 variables
    to be included for the final models. Selected weather variables include air temperature
    and VPD, and VIs included NDRE, PSRI, EVI, GRVI, SAVI and SR. Two machine learning
    models, RF and XGB, outperformed other models (Table 4). The predicted by the
    RF full model agreed well with the measurements (Fig. 4), explaining more than
    78% of variance in the independent testing data, with a RMSE of 0.123 (±0.03)
    MPa and a MAE of 0.100 (±0.026) MPa (Fig. 4; Table 4). Other regression models
    had R2 lower than 0.67. The RF model performed slightly better than the XGB model
    and therefore was used for the following analysis. Table 4 Model performance from
    cross validation (repeat = 10, fold = 5; n = 14) for different leaf water potential
    estimation models, as represented by mean values of R2, RMSE, and MAE as well
    as the standard deviations in parenthesis Full size table Fig. 4 The comparison
    between the measured values of leaf water potential ( ) and the estimation from
    the random forest full model for the training dataset and testing dataset, respectively.
    Ground measurements from multiple dates and three vineyards were randomly split
    into training (80%, n = 45, open circles, dashed line) and testing (20%, n = 12,
    solid squares, solid line) Full size image We found that removing weather variables
    from the input variables, i.e., models with only remote sensing inputs, significantly
    reduced the prediction accuracy across all models (Table 4). For example, the
    RF model without weather variables only explained 52% of spatial and temporal
    variation in the observed and resulted in higher uncertainty as shown by higher
    RMSE of 0.189 MPa and MAE of 0.146 MPa. The robustness of the model also decreased,
    as shown by the increase of the standard deviation of the statistics from the
    repeated fivefold validation (Table 4). When further excluding the remote sensing
    metrics related to the red edge bands, the reduced RF models could only explain
    48% of spatial and temporal variation in (Table 4). We also found that the decrease
    in the prediction capability of the reduced models was most significant for SVM
    and stepwise linear regression approaches. Variable importance and determinants
    of Based on the RF full model, we found that the weather variables, including
    mean air temperature and VPD at noon, were the most important predictors, followed
    by the chlorophyll indices NDRE and PSRI (Fig. 5). The average RMSE across all
    decision trees would increase by 0.75 and 0.70 MPa when excluding air temperature
    or VPD from the full RF model, respectively. When NDRE (or PSRI) was not included
    in the RF model, the mean RMSE of the predicted leaf water potential would increase
    by 0.32 MPa (or 0.24 MPa). Fig. 5 The variable importance plots for a the full
    model and two reduced models by b excluding weather variables and by c further
    excluding RedEdge metrics, as shown in Table 4. X-axis represents the variable
    importance measured by the mean increase in node purity Full size image In the
    reduced model without weather variables, the greenness index GRVI and the chlorophyll
    index NDRE became most important. Excluding GRVI or NDRE from the NoWeather model
    would result in an increase of RMSE of 0.95 and 0.72 MPa, respectively. Their
    importance was much higher than NIR, EVI and PSRI, with mean RMSE increase ranging
    from 0.32 to 0.55. In the reduced model without weather and red edge variables,
    the greenness index GRVI, and the canopy structure-related band and index NIR
    and EVI became dominant for estimating . The mean RMSE across all trees would
    increase by 0.91, 0.78 and 0.50 MPa when GRVI, NIR and EVI were not included.
    The ICE plot based on the RF full model further illustrated the marginalized impact
    of key variables on the (Fig. 6). Warmer temperature was shown to increase water
    stress only slightly when the air temperature at noon was below 27.5 °C, but enhanced
    water stress dramatically beyond 27.5 °C (Fig. 6a). Similarly, higher VPD enhanced
    water stress as well, with the highest impacts between 2.5 and 3.0 kPa (Fig. 6b).
    The rapid increase of water stress beyond 27.5 °C and 2.5 kPa were constant over
    all samples. Among the VIs, we found that higher NDRE and higher EVI were associated
    with lower . The water stress decreased rapidly when NDRE reached 0.43 and 0.53
    (Fig. 6c). The water stress generally decreased with the increase of EVI, especially
    when EVI was above 0.78. Decreased water stress was also observed when EVI reached
    0.6 and 0.65 over part of samples, while there were some exceptions that don’t
    have similar patterns. Fig. 6 The individual conditional expectation plot of the
    leaf water potential ( ) on a air temperature, b vapor pressure deficit (VPD),

    (EVI). The grey lines represent the dependence of the predicted on a variable
    for each sample separately. Red lines representing the average dependence of the
    on a variable of all samples Full size image mapping and analysis of the predicted
    The map predicted by the RF full model using the UAV imagery and weather data
    showed a large spatial heterogeneity over the RIP720 vineyard (Fig. 7). The estimated
    median of block T1 and T2 were around −1.54 and −1.58 MPa on July 12th, 2018,
    significantly lower than the median of −1.48 and −1.52 MPa over blocks T3 and
    T4 (Fig. 7a). Similarly, on August 5th, 2018, blocks T1 and T2 were more stressed
    than T3 and T4, with a median of −1.60 vs. −1.53 MPa (Fig. 7b). This was consistent
    with the irrigation treatments that less water was applied to block T1 and T2
    in 2018. In 2020, the majority of T1 showed less water stress level than the other
    three blocks on both days (Fig. 7c, d). This also agreed well with the different
    irrigation treatment in 2020 applied to block T1. Fig. 7 Maps of the predicted
    leaf water potential ( ) based on the random forest full model for the RIP720
    vineyard during two IOP dates in 2018, a July 12th and b August 15th and two IOP
    dates in 2020, c July 26th and d August 2nd. Also shown are the locations of ground
    sampled vines Full size image The predicted maps also captured the overall temporal
    dynamics of (Figs. 7 and 8), consistent with the patterns observed by the ground
    measurements over the sampled vines. The block T1 and T2 were more stressed in
    August than July in 2018 (Figs. 7a, b and 8), due to deficit irrigation strategy
    typically implemented later in the season. In contrast, all four blocks recovered
    from water stress between July 26th to August 2nd after the intensive irrigation
    in 2020. Although in the predicted maps, we found T2 were more stressed than T3
    and T4 in 2020, which was different from the irrigation plan. This is likely because
    the sampled vines did not well represent the within block distribution of estimated
    (Figs. 7d, 9), especially due to the limited samples within each block over each
    sample day, with sample sizes ranging from 6 to 12. For example, the ground measurements
    of on July 12, 2018 (Fig. 9a) and on July 26, 2020 (Fig. 9c) ranged from −1.67
    to −1.48 MPa, and −1.65 to −1.55 MPa, respectively, while the predicted showed
    that there were some less stressed vines, which had higher than −1.48 and −1.55
    MPa. Fig. 8 The statistics of leaf water potential ( ) over each block in the

    Full size image Discussion Capability of machine learning models driven by UAV
    imagery Our study demonstrated that the multispectral imageries and weather information
    can be integrated into a machine learning model to capture the spatial and temporal
    variability of across different vineyards. The unified random forest full model
    based on UAV multispectral imageries and weather variables were shown to perform
    well over three vineyards with different varieties, soils, and spacing, and blocks
    of varying irrigation treatments. The assessment with independent validation data
    showed better or similar accuracy (R2 of 78%, RMSE of 0.122 MPa and MAE of 0.099
    MPa), than those reported by other vineyard studies with multi-spectral UAV imagery.
    In the current literature, Romero et al. (2018) sampled 16 vines in one single
    vineyard in China for each one of the 5 days, and built an ANN machine learning
    model to estimate from UAV multispectral images with an RMSE = 0.32 MPa and MAE = 0.35
    MPa for the validation set (20% of the total data points). Another ANN study (Poblete
    et al. 2017) with a larger sample size (90 vines over three days, and 20% were
    used for validation) over a Carmenere vineyard in Chile had a similar uncertainty
    for the validation set (RMSE = 0.12 MPa and MSE = 0.1 MPa). Impacts of weather
    and red edge metrics on water stress level estimation Our RF modeling analysis
    highlighted the importance of incorporating weather variables, including noontime
    mean air temperature and VPD to capture water stress level through time and across
    multiple vineyards. This finding is supported by the concept of the soil–plant-atmosphere
    continuum (Elfving et al. 1972), governing the plant water stress level as quantified
    by the . Suter et al. (2019) suggested that to allow for temporal comparisons
    of plant water potential, a standardization of plant water potential with both
    soil water availability and weather conditions is required. Similarly, studies
    have been conducted to build a baseline or as a function of VPD to interpret the
    measurements and manage irrigation for prune (McCutchan and Shackel 1992), almond
    (Shackel et al. 1997) and grapevine (Williams and Baeza 2007; Olivo et al. 2009).
    The calculation of CWSI also includes the weather conditions. The lower baseline
    of CWSI was determined by the relationship between VPD and the difference of canopy
    and air temperature of well-watered plants (Jackson et al. 1981). We also found
    that the remote sensing metrics involving the red edge spectral band further increased
    the capability of estimating vine water stress. The red edge band and indices
    have been reported to be associated with chlorophyll content and physiological
    status (Barnes et al. 2000; Clevers et al. 2010; Clevers and Gitelson 2013). As
    low chlorophyll content usually reflects that the plants are under stress, the
    red edge based indices have been applied to detect various plant stressors. For
    example, NDRE effectively captured the variability of nitrogen status in wheat
    (Tilling et al. 2007) and detected charcoal rot disease in soybean (Brodbeck et
    al. 2017) and water deficiency in maize (Becker et al. 2020). Uncertainties and
    future work Although promising as a proof of concept, our results are limited
    by the available ground measurements due to the challenging in collecting with
    pressure chambers in the field and constrained by the number and diversity of
    the sampled vineyards. To further test and improve the robustness of the model,
    more field survey data and concurrent UAV flights are needed to represent a broader
    range of vineyards, environmental conditions, and water stress levels. For example,
    more samples over different cultivars and trailing systems will allow us to examine
    how other factors may affect the model performance. Given a sufficient number
    of ground truth data covering various water status, machine learning based classification
    approach can also be developed to detect the categorical stress levels, e.g.,
    from low, moderate, to severe stress to guide irrigation management. Our study
    only used optical metrics derived from five spectral bands available from the
    MicaSense camera. Unlike thermal data, the VIs generated from UAV multispectral
    data can only detect water stress levels indirectly and thus have certain limitations.
    For example, the VIs have been reported to perform differently when predicting
    the grapevine water stress levels for different cultivars and different growth
    stages. For example, widely-used canopy structure index NDVI was found to have
    high correlation with (Baluja et al. 2012) of rain-fed Tempranillo vines, with
    R2 = 0.68, but had relatively low correlation with stomatal conductance (R2 = 0.32)
    of subsurface-irrigated Cabernet Sauvignon vines (Espinoza et al. 2017) and (R2 = 0.35)
    of drip-irrigated Carmenere vines (Poblete et al. 2017). Chlorophyll index TCARI/OSAVI
    was reported to have high correlation with (R2 = 0.68) of rain-fed Tempranillo
    vines, but not significant correlation with (R2 = 0.09, p > 0.05) for drip-irrigated
    Carmenere vines (Poblete et al. 2017). We also found different performances of
    VI-based approaches across vineyards. In BAR007 and BAR012, the different water
    stress levels among different vines were probably caused more by different topography,
    soil conditions, cultivars, and long-term irrigation strategies. These long-term
    factors contributed to distinct plant physiological variables among different
    vines, which can be well captured by VIs. For example, topography likely affects
    the spatial heterogeneity of vine growth and size. The steeper slopes may result
    in more runoff and less soil water retention (Brillante et al. 2018), while aspects
    affect the amount of solar radiation received by the vines (Biss 2020). In the
    RIP720 vineyard, the different water stress levels were caused by relatively short-term
    irrigation treatments, thus the relationships between VIs and were less significant
    and these shorter stress events as noted earlier can only be determined if thermal
    data are available (Knipper et al. 2019). Several studies have used multispectral
    and hyperspectral cameras that can measure photochemical reflectance index (PRI),
    solar-induced fluorescence (SIF), water index (WI) to detect plant water stress
    (Peñuelas et al. 1997; Zarco-Tejada et al. 2012, 2013). Adding spectral reflectance
    and VIs from additional spectral and thermal bands will further improve the capability
    of remote monitoring water stress. We recognize that the UAV imaging is constrained
    by the limited payload and processing a large data volume of super high resolution
    aerial imagery can be time consuming or costly, despite the availability of commercial
    drone imagery processing software such as Pix4D. Therefore, the UAV based approach
    can be rather challenging to scale it up for operational water stress mapping
    at a larger scale. To address this scalability issue, an important next step is
    to combine less frequent but high spatial resolution imagery from UAV systems
    or satellites such as PlanetScope with more frequent moderate resolution imagery
    from Landsat and Sentinel 2 satellite series (Houborg and McCabe 2018). The data
    fusion from multiple sensors will allow for mapping vine water stress more frequently
    throughout the growing season. One important consideration is the spectral configuration
    of different sensors. Radiometric consistency across cameras should always be
    evaluated to correct for potential biases between reflectance observed from different
    remote sensing systems; or the machine learning models need to be re-trained using
    the imagery from different systems. Potential applications for irrigation management
    By combing UAV based multispectral data and weather information, the unified machine
    learning model, once trained and validated, can estimate the grapevine water stress
    level at 8 cm scale across the whole field of any vineyards in the region. This
    approach can potentially supplement the traditional ground measurements of over
    sampled vines with pressure chambers, and scale up to capture the within-field
    spatial heterogeneity in a timely and efficient way. With the water stress level
    map produced with the model and remote sensing imagery, the growers can design
    the informed irrigation zones and manage their irrigation schedule more precisely.
    One of the key remaining issues is how quickly one can generate these leaf water
    potential maps and make it available to the growers. Conclusion We developed and
    tested the capability of UAV systems for monitoring water status in three commercial
    vineyards in California, USA. We found that the models based on remote sensing
    only metrics cannot be generalized across the vineyards. The RF model was built
    to estimate at 8 cm, using ground measurements from all fields and all dates,
    the corresponding remote sensing metrics from high resolution imagery from the
    Micasense Rededge multispectral camera, and weather data. Our validation with
    independent testing data showed that the RF full model can predict well with a
    R2 of 0.778, RMSE of 0.123 MPa, and MAE of 0.100 MPa. The weather variables including
    air temperature and VPD were critical for capturing the large scale variability,
    i.e., across vineyards and across dates. The red edge band, however, provided
    important information for the within field variability of . The map produced with
    the RF model was able to capture both temporal and spatial variability of water
    stress level of the vineyard, consistent with irrigation management and patterns
    observed from the ground sampling. Our results demonstrated the potential of the
    multi-spectral UAV system for providing data-driven information to guide precision
    irrigation management. Availability of data The data that support the findings

    Get rights and content Highlights • A MLR model built in cropland using Sentinel-1
    and soil moisture probes. • The model used temporal statistics of Sentinel-1 data
    and had a RMSE of 0.02 m3 m−3. • Soil water dynamics were mapped at 30-m across
    one field in the cropping season. • Location-specific and time-dependent interaction
    between water and control factors. • The method can be applied elsewhere to improve
    irrigation under climate change. Abstract Advances in sensor technologies provide
    the potential for real-time monitoring of soil moisture status. Little work has
    been conducted to study the spatial and temporal variations of soil water content
    at the field scale and the interactions between soil water content and environmental
    controlling factors in cropped fields during the growing season. In this study,
    we assessed the spatial and temporal variations of surface soil water content
    (0–0.1 m) using seven in-situ soil moisture probes and Sentinel-1 satellite data
    over the 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons in irrigated fields of the Central Sands
    Plains, Wisconsin, USA. An empirical multiple linear regression model was developed
    between the soil water content with Sentinel-1 backscatter data. The model was
    evaluated with leave-one-group-out cross-validation, which showed an R2 of 0.60,
    mean error of –0.00 m3 m−3, root mean square error of 0.02 m3 m−3, and Lin’s concordance
    correlation coefficient of 0.75. Soil volumetric water content (VWC) and soil
    water deficit (SWD) were mapped at 30-m resolution every 6–12 days across one
    field (DU field at the Wallendal farm). Using two statistical metrics (“first
    metric” and “last metric”) and a bootstrapping approach, the location-specific
    and time-dependent interactions between estimated soil water content and environmental
    controlling factors across the DU field during the cropping season were evaluated,
    and it was found that such interactions were affected by initial soil water content
    and plant stress status. The robustness of the model needs to be improved in the
    future by collecting more VWC measurements in different soil and crop conditions.
    The method has the potential to provide a baseline soil moisture map and can be
    coupled with mechanistic models and subsoil VWC measurements for improved irrigation
    management and water use efficiency under a changing climate. Previous article

    Introduction Knowledge of soil water dynamics is important in agriculture because
    real-time estimation of soil water content at the field scale will improve irrigation
    effectiveness (Liang et al., 2016) and crop water use efficiency (Huang et al.,
    2018). It is also important in hydrology, climate science, and ecology because
    it couples the water and energy cycles via evapotranspiration (Robinson et al.,
    2008, Seneviratne et al., 2010). With the advent of digital agriculture (United
    Nations, 2017), advances in sensor technologies and the Internet of Things have
    emphasized the need for real-time monitoring of soil moisture status. Such soil
    moisture monitoring networks include USDA’s Natural Resources Conservation Service’s
    Soil Climate Analysis Network (SCAN; Schaefer et al., 2007), US Climate Reference
    Network (USCRN; Bell et al., 2013), and other national and international soil
    moisture networks (Dorigo et al., 2011, Quiring et al., 2016). Although these
    networks have provided knowledge at regional to continental scales in evaluating
    satellite-based soil moisture products (Al Bitar et al., 2012), monitoring drought
    (Mozny et al., 2012), and estimating deep drainage (Wyatt et al., 2017), they
    cannot be directly used to understand the variation of soil water content at the
    field scale. The lack of soil moisture estimates at the field scale at high spatial
    and temporal resolutions is mainly due to two reasons. Firstly, soil water content
    is heterogeneous in space and dynamics in time with environmental controlling
    factors (e.g. meteorological forcing, topography, soil, vegetation) varying at
    different scales (Joshi and Mohanty, 2010, Vereecken et al., 2014). However, soil
    moisture networks are often sparse and available at a much coarser spatial scale
    (e.g. one station per state for USCRN), which cannot be used to characterize the
    heterogeneity of soil water content at the field scale for agricultural application
    or hydrological and ecological modeling. Secondly, long-term soil moisture networks
    are installed mainly in forest or grassland soils in an effort to minimize human
    disturbances during data collection (Dorigo et al., 2011, Quiring et al., 2016).
    Although soil moisture sensors can be used in cropland for research-oriented experiments
    (e.g. Liang et al., 2016, Huang et al., 2017a), it is cost-prohibitive to install
    and maintain these sensors during the growing seasons and remove them prior to
    harvesting. Therefore, information is limited about the spatial and temporal variations
    of soil water content at the field scale, as well as the location-specific and
    time-dependent interactions between soil water content and environmental controlling
    factors, particularly over the cropping seasons (e.g. Liang et al., 2016, Scudiero
    et al., 2018). Advances in remote sensing and spatial–temporal modeling provide
    a potential solution. By coupling data from soil moisture probes with remotely
    sensed datasets, it is possible to use various physical and empirical models to
    predict soil moisture across large spatial extents at fine spatial and temporal
    resolutions (Wang and Qu, 2009). Recently, microwave remote sensing has become
    popular because it is less affected by atmosphere noises (e.g. clouds) compared
    with optical and thermal remote sensing platforms. Successful examples include
    passive microwave sensors that have fine temporal resolutions (e.g. 3 days) but
    coarse spatial resolutions (e.g. greater than 10 km) such as the Soil Moisture
    and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission (Kerr et al., 2001) and Soil Moisture Active
    Passive (SMAP) mission (Entekhabi et al., 2010, Pan et al., 2016). More recently,
    active microwave sensors have been used to estimate soil water content such as
    Sentinel-1 (Paloscia et al., 2013, Gao et al., 2017), which has fine spatial resolutions
    (e.g. 10 m) but coarse temporal resolutions (e.g. 6–12 days). Although researchers
    have used microwave sensors for estimating soil water content, little research
    has been done to understand the interactions between soil water content and environmental
    controlling factors in cropland over the growing seasons. Because these environmental
    controlling factors (e.g. rainfall, irrigation, soil texture, vegetation) often
    vary in space and time, it is expected that the interactions between soil water
    content and controlling factors are time-dependent (Zhu and Lin, 2011). In this
    study, we first present a model that estimates the spatial and temporal variations
    of surface soil water content (0–0.1 m depth) using in-situ soil moisture probes
    and Sentinel-1 data collected over two cropping seasons in irrigated fields of
    the Central Sands Plains, Wisconsin, USA. This region covers over 708,000 ha and
    is an important crop production area that relies on irrigation. The study will
    test two hypotheses: 1) surface (0–0.1 m) soil water content can be predicted
    at the high resolution (30-m) in sandy soils using a novel empirical model established
    using the Sentinel-1 data over the cropping seasons, and 2) the interactions between
    soil water content and controlling factors are location-specific and time-dependent
    and can be quantified using the estimates of soil water content at the high spatial
    resolution (i.e. 30 m). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Study area The study areas
    included 6 irrigated fields at the Wallendal (Longitude: −89.6748, Latitude: 43.9054)
    and Coloma farms (Longitude: −89.5955, Latitude: 44.0156) in Central Sands Plains
    in Wisconsin, USA. The fields are approximately 25–40 ha in size (Fig. 1). The
    soils are mostly sandy, with sand content larger than 80% (Yost et al., 2019).
    Soils are classified as Typic Udipsamments and Arenic Hapludalfs according to
    USDA Soil Taxonomy. The fields at Wallendal farms are used for potato, soybean,
    and corn production with the rotation of various vegetables and fruits (e.g. kidney
    bean and pumpkin) and forage crops (e.g. alfalfa) and cover crops (e.g. hay-Sudan
    grass) while the fields at Coloma farms are mainly cropped with potato and soybeans.
    Different crops may be planted within the same field to maximize the water use
    efficiency based on variations in soil texture. For example, at the DU field of
    Wallendal farms (Fig. 1), kidney bean, hay-sudan grass, and pumpkin were planted
    over the 2016 cropping season. Download : Download high-res image (665KB) Download

    field names are highlighted for Wallendal and Coloma farms. Irrigation is applied
    using center-pivot systems with irrigation events scheduled every 2 or 3 days
    during the growing seasons in 2016 and 2017. The study sites are irrigated based
    on adjusted evapotranspiration estimates from the climate data measured at the
    Hancock Agricultural Research Station, approximately 12 km northeast of the study
    site. At Hancock, daily potential evapotranspiration is calculated using the FAO
    Penman-Monteith method (Allen et al., 1998). Adjusted evapotranspiration is calculated
    by multiplying the potential evapotranspiration by the crop coefficient based
    on the crop type and growth stage (Wisconsin Irrigation Scheduler, 2018). For
    instance, different irrigation rates were applied for different crops using the
    center-pivot irrigator at the DU field (Table 1). Table 1. Cumulative irrigation

    probe data The soil moisture probes used were manufactured by AquaSpy Inc. (San
    Diego, CA, USA). They are based on the capacitance method. One set of soil moisture
    probes have 12 individual sensors and can measure relative soil water content
    with a 0.1-m depth increment at 12 depths between 0 and 1.2 m (Paterson et al.,
    2009). Seven sets of moisture probes were installed at six irrigated fields at
    the Wallendal and Coloma farms in either 2016 or 2017. One set of soil moisture
    probes were installed in each of the four fields at the Wallendal farm (i.e. “DU”,
    “KRM”, “Lobby East”, “Thorson”) (Fig. 1). At the Coloma farm, a set of probes
    were installed in the center of field “home” and two sets of probes were installed
    in the two irrigation management zones (“Powell-Dry” and “Powell-Wet”) of field
    “Powell”. The irrigation management zones of the Powell field were delineated
    based on a map of soil apparent electrical conductivity measured by a Veris-3100
    (see Section 2.5 for details). A universal calibration equation was applied to
    convert the soil moisture sensor measurements to soil volumetric water content
    (VWC, m3 m−3) (Yost et al., 2019). In this study, a depth of 0–10 cm was used
    because it was close to the effective measuring depth of the active microwave
    sensor (Paloscia et al., 2013). 2.3. Sentinel-1 data The remote sensing data collected
    from the recently launched European Space Agency – Sentinel-1 was used in the
    study. It is a phase-preserving dual polarization Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
    system. The SAR transmits a signal at a dual-polarization C-band frequency in
    either horizontal or vertical polarization, and then receives the backscatter
    intensity in both horizontal and vertical polarizations. As soil VWC increases,
    the dielectric constant of the soil–water mixture increases, with the change detected
    by backscatter intensity (Njoku and Kong, 1977, Dobson et al., 1985). Sentinel-1
    platform is a two-satellite constellation and provides land surface backscatter
    measurements at 10 m × 10 m every 6–12 days depending on the number of available
    satellites that fly over the study area. Sentinel-1 satellite data were obtained
    over the cropping seasons across the study fields from 2016 to 2017 using the
    Google Earth Engine platform (Gorelick et al., 2017). The data used in the study
    area included the ground range detected scenes collected in the interferometric
    wide swath mode every 6–12 days. Each image contained the single-band VV (single
    co-polarization, vertical transmit/vertical receive) and dual-band VV + VH (dual-band
    cross-polarization, vertical transmit/horizontal receive) and the incidence angle
    of the sensor. Each scene was pre-processed with Sentinel-1 Toolbox following
    thermal noise removal, radiometric calibration, terrain correction using SRTM
    30-m digital elevation model (Rabus et al., 2003). The final terrain corrected
    values were converted to decibels via log scaling (10*log10(x)) and quantized
    to 16-bits (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/sentinel1). In this study,
    we used the Sentinel-1 data at 30-m resolution instead of 10 m because it can
    eliminate the speckle effects in the Sentinel-1 radar data (Gao et al, 2017).
    The resampling of original 10-m Sentinel-1 data to 30-m resolution was carried
    out using the nearest neighbor algorithm. Different spatial upscaling (Crow et
    al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2017) and downscaling (Peng et al., 2017) methods have
    been previously used to interpolate soil moisture estimates from soil moisture
    sensor networks or remote sensing platforms onto the targeted resolutions using
    other remote sensing platform measurements or geoinformation-based information
    such as topographical, soil attribute, and vegetation characteristics. In terms
    of mapping soil VWC using Sentinel-1, the change detection methods based on the
    linear relationship between changes in VWC and backscatter data are popular and
    have been recently applied to obtain global soil VWC retrievals at 500-m resolution
    (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018). Based on previous studies, an empirical modeling
    approach was used in this study given soil texture is relatively homogenous (sandy)
    across the study fields. First, the temporal statistics of the VV and VH backscatter
    data were calculated at each pixel over the whole 2016 and 2017 cropping period.
    These include temporal minimum, mean, maximum, range and standard deviation. These
    temporal statistics of the sensor measurements over time are used because they
    often contain useful information related to the characteristics of the soil and
    vegetation in the field (Robinson et al., 2012, Pierdicca et al., 2014, Huang
    et al., 2017a, Pedrera-Parrilla et al., 2017, Attarzadeh et al., 2018, Bauer-Marschallinger
    et al., 2018) and thus could be included as covariates to predict soil water content.
    2.4. Establishing an empirical soil water content model A multiple linear regression
    (MLR) model was used to predict soil VWC at 0–0.10 m using the Sentinel VV, VH,
    their temporal statistics, and the incidence angle of the sensor. The incidence
    angle was used to account for the effect of the relative position of the microwave
    sensor on the backscatter of the signal as suggested by Alexakis et al. (2017).
    Due to the strong correlations between several temporal statistics of VV and VH
    data (e.g. VV, VV_max), we excluded them as input covariates. A backward elimination
    approach was used to select the significant covariates for the regression model
    at a significance level of 0.05. To evaluate the model uncertainty, the 95% upper
    and lower confidence intervals of the predicted VWC from the MLR model established
    using all 7 locations were calculated using the JMP software (JMP 14, SAS). Given
    the small number of observation points used for establishing the MLR model (i.e.
    58) and the relatively uniform landscape and soil texture across the study area,
    we did not use the non-linear models such as artificial neural networks as suggested
    by other researchers (Paloscia et al., 2013, Alexakis et al., 2017, Gao et al.,
    2017). Note that a larger soil VWC-Sentinel-1 dataset was not available in this
    study area over two years due to two reasons. First, the farmers rotated the sensors
    for different fields every year after harvesting the crops. As such, soil VWC
    measurements were not available in one field for both years (Table 2). Second,
    although the repeat cycle for Sentinel-1 (2 satellites) is 6–12 days, the cropping
    season in Wisconsin, USA is short (i.e. from mid-May to early September). Because
    different sensors needed to be installed in different fields after planting and
    removed before harvesting, the available soil VWC measurements became fewer during
    the two years. Although the sampling size of the VWC-Sentinel-1 measurements was
    small (i.e. 58), we used it to predict VWC and to infer the soil moisture variability
    in the study area, whereby the soils were dominated by relatively uniform sandy
    soils with sand content larger than 80% (Yost et al., 2019). Table 2. Summary

    0.63 To assess the robustness of the MLR model with selected covariates, we used
    leave-one-group-out cross-validation as performed by Huang et al. (2017b). To
    predict soil water content at one sampling location (one set of moisture probes)
    at different times, we first used the remaining 6 sampling locations (6 moisture
    probes) to fit the linear regression model with the same covariates as selected
    above and applied the model onto this sampling location to obtain the predicted
    VWC. We then performed this validation approach 7 times to obtain the predicted
    VWC at all 7 locations at different times in turn. Note that 7 MLR models were
    established in turn to evaluate the model performance via the cross-validation
    approach while the MLR model that used VWC measurements from all 7 locations was
    used in the next section to predict VWC in the DU field and for the following
    analysis of interactions between soil VWC and environmental factors. The coefficient
    of determination (R2), Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (Lin, 1989),
    mean error (bias), and root mean square error (accuracy) were calculated based
    on the measured VWC from soil moisture probes and predicted VWC from the leave-one-group-out
    cross-validation. Note that Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient (Lin, 1989)
    measures the agreement between two variables and is calculated from a sample as:
    where and are the means for the measured and predicted variables and and are the
    corresponding variances; has a value between 0 and 1, with values closer to 1
    indicating a stronger agreement of measured variables versus predicted variables
    (closer to 1:1 line). 2.5. Predicting the spatial and temporal variations in VWC
    across the field The fitted MLR model based on VWC measurements from all the soil
    moisture probes and selected covariates in Section 2.4 were applied onto a 30-m
    grid across one study field (i.e. field DU in the Wallendal farm) at different
    times over the 2016 cropping season. This field was selected for illustration
    purpose given that three crops were planted in 2016. The resulting maps of VWC
    were at 30-m resolutions every 6–12 days. Information about the environmental
    controlling factors was also obtained across the DU field. A digital elevation
    model was obtained from the US Geological Surveys (USGS, 2018) at a 1/3rd arc-second
    (∼10 m) spatial resolution. Topographic wetness index (TWI) was calculated using
    SAGA-GIS (Conrad et al., 2015) based on the 10-m digital elevation model. Maps
    of soil particle size fractions (i.e. clay, silt, and sand contents), bulk density
    (BD), and soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration at the depth of 0–0.05 m and
    100-m resolution were obtained from Ramcharan et al. (2018). Field capacity (FC)
    at −10 kPa and permanent wilting point (PWP) at –1,500 kPa were estimated based
    on published pedo-transfer functions from the same region using soil clay, silt,
    and sand content, BD, and SOC concentration (Yost and Hartemink, 2019): (1) (2)
    Soil apparent electrical conductivity (ECa) data were also collected across the
    field using a Veris-3100 (Salina, KS, USA). The shallow mode was used, which measured
    soil ECa at an effective depth of 0.0–0.30 m. Low ECa values often indicate sandy
    and drier soils, while higher ECa values represent clayey and wetter soils (Corwin
    and Lesch, 2003). To quantify the relative amount of soil water that is available
    to plants, we calculated soil water deficit (SWD, %) across the DU field using
    the following formula (Berliner and Oosterhuis, 1987, Patanè and Cosentino, 2010):
    (3) where was the soil water content estimated on one day over the 2016 cropping
    season, and and were estimated from Eqs. (1), (2). 2.6. Understanding the location-specific
    and time-dependent interactions between VWC and environmental controlling factors
    To quantify the relative contribution of different environmental controlling factors
    on VWC, two statistical metrics were used. The first metric determines which covariate
    (i.e. environmental factor) alone is able to explain the response. It calculates
    the univariate coefficient of determination (R2) values from the linear regression
    models of VWC with one covariate only (e.g. soil clay content). In other words,
    these univariate R2 values are identical to the squared correlation coefficients
    of the covariate with the response. If covariates are correlated, the sum of these
    individual contributions is often higher than the overall R2 of the model with
    all covariates together, i.e., the overall model explains less than the sum of
    all individual models. For brevity, we call this metric the “first metric” (Grömping,
    2006). The second metric used determines which covariate is able to explain the
    variance of response in addition to all other covariates that are present. We
    ascribe to each covariate the increase in R2 when including this covariate as
    the last covariate. If covariates are correlated, these contributions often add
    up to far less than the overall R2 of the model with all covariates together.
    We call this metric the “last metric” (Grömping, 2006). To understand the location-specific
    controls of environmental factors on VWC, we calculated the temporal mean and
    standard deviation (SD) of the estimated VWC across the DU field during the 2016
    cropping season. We assumed that the long-term (i.e. during the entire cropping
    season) temporal mean and SD of VWC at the field scale were mainly affected by
    the spatial variations in the environmental factors (i.e. crop types, soil texture)
    and thus the interactions between VWC and environmental factors were mainly location-specific.
    To understand the time-dependent effects of environmental controlling factors
    on VWC, changes of VWC over short periods (i.e. between June 9th and 14th, and
    between July 15th and 20th in 2016) at the DU field were used. Dates of June 9th
    and 14th were selected because no irrigation event occurred during this period
    and the water input came from rainfall only. Dates of July 15th and 20th were
    selected to represent the scenario when both irrigation and rainfall occurred
    over the period (Table 1). Note that mean VWC on June 9th (0.13 m3 m−3) was smaller
    than that of July 15th (mean VWC of 0.15 m3 m−3). This enabled us to study the
    initial soil water condition on the interactions between VWC and environmental
    controlling factors. The conditions include an initially dry soil condition (June
    9th) and an initially wet soil condition (July 15th). We assumed that the short-term
    (i.e. during a few days) changes of VWC at the field scale were mainly affected
    by the temporal variations in the environmental factors (e.g. rainfall, irrigation)
    and thus the interactions between VWC and environmental factors were mainly event-based
    and time-dependent. Here, the “first” and “last” metrics were used to quantify
    the correlations between VWC and environmental factors. In terms of the location-specific
    effects of environmental factors on VWC, the model response is the temporal mean
    or temporal SD of VWC over the 2016 cropping season calculated for each pixel
    across the DU field. In terms of the time-dependent effects of environmental factors
    on VWC, the model response is the changes of VWC over short periods (i.e. between
    June 9th and 14th, and between July 15th and 20th in 2016) that were calculated
    for every pixel across the DU field at 30-m resolution. For both effects, the
    covariates are the different environmental controlling factors, including factors
    varying in space such as soil properties (ECa, clay and sand contents, BD, SOC),
    crop types, and topography (elevation and TWI), and factors varying in space and
    time such as sum of cumulative rainfall and irrigation. In terms of space-varying
    factors, spatial distributions of soil properties and topography were obtained
    from various maps described in Section 2.5. Silt content was not used due to its
    strong correlation with sand content. Spatial distributions of crop types were
    obtained from the farmers (Fig. 1). Numeric values of 1, 2 and 3 were assigned
    to the areas of Kidney bean, hay-Sudan grass, and Pumpkin, respectively, based
    on their increasing initial evapotranspiration (ET) coefficient determined by
    the FAO (2018). In terms of spatial–temporal varying factors, cumulative rainfall
    was measured using a rain gauge on the farm over different time intervals assuming
    it was uniform across the whole field. Cumulative irrigation was calculated based
    on the actual irrigation maps provided by the farmers over different time intervals
    whereby different irrigation rates were used for different crop types. In this
    study, we assumed the average rates of irrigation water applied by the center-pivot
    along the radial direction were proportional to the rates applied for the different
    crop types (Fig. 1). This led to an average irrigation rate within the same crop
    type over different periods (Table 1). Because the rainfall was relatively uniform
    across the field, the sum of rainfall and irrigation was used to represent the
    overall water input. As mentioned in Section 2.4, only 58 coupled VWC-Sentinel-1
    measurements were available in this study. To minimize the effect of the small
    sample size on the robustness of the MLR model and the following interaction analysis
    between VWC and environmental factors, we adopted a bootstrapping approach. We
    described this in turn as follows. 1) Randomly sample the 58 coupled VWC-Sentinel-1
    measurements 58 times with replacement. This generated a dataset of 58 VWC-Sentinel-1
    measurements with identical measurements. 2) Fit an MLR model using this bootstrap
    dataset and the selected covariates in Section 2.4 and predict soil VWC across
    the DU field on different days over the 2016 cropping season. 3) Calculate the
    temporal mean and SD of the VWC and short-term changes of VWC (i.e. June 9th –
    14th and July 15th − 20th) across the DU field and calculate the “first” and “last”
    metrics. 4) Repeat steps 1) – 3) 1,000 times and calculate the histograms of the
    “first” and “last” metrics. Calculation of the “first” and “last” metrics was
    done using the “relaimpo” package of the R software (Grömping, 2006) and the bootstrapping
    approach was done using the base “sample” function in the R software (R Core Team,
    2019). The relative contributions of different environmental factors to the temporal
    SD and short-term changes of VWC did not change for different bootstrap datasets
    because the effects of bootstrapping sampling were canceled out when the SD and
    changes of VWC were calculated. Therefore, only the relative contributions were
    reported for these scenarios. 3. Results 3.1. Summary temporal statistics of soil
    water content Soil VWC at 0–0.1 m depth measured with a sensor on a daily basis
    in the DU field over the 2016 cropping season is presented in Fig. 2. VWC ranged
    from 0.14 m3 m−3 to 0.28 m3 m−3. The pattern of soil VWC is consistent with the
    irrigation and rainfall events. The summary temporal statistics of VWC at all
    7 locations in 2016 or 2017 are shown in Table 2. In general, VWC values are normally
    distributed during the cropping seasons in 2016 and 2017. The minimum, mean, median,
    maximum, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (CV) of VWC vary between
    different locations, with the minimum VWC ranging from 0.05 m3 m−3 in Coloma-Powell-Dry
    field to 0.14 m3 m−3 in Wallendal-DU field and the maximum VWC ranging from 0.20 m3
    m−3 in Coloma-Powell-Dry field to 0.31 m3 m−3 in Wallendal-Thorson field (Table

    in the DU field over the 2016 cropping season in the Central Sands Plains of Wisconsin,
    USA. Daily irrigation (mm) and rainfall (mm) were measured in the field. Daily
    average air temperature and solar radiation were measured from the Hancock weather
    station. It was also noted that in Coloma-Powell field, mean VWC values measured
    by the probe in the dry zone (0.10 m3 m−3, Coloma-Powell-Dry, selected based on
    a Veris ECa map) were generally smaller than those measured by another probe in
    the wet zone (0.19 m3 m−3, Coloma-Powell-Wet, selected based on the Veris ECa
    map). 3.2. Model accuracy and precision The summary of the multiple linear regression
    model is shown in Table 3. Backscatter data from VH, mean and maximum values of
    VH, mean values of VV, and incidence angle were selected for predicting VWC at
    0–0.1 m soil depth. With all the covariates selected, the fitted MLR had an R2
    value of 0.678 and root mean square error of 0.02 m3 m−3. When applied onto the
    soil moisture probe over the 2016 growing season, the model had a good performance
    given that the most of the VWC measurements were within 95% upper and lower confidence
    intervals of the prediction (Fig. 2). Table 3. Summary statistics of the multiple

    of VWC at these sites was only 0.2 m3 m−3). Lin’s concordance correlation coefficient
    of the validation result is 0.75, indicating a reasonably good agreement between
    the measured VWC and predicted VWC (Lin, 1989). It was noted that the MLR model
    had different performance in different fields due to the variations in soil properties
    and crop types (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (180KB) Download :

    performance was different for different fields with varying soil texture, ground
    roughness, and crops. As shown in Fig. 3, the model had a highest accuracy in
    Wallendal-Thorson (Seed corn, R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.021), followed by Wallendal-KRM
    (Soybean, R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 0.017), Wallendal-Lobby-East (Pumpkin, R2 = 0.35,

    of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties The spatial
    distributions of estimated environmental controlling factors and soil properties
    are presented for the DU field (Fig. 4). The elevation is relatively uniform and
    it gradually decreases from the southeast corner (313 m) towards the north and
    west (310 m) of the field (Fig. 4a). The variations of ECa (Fig. 4b) and clay
    content (Fig. 4c) are small but not negligible across the field, whereby soil
    of high ECa (greater than5 mS m−1) and clay content (9–11%) is located in the
    northwest and center of the field while soil of low ECa (2–3 mS m−1) and clay
    content (4–6%) is found in isolated places and particularly close to the southwest
    corner of the field. The spatial distributions of SOC (Fig. 4d), FC (Fig. 4e),
    and PWP (Fig. 4f) are similar to that of clay content. Download : Download high-res

    VWC and SWD during the cropping season The spatial and temporal variations of
    estimated VWC using the empirical MLR model at the DU field over the 2016 cropping
    season are presented (Fig. 5). In general, VWC values increased from June 9th
    to 14th due to a rainfall event of 32.8 mm and increased from July 15th to 20th
    due to a rainfall event of 26.4 mm and three irrigation events with cumulative
    amount of water of 27.9 mm for kidney bean and hay-Sudan grass and 20.3 mm for
    pumpkin (Table 1 and Fig. 2). The changes of VWC were different during these two
    periods across the field. The change of VWC from June 9th to 14th was mostly in
    the north and west of the field while the change of VWC from July 15th to 20th
    was mostly in the south and east. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    the empirical MLR model A trade-off exists between the accuracy and spatial resolutions
    of the soil VWC retrieval models. Well-established models based on microwave remote
    sensing can have good model accuracy (e.g. RMSE < 0.04 m3 m−3) but the spatial
    resolutions are often too coarse such as 3 km to 36 km for SMAP (NASA, 2019) and
    500 m for Sentinel-1 (Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018) for field scale agricultural
    management and hydrological studies. The multiple linear regression model is reasonably
    good in this study. This can be attributed to the relatively uniform soil texture
    (sandy soil) across the study fields (Fig. 4). Compared to other physical (e.g.
    Fung et al., 1992), semi-empirical (e.g. Dubois et al., 1995), and empirical (e.g.
    Oh et al., 1992, Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018, Vreugdenhil et al., 2018)
    models that relate microwave backscatter measurements to soil VWC, this empirical
    model is relatively easy to build because it does not require the measurement
    or estimation of other model parameters such as the ground roughness conditions.
    There are a few disadvantages of the empirical MLR model that need to be overcome
    in the future. First, the good model performance may decrease when the model is
    applied to a different study area where the soil conditions (e.g. soil texture,
    ground surface roughness) and vegetation types fall outside the range of the calibration
    datasets (Table 2 and Fig. 3). This was indicated in Fig. 3, whereby the model
    performance varied with soil conditions and crop types. In this study, the model
    performed worst in the potato field (Coloma-Powell-Dry), most likely due to the
    low VWC values. The model also performed poorly in the fields cropped with potato,
    most likely due to the limited penetration depth of C-band microwave into the
    soil during the cropping season. To overcome this limitation, collecting soil
    VWC data at other soil conditions and vegetation types should be done in the future.
    Alternatively, as suggested by Bauer-Marschallinger et al. (2018) amongst other
    researchers, interfering factors on the model performance include surface roughness,
    tillage, plant canopy water content, vegetation, density and orientation, and
    the interactions are complex and often difficult to mitigate. Therefore, an alternative
    approach to utilize Sentinel-1 data for soil water retrieval is to upscale data
    to a coarser scale and minimize the effects of these interfering factors (Bauer-Marschallinger
    et al., 2018). Second, the relationship between Sentinel-1 backscatter data and
    soil VWC were often not linear and needs to be corrected for the crop in real-time
    (Shoshany et al., 2000). For example, Gao et al. (2017) synergistically used Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data for soil moisture mapping at 100 m resolution across a 20 km
    by 20 km study area in Spain. To correct the effect of crop cover on soil water
    dynamics, they used the NDVI index calculated from Sentinel-2 data as a proxy
    for detecting the changing crop cover over the cropping season and reduced the
    RMSE of the model from 0.087 with a change detection algorithm using only Sentinel-1
    data to 0.059 m3 m−3 by including the NDVI index. Synergetic use of Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 data was also attempted by Attarzadeh et al. (2018), which generated
    an RMSE value of 0.049 m3 m−3. In our study, we did not include optical Sentinel-2
    or Landsat because of the large cloud cover during the two cropping seasons across
    the study area. If the method were to be applied elsewhere, data fusion between
    Sentinel-1 and other optical remote sensing measurements (e.g. NDVI from Landsat
    and Sentinel-2) may be explored. In addition to data fusions, non-linear models
    and machine learning algorithms can also be used to improve the model performance.
    Possible models include artificial neural network (Paloscia et al., 2013), random
    forest (Vreugdenhil et al., 2018), Support Vector Regression (Attarzadeh et al.,
    2018), and Bayesian multi-temporal algorithm (Pierdicca et al., 2014). However,
    these non-linear models often require a large calibration dataset and thus are
    not applicable in this study. Third, the number of coupled VWC-Sentinel-1 measurements
    (i.e. 58) was too small for building a robust MLR model. Although the MLR model
    established in this study was relatively accurate, it would be difficult to apply
    it to other areas for predicting soil VWC. Therefore, it is worth collecting more
    soil VWC measurements in the cropped fields in the future to improve the robustness
    of the soil VWC retrieval algorithm. 4.2. Location-specific interactions between
    soil VWC and environmental controlling factors To investigate the location-specific
    relationship between soil VWC and different environmental controlling factors,
    two statistical metrics are calculated using 1,000 bootstrap datasets (Table 4).
    In terms of the temporal mean VWC in the 2016 cropping season, considering the
    contribution of each environmental controlling factor independently based on the
    “first metric” (Table 4a), rainfall + irrigation explained 4.8% of the total variance,
    followed by BD (4.0%), ECa (3.1%), clay content (2.8), SOC (1.8%), sand content
    (1.0%), elevation (0.2%), crop (0.2%), and TWI (0.1%). The relative importance
    of different environmental controlling factors was slightly different (Table 4b)
    when considered together in explaining the total variance of mean VWC in 2016.
    In this case, the most important covariate was still rainfall + irrigation (4.7%),
    followed by crop (3.8%), ECa (1.6%), clay content (1.4%), BD (0.2%), sand content
    (0.1%), elevation (0.1%), SOC (0.1%), and TWI (0.0%). This indicated that temporal
    mean VWC in this sandy field is mostly controlled by meteorological forcing (rainfall
    and irrigation), followed by crop, soil properties, and topography. Table 4. Percentage
    contribution (%) of location-specific environmental controlling factors on mean
    and standard deviation (SD) of estimated soil volumetric water content (VWC) across
    the DU field at 30-m resolution at the Wallendal farm during the 2016 cropping
    season as calculated using two statistical metrics a) “first metric” and b) “last
    metric” and 1, 000 bootstrap datasets. Note: a large percentage contribution indicates
    that the environmental factor contributes more to the mean or SD of VWC. a) Variables

    only 13.6% of the total variance was explained by all the environmental controlling
    factors shown in Table 4. This can be due to three seasons. First, the maps of
    soil properties were obtained at the 100-m spatial resolution based on a machine
    learning approach with a large amount of uncertainty (Ramcharan et al., 2018)
    and the use of a 10-m digital elevation model may not well represent the local
    topography characteristics at the scale of soil moisture probes (<0.5 m2). Second,
    other environmental controlling factors may also contribute to the variance of
    mean VWC, such as evapotranspiration, deep drainage, and runoff, which cannot
    be mapped as such fine spatial and temporal resolutions using the available datasets.
    Third, the variance of mean and SD of VWC can be due to random errors that cannot
    be explained by any environmental factors (Vinnikov et al., 1996). The histograms
    of the percentage contributions of different environmental factors generated using
    1,000 bootstrap datasets are shown in Fig. 7. In general, the estimation of relative
    contributions of different environmental factors was reliable given the narrow
    95% percentiles. In addition, the orders of importance of different environmental
    factors calculated using the “first” and “second” metrics remained the same. This
    suggested that the small sampling size (i.e. 58) did not affect the estimation
    of relative contributions of different environmental factors to the mean of VWC
    much and the analysis was robust. Download : Download high-res image (763KB) Download

    (%) of location-specific environmental controlling factors on temporal mean of
    estimated soil volumetric water content (VWC) across the DU field at 30-m resolution
    at the Wallendal farm during the 2016 cropping season as calculated using two
    statistical metrics a) “first metric” and b) “last metric” and 1,000 bootstrap
    samples. Note: the mean and 95% upper and lower percentiles of the percentage
    contributions were plotted with solid and dashed lines, respectively. A large
    percentage contribution indicates that the environmental factor contributes more
    to the temporal mean of VWC. Different patterns were observed for the temporal
    SD of VWC during the 2016 cropping season. Unlike the temporal mean VWC, all the
    environmental controlling factors explained 39.5% of the total variance of the
    SD of VWC. This was not unexpected because the SD of VWC is mainly driven by water
    input from rainfall and irrigation, water storage as represented by field capacity
    and porosity as a function of soil particle size fractions, BD and SOC, and water
    output as evapotranspiration (crop) and runoff (topography). When considering
    the relative contribution of each individual environmental controlling factor
    in explaining the SD of VWC in 2016 (Table 4a), crop was ranked most important
    (35.4%), followed by BD (21.7%), rainfall + irrigation (21.1%), sand content (11.8%),
    elevation (5.1%), SOC (2.1%), clay content (0.4%), ECa (0.5%), and TWI (0.0%).
    When considering the relative contribution with all factors considered, the crop
    was ranked most importantly followed by soil properties and topography (TWI and
    elevation). In this case, rainfall + irrigation was not significant because it
    was masked by the strongly correlated crop factor that was used to determine irrigation
    rates. The correlations between soil VWC and various environmental controlling
    factors are consistent with the previous studies. These include meteorological
    forcing such as rainfall (Oldak et al., 2002, Gaur and Mohanty, 2013) and solar
    radiation (Joshi and Mohanty, 2010), irrigation (Malash et al., 2008), soil properties
    such as soil texture (Joshi and Mohanty, 2010), hydraulic properties (Shao et
    al., 1997), soil organic carbon (Yost and Hartemink, 2019), ECa as a representation
    of different soil properties (Corwin and Lesch, 2003), vegetation (Wang et al.,
    2014, Wang and Franz, 2015, Li et al., 2018), and topography (Bonan et al., 1993,
    Vanderlinden et al., 2012). The difference between this study and other studies
    is that meteorological forcing such as rainfall and solar radiation is less important
    in explaining the variations in temporal mean and SD of VWC as compared to other
    factors because they are relatively uniform at the field scale. 4.3. Time-dependent
    interactions between soil VWC and environmental controlling factors Changes in
    soil VWC are also time-dependent/event-based (Fig. 5 and Fig. 6). The relative
    contribution of environmental controlling factors on changes of soil VWC calculated
    using 1,000 bootstrap datasets is also presented (Table 5). In terms of changes
    of VWC due to rainfall (and evapotranspiration) only (June 9th to 15th, 2016),
    the time-dependent controls on soil VWC dynamics are mainly caused by crop (13.5%),
    followed by soil properties such as BD (6.3%), sand content (4.7%), ECa (1.2%),
    clay content (0.7%), SOC (0.2%), and topography (1.2% for TWI and 0.3% elevation)
    (Table 5a). However, when the changes of VWC is due to both rainfall and irrigation
    (and evapotranspiration) (July 15th to 20th, 2016), the time-dependent controls
    on soil VWC is mainly due to crop (11.7%), irrigation (8.3%), soil properties
    such sand content (5.8%) and BD (2.5%) and elevation (3.7%). Table 5. Percentage

    experiment periods as calculated using two statistical metrics a) “first metric”
    and b) “last metric” and 1, 000 bootstrap datasets in the DU field at the Wallendal
    farm. Note: a large percentage contribution indicates that the environmental factor
    contributes more to the change of VWC. a) Variable Duration Initial soil condition

    soil VWC and environmental factors have also been reported by other researchers.
    First, the interactions between soil VWC and environmental factors are controlled
    by the initial soil VWC. For example, Gardner and Ehlig (1962) showed that the
    water removal from the soil as a function of impedance to water movement was largely
    in the plant when the soil was wet and largely in the soil when the soil became
    dry. This may explain while the relative contribution of crop to changing VWC
    was similar at the periods of June 9th –15th (relatively dry initial soil condition
    on June 9th with a mean VWC of 0.13 m3 m−3) and July 15th– 20th (relatively wet
    initial soil condition on July 15th with a mean VWC of 0.15 m3 m−3), the relative
    contribution of soil decreased greatly. Second, the interactions between soil
    VWC and environmental controlling factors are also controlled by plant stress
    status. For example, based on the simulation results, Teuling and Troch (2005)
    found both soil and vegetation controls can act to either create or destroy spatial
    variance depending on whether or not the soil dried below the critical moisture
    content, namely, the transition between unstressed and stressed transpiration.
    In this study, this was confirmed by the time-dependent contribution of environmental
    controlling factors on changing soil VWC and thus soil water deficit (SWD) (Table
    5). Note that the percentage contributions for the changes in SWD were the same
    to those of the VWC (data not shown) because SWD was calculated by rescaling VWC
    based on field capacity and permanent wilting point. Third, a number of researchers
    have found the temporal stability of soil VWC variations in natural landscapes
    with variable vegetation and soil types and complicated topography and concluded
    that these can be used for remote sensing of soil VWC and soil moisture parameterization
    in climate models (Vachaud et al., 1985, Vinnikov et al., 1996, Mohanty and Skaggs,
    2001, Vanderlinden et al., 2012, Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018). In our study,
    we calculated the temporal statistics of the Sentinel-1 backscatter measurements
    based on the available measurements collected in both 2016 and 2017 cropping seasons.
    We also explored the potential to use temporal statistics calculated in 2016 or
    2017 only but failed to fit an accurate MLR model. The difference between our
    study and the studies mentioned above is our remote sensing data were collected
    in the cropland over the growing seasons with different crop rotations for the
    same field in different years. One potential explanation to the good model performance
    can be that the ground roughness was relatively stable over time and can be separated
    from the crop canopy dynamics as suggested by Bauer-Marschallinger et al. (2018).
    However, future work is required to further investigate this issue in places with
    dense vegetation. It is also worth noting that our study did not reveal the importance
    of meteorological forcing in explaining soil VWC variations as discovered by others
    at different scales. For example, in extremely dry surface soils, researchers
    have found soil VWC is controlled by high potential evaporation, which leads to
    upward vapor movement (e.g. Saito et al., 2006, Du et al., 2018). In our study,
    the influence of meteorological forcing was not significant because the soil moisture
    probes were installed at the field scale and the annual rainfall is larger than
    the annual evaporation in the study area. Therefore, it is possible to apply this
    approach to other climate regimes in the future so that the location-specific
    and time-dependent interactions between soil VWC and meteorological forcing can
    be revealed (Seneviratne et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2017). In addition, it is
    also worth further investigating the interactions between soil water content and
    environmental controlling factors under cropping and non-cropping seasons and
    compare them for different vegetation types across a large spatial extent and
    over a long period as explored by Zhu and Lin (2011). 4.4. Implications for soil
    water Conservation and irrigation management under climate change The maps of
    soil VWC (Fig. 5) and SWD (Fig. 6) illustrated the spatial and temporal variations
    of surface soil water content over a cropping season. These can be used in the
    future as baseline soil moisture maps for the farmers to schedule irrigation,
    particularly when patterns of precipitation are changing across the globe (IPCC,
    2014). In order to achieve this, mechanistic/hydrological models need to be used
    in combination with surface soil VWC retrieved from remote sensing data, soil
    hydrological properties (Montzka et al., 2017, Chaney et al., 2019) at different
    depths, and subsoil VWC measurements from soil moisture probes as validation for
    forecasting soil water dynamics at different depths and irrigation scheduling
    in the real-time (Das and Mohanty, 2006, Huang et al., 2017a, De Lannoy et al.,
    2007, Das et al., 2008, Lievens et al., 2017, Bauer-Marschallinger et al., 2018).
    When the spatial information about soil hydrological properties is available (e.g.
    field capacity, permanent wilting point), maps of changes in SWD can be used to
    identify areas where irrigation is not necessary occurs (low SWD values) and design
    maps for variable-rate irrigation (Lo et al., 2017). 5. Conclusion An empirical
    multiple linear regression model for predicting soil water dynamics at the surface
    (0–0.1 m) in cropped fields was established using Sentinel-1 data and soil moisture
    probes. Backscatter measurements of Sentinel-1 backscatter data were used in combination
    with temporal statistics (e.g. mean and maximum) and incidence angle of the sensor
    as covariates to predict soil water content in space and time. The model was reasonably
    accurate given the small RMSE (0.02 m3 m−3), large R2 (0.60) and Lin’s concordance
    correlation coefficient of 0.75 from a leave-one-group-out cross-validation. Soil
    water content was mapped at 30-m resolution every 6–12 days across one study field.
    Using two statistical metrics and bootstrapping sampling, the results revealed
    location-specific and time-dependent interactions between soil water content and
    environmental controlling factors, including crop, soil properties, irrigation,
    and topography. The time-dependent interactions are affected by initial soil water
    content and plant stress status. Future work should include more soil moisture
    probe data in the cropland over the growing seasons and applying non-linear modeling
    algorithms. The method has the potential to provide a baseline surface soil moisture
    map and to be coupled with mechanistic/hydrological models for improved irrigation
    management and water use efficiency under climate change. Further research is
    required to study location-specific and time-dependent interactions between soil
    water content and environmental controlling factors across different climate regimes
    and investigate the issues of time-stable scales of variations in soil water content
    in places where vegetation is changing over time. Declaration of Competing Interest

    Abstract: Almost ﬁfty years have passed since the idea to retrieve a value for\
    \ Evapotranspiration (ET)\nusing remote sensing techniques was ﬁrst considered.\
    \ Numerous ET models have been proposed,\nvalidated and improved along these ﬁve\
    \ decades, as the satellites and sensors onboard were enhanced.\nThis study reviews\
    \ most of the efforts in the progress towards providing a trustworthy value of\n\
    ET by means of thermal remote sensing data. It starts with an in-depth reﬂection\
    \ of the surface\nenergy balance concept and of each of its terms, followed by\
    \ the description of the approaches\ntaken by remote sensing models to estimate\
    \ ET from it in the last thirty years. This work also\nincludes a chronological\
    \ review of the modiﬁcations suggested by several researchers, as well as\nrepresentative\
    \ validations studies of such ET models. Present limitations of ET estimated with\
    \ remote\nsensors onboard orbiting satellites, as well as at surface level, are\
    \ raised. Current trends to face such\nlimitations and a future perspective of\
    \ the discipline are also exposed, for the reader’s inspiration.\nKeywords: ET;\
    \ remote sensing; land surface temperature (LST); atmospheric surface layer; heat\n\
    ﬂuxes; SEB theory; thermal applications\n1. Introduction\nEvapotranspiration (ET)\
    \ is a process that includes evaporation from the surface, such\nas open water\
    \ bodies, soil and vegetation, and transpiration as the water released mostly\n\
    by the plant leaves transported from the root system. ET is a key factor in the\
    \ hydrological\ncycle, since it describes the mechanism and energy needed to transport\
    \ the liquid water\nstored in the soil-watershed-canopy system to the atmosphere,\
    \ converted into water vapour.\nIn the broader context, irrigated agriculture\
    \ still accounts for 70% of freshwater with-\ndrawals [1]. This is a serious problem\
    \ noticed by the Horizon Europe program. In this\nframework, ET plays an important\
    \ role as a controlling factor of the water cycle and energy\ntransport among\
    \ the biosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere. The importance of ET has\nbeen evidenced\
    \ from the very beginning of the Remote Sensing discipline, in applica-\ntion\
    \ ﬁelds such as hydrology, for instance for the scheduling of ﬁeld-scale irrigations\
    \ and\ntillage [2] or in meteorology and climatology, for prediction of natural\
    \ hazards such as\nﬂoods and droughts [3] or in agriculture, where for vegetated\
    \ surfaces, ET can be used as\nan indicator of plant water stress [4].\nIn situ\
    \ ET ﬁeld retrievals from ground instrumentation, based on conventional tech-\n\
    niques (e.g., Eddy covariance, Bowen ratio, lysimetry, etc.), offer the advantage\
    \ of a direct\ndetermination of the value of ET for a measuring site [5]. However,\
    \ these instruments are\noften costly, their data require an adequate treatment\
    \ which is quite time-consuming, and\ninstrumental problems may happen [6]. A\
    \ commonly-used alternative for the estimation of\nET is the Penman-Monteith equation,\
    \ which uses monitored variables (e.g., air temperature\nor humidity), very convenient\
    \ with basic meteorological stations, especially in the form\nsuggested by Food\
    \ and Agriculture Organization (FAO) [7,8]. Furthermore, for an area\nRemote Sens.\

    Remote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n2 of 36\nwhich is spatially heterogeneous, measurements\
    \ made in a single location may not be\nrepresentative of the full area [9]. For\
    \ a given area in a humid climate, annual ET can\nbe as large as half of the precipitation,\
    \ whereas for arid and semi-arid areas ET is almost\nequivalent to the total annual\
    \ rainfall [10].\nIn summary, even if accurate ET estimates can be obtained for\
    \ the instrumented\nsites, these values are not useful at larger scales due to\
    \ the usual heterogeneity of the\nlandscape and the complexity of the hydrological\
    \ processes [2]. Conventional ground\nmeasurement techniques do not appreciate\
    \ spatial distribution at large-scales, especially in\nregions composed of well-contrasted\
    \ areas where advection may be important.\nRemote sensing technology is a globally\
    \ consistent and economically feasible means\nto estimate ET values at regional\
    \ and meso-scales on the Earth’s surface [11], since the\napproach directly links\
    \ surface radiances and the components of the surface energy bal-\nance [12–14].\
    \ Over the last 30 years, combined use of satellite remote sensing data from\n\
    optical and thermal infrared sensors has provided substantial progress in the\
    \ estimation of\nET [15–18]. Based on the concept of surface energy balance and\
    \ net radiation, most remote\nsensing models have estimated ET for application\
    \ studies such as water consumption,\nwater resources planning and management\
    \ over watersheds [19] or modeling ecological\nprocesses and analyzing biophysical\
    \ characteristics of landscape [20].\nThe present document is a review report\
    \ of the most popular remote sensing Land\nsurface temperature (LST)-based ET\
    \ algorithms used during the last three decades. This\narticle revisits and updates\
    \ of the state of the art on this topic reported in previous review\narticles\
    \ [17,21–25], incorporating recently published works showing modiﬁcations and\n\
    improvements of the models. This review aims to combine the current state of the\
    \ art on\nthe subject under study, making it suitable for both experts and users\
    \ of ET estimated from\nsatellite. Nevertheless, reading the aforementioned review\
    \ articles is highly recommended\nfor a more complete and up-to-date idea of the\
    \ subject under study.\nA brief description of the surface energy budget is provided\
    \ in Section 2, while some\nof the most popular remote-sensing approaches to estimate\
    \ ET are described in Section 3,\nindicating their evolution with time and the\
    \ representative validation studies in the last\ntwenty years. Also advantages\
    \ and disadvantages of each ET model are discussed. Section 4, it\nis shown an\
    \ in-depth review of the limitations and current trends in remote sensing techniques\n\
    to estimate ET, as well as the future prospects to be addressed by the remote\
    \ sensing ET\ncommunity. Finally, Section 5 resumes the main conclusions of this\
    \ review study.\n2. Surface Energy Balance (SEB) Theory\nIt is a common approach\
    \ to consider that an energy balance equation can be applied\nto any point of\
    \ the Earth Surface [26]. The Net Radiation is the ﬂux term that warms the\nsurface\
    \ during the day and cools it at night.\nInstead ET is a process related with\
    \ the quantity of energy used by the surface for the\nwater phase change. When\
    \ condensation occurs at the surface (usually at night) energy\nis transferred\
    \ to the surface. Ignoring at this point any other effects (e.g., advection, heat\n\
    stored in the upper soil or the plant energetics), the surface energy balance\
    \ equation can be\nwritten as:\nRn =G + H + LE\n(1)\nwhere the net radiation Rn\
    \ (in W/m2), represents the total heat energy considered in the\nbalance between\
    \ incoming and outgoing short-wave (0.15 to 3 µm) and long-wave (3 to\n100 µm)\
    \ radiation under steady atmospheric condition, and it can be expressed as:\n\
    Rn = (1− αs) Rs + εs εaσTa4− εsσTs4\n(2)\nwhere αs is the surface shortwave albedo,\
    \ calculated with satellite data as a combi-\nnation of narrow spectral reﬂectance\
    \ estimated from bands of several remote sensing\ninstruments [27], however, it\
    \ can also be estimated in other ways such as using a 4-\ncomponent net radiometer.\
    \ Rs is commonly called insolation and it is a measure of the\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 3440\n3 of 36\nincident solar radiation, either photosynthetically active\
    \ radiation in the visible spectrum\n(400–700 nm) or in the total shortwave (150–3000\
    \ nm), received on a given surface area\nand time. There also exist several remote\
    \ sensing products to estimate Rs. For instance,\nthe geostationary satellite\
    \ Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) [28]\nor polar satellites\
    \ like the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) [29]\nor Advanced\
    \ Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) [30]. Atmospheric emissivity\n(εa) can\
    \ be estimated from vapor pressure values [31]. There are several ways to retrieve\n\
    air temperature (Ta). Some of them are the remote sensing MODIS products MOD07\
    \ [32],\nor from synthetic atmospheric proﬁles [33] included in radiative transfer\
    \ codes, which\nhas been proven to be more accurate than MOD07 compared with meteorological\
    \ data\nfrom a near station [34]. Also Ta can be retrieved from other datasets\
    \ like tower-based\nmeasurements or reanalysis data such as European Centre for\
    \ Medium-Range Weather\nForecasts (ECMWF, https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/dataset/ecmwf-reanalysis-v5\n\
    (accessed on 1 July 2022). Surface emissivity (εs) and LST can be retrieved from\
    \ remote\nsensing techniques separately [35–37] as well as at the same time [38,39].\
    \ σ is the Stefan-\nBoltzmann constant. Two last terms in Equation (2) can be\
    \ substituted by downward and\nupward longwave radiation terms. Both longwave\
    \ radiation variables can be estimated\nby remote sensing techniques. For the\
    \ downward term there exist operational products\nfrom MODIS and GOES [40], AVHRR\
    \ and Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager\n(SEVIRI) [30], while for\
    \ the upward radiation term there are products and algorithms\nfor MODIS, Advanced\
    \ Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reﬂection (ASTER), Thematic\nMapper (TM), SEVIRI,\
    \ AVHRR, Along Track Scanning Radiometer (ATSR), Advanced\nAlong-Track Scanning\
    \ Radiometer (AATSR), GOES, Geostationary Meteorological Satel-\nlite (GMS), Visible\
    \ Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and Atmospheric infrared\nsounder\
    \ (AIRS) [41]. Reader is referred to review study of [42] for further details\
    \ about Rn\nestimated from ground measurements to remote sensing tools.\nThe soil\
    \ heat ﬂux G (in W/m2), is the heat energy used for warming or cooling\nsubstrate\
    \ soil volume. As of today, it is impossible to directly measure G from remote\n\
    sensing data. However, in many studies G is retrieved as a pondered estimate of\
    \ Rn [43],\nor related to other variables easily retrievable from remote sensing\
    \ data, such as Leaf\nArea Index (LAI) [44], Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index and LST (NDVI) [45], and\nFraction Vegetation Cover (FVC) [46]. Reader\
    \ is referred to review study of Gao et al. [47]\nwhere this issue is investigated\
    \ and a variety of methods are intercompared.\nThe sensible heat ﬂux H (in W/m2),\
    \ is the driving mechanism through which the air\nabove the surface warms or cool\
    \ as heat is transported from or to the surface. In the SEB\nEquation (1), it\
    \ is expressed as:\nH = ρCP\n(To − Ta)\nraH\n(3)\nwhere ρ is the density of air\
    \ (kg/m3), CP is the speciﬁc heat of air (1004 J/kgK), Ta is the\nair temperature\
    \ usually at a height z of 2 m above the canopy [48], To is the aerodynamic\n\
    temperature near the surface and raH is the aerodynamic resistance (s/m) obtained\
    \ from the\nMonin-Obukhov Stability Theory (MOST) [49]. To is a parameter not\
    \ easily estimable, so\nusually in remote sensing it is considered as the radiometric\
    \ Ts retrieved from TIR sensors\non board orbiting satellites, after some reformulation\
    \ of the raH parameter to account for\nsuch approximation [43]. This issue is\
    \ addressed in the next Section 2.2.\nThe Latent Heat Flux LE (in W/m2), governs\
    \ the loss of latent heat from surface due\nto evapotranspiration. It is usually\
    \ retrieved as a residual from the SEB Equation (1) and it\nis linearly related\
    \ with ET:\nLE = λET\n(4)\nwhere λ is the latent heat of vaporization of water,\
    \ which is dependent on the temperature,\nand usually takes a value of 2.45 ×\
    \ 106 J/kg at 20 ◦C.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n4 of 36\nThe remote sensing\
    \ LST-based ET models produce instantaneous (ETi) values, for\nwhich the algorithms\
    \ will be described in the next section. This instantaneous estimation\nis of\
    \ not much use for most hydrological and water resources management applications\n\
    and it is customary to convert ETi retrieved from overpass times of satellites\
    \ to daily (ETd)\nor longer time scales to make full usable application of the\
    \ remote sensing data. Several\nauthors have proposed approximation methods to\
    \ derive ETd values from ETi estimated\nfrom satellite data. Some of these well-accepted\
    \ methods are described below.\nJackson et al. [50] related ETi to ETd value according\
    \ to the diurnal solar irradiance\nevolution, following the sine function equation:\n\
    ETd =\n2N\nπ sin\n\0 πt\nN\n\x01ETi\n(5)\nN = 0.945\n\x12\nn1 + n2 sin2\n\x12\
    π(D + 10)\n365\n\x13\x13\n(6)\nn1 = 12 − 5.69·10−2lat − 2.02·10−4lat2 + 8.25·10−6lat3\
    \ − 3.15·10−7lat4\n(7)\nn2 = 0.123 lat − 3.1·10−4lat2 + 8·10−7lat3 + 4.99·10−7lat4\n\
    (8)\nwhere t is the time of day, D day of year and lat is the geographical latitude\
    \ between 60◦S\nand 60◦N. For cloud free or a relatively constant cloud cover\
    \ days, the sine function (5) has\nproduced reliable estimates of ETd [11,51].\n\
    Another method assumes that evaporative fraction (EF) remains constant during\
    \ the\ndaylight hours [52]. EF is the rate between ETi and available instantaneous\
    \ energy (Rn−G)i.\nHowever, it has been found that during nighttime ET could reach\
    \ as many as about\n10 percent of the daily totals [53]. So, the night induces\
    \ a percentage that is added to\nEF, and after that assumes EF constant during\
    \ the 24 h of the day [52,53]. Then ETd can\ntherefore be written as:\nETd = 1.1\n\
    Rnd\n(Rn − G)i\nETi\n(9)\nwhere Rnd is the daytime available energy, actually\
    \ it is (Rn−G)d but it is generally assumed\nthat daily G is negligible (see Section\
    \ 2.2).\nAllen et al. [54] considered that EF was not able to capture the impact\
    \ of advection,\nchanging wind and humidity conditions along the day. So, they\
    \ deﬁned the constant\nreference ET fraction (ETrF) as the ratio between ETi and\
    \ reference ET over the standard-\nized 0.5 m tall alfalfa (ETr) [7]. For horizontal\
    \ areas (no signiﬁcant slope terrain effects)\nAllen et al. proposed the next\
    \ ETd approximation:\nETd = ETrF\nETr\n=\nETi\nETrETr,d\n(10)\nwhere ETr,d is\
    \ the cumulative daily reference of ET [54].\n2.1. Aerodynamic Resistance to Heat\
    \ Transfer Based on MOST\nAerodynamic resistance to heat transfer (raH in Equation\
    \ (3)), is an ecosystem param-\neter which is affected by the surface roughness\
    \ (vegetation height and structure), wind\nspeed (u) and atmospheric stability.\
    \ Increasing the intensity of the wind or the roughness\nof the surface imply\
    \ a decrease in the value of raH [48]. It must be adjusted according to\nsurface\
    \ characteristics and based on the calculation of momentum ﬂux and the observed\n\
    logarithmic proﬁle of wind speed close to surfaces, it is given by:\nraH =\nh\n\
    ln\n\x10\nzu−d\nz0M\n\x11\n− ψM\nih\nln\n\x10\nzT−d\nz0H\n\x11\n− ψH\ni\nκ2u\n\
    (11)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n5 of 36\nwhere zu and zT are the heights at\
    \ which u and Ta were respectively measured, d is the\nzero-displacement height,\
    \ z0M and z0H are the roughness length of momentum and sensible\nheat exchange,\
    \ respectively. κ = 0.41 is the dimensionless von Karman constant, ΨM and ΨH\n\
    are the Monin-Obukhov stability functions [49] for momentum and sensible heat\
    \ turbulent\nﬂuxes. Usually, two levels of temperature and wind are required to\
    \ compute these functions,\ntypically at 2 m above the canopy height for the atmospheric\
    \ variables, while wind is set to\nzero at z0M and the value of LST is taken at\
    \ z0H.\nAtmospheric stability correction on raH is an important issue since not\
    \ considering\nit leads to an overestimation of ET when the canopy-air temperature\
    \ difference is greater\nthan about ±2 ◦C [48]. To determine the stability functions\
    \ the Obukhov length [49] is\ndeﬁned as:\nΛ = u∗3ρCPTa\ngκH\n(12)\nwhere u* is\
    \ the friction velocity and g the gravity acceleration. It must be solved with\
    \ H and\nu* [55]. When Λ < 0, means atmospheric instability, and for Λ > 0 stable\
    \ conditions. It is\nworth to note that both Ta and u* are external parameters\
    \ which retrieval is non-dependent\non remote sensing techniques [56–60].\nIn\
    \ case of atmospheric thermal instability and no predominant free convection condi-\n\
    tions (usually at daytime), ΨM and ΨH can be expressed as [61]:\nψM = 2ln\n\x12\
    1 + x\n2\n\x13\n+ ln\n\x121 + x2\n2\n\x13\n− 2arctan(x) + π\n2\n(13)\nψH = 2ln\n\
    \x121 + x2\n2\n\x13\n(14)\nx =\n\x12\n1 − 16zu − d\nΛ\n\x130.25\n(15)\nUnder atmospheric\
    \ stable conditions (prevailing at night) [62,63] proposed the same\nformulation\
    \ for the Monin-Obukhov stability functions, as:\nψM = ψH = −5zu − d\nΛ\n(16)\n\
    The effective roughness length for momentum (z0M) is a distance above the zero-plane\n\
    displacement height where the wind speed is assumed to be zero when log-proﬁle\
    \ wind\nspeed is extrapolated downward, rather than at true ground surface [64].\
    \ z0M and d are\ncomplex functions of the surface roughness (vegetation height\
    \ and structure), estimated\nfrom models that consider canopy height, width, and\
    \ element spacing into account [65,66].\nThere are also alternative methods that\
    \ integrate the LAI in the estimation of z0M and d [67].\nThe roughness length\
    \ for heat exchange (z0H) can be expressed as a function of z0M\nas [67]:\nln\n\
    \x12z0M\nz0H\n\x13\n= κ\nB\n(17)\nwhere B the Stanton number (dimensionless).\
    \ κ/B rate is a complex function, also called\n“excess resistance”, which is dependent\
    \ on time of the day, weather, and the type of\nvegetation, but constant values\
    \ for z0H/z0M of 0.1 and 0.2 are often used for dense and\nsparse crops, respectively\
    \ [68].\nIn summary, surface roughness plays an important role in the estimation\
    \ of H and it is\nworth noting it still remains a challenging issue for large\
    \ scale retrieval of the turbulent heat\nﬂuxes. However, resistance Equation (11)\
    \ is applied since early seventies over local and\nregional scales and for varied\
    \ vegetation covers [48,69,70]. We will avoid further details on\nMOST at this\
    \ point not to distract the reader from the main aim of this review. For more\n\
    information about surface roughness formulation, reader is referred to reviews\
    \ of [71,72]\nand an in-depth study by [73].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n6 of\
    \ 36\n2.2. Satellite Estimation of To\nRegarding To (Equation (3)), it represents\
    \ the temperature of the apparent source/sink\nof sensible heat ﬂux [74], and\
    \ it is computed at the level of d + zoH, averaged from the\nweighted contribution\
    \ to the aerodynamic conductance of each element composing the full\ncanopy scene.\
    \ According to [75] To is neither measured nor easily estimated, while Ts is\n\
    relatively easily measured with infrared thermometers and scanners. To has been\
    \ usually\nsubstituted by Ts in Equation (3) since it is very difﬁcult to measure\
    \ [69,76]. Min et al. [77]\nindicated that for homogeneous and isothermal surfaces\
    \ the deﬁnition of aerodynamic and\nthermodynamic (canopy or surface radiometric)\
    \ temperatures are equivalent, however,\nassuming To equal to Ts at canopy level\
    \ could be problematic since it is known that Ts is\n2–3 ◦C higher than To for\
    \ uniform canopy covers [78], and up to 10–15 ◦C higher for incom-\nplete canopy\
    \ covers [79]. Ts is also inﬂuenced by the viewing angle, so if it is measured\n\
    at nadir Ts tends to be larger than To due to the direct incident sunlight. Nevertheless,\
    \ at\nlarger viewing angles between 50◦ and 70◦ from nadir, Ts coincides with\
    \ To [80]. Difference\nbetween Ts and To leads to errors in the estimation of\
    \ H which in turn leads to errors in\nthe estimation of LE (ET). To account for\
    \ those differences, researchers commonly have\nparameterized, with mixed results,\
    \ the H equation in order to be able to use Ts instead\nof To. However, there\
    \ is an effect of vegetation three-dimensional (3D) structure and its\ninteraction\
    \ with directional wind speed (wind direction, angle of attack), on the generation\n\
    of To, roughness length (for heat and momentum transfer), friction velocity; which\
    \ in turn\naffect H and LE.\nMore recently, [81] improved a To model for deﬁcit\
    \ irrigated corn by including a\nturbulence mixing-row resistance that attempts\
    \ to incorporate the interactions between\ncrop rows orientation and wind direction\
    \ (the angle of attack). However, the approach is\nonly applicable to the corn\
    \ canopy structure and site conditions. In terms of vegetation\ncanopy structure\
    \ effects on energy balance models, [82] found out that, in the case of the\n\
    unique canopy structure and conﬁguration of vineyards, these SEB models were not\
    \ able\nto adequately describe the physical processes driving evapotranspiration\
    \ from vineyards.\nIn general, research results reported in the literature show\
    \ that the surface aerody-\nnamic temperature can be locally parameterized for\
    \ different vegetation surfaces, surface\nhomogeneity and environmental and climatological\
    \ conditions, with relative success. How-\never, researchers still use surface\
    \ radiometric temperature images, from satellites, instead\nof the appropriate\
    \ aerodynamic temperature because currently there is no single robust\nand comprehensive\
    \ To model, for the application of the one-source energy balance of land\nsurfaces\
    \ model, that works for multiple surface cover types and environmental conditions.\n\
    Thus, there is a need to study the mechanisms that generate the surface aerodynamic\n\
    temperature, for different vegetation/crop surface types and environmental conditions.\n\
    2.3. Energy Balance Closure Flux Terms Frequently Not Considered\nThe hypothesis\
    \ that the four terms described above close the surface energy budget\nis usually\
    \ not fulﬁlled [26], with imbalances amounting typically between 10 and 40%\n\
    depending on the terrain heterogeneity and complexity [83]. The most relevant\
    \ motions\nseem to take place at the hectometre scale [84,85].\nThe main reasons\
    \ for this lack of closure usually mentioned are the uncertainty of the\nmeasurements,\
    \ the horizontal transport by advection, the unadequate computation of heat\n\
    stored in the upper soil or the canopy and the lack of consideration of the energy\
    \ used\nin the plant physiological processes for dense canopies. Several studies\
    \ using drone or\nsatellite-derived LST ﬁelds show that the advection of heat\
    \ may be important [86–88] and\nwell correlated with the imbalance.\nForcing the\
    \ closure of the four-term surface budget equation to obtain LE, implies that\n\
    the imbalance is considered entirely as latent heat ﬂux, for which there is no\
    \ clear evidence,\nalthough some studies point in that direction [89]. Instead\
    \ most authors tend to distribute\nthe observed imbalance between the latent and\
    \ the sensible heat ﬂuxes proportionally to\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n7 of\
    \ 36\nthe observed Bowen ratio (H/LE) [90]. In the rest of this work, we will\
    \ consider that the\nsurface energy budget is closed unless stated otherwise.\n\
    3. Remote Sensing LST-Based ET Algorithms\nET algorithms based on thermal remote\
    \ sensing data can be divided into three cat-\negories: (i) single-source models,\
    \ (ii) VI-TS Triangle/trapezoidal models, and (iii) dual\n(two)-source models.\n\
    3.1. Single-Source Energy Balance Models\n3.1.1. Surface Energy Balance Index\
    \ (SEBI) and Simpliﬁed-SEBI (S-SEBI) Models\nOriginally proposed by [91], the\
    \ physically-based assumption is that ET varies with the\nTs for a homogeneous\
    \ surface. For a given surface albedo and boundary layer conditions,\nthere exists\
    \ a temperature gradient between the surface and the atmosphere (Ts−Ta) at some\n\
    crop height, that ranges from a maximum value for which ET is assumed to be zero,\
    \ to a\nminimum value for which the potential ET (ETp) is taken, as given by the\
    \ Penman-Monteith\nequation [7].\nFigure 1 shows a complete scheme of the SEBI\
    \ principles. There exists a correlation\nbetween Ts and the surface reﬂectance\
    \ (albedo), where for low reﬂectance values Ts remains\nconstant with the progressive\
    \ increase of such reﬂectance. This phenomenon is attributed\nto presence of body\
    \ water or well-watered surfaces, where all the available energy is used\nfor\
    \ the evaporation. From certain reﬂectance threshold Ts increases with the reﬂectance,\n\
    inducing a decrease in the evaporation, in the so-called “evaporation controlled”\
    \ range.\nFrom another higher reﬂectance threshold, Ts decreases with the increase\
    \ of the reﬂectance,\nbecause the Rn decreases due to the high reﬂection of the\
    \ energy received, a process known\nas “radiation controlled”.\nRemote Sens. 2022,\

    \ on the previous assumptions, for a speciﬁc surface given Ts, [91] provided a\n\
    value for ET by means of an interpolation expression:\nETi =\n\n\n1 −\n(Ts−Tpbl)\n\

    \ at higher elevation or at the top of the\nPlanetary Boundary Layer (pbl) and\
    \ raH,min and raHmax are the minimum and maximum\naerodynamic resistance in the\
    \ sensible heat ﬂux H [49].\nA simpliﬁed version of the SEBI method (S-SEBI) was\
    \ proposed by [92] with the\nadvantage that no additional meteorological data\
    \ are needed if the hydrological conditions\nof the surface are extreme enough\
    \ to observe a signiﬁcant range of gradient temperatures\nfor the corresponding\
    \ reﬂectance spectra.\nTherefore if for a given αs value the two extremes of Ts\
    \ exist, that is for\nHmax (Ts,max, αs) and LEmax (Ts,min, αs), [92] expressed\
    \ the ET value as:\nλETi =\nTs,max − Ts\nTs,max − Ts,min\n(Rn − G)\n(19)\nThe\
    \ method is called simpliﬁed if the wet and dry pixel conditions are observed\
    \ for a\nspeciﬁc albedo value in a satellite scene. But [92] simpliﬁed even more\
    \ Equation (19) by\nadjusting linearly the trends of maximum and minimum Ts with\
    \ the albedo (see Figure 1),\naccording the following equations:\nTs,max = amax\
    \ + bmaxαs\n(20)\nTs,min = amin + bminαs\n(21)\nwhere amax and bmax are the slope\
    \ and offset coefﬁcients for the linear regression of the\nmaximum temperature\
    \ values with the albedo and amin and bmin are the corresponding\ncoefﬁcients\
    \ for the linear regression of the minimum temperatures, also with the albedo.\n\
    These four parameters must be adjusted in each individual satellite scene. Including\n\
    Equations (20) and (21) in Equation (19), ET expression from S-SEBI model can\
    \ be deﬁned\nthen as:\nλETi =\namax + bmaxαs − Ts\namax − amin + (bmax − bmin)αs\
    \ (Rn − G)\n(22)\nVery few modiﬁcations have been proposed in the literature for\
    \ the S-SEBI model. One of\nthem is made by [93], which in order to avoid using\
    \ the LE and H fluxes, it is proposed using\ninstead the evaporative fraction\
    \ (EF), that can be extracted from the Ts-α scatterplot shape.\nA recently published\
    \ study [94] proposed an adaptation of EVapotranspiration As-\nsessment from SPAce\
    \ (EVASPA) tool [95] to S-SEBI model. This model, denoted as E3S\n(for EVASPA\
    \ S-SEBI Sahel), proposes two relevant changes. The ﬁrst one is related to the\n\
    handling of the algorithms determining the wet and dry edges, since in some regions\
    \ like\nthe Sahel with strong seasonal contrast only one edge may be identiﬁed.\
    \ This led to the\nintroduction of twelve additional seasonally-dependent algorithms\
    \ to estimate the dry\nand wet points, using an ensemble member weighting. Secondly\
    \ a cloud edge ﬁltering\nmethod was implemented, to avoid that pixel outliers\
    \ can distort the Ts scatterplot shape.\nThe cloud edge ﬁltering was developed\
    \ in two levels: (1) the ﬁrst level ﬁlter was based on\nthe quality ﬂag provided\
    \ by the MODIS LST products. Thus, all pixels bordering clouds\nand associated\
    \ with an LST error >1 K were removed; (2) a second level ﬁlter consisted\nin\
    \ extending the ﬁrst level ﬁlter to cloud-bordering pixels with LST below the\
    \ ﬁrst LST\nquartile in the entire image. This quantile level selection could\
    \ be site and climate-speciﬁc.\nTable 1 shows a review of the validation studies\
    \ carried out from the S-SEBI proposal\nup to date. The validation studies are\

    \ are required. Instead, all the four input parameters (αs,\nTs, Rn and G) can\
    \ be retrieved from satellite data (G is related with Rn, see Section 2.2).\n\

    \ The Landsat team offers to the user the TIR\nproducts of its sensors at 30 m\
    \ resolution, by complementing the data from its Visible and\nNear InfraRed (VNIR)\
    \ sensors.\n3.1.2. Surface Energy Balance System (SEBS) Model\nProposed by [46]\
    \ the SEBS method is based, as it is S-SEBI, SEBAL and METRIC (to\nbe described\
    \ below), on the same main concept as SEBI. The difference of SEBS from the\n\
    rest is that it deals with estimating the ET ﬂuxes at large scales, therefore\
    \ considering\nheterogeneous surfaces.\nTherefore, the assumption of constant\
    \ atmospheric conditions for the whole scene is not\napplicable. Moreover, spatial\
    \ variation of roughness height for different surfaces is allowed.\nThe SEBS is\
    \ an extended model that deﬁnes the surface roughness length in the heat\nﬂuxes,\
    \ reformulating the EF at the limiting cases. To this end in the SEBS theory the\
    \ dry\nand wet case limits are:\nDry limit:\nLEdry = 0\n(23)\nHdry = Rn − G\n\
    (24)\nWet limit:\nLEwet = Rn − G − Hwet\n(25)\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n10\

    \ is the vapor pressure deﬁcit (difference between saturated and non-saturated\n\
    vapor pressure), ∆ is the slope of the curve relating temperature difference (Ts-Ta)\
    \ with\nVPD, and γ is the is the psychrometric constant.\nAs an intermediate step\
    \ SEBS method deﬁnes a relative EF (EFr) as:\nEFr = 1 −\nH − Hwet\nHdry − Hwet\n\
    (27)\nOnce all the required parameters have been estimated, LE is expressed in\
    \ SEBS as:\nLE = EFr·LEwet\n(28)\nSome studies presented a modiﬁcation of the\
    \ SEBS inner structure in terms of:\n(i) momentum roughness length and zero plane\
    \ displacement; (ii) an empirical relationship\nbetween land surface temperature\
    \ and air temperature; and (iii) designing a new input\ninterface of meteorological\
    \ ﬁeld at reference, with the objective of representing land surface\nand climatic\
    \ changes of a speciﬁc region. These studies adapted SEBS to be applicable in\n\
    different countries like Taiwan (SEBS-Taiwan, [102]), China (SEBS-China, [103])\
    \ or Iran\n(SEBS-Iran, [104]). SEBS was also modiﬁed at local scale (SEBS-Urban,\
    \ [105]) after including\nthe anthropogenic heat ﬂux in the SEB equation to estimate\
    \ the ET of Beijing city. This\nstudy hypothesized that ET was equal to the water\
    \ consumption in the study area.\nAn improvement of SEBS method was suggested\
    \ by [106] by correcting the excess\nresistance (Equation (15)) with a scale factor\
    \ dependent on soil moisture (SM), following:\n\x10 κ\nB\n\x11\ncorr =\n\x14\n\
    a +\n1\n1 + exp(b − cSMrel)\n\x15 κ\nB\n(29)\nwhere a, b and c are coefﬁcients\
    \ of the sigmoid function and SMrel is a relative soil moisture\ndeﬁned as:\n\
    SMrel = 1 −\nSM − SMmin\nSMmax − SMmin\n(30)\nSMmax and SMmin values can be obtained\
    \ using a time series analysis of the soil\nmoisture data on annual or long-term\
    \ basis [106]. Wu et al. [107] suggested the use of the\nNormal Differential Water\
    \ Index (NDWI) instead of SMrel in Equation (30). Yi et al. [108]\nalso recommended\
    \ replacing SMrel by the inverse of the modiﬁed perpendicular drought\nindex (MPDI).\n\
    It is also worth mentioning the study of Chen et al. [109], in which the excess\
    \ resistance\nis internally modiﬁed to be robust for heat ﬂux calculation for\
    \ high and low canopies, since\nit has been proved its depends on environmental\
    \ conditions, surface types, canopy structure\nand vegetation surface geometry.\
    \ kB−1 structure was adjusted from a one-foliage layer to a\nmulti-foliage layer,\
    \ which provides the possibility of including the impact of vertical variations\n\
    in foliage leaf area density, foliage shelter factor, and foliage heat transfer\
    \ coefficient.\nTable 2 shows a review of the validation studies carried out for\
    \ the SEBS model up\nto date. The main advantages of the SEBS are that new limit\
    \ cases in the SEB reduce\nuncertainty from Ts and meteorological variables, SEBS\
    \ introduces a new formulation for\nthe roughness length for heat transfer instead\
    \ of using ﬁxed values, and a priori knowledge\nof the actual turbulent heat ﬂuxes\
    \ is not required. However, the disadvantages are that\nSEBS requires too many\
    \ parameters and offers relatively complex solution for the turbulent\nheat ﬂuxes,\
    \ which can be a source of inconveniences when data are not available.\nRemote\

    \ by [120], SEBAL is an iterative and feedback-based numerical procedure that\n\
    deduces the radiation, heat and evaporation ﬂuxes. SEBAL estimates LE with the\
    \ residual\nof Equation (1) in a pixel by pixel satellite scene, just considering\
    \ two anchor points (dry\nand wet points) for the full scene. At the dry point\
    \ LE = 0 and H = Rn-G, and at the wet\npoint H = 0 and LE can be considered either\
    \ Rn-G or a reference ET [7].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n12 of 36\nThe main\
    \ consideration of SEBAL is to establish a linear regression between Ts and\n\
    difference of Ts with the air temperature at the crop height z (δTa), as follows:\n\
    δTa = c1Ts − c0\n(31)\nwhere c1 and c0 are the empirical coefficients derived\
    \ from anchored conditions of wet\n(δTa,wet = 0, Ts,wet) and dry points (Ts,dry),\
    \ for which the temperature difference is expressed as:\nδTa,dry = (Rn − G)raH\n\
    ρCP\n(32)\nThese coefﬁcients must be estimated for each individual satellite scene,\
    \ independently\nof the surface type composing the image. Once the regressed equation,\
    \ for each Ts value\nassigned to each pixel of the scene is retrieved, the H is\
    \ estimated with the expression:\nH(Ts) = ρCP\nraH\n(c1Ts − c0)\n(33)\nA ﬁrst\
    \ modiﬁcation of SEBAL was proposed by [121] after introducing Digital eleva-\n\
    tion model (DEM) data to account for impacts of slope aspect on incident solar\
    \ radiation.\nBut the main subject of modiﬁcation of SEBAL model is related with\
    \ the choice of end-\nmembers or anchor points (i.e., “hot” and “wet” points in\
    \ the satellite scene). A Modiﬁed\nversion of SEBAL (M-SEBAL) was proposed by\
    \ [122], that based the election of the anchor\n(dry/wet) points on the type of\
    \ surface, deﬁned by the FVC. They adjusted Equation (31)\nfor every speciﬁc surface\
    \ deﬁned by FVC and subsequently estimated H and LE. Feng\net al. [123] derived\
    \ geo-mathematically four reference dry and wet limits, instead of the\nclassical\
    \ option of two anchor points.\nAnother modiﬁcation is addressed in [124], where\
    \ authors deal with the endmember\npixel selection process, proposing an automated\
    \ procedure by introducing an exhaustive\nsearch algorithm (ESA), in which all\
    \ possible candidates are systematically considered and\nchecked to determine\
    \ if the solution is satisﬁed, based on two steps: (1) create a binary map\nof\
    \ candidate pixels that are identiﬁed using a simple rule-based classiﬁer, and\
    \ (2) apply\nESA to identify hot and cold pixels that meet the deﬁned criteria.\
    \ In this sense, [125] created\nthe automated SEBAL (ASEBAL) model that allows\
    \ automatic selection of the endmember\npixels according to criteria based on\
    \ the variation in biophysical parameter values retrieved\nfrom satellite products.\n\
    It is also worth mentioning the study of [126], where authors found more appropriate\n\
    to combine the capabilities of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) with optical remote\
    \ sensing\ntechnique in the applications where soil moisture conditions to locate\
    \ anchor pixels, since\nSAR is more suitable to detect soil moisture conditions.\n\
    Two interesting studies that suggested modiﬁcations of SEBAL ET model were related\n\
    with changes in the SEB equation, by introducing new ﬂuxes terms that must be\
    \ accounted\nin certain situations. Mkhwanazi et al. [127] proposed a modiﬁed\
    \ version of SEBAL model\n(SEBAL-A), that is capable of accounting for advection\
    \ ﬂux term, estimated with a wind\nfunction which included a daily mean or extreme\
    \ temperatures parametrization, which is\nincorporated it into the original SEBAL\
    \ daily ET sub-model. [128] also suggested enhancing\nthe SEBAL model when it\
    \ is applied in a heterogeneous urban environment (uSEBAL),\nafter considering\
    \ urban land surface parameters and including the urban anthropogenic\nheat ﬂux\
    \ in the SEB budget.\nFinally, it is worth to note that recent open access software\
    \ code versions of SEBAL are\naccessible. One of them is a new python version\
    \ of SEBAL (pySEBAL), which incorporates\nan automated pixel selection procedure\
    \ and is currently under development and testing\nat the IHE-Delft Institute [129].\
    \ In addition, a new tool based on the SEBAL algorithm,\nmodiﬁed with a simpliﬁed\
    \ version of the Calibration using Inverse Modeling at Extreme\nConditions process\
    \ [130] for the endmembers selection, was developed within the Google\nEarth Engine\
    \ (geeSEBAL) environment [131].\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n13 of 36\nTable\
    \ 3 shows a review of the validation studies carried out by the SEBAL model\n\
    up to date. The main advantages of SEBAL are the minimum ground data required,\
    \ the\nunnecessary atmospheric correction thanks to the internal calibration.\
    \ However, elec-\ntion of dry/wet anchor points is subjective, SEBAL applications\
    \ over non-ﬂat areas and\nuncertainties on Ts estimates have a great impact on\
    \ H retrievals.\nTable 3. Representative chronological compendium of validation\

    3.1.4. Mapping Evapotranspiration at High Resolution and with Internalized Calibration\n\
    (METRIC) Model\nMETRIC was proposed by [54], based almost completely on SEBAL\
    \ method. The main\ndifferences with SEBAL are that Rn and Ts are corrected topographically\
    \ using a Digital\nElevation Model. Both methods differ in the calculation of\
    \ H as in METRIC the temperature\ngradient of the wet point (Equation (32)) is\
    \ expressed as:\nδTa,dry = (Rn − G − 1.05ETr)raH\nρCP\n(34)\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 3440\n14 of 36\nThe assumption that ET rate (ETr) is about 5% above that\
    \ of the standard ETr in the\nMETRIC model is assumed because, for a large population\
    \ of ﬁelds, some ﬁelds will have\na wet soil surface beneath a full vegetation\
    \ canopy that will tend to increase the total ET\nrate [54].\nSince METRIC is\
    \ directly based on SEBAL model, all the modiﬁcations previously\ndiscussed in\
    \ Section 3.1.3 can also apply to METRIC. However, it is interesting to note\n\
    a recent study [138], where calibration variability in METRIC is examined through\
    \ the\nanchor pixels selection. Following METRIC original procedure to detect\
    \ “cold” and “hot”\npixel in a scene, the authors detected a range of different\
    \ “cold” and “hot” pixels that\nconformed a total of ﬁve sets of calibration pixel\
    \ pairs (based on combination of maximum\nand minimum “cold” and “hot”, as well\
    \ as values closest to the ﬂux station). So, different\nslopes and intercept values\
    \ were retrieved from the plot δT vs. Ts (Equation (31)). In\nsummary, authors\
    \ observed signiﬁcant spatial differences in ET across the study area,\nwhich\
    \ suggested that candidate calibration pixels cannot be completely quantiﬁed using\n\
    only NDVI and Ts. Therefore, it can be presumed that the large differences in\
    \ δT among the\ncandidate pixels were not random noise, and that the inclusion\
    \ of available energy into the\ncalibration pixel selection process could potentially\
    \ improve the calibration process and\nprovide better estimates of ET.\nIs also\
    \ worth to note that METRIC results can be directly obtained at any region of\
    \ the\nworld with the new Earth Engine Evapotranspiration Flux (EEFlux) portal\
    \ [139,140]. Table 4\nshows a review of the validation studies carried out for\
    \ the METRIC model up to date. The\nmain advantages and drawbacks of METRIC are\
    \ the same as for SEBAL, Highlighting that\nthe main advantage over SEBAL is its\
    \ application over mountainous areas.\n3.2. Land Surface Temperatures–Vegetation\
    \ Index Triangle/Trapezoidal ET Models\nVegetation Indices (VIs) offer important\
    \ information from Ts−VI triangle/trapezoidal\nrelationship. These diagrams can\
    \ be useful for estimating regional ET values under the condition\nthat full ranges\
    \ of SM content and vegetation are present in the remote sensing scene.\nThe Triangle\
    \ method was described by [146], and provides a biophysical justiﬁcation\nfor\
    \ the combination of T and vegetation indices (VI) time series for land-cover\
    \ mapping\nand land-cover change analysis. Figure 2a shows the simpliﬁed Ts−VI\
    \ triangle diagram\nwhere the so called “dry edge” is deﬁned by a decrease of\
    \ the Ts with the increase of the VI,\nthis edge is deﬁned under the assumption\
    \ that highest Ts for different types of surfaces\n(different VIs) is associated\
    \ to points with unavailability of SM content. The lower envelope\nrepresents\
    \ the wet edge, which is nearly constant and represents the lowest Ts for the\
    \ different\ntypes of surfaces, assuming here that the ET is potential. Theoretically\
    \ the two envelopes (dry\nand wet edges) intersect in a point of full cover vegetation\
    \ and maximum ET.\nBased on the Priestley-Taylor formulation [147] and fully remotely\
    \ sensed data, an\nexpression proposed by [148] allows estimating the LE according\
    \ to the Ts−VI triangular\nrelationship as:\nLE = ϕ\n\x14\n(Rn − G)\n∆\n∆ + γ\n\
    \x15\n(35)\nwhere ϕ varies from 0 to 1.26, and it is estimated with a two-step\
    \ linear interpolation. This\ninterpolation consists in: (1) once set a ϕmin =\
    \ 0 (driest bare soil) and ϕmax = 1.26 (largest\nVI and lowest Ts), for each intermediate\
    \ VI a ϕmin,i is estimated by interpolation between\nϕmin and ϕmax and a ϕmax,i\
    \ is assigned to the minimum Ts value of such VI (usually 1.26),\n(2) Different\
    \ ϕi can be estimated from the Ts range at each VI. VI can be either the NDVI,\n\
    FVC, the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI),\
    \ etc.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n15 of 36\nTable 4. Representative chronological\

    \ intersections are observed in the dry edge and in the iso-lines\nof equal moisture\

    \ [150] proposed a Time-Domain Triangle Method (TDTM), based on a pixel by pixel\n\
    Ts–VI feature space, obtained by exploring the temporal domains over each single\
    \ image\npixel, since the triangle contains the whole climatic variability of\
    \ the Ts–VI. Also, in [151],\nan algorithm to determine quantitatively the dry\
    \ and wet edges for the Ts–VI triangular\nspace in arid and semi-arid areas, where\
    \ wet pixels are not generally easily identified, was\ndeveloped with an iterative\
    \ process that automatically retrieve the two edges in the Ts–FVC\ntriangle space\
    \ in ten steps. The process starts dividing the range of FVC in the Ts–FVC triangle\n\
    space into M intervals evenly and ends with a linear regression to obtain the\

    \ radiances without\nperforming atmospheric correction or other processes, to\
    \ avoid the uncertainty associated\nwith the estimation of ET, attributed to satellite\

    \ or ground data are required, but the drawback is that large numbers of pixels\n\
    with wide range of SM and FVC are required to assure dry and wet limits, a subjective\n\
    procedure. For the Trapezoidal method one advantage over triangular version is\
    \ that a large\nnumber of pixels is not required since intermediate values are\
    \ determined by four limiting\nvertices. But a drawback is that ground measured\

    \ Model\nA two-layer model of turbulent exchange that includes the view geometry\
    \ associated\nwith directional radiometric surface temperature was developed and\
    \ evaluated by [43]. The\nmain assumption of TSEB model is that Ts estimated from\
    \ remote sensing measurements is\nthe composite of soil and canopy surfaces, and\
    \ it can be expressed as:\nTs =\nh\nFVCT4\nc + (1 − FVC)T4\nsoil\ni\n(37)\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n18 of 36\nwhere Tc is the temperature of the canopy and\
    \ Tsoil is the temperature of the non-vegetated\nsoil. Note the term FVC in this\
    \ Equation (37) is a function of LAI and sensor viewing\nangle [44]. The original\
    \ TSEB does not consider the weighting by the emissivities of each\ncomponent,\
    \ but some authors have claimed for its importance [132,159,160].\nThe key of\
    \ the TSEB model is the partition of sensible heat ﬂux into the canopy and soil\n\
    layers. If we assume that there is an interaction between the ﬂuxes of both components,\
    \ due\nto a heating of the in-canopy air by heat transport from the soil, the\
    \ resistance framework\nin TSEB can be considered to be in series [43,161–163].\
    \ A parallel conﬁguration was\nalso introduced [43], based on the assumption that\
    \ the resistance of each source interacts\nindependently with respect to the surface-atmosphere,\
    \ although the canopy still has an\neffect on the radiation transmitted towards\
    \ the soil and the wind attenuation through\nthe canopy to the soil surface. Schemes\
    \ in Figure 3 shows both the series and parallel\nconﬁgurations [164]. Each component\
    \ has its own SEB equation expressed as:\nRn,soil = Hsoil + LEsoil + G\n(38)\n\

    Hsoil = ρCP\nTsoil − Ta\nraH + rs\n(44)\nHc = ρCP\nTc − Ta\nraH\n(45)\nwhere the\
    \ parameter rs is the resistance to the heat ﬂow in the boundary layer immediately\n\
    above the soil surface, and it can be expressed as:\nrs =\n1\n0.0025(Ts − Tc)1/3\
    \ + 0.012us\n(46)\nwhere us is the wind speed at a height above the soil surface\
    \ where the effect of soil surface\nroughness is minimal (i.e., 0.05–0.1 m).\n\
    Latent heat ﬂuxes for soil (LEs) and canopy LEc) are calculated as residuals of\n\
    Equations (44) and (45).\nAnother type of two-source model formulation is the\
    \ so-called patch model where it\nis assumed that all the ﬂuxes act vertically\
    \ and that there is no interaction between soil\nand canopy components (i.e.,\
    \ a complete energy balance between the atmosphere and each\nelement [165,166]).\n\
    There exist modiﬁcations on the TSEB model, like the Two-Source Time-Integrated\n\
    Model (TSTIM) proposed by [53], lately called Atmosphere-Land Exchange Inverse\
    \ (ALEXI)\nin [167], which relates time-differential Ts observed (1.5–5.5 h after\
    \ sunrise) from geosta-\ntionary satellites to the time-integrated energy balance\
    \ within the surface-atmospheric\nboundary layer system.\nALEXI has minimal reliance\
    \ on absolute (instantaneous) air or surface temperature\ninput data, and therefore\
    \ provides a relatively robust ﬂux determination at the coarse\ngeostationary\
    \ pixel scale (5–10 km). For ﬁner scale ET applications, ALEXI ﬂux ﬁelds can be\n\
    spatially disaggregated using higher resolution Ts information from polar orbiting\
    \ systems\n(e.g., Landsat or MODIS) in an algorithm referred to Disaggregated\
    \ ALEXI (DisALEXI)\nmodel [168].\nAnother modiﬁed TSEB model is the Simpliﬁed\
    \ TSEB (STSEB) model proposed\nby [169], which suggests dividing the Rn, H and\
    \ LE ﬂuxes in soil and canopy weighted\nvalues, according to the FVC. The scheme\
    \ proposed by [170], which is based on canopy\nconductance by means of a formulation\
    \ that has sound parameterizations of transpiration\nand evaporation, that links\
    \ soil surface temperature and soil evaporation eliminating the\nneed of using\
    \ soil moisture as input, and allowing the model predicting surface tempera-\n\
    ture and energy ﬂuxes simultaneously. Furthermore, it can be calibrated using\
    \ remotely\nsensed LST data.\nTables 6 and 7 show a list of the validation studies\
    \ carried out using TSEB model up to\ndate. TSEB is obviously a very well-accepted\
    \ model, based on the amount of validation\nstudies. The main advantages of TSEB\
    \ model are: angular effects are into consideration, no\n“resistance excess” correction\
    \ is required, atmospheric and emissivity induced errors on Ts\nare reduced (case\
    \ of ALEXI/DisALEXI model).\nIn general terms, the validation studies of all the\
    \ ET models shown in Tables 1–7\nestablish the estimation error of the daily ET\
    \ between 1–5 mm/d, with an average error of\naround 1 mm/d regardless of the\
    \ sensor spatial resolution or the type of surface under study.\nHowever, it can\
    \ be seen for ET models such as S-SEBI, SEBS, LST-VI Triangle/Trapezoidal\nor\
    \ Two-Source, that at high spatial resolutions (60–100 m) the error is smaller\
    \ (around\n1 mm/d), and around 2 mm/d for kilometric resolutions. Regarding the\
    \ one-source ET\nSEBAL and METRIC models, the validation studies have shown the\
    \ smallest errors, with\nvalues ranging between 0.4–2.4 mm/d, although most of\
    \ these studies have been carried\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n20 of 36\nout\

    \ from the recent Carlson’s essay [183],\nthat mathematical models of natural\
    \ land-living systems applied to satellite-based measure-\nment systems, will\
    \ never be able of full-describing and predicting all relevant processes\nrelated\
    \ to the functioning of such systems, insomuch as these models also require knowl-\n\
    edge of plants and soils. However, such models can be useful, in describing key\
    \ driving\nvariables under limited environment conditions for plant growth and\
    \ development, and\nsurface energy balance at spatial resolutions ranging from\
    \ tens of meters, up to hundreds\nof kilometers.\n4. Limitations, Current Trends\
    \ and Future Prospects\n4.1. Toward High Spatiotemporal Resolution ET Retrievals\n\
    Water resource management applications require spatial information about daily\
    \ and\nseasonal ET at pixel scales resolving individual agricultural ﬁelds or\
    \ even ﬁner management\nzones within ﬁelds. Such applications include irrigation\
    \ scheduling, monitoring compliance\nwith water rights, negotiating water rights\
    \ transfers, sales or leases, predicting changes in\nregional water use due to\
    \ land-use and/or climate changes, and studying the impacts of\nagriculture on\
    \ surrounding ecosystems and stream ﬂow [173]. Ts is the most inﬂuential\ninput\
    \ parameter in deriving the energy ﬂuxes, because it provides an indication of\
    \ the net\neffect of land-atmosphere interactions, which results in the process\
    \ of evapotranspiration.\nHowever, coarser-scale TIR imaging devices (e.g., MODIS)\
    \ can provide Ts data for ET\nmapping on a near-daily basis for relatively large\
    \ ﬁelds, these data being too coarse to\nresolve water use at the scale of individual\
    \ users in most irrigation districts. On the other\nhand, some polar orbiting\
    \ satellites (e.g., Landsat series, ASTER) are the only platforms that\nprovide\
    \ routine, global thermal imagery at scales (60–120 m) that resolve water use\
    \ patterns\nover heterogeneous agricultural areas, but overpass frequency (16\
    \ days) is not optimal for\nET monitoring. Hence, a desirable alternative technique\
    \ is to derive high resolution Ts data\nusing the ﬁne resolution VIS/NIR/TIR bands\
    \ that are available from either the same or\ndifferent satellite systems, at\
    \ daily frequencies of temporal resolution.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n22 of\
    \ 36\nA strong inverse relationship exists between Ts and VIs (see Section 3.2.),\
    \ and VIs can\nbe derived from VIS/NIR data at high spatial resolution (60–120\
    \ m). Such a relationship can\nbe exploited to improve the spatial resolution\
    \ of TIR band imagery (at a coarser resolution\nof 1–10 km) than the one associated\
    \ to VIS/NIR band instruments. This relationship reﬂects\nthe fact that denser\
    \ vegetation cover tends to be correlated with lower surface temperatures\ndue\
    \ to cooling by transpiration.\nGenerally, most methods ﬁrst imply a coincident\
    \ overpass of two (high and coarse)\nspatial resolution satellite imager (e.g.,\
    \ MODIS-Landsat/ASTER), both operating in the\nVIS/NIR/TIR regions. Second, the\
    \ methods are based on a statistical regression between\nVI (e.g., NDVI, SAVI,\
    \ EVI, Modiﬁed SAVI (MSAVI), Normalized Difference Moisture Index\n(NDMI), NDWI),\
    \ etc.), which is aggregated to the original resolution of the Ts (e.g., Landsat\n\
    NDVI at 30 m is aggregated to 960 m of the original MODIS Ts) and the actual Ts.\
    \ The resulting\nregression is used to disaggregate the coarse resolution Ts into\
    \ fine resolution Ts with the VI\nretrieved for other dates. The fundamental assumption\
    \ in this method of disaggregation is\nthat the Ts–VI relationship remains continual\
    \ at multiple spatial resolutions.\nTechniques and tools to disaggregate either\
    \ Ts, VI or ET are varied. So, the pio-\nneering work of [184] used the Spatial\
    \ and Temporal Adaptive Reﬂectance Fusion Model\n(STARFM) [185], which uses comparisons\
    \ of one or more pairs of observed Landsat/MODIS\nmaps, collected on the same\
    \ day, to predict maps at Landsat-scale on other MODIS obser-\nvation dates.\n\
    To estimate from ALEXI/DisALEXI application, daily ET values at MODIS (1 km) and\n\
    Landsat (30 m) scales, with continuous data retrieved from geostationary GOES\
    \ sensor.\nSuch STARFM- ALEXI/DisALEXI combined algorithm has been proven successful\
    \ in\nsuccessive studies [173,175,176]. Other techniques like the hybrid use of\
    \ the hot edge model\nand artiﬁcial neural network [186], machine learning approaches\
    \ [187] or data mining [188]\nare also valuable disaggregation alternatives. However,\
    \ temperature variations due to\nsubpixel moisture variability cannot be recovered\
    \ unless they are well-correlated with\nvegetation features. Therefore, dominant\
    \ moisture variations must be well-resolved at the\nnative TIR resolution. These\
    \ results suggest that while thermal sharpening is a valuable\ntool for enhancing\
    \ spatial information content in TIR imagery, it does not replace the need\nfor\
    \ TIR data collection at the sub-ﬁeld scale. Other differences between both sensors\
    \ exist\ndue to several effects such as acquisitions at different time, spectral\
    \ resolution, atmospheric\ncorrection, viewing angle, and pixel footprint that\
    \ have to be considered and resolved,\nusually by normalization procedures.\n\
    An actual prospect which has been recently addressed in [189–193], is the synergistic\n\
    application of disaggregation techniques to retrieve ET values at high spatiotemporal\n\
    resolution, using two different satellites, one of which is carrying a sensor\
    \ without thermal\nbands at coarser (~ 1 km) spatial resolution, and the other\
    \ carrying a VIS-NIR sensor\n(i.e., MODIS- Spot-5), mapping Earth surfaces at\
    \ ﬁner spatial resolution (~10–30 m) and\nwith a revisit of few days (e.g., 5\
    \ days for Sentiel-2, combining platforms A and B).\nIn this context, the ESA\
    \ has funded the Sentinels for Evapotranspiration (Sen-ET) project,\nwhich main\
    \ objective was to develop an open-source software application for accurate,\n\
    pre-operational modelling of instantaneous evapotranspiration, by means of an\
    \ optimal\nmethodology for estimating ET at tens of meters spatial scale, based\
    \ on synergistic use\nof Sentinel 2 and Sentinel 3 satellites observations. Also,\
    \ the continuing Increasing Crop\nWater Use Efﬁciency at Multiple Scales Using\
    \ Sentinel Evapotranspiration (ET4FAO) project,\nwill implement further reﬁnements\
    \ to the Sen-ET method. For further information readers\nare referred to Guzinski\
    \ et al. [194].\n4.2. Accurate and Spatial Representative Field Instrumentation\n\
    Common ET measuring systems include water balance, lysimeters, Bowen ratio, eddy\n\
    covariance, or sap ﬂow [5]. Inherent to all these methods is the reality that\
    \ the instrumental\nuncertainties and the difﬁculties to set a fully consistent\
    \ experimental setup to determine\nthe energy and water budgets can lead to water\
    \ use estimates far from reality.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n23 of 36\nInstrumentations\
    \ like water balance, lysimeters, Bowen ratio or sap ﬂow are point\nspeciﬁc and\
    \ could not represent the ET of medium (100 m) to coarse (1–10 km) scales\nestimated\
    \ from satellite data. The Eddy-Covariance systems are typically representative\
    \ of\nan area surrounding them of a few hundred meters of radius [195], but in\
    \ the case of terrain\nheterogeneities of smaller size their representativity\
    \ is questionable, as local circulations\nat the hectometer may advect signiﬁcant\
    \ amounts of water vapour [196]. New Large\nAperture Scintillometers (LAS) devices\
    \ provide an approach to validate ET at much larger\nscales. LAS estimate the\
    \ sensible ﬂux based on measurements of small ﬂuctuations in the\nrefractive index\
    \ of air caused by temperature, humidity, and pressure induced variations in\n\
    density. However, according to [6] all the above-mentioned instruments showed\
    \ average\ntypical errors of: 10% (lysimetry), 15% (Bowen Ratio), 20% (soil water\
    \ balance), 25% (Eddy\ncovariance and LAS) and 35% (sap ﬂow).\nEddy covariance\
    \ and LAS are well-accepted techniques to validate ET estimates at\nmedium to\
    \ coarse (100–1000 m) and large (up to 10 km) scales, because of a good ratio\n\
    error/advantage. But accurate instrumentation is required for ET validations at\
    \ different\nscales. In this sense Laser LAS devices [26,197] are lately being\
    \ used to ensure residual\nET estimations (through accurate H estimations) at\
    \ high and medium scales (10–100 m),\nreducing the problem of the SEB non-closure\
    \ induced by the Eddy correlation [198].\nThe use of unmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ (UAVs) has given a boost to precision agriculture,\noffering an opportunity\
    \ to provide multi-spectral imagery at the highest spatial resolution\n(few cm\
    \ per pixel, [87]). UAVs are portable and cost-effective, and ﬂight procedures\
    \ over\ncrop ﬁelds helps increasing the production. New VIS/NIR/TIR sensors onboard\
    \ UAVs\nhave the ability of observing the agricultural ﬁelds with great detail.\
    \ UAV images can\nproduce ortho-mosaics and 3D information products to be used\
    \ in mapping structure and\nvolume of plant canopy, which is directly correlated\
    \ to plant biomass and LAI, [199]. A\nsigniﬁcant number of studies recently published\
    \ [200–206] have taken advantage of the\ngood performance of UAVs, applying remote\
    \ sensing techniques to estimates the crop ET.\nIt must be emphasized the care\
    \ to be taken, when applying ET models to thermal sensors\non board UAVs, since\
    \ it is well-known that uncooled commercial thermal cameras induce\nvery signiﬁcant\
    \ errors in LST, which is key in the application of energy balance models [87].\n\
    4.3. Operational ET Products\nHistorically, the MODIS evapotranspiration products\
    \ (MO/YD16) are the ﬁrst\n0.5 km operational land surface ET database for the\
    \ global vegetated land surface at\n8-day, monthly, and annual intervals [207].\
    \ This product is based on the Penman-Monteith\napproach [7], not on thermal data.\
    \ This non-TIR based product has been widely evaluated\nagainst ground measurements,\
    \ showing errors around 0.31 mm/d, or 24%, using data\nfrom 46 eddy covariance\
    \ ﬂux towers [208]. Other important non-thermal-based datasets\nproducts are the\
    \ FLUXCOM [209], WaPOR [210], or the European Centre for Medium-\nRange Weather\
    \ Forecasts (ECMWF) (GLDAS) ET images [211]. However, some initiatives\nassimilate\
    \ the land surface temperature in their ET products. This is the case of the\n\
    ECOSTRESS ALEXI/JPL ET [212,213], or the EUropean Organisation for the Exploitation\n\
    of METeorological SATellites (EUMETSAT) Satellite Application Facility on Land\
    \ Surface\nAnalysis (LSA-SAF), ET product from Meteosat Second Generation (MSG)\
    \ [214]. The com-\nparison of these operational ET products with 15 eddy covariance\
    \ ﬂux towers located in\nEurope showed the good performance of the EUMETSAT over\
    \ the MODIS ET [208,215–217]\nproducts [194].\nThe Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam\
    \ Model (GLEAM) [218] is the only global\nET operational product designed to be\
    \ driven by remote sensing observations derived\nfrom microwave sensors, including\
    \ soil moisture and vegetation optical depth. To assimilate\nmicrowave soil moisture\
    \ observations—typically sensitive to the first few cm of the soil—\nGLEAM uses\
    \ a simple Newtonian nudging algorithm, which minimizes the computational\ndemands\
    \ [219]. All output datasets have a daily resolution and a common 0.25◦ global\
    \ grid.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n24 of 36\nAs previously commented on Section\
    \ 3.1.4., METRIC ET products can also be directly\ndownloaded, for any region\
    \ of the world, with the new Earth Engine Evapotranspiration\nFlux (EEFlux) portal\
    \ [140,220], that includes a tool that processes ET maps from input\nimages of\
    \ Landsat series 7 and 8, i.e., ET maps at the spatial resolution of 30 m every\n\
    16 days. Initiatives like online platform (OpenET, [221]) for mapping daily, monthly\
    \ and\nyearly ET values at the scale of individual ﬁelds (i.e., 30 m). This webtool\
    \ offers easily\naccessible satellite-based ET across the western US. Also missions\
    \ like GRAPEX [222] tries\nto apply a multi-scale remote sensing ET toolkit for\
    \ mapping crop water use and crop stress\nfor improved irrigation scheduling and\
    \ water management in vineyards in the Central\nValley of California, a region\
    \ of endemic periodic drought.\nDespite the enhancement of operational ET products,\
    \ there is still a demand of higher\nresolution and more accurate operational\
    \ ET products. As pointed out in Section 4.1., water\nresource management applications\
    \ require spatial information about daily and seasonal\nET at pixel scales of\
    \ the hundreds of meters or lower. Operational high spatiotemporal ET\nproducts\
    \ are being demanded specially from the agricultural sector and this is the goal\
    \ to\nbe achieved in the near future.\n4.4. New Advent of Orbiting Sensors with\
    \ Improved Spatial and Temporal Features\nSince its beginning nearly four decades\
    \ ago, the ﬁeld of Remote Sensing has expe-\nrienced an exponential increase in\
    \ terms of satellites, products and users. However, the\nadvance of the satellite\
    \ engineering is always a compromise between high spatial/low tem-\nporal resolution\
    \ (or vice versa) of the scenes acquired by the imager onboard. Fortunately,\n\
    these advances tend to converge to instrument features that attend the actual\
    \ requirements\nof remote sensing users. So, future Hyperspectral Infrared Imager\
    \ (HyspIRI) [223], will\ncombine near and shortwave infrared imaging spectrometer\
    \ with a multi-channel TIR\nradiometer, designed to have a spatial resolution\
    \ of 60 m and a revisit time of 5 days.\nAnother future micro-satellite is the\
    \ MIcro Satellite for Thermal Infrared GRound Surface\nImaging (MISTIGRI) [224],\
    \ which intends to estimate daily the TIR radiance from surface\nat resolutions\
    \ of 50 m, also with a revisit period of 5 days. Currently is orbiting and\nacquiring\
    \ data the ninth Landsat satellite [225], which is carrying, as well as its immediate\n\
    predecessor Landsat 8, two sensors on-board, Operational Land Imager (OLI) detecting\
    \ the\nVIS-NIR spectral reﬂectance at 30 m resolution and TIRS-2, measuring the\
    \ spectral thermal\nemittance at 100 m. Landsat 9 revisit time is 16 days, like\
    \ its predecessors.\nIn parallel, work is being carried out on the development\
    \ of increasingly higher\nresolution multispectral thermal sensors, such as the\
    \ ECOsystem Spaceborne Thermal\nRadiometer Experiment on Space Station (ECOSTRESS)\
    \ mission [226], the Land Surface\nTemperature Monitoring (LSTM) mission [227]\
    \ or the Thermal infraRed Imaging Satellite\nfor High-resolution Natural resource\
    \ Assessment (THRISNA) mission of Centre national\nd’études spatiales- Indian\
    \ Space Research Organisation (CNES-ISRO) [228], which will\nallow further progress\
    \ in the applications of this parameter in the estimation of crop water\nrequirements,\
    \ among other applications.\nRecently, the U.S. Geological Survey- National Aeronautics\
    \ and Space Administration\n(USGS-NASA) consortium has launched an operational\
    \ LST product for the entire Landsat\ntime series globally, which will also apply\
    \ to the new TIRS-2 sensor on board Landsat 9,\nthus continuing the entire Landsat\
    \ legacy beyond 2030.\n4.5. SEB Closure and Impact of Advection Term\nAll the\
    \ remote sensing-based ET models described in here, presume that the Equation\n\
    (1) is undoubtedly true and the SEB closure takes place as Rn is used only as\
    \ the source\nof the energy ﬂuxes H, G and LE. The analysis of the surface energy\
    \ budget with eddy-\ncovariance measurements has made evident that this presumed\
    \ closure seldom takes place,\ninstrumentation error aside, and there are other\
    \ terms that at least at some time of the\nday, it must be taken seriously into\
    \ consideration. Cuxart et al. [83] indicated that the four\nmains traditionally\
    \ terms would be only balanced if no other thermal sources or sinks\nRemote Sens.\
    \ 2022, 14, 3440\n25 of 36\nexisted, implying no thermal advection and surface\
    \ homogeneity. Therefore, once surface\nheterogeneity comes into the picture,\
    \ thermal advection will take place and the usual\n4-term energy budget will not\
    \ close anymore, and the corresponding imbalance is the sum\nof several other\
    \ terms like the heat storage in the volume, the biological thermal exchanges,\n\
    the temperature tendency, the thermal advection and any other unaccounted factor\
    \ [88].\nIn a recent study [87] it was observed from high resolution (2 m) Ts\
    \ maps obtained\nfrom a TIR camera assembled in a drone, that after up-scaling\
    \ the original resolution to\nscales of 70–200 m, the advection term can explain\
    \ an important amount of the imbalance\noccurred at midday in a SEB station. Non-closure\
    \ of SEB equation is an important issue\nhistorically left aside, but new tools\
    \ and remote sensing sensors commit to ET community\nto study such non-closure\
    \ causes in more detail.\n4.6. Machine Learning ET Retrievals\nThere is no doubt\
    \ that the Ts is the most inﬂuential indicator of the land-atmosphere\nevapotranspiration.\
    \ However, in the last years there have been a noticeable increase of\npublished\
    \ papers [229–237] that fused remote sensing techniques with a high variety of\n\
    machine learning (ML) methods to estimate ET values. Artiﬁcial intelligence approaches\n\
    using the ML techniques like: neural network (NN), support vector machine (SVM)\
    \ or\nrandom forest (RF) have tried to consider the non-linearity between ET and\
    \ the variables\nfor meteorological and land surface conditions. However, these\
    \ methods can be time-\nconsuming since in order to use properly a machine learning\
    \ algorithm, it is necessary to\ntrain it with a different dataset, and once optimized,\
    \ the ML algorithm is checked against a\ntest dataset, different from the training\
    \ and validation datasets. A new review study about\nthis topic [238] is recommended\
    \ to the reader for more detail.\n4.7. Merging ET Models\nIn the last ﬁve years\
    \ the number of studies related with the ET estimations with\nmulti-model techniques\
    \ have raised. The reason of such increase is because hybrid ET\nmodels may address\
    \ landscape heterogeneity occurring in most ecosystems. These areas\nare partially\
    \ covered with soil, trees, and grasses patches, so taking advantage of better\n\
    performance of single source ET models in homogeneous areas and Two-source ET\
    \ models\nin heterogeneous ones is of key importance for best ET retrievals. So,\
    \ a new growing trend\nto work with three-source SEB models, to account for complexity\
    \ of various contributions\nof different vegetation elements in the scene has\
    \ been stated [239], results showed that\nthree-source SEB models can be of great\
    \ utility for irrigation management of patchy surface\nas vineyard. Some of these\
    \ hybrid ET models are also based on machine learning techniques\nsuch SVM [240],\
    \ also with the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method, which is based on\nthe\
    \ basis of the posterior probability distribution of multiple candidate models\
    \ [101,241].\nBMA can not only predict more accurate values, but do so with smaller\
    \ biases and variances,\ntherefore this method usually outperforms individual\
    \ candidate models. Finally, a recent\nstudy [119] converted the single-source\
    \ SEBS into a dual-source model (called TS-SEBS) to\npartition ET into E and T\
    \ for detailed studies of ﬂux exchanges between soils and canopies.\n5. Conclusions\n\
    Monitoring the evapotranspiration of a crop or vegetated surface, through remote\n\
    sensing techniques, has been one of the goals of disciplines such as agriculture,\
    \ hydrology\nor climatology and meteorology, for a variety of purposes such as\
    \ optimizing the irrigation\nscheduling and the agronomic management, or for the\
    \ prediction of natural hazards such as\nﬂoods and droughts. Direct estimation\
    \ is simply not possible, and ET is generally obtained\nas a residue from the\
    \ energy balance equation, once the terms Rn, G and H have been\nestimated, assuming\
    \ that other effects, such as advection, are negligible, which is often not\n\
    the case. However, the original concept of using an aerodynamic temperature as\
    \ a refer-\nence was substituted by the information provided by the surface radiometric\
    \ temperature,\nmore easily derived from satellite data. Although results in the\
    \ literature show that the\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3440\n26 of 36\naerodynamic\
    \ surface temperature can be parameterized locally for different vegetation sur-\n\
    faces, surface homogeneity, and environmental and climatological conditions, with\
    \ relative\nsuccess, the lack of a robust and comprehensive model for the application\
    \ of this approach\nkeeps most efforts focused on the use of satellite thermal\
    \ images. This review article brings\ntogether and updates the main ET models,\
    \ based on LST data obtained from satellite. These\nmodels fall into 3 categories:\
    \ (i) one-source models, (ii) triangular/trapezoidal LST-VI\nrelationship models,\
    \ and (iii) two-source models. A comprehensive selection of validation\nstudies\
    \ for each particular model is included.\nAfter updating the state of the art\
    \ of the subject under study, no ﬁrm conclusions can\nbe stated regarding the\
    \ better performance of one model versus others. One can only extract\npartial\
    \ ﬁndings such as the better suitability of the one-source approaches for full\
    \ cover\ncrops, whereas the two-source models can better represent ET in woody\
    \ or row crops. In\ngeneral terms, the validation studies of all the ET models\
    \ shown in Tables 1–7 establish the\nestimation error of the daily ET ranging\
    \ 1–5 mm/d, with a mean error of around 1 mm/d\nregardless of the sensor, the\
    \ spatial resolution or the type of surface under study. However,\nit is noticed\
    \ that for ET models such as S-SEBI, SEBS, LST-VI Triangle/Trapezoidal or\nTwo-Source,\
    \ the error is smaller (around 1 mm/d) at high spatial resolutions (60–100 m),\n\
    and degrades up to 2 mm/d for kilometer resolutions. As for the one-source ET\
    \ SEBAL\nand METRIC models, validation studies report the smallest errors, with\
    \ values ranging\nfrom 0.4–2.4 mm/d, although most of these studies focus and\
    \ are based on high spatial\nresolution sensors. One of the main ﬁndings in this\
    \ review is that new formulations,\napproaches or model updates do not succeed\
    \ in reducing the uncertainty in ET modeling\nover the years. For these reasons,\
    \ decisions on the models to be implemented to derive\noperational ET products\
    \ based on coming missions such as ESA′s LSTM or NASA′s SBG,\nshould rather stand\
    \ on reliability and robustness under a variety of environmental and\nsurface\
    \ conditions. Joint efforts initiatives such as the recent OpenET should prevail\
    \ in this\nsearch. Some important challenges that the ﬁeld of ET monitoring from\
    \ satellite data have\nbeen identiﬁed, with special attention on the use of machine\
    \ learning methodologies to\nimprove ET estimates.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    and content Under a Creative Commons license open access Highlights • Machine
    learning (ML) outperformed empirical models for prediction of leaf wetness. •
    ML models were significantly more accurate than empirical models for most subsets.
    • On a regional basis ML were up to 8.78% more accurate than empirical methods.
    • The night-time subset of data is the least accurately predicted of all data
    subsets. Abstract Leaf wetness is an important input parameter into disease prediction
    models. The use of machine learning algorithms for the classification of leaf
    wetness measurements from 30 meteorological stations in North Western Europe during
    the period of January 2014 to October 2018 was assessed in this study. The accuracy
    of the empirical models utilised within in this study was enhanced by increasing
    the relative humidity threshold from 90% to 92%. Increasing the relative humidity
    threshold led to an average increase in the classification accuracy of 1.12%.
    The use of machine learning classification algorithms consistently provided more
    accurate results for the prediction of leaf wetness when compared to the empirical
    models that were studied with an average increase in the classification accuracy
    of 4.85%. The sub-division of the data into regional subsets had a greater effect
    on the accuracy of the models than the temporal sub-division of the data. Machine
    learning classification techniques performed well compared with previously established
    empirical models for the prediction of leaf wetness. Further improvements in the
    algorithms are possible, making the techniques studied here a viable research
    tool. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Leaf WetnessMachine
    LearningClassificationMeteorologyAgricultureCrop Disease 1. Introduction The development
    of a number of plant fungal and bacterial diseases are dependent upon the presence
    of water on plant surfaces, commonly referred to as leaf wetness (Rowlandson et
    al., 2015, Sentelhas et al., 2008) examples include bacterial spot disease of
    stone fruits and almond (Morales et al., 2018), Gibberella ear rot in Maize (Rao
    et al., 1998), apple scab in apples (Stella et al., 2017) and yellow rust and
    septoria blotch in wheat (Matzen et al., 2019). Typically water may accumulate
    on the canopy as a result of either rainfall events, irrigation, guttation (the
    secretion of droplets of water from the pores of a plant), dewfall from the atmosphere
    or distillation from the soil (Amir, 2016, Rowlandson et al., 2015, Sentelhas
    et al., 2008). As this paper is focussed on cultivation regions in north-western
    Europe, irrigation is not considered as a significant contributor to leaf wetness
    as it is not common to irrigate cereal crops or other broadacre crops. Guttation
    is an internal leaf process which exudes free water onto the leaf surface, little
    is known about guttation except that it primarily occurs on injured leaves and
    during periods of intense root growth activity (Jacobs et al., 1994). The occurrence
    of leaf wetness is an important parameter as an input variable into a disease
    prediction model along with temperature. Temperature is an important parameter
    for all phases of plant disease development while moisture is important for the
    infection process and the release of bacterial spores (Gillespie & Sentelhas,
    2008). The development of accurate disease warning systems has the potential to
    allow farmers to reduce the amount of chemical fungicides they apply without affecting
    the yield of their crops (Gleason et al., 2008). In the United Kingdom in 2016
    alone, over 5,684.4 tonnes (active substance) of fungicides were applied to broadacre
    crops (Garthwaite et al., 2016), a reduction in this usage would have substantial
    impacts from both an environmental standpoint and on the economics of crop production.
    Environmental impacts of fungicides and other chemical products applied to crops
    present as residues in crop products, side effects on ground water contamination,
    impacts on local wildlife and eco-systems, and so on. Current methods to determine
    the occurrence of leaf wetness include visual observation, threshold or empirical
    models and physical models (Kim et al., 2002, Pedro and Gillespie, 1982, Sentelhas
    et al., 2008, Wichink Kruit et al., 2004). The visual observation method is not
    a feasible method for implementation as it is time consuming, labour intensive
    and is subject to observer interpretation (i.e. at what level of observed moisture
    is the leaf considered wet?). The more common method of measuring leaf wetness
    is through the use of plate sensors which measure electrical resistance, as the
    surface of the sensor becomes wet the resistance decreases. These sensors have
    been developed and deployed since the late 1970′s when Gillespie and Kidd (1978)
    used a grid of solder-coated copper fingers mounted on a l mm thick, epoxy fibreglass
    board to compare the drying times of various colours of the sensors within an
    onion crop. The use of leaf wetness sensors on agricultural meteorological stations
    is limited, as a consequence many models for the prediction of leaf wetness have
    been developed including, but not limited to, (Gleason et al., 2008, Pedro and
    Gillespie, 1982, Rao et al., 1998). These models include both physical and empirical
    models. Empirical models are based on readily available meteorological data such
    as rainfall, relative humidity and windspeed (Francl & Panigrahi, 1997). Francl
    and Panigrahi (1997) reported that surface wetness obviously coincides with rainfall
    events, however, the time surfaces remain wet after rainfall is a more complex
    issue and depends on post-precipitation environmental conditions that influence
    drying times. An advantage of empirical based models over physical based models
    is that they require fewer input variables that are more readily available for
    most regions where crops are cultivated (Montone et al., 2016). Physical models
    for the prediction of leaf wetness may provide a more accurate prediction, however,
    the need for complex environmental conditions related to cloud cover, solar radiation,
    energy fluxes, crop growth parameters and soil parameters make the models complicated
    and less suitable as general models for the prediction of leaf wetness over larger
    areas (Allen et al., 1998, Bregaglio et al., 2011, Montone et al., 2016, Stella
    et al., 2017). Remote sensing of agricultural crops from both satellite and drone
    images has become increasingly common in recent years (Huang et al., 2018, Maes
    and Steppe, 2019). Leaf wetness may play an important role in the accuracy of
    the models produced from these images. Hornbuckle et al., 2006, Hornbuckle et
    al., 2010, have demonstrated that free water, in the form of dew, on the canopy
    of a maize crop had the effect of decreasing the brightness temperature of that
    crop while free water on the canopy of a wheat and grass crop had the effect of
    increasing the brightness temperature of the crop at the 1.4 GHz frequency of
    the European Space Agency’s Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite. If the
    effect of free water upon canopies is not taken into account during image acquisition
    estimations of soil moisture could be biased which may have an effect on drought
    stress, yield prediction and disease monitoring models of crops. Machine Learning
    (ML) has been defined by Liakos et al. (2018) as the scientific field that gives
    machines the ability to learn without being strictly programmed allowing for large
    non-linear problems to be solved autonomously (Chlingaryan et al., 2018). ML techniques
    have been adopted in a range of agricultural problems in order to help with the
    prediction and classification of a diverse range of parameters. Piedad et al.
    (2018) utilised tier-based ML combined with machine vision for the postharvest
    classification of banana with an accuracy of 94.2% achieved using the Random Forest
    (RF) classifier. A number of ML algorithms combined with spectral reflectance
    values have been implemented by Karadağ et al. (2020) to detect fusarium disease
    in peppers. The average success rate for the classification of peppers into diseased
    and healthy peppers was found to be 100% for the K-nearest neighbours (KNN) algorithm,
    97.5% for an artificial neural network algorithm and 90% for the Naïve Bayes algorithm
    (Karadağ et al., 2020). Mehra et al. (2016) used ML techniques, mainly artificial
    neural networks and RF to predict the risk of Stagonospora nodorum blotch in winter
    wheat using pre-planting factors. This paper specifically seeks to investigate
    the efficacy of ML techniques for the prediction of leaf wetness in North-Western
    Europe. It compares five popular ML classification algorithms with six pre-existing
    empirical models for the prediction of leaf wetness in a temperate maritime climate.
    This paper is novel as it constitutes the first comprehensive methodological study
    which compares a range of ML techniques with established ‘blue ribbon’ benchmarks
    for the prediction of leaf wetness. To date limited work has been undertaken in
    considering ML techniques for the prediction of leaf wetness. 2. Machine learning
    classification background The classification methods used in this paper are each
    briefly described in the subsections below (2.1 Support Vector classification
    (SVC), 2.7 Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)), the aim of this paper is not to provide
    an exhaustive explanation of each classification method, but to give an understanding
    of how each method operates. Further detail on all of the classification methods
    used in this paper and the underlying mathematical processes of each can be found
    in the Scikit-learn documentation (https://scikit-learn.org/stable/supervised_learning.html#supervised-learning).
    The described classification methods were chosen as a review of scientific literature
    shows them to be the most commonly used algorithms for classification purposes
    of agricultural and meteorological data. 2.1. Support Vector classification (SVC)
    Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are a group of supervised learning algorithms,
    which can be used for both classification and regression purposes (Binkhonain
    & Zhao, 2019). The objective of SVM algorithms is to find a hyperplane in N-dimensional
    space (with N being the number of features used to develop the model) which distinctly
    classifies the data points. SVMs attempt to maximise the distance between data
    points of the classes used in the classification, in the case of this paper the
    ‘wet’ and ‘dry’ time periods (Binkhonain and Zhao, 2019, Leena and Saju, 2019).
    These algorithms look for all data points that are close to the opposing class.
    These data points, which are known as support vectors, are important in the classification
    task, while the rest of the training data points are ignorable. Thereafter, the
    best separation line, known as the decision boundary, is defined (Leena & Saju,
    2019). Due to the long training time required for SVC algorithms on large datasets
    with non-linear kernels, LinearSVC was used in this study. According to Pedregosa
    et al. (2011) LinearSVC is appropriate for large datasets (where the number of
    samples is > ~50,000) as the fit time complexity is more than quadratic with the
    number of samples making it difficult to scale to larger datasets. 2.2. Gaussian
    Naïve Bayes (GNB): GNB is a statistical method based on Bayes’ theorem, with a
    strong ‘assumption of independence between features’ (Karadağ et al., 2020). GNB
    computes the probability of an input that is relevant to a specific pre-defined
    class, with the help of certain statistical functions (Binkhonain and Zhao, 2019,
    Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018). The output of this algorithm is the category
    with the highest probability (Binkhonain and Zhao, 2019, Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú,
    2018, Karadağ et al., 2020). The Bayesian approach for classification consists
    in finding the most probable class for a new example within a finite set of classes
    given the attributes that describe this example (Casamayor et al., 2010, Rehman
    et al., 2019). 2.3. Decision tree (DT) DTs are logic based algorithms where datasets
    are modelled in hierarchical structures using a series of comparisons of if/else
    statements to arrive at a homogenous classification of a target variable (Alpaydin,
    2010, Moller et al., 2019). Each node in the tree consists of either decision
    nodes containing terms or ‘leaves’ (Alpaydin, 2010), which consist of class label
    predictions. The branches are labelled by the weight of each term in the document
    (Binkhonain and Zhao, 2019, Chlingaryan et al., 2018). 2.4. Random forest (RF):
    A RF is a collection of DT classifiers grouped together to form a forest (Breiman,
    2001, Chaudhary et al., 2016). RFs are popular machine learning algorithms used
    for several types of classification tasks for noisy and unbalanced data and can
    identify non-linear patterns in the data (Chaudhary et al., 2016, Hart et al.,
    2019). A RF algorithm builds a collection of independent DTs whose results are
    combined to make a prediction for a given data record. Every tree of the forest
    gives a unit vote, assigning each input to the most probable class label (Hart
    et al., 2019, Saggi and Jain, 2019). Some of the major advantages of the RF classifier
    is that they are fast to train and do not suffer from over fitting, even if more
    trees are appended to the forest (Chaudhary et al., 2016, Hart et al., 2019).
    2.5. K Nearest neighbours (KNN) KNN is a statistical method used to predict the
    new input by computing the similarity between the test data and the new instance
    through finding the nearest K data points in the training dataset based on certain
    distance functions (Karadağ et al., 2020). K represents the number of nearest
    data points (i.e. neighbours) (Alpaydin, 2010, Chlingaryan et al., 2018, Khan
    et al., 2010). 2.6. Logistic regression (LR): LR estimates the probability of
    a binary response variable based on a set of predictor inputs (Hart et al., 2019,
    Sirsat et al., 2017). Unlike linear regression which outputs continuous number
    values, LR transforms its output using the logistic sigmoid function to return
    a probability value which can then be mapped to two or more discrete output classes
    (Hart et al., 2019, Piccini et al., 2019). 2.7. Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) An
    MLP is a type of feed forward artificial neural network (Piedad et al., 2018).
    For classification problems, the aim of an MLP is to approximate a nonlinear function
    to map covariates to a class label from a set of K possible class labels using
    model parameters (Augusta et al., 2019, Goodfellow et al., 2016). These model
    parameters are in effect the values of the weights on the connections between
    nodes (Goodfellow et al., 2016). Modelling begins with the input layer, proceeds
    to (at least) one hidden layer, and ends at the output layer (Ferentinos, 2018,
    Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018). There are no feedback connections in which
    outputs of the model are fed back into itself (Saggi & Jain, 2019). 3. Materials
    and methods 3.1. Meteorological data Meteorological data for this study was collected
    from 31 weather stations from across the United Kingdom (Fig. 1.) These weather
    stations were also grouped into smaller regions to determine if better predictions
    could be made from similar regions as opposed to a general model for the entire
    of the United Kingdom. The regional subsets of the data were determined following
    a visual assessment of the spatial distribution of the meteorological stations
    that were used in this study. All of the weather stations recorded rainfall (mm),
    air temperature (°C), relative humidity (%), windspeed (m s−1), wind direction
    (°) and solar radiation (W m−2) in 15 min intervals between January 1st 2014 and
    October 22nd 2018 totalling 3.23 million weather records. Download : Download

    ID. All of the sensors used in this study were supplied by ADCON (https://www.adcon.com/products/sensors-284/),
    OTT HydroMet GmbH, Klosterneuburg, Austria). Rainfall was measured with a resolution
    of 0.2 mm (±1% < 50 mm h−1; ± 3% 50 – 100 mm h−1; ± 5% > 100 mm h−1) using the
    RG1-200 tipping bucket rain gauge. Air temperature (±0.1 °C) and relative humidity
    (±1% 0 – 90% and ± 2% 90 – 100%) were measured using the TR1 combi-sensor. Wind
    speed was measured with the 3 cup anemometer (±0.3 m s−1) and wind direction was
    measured with the wind vane (±2°) of the Vento1 wind sensor set. Solar radiation
    was measured using the SP-Lite pyranometer. The pyranometer has a temperature
    dependence of + 0.15% °C−1 and a directional error of ± 5% at 80°. Soil temperature
    (°C, ± 0.3 °C) was recorded at a depth of 10 cm using the ST2 sensor (Fig. 1.).
    Leaf wetness was measured using the WET leaf wetness sensor. The leaf wetness
    sensor has an output that is between 0 and 10, this was converted to a dichotomous
    signal (0; dry and 1; wet) for comparison with other relevant studies. Readings
    from this sensor between 0 and 3 were deemed dry whilst readings from 4 to 10
    were deemed wet in accordance with the sensors technical data. All of the meteorological
    stations used in this study followed a rigorous installation process and undergo
    routine monitoring and maintenance to ensure no issues with biofouling and leaf
    build up affect the measurements for prolonged periods of time. 3.2. Leaf wetness
    models The ML models were compared against previously published empirical models
    for the prediction in leaf wetness. The empirical models that were chosen for
    comparison included models that were developed solely using meteorological data
    as input parameters as no information on the soil characteristics, canopy height
    measurements or Leaf Area Index (LAI) measurements were available for inclusion
    from other physical based models. Threshold models are a subset of empirical models
    that define a time period as wet if a meteorological variable, typically relative
    humidity (RH), is greater than a specified value. The current threshold value
    that is widely used is when RH > 90%. The authors also increased the threshold
    values of RH to 92% and 95% to determine if these higher values would lead to
    more accurate predictions. van Jaarsveld (2004) outlined a threshold value of
    RH > 87% which is used in the atmospheric transport model (OPS) of RIVM. Kim et
    al. (2002) expanded on a model that was previously published by Gleason et al.
    (1994) which used a classification and regression tree (CART) approach (Fig. 2)
    combined with a stepwise linear discriminant regression and a corrected windspeed
    factor to estimate the leaf wetness duration (LWD) of 15 sites in the United States.
    The DPD parameter illustrated in Fig. 2 is the Dew Point Depression which is defined
    as the difference between the air temperature and the dew point. Hours are classified
    as wet if either Inequality 1 or Inequality 2 are met. The model developed by
    Kim et al. (2002) predicted the LWD more accurately than a proprietary model for
    both the dew eligible and dew ineligible time periods. Download : Download high-res

    tree for the prediction of leaf wetness duration used by Kim et al., 2002. Inequality
    1 = ( Inequality 2 = The final two empirical models used for the prediction of
    leaf wetness are extended from threshold models outlined by (Wichink Kruit et
    al., 2004). These models account for changes in the RH over a defined time period.
    In this study two time periods were used, 15 min and 30 min. The models define
    a time period as wet if the RH is above 87%, and dry if it is below 70%. For RH
    values between these values leaves are assumed to be wet if the RH increases by>3%
    in the time period and dry if it decreases by >2% (Wichink Kruit et al., 2004).
    3.3. Machine learning classification algorithms The Scikit-learn module (Pedregosa
    et al., 2011) in the Python programming language compiled into a script was used
    to test whether or not the described ML classification methods could correctly
    differentiate the time periods of weather data into two classes of leaf wetness:
    ‘wet’ and ‘dry’. The Scikit-learn module was selected as Python is considered
    globally to be one of the most popular programming languages for scientific computing
    and has extensive scientific libraries available. In this study the data was split
    into training and test sets with the test set size being 20% of the initial dataset.
    All of the classification methods were set to default parameters unless specified
    otherwise. The air temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, solar radiation and
    windspeed parameters were used as input variables in all of the models that were
    developed in this paper. The soil temperature variable was only used as an input
    variable in the subset of data that looked at the meteorological stations that
    had this sensor installed. Data points were only considered as outliers if they
    exceeded possible ranges (e.g. a relative humidity value of >100%) otherwise all
    data points were included in the datasets. The data was not normalised prior to
    classification. 3-fold cross validation was used to validate model robustness.
    3-fold was used as Feng et al. (2008) found no statistical difference between
    this and 5-fold cross validation techniques. Also Romeiko et al. (2020) found
    3-fold cross validation useful for implementation on agricultural data such as
    that utilised in this study. 3.4. Model metrics In this section we describe the
    measures that were used to evaluate the performance of the models developed. This
    paper presents results of the performance of the models on the test set data.
    The confusion matrix of each model was obtained which allowed for the classification
    accuracy and a number of performance metrics to be calculated. These metrics included
    the precision, recall, specificity and F-score. The log loss and AUC-ROC score
    for each model were also obtained. The classification accuracy is defined as the
    number of correct predictions / total number of predictions ((TP + TN) / (TP +
    TN + FP + FN)), where TP is true positives, TN is true negatives, FP is false
    positives and FN is false negatives. Precision is defined (Binkhonain & Zhao,
    2019) as TP/(TP + FP). It measures the total number of correctly classified observations
    with respect to the total number of observations retrieved. Recall (also called
    the true positive rate) measures the fraction of observations that were correctly
    classified by the model and is expressed as TP/(TP + FP) (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú,
    2018). Specificity (also referred to as the true negative rate) is the opposite
    of Recall and is defined as TN/(TN + FP). The F-Score corresponds to the trade-off
    value of precision and recall is the harmonic mean of the two (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú,
    2018). It is expressed as 2 * (precision × recall) / (precision + recall). The
    F-Score, which is also commonly referred to as the F1 score, can also be considered
    as a measure of a models robustness, with higher F-Scores allowing for greater
    confidence in the predictions made by the classifier. The ROC score outlines the
    diagnostic ability of a binary classification system. Hindle et al. (2013) argue
    that the ROC score is less biased when compared to measures such as the F-Score
    which tends to skew towards the positive class in the case of unbalanced class
    distribution (Binkhonain & Zhao, 2019). ROC curves describe how good the models
    are at predicting the positive class when the actual outcome is positive and for
    this reason were chosen to display the results of the models evaluated in this
    work. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) is a measure of how well a parameter
    can distinguish between two classes (wet/dry). For the ROC curves displayed in
    this work (for the ML models) the predicted probabilities of achieving a classification
    result are presented in an effort to smooth the curves, this was achieved by employing
    the predict_proba function of the sklearn module that was utilised to develop
    the models. As there is no inherent probability of an outcome associated with
    the empirical models the ROC curves for these models have not been smoothed. The
    log loss metric measures the uncertainty of the probabilities of a model by comparing
    them to the actual labels. The lower the uncertainty of the prediction the better
    the model is at predicting the correct classification class. 4. Results and discussion
    The accuracy results from the K-means models ranged from 44.23% to 67.12% with
    an average accuracy of 51.77% and were therefore not presented in this study.
    Table 1 shows the results of the models produced using the entire dataset and
    the subset produced using the soil temperature parameter as an independent variable.
    Soil temperature was chosen as an independent variable to determine if soil heat
    fluxes and evapotranspiration rates could be accounted for with this variable.
    From Fig. 3 the variable with the strongest correlation to leaf wetness is the
    relative humidity (Pearson’s R = 0.52) parameter followed by the solar radiation
    (SPLite) parameter (Pearson’s R = -0.31). The leaf wetness is negatively correlated
    with solar radiation as higher readings of solar radiation are related to bright,
    clear days which would increase the evaporation of water from the surface of leaves.
    This can also be seen as the RH is correlated with solar radiation with a Pearson’s
    R value of −0.58. The low correlation of LW Binary (Fig. 3) to a single input
    variable illustrates the complex nature of predicting leaf wetness. The stations
    that recorded soil temperature are highlighted in Fig. 1. From Table 1 it appears
    that the addition of soil temperature as an independent variable to the models
    has a limited positive effect on the accuracy of the models. The preferred models
    (Table 1 and Fig. 4) with and without soil temperature had classification accuracies
    of 83.16% and 80.03%, respectively. Table 1. Performance metrics with standard
    deviation in parentheses for the unfiltered and soil temperature dataset modelsa.

    (b) empirical models of the full dataset, (c) machine learning models of the soil
    temperature subset, and empirical models of the soil temperature subset (d). The
    10 cm soil temperature is correlated with the air temperature with a Pearson’s
    R value of 0.77 for the meteorological stations used in this study. Onwuka and
    Mang (2018) reported that increased soil temperature influences the interspheric
    process of gas exchange between the atmosphere and the lithosphere. This may have
    an effect on leaf wetness as it would result in greater amounts of atmospheric
    moisture present at crop height. Soil temperature also increases the rate of plant
    growth (Onwuka & Mang, 2018), and as a consequence this may increase the amount
    of guttation from plants which would keep the leaves of plants wet for longer
    periods. Kim et al. (2010) reports that a RH threshold of > 90% has long been
    used as the standard to estimate LWD. The results from the empirical models for
    the full dataset and the soil temperature dataset in this study show that increasing
    the RH threshold from 90% to 92% increases the classification accuracy by 1.1%
    in both datasets. The increase in the RH threshold also increases the F-Score
    metric from 0.81 to 0.83 and reduces the log loss metric from 8.05 to 7.65 for
    the full dataset, indicating that the model is more robust in predicting the presence
    of water on the surface of a leaf. This increase in model capabilities can also
    be seen in the ROC curves shown in Fig. 4 and the AUC values of these curves presented
    in Table 4 with the RH > 92% model having a similar or greater area under the
    curve to the other models. The area under an ROC curve indicates how well a model
    can distinguish between the classes. The results for the threshold model of RH
    > 95% did not improve on the RH > 90% model and thus were not shown in this work.
    The empirical models that expanded on the RH threshold value, (RH_ext15 and RH_ext30),
    and the CART model performed considerably worse than the RH > 92 model with accuracies
    ranging from 63.78% to 69.7% for the full dataset. For the full dataset the most
    accurate ML model in predicting the leaf wetness was that of the MLP model with
    an accuracy of 80.03%. The second best model was the LR model which had an accuracy
    of 78.72%. Using soil temperature at 10 cm depth as an independent variable in
    ML classification algorithms results in a 7.35% increase in the classification
    accuracy when compared with an empirical approach using the RH > 92% threshold,
    this increases to 8.46% when the standard threshold of RH > 90% is used. This
    may be due to the increased rate of evapotranspiration from warm soils as reported
    by Onwuka and Mang (2018). 4.1. Effect of temporal subsets Table 2 shows the results
    of the models that were split on a temporal basis. The time periods for the day-time
    subset contained records from 07:00 to 19:45, inclusive, while the night-time
    subset contained records from 20:00 to 06:45, inclusive. These datasets were not
    adjusted to account for any seasonal variation in day length that may occur during
    the growing season at the latitudes at which this study was conducted. The accuracies
    of the temporal models (Table 2, Table 4 and Fig. 5) were highest for the models
    that were developed using the MLP classification algorithm for both the day-time
    and the night-time subsets (84.05% and 75.63%, respectively). These models also
    had the lowest log loss parameters of 5.51 and 8.42, respectively. The models
    with the highest accuracies produced using the empirical approaches were developed
    when the RH > 92 threshold was used (81.48% and 73.47% for the day-time and night-time
    subsets, respectively). The CART and extended threshold models were again the
    worst performing empirical models for the stations used in this study (Table 2,
    Table 4 and Fig. 4). As the CART model developed by Kim et al. (2002) used meteorological
    data for the states of Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois in the USA it may not be a
    suitable model for use in the humid maritime regions of North-Western Europe.
    Although the classification accuracy of the day-time model (84.05%) was higher
    than the classification accuracy of the full dataset model (80.03%), the average
    accuracy of the temporal models (79.84%) was comparable with the results of the
    full dataset model. This result would indicate that models produced using the
    full dataset would be more useful for farmers and decision makers as there would
    be less confusion between when/if the day-time model should be used. Henze et
    al. (2007) suggest that increasing day length at higher latitudes may affect the
    inoculation of some plant diseases. Conversely, night-time periods may not affect
    the growth of fungal spores on plants, however, more research would be needed
    to support or reject this hypothesis. As a full understanding of fungi that cause
    diseases such as Septoria tritici is not available, the details of their interactions
    with cereal crops remains elusive (Fones & Gurr, 2015). If this hypothesis held
    true then only leaf wetness periods during the day-time hours would be needed
    for disease prediction models allowing for the accuracy of 84.05% to be used.
    Further research on this topic would be required before any assessment could be
    made. Table 2. Performance metrics and standard deviations in parentheses for

    that empirical based models may have issues with their spatial portability as
    climactic conditions associated with leaf wetness may differ by geographical location
    and the topography of the surrounding region (Duttweiler et al., 2008). The data
    in this study was sub-divided into 4 regions (Fig. 1) to determine if this had
    an effect on the accuracy of the models produced. The results of the regional
    models are presented in Table 3 and the ROC curves for the empirical and ML models
    are illustrated in Fig. 6 with the AUC values presented in Table 4. The accuracies
    of these models ranged from 78.88% to 81.80% for the empirical models and from
    83.77% to 88.52% for the ML models. The average accuracy across the four regions
    used in this study for the empirical models and the ML models was 80.07% and 86.19%,
    respectively (Table 3). This compares to the accuracies of the full dataset of
    77.85% and 80.03% for the empirical and ML models, respectively (Table 1). This
    would suggest that regional sub-division of the data has a greater effect on the
    classification accuracy of models when compared to temporal subdivision of the
    data (Table 2 and Table 3). The highest accuracy in this study (88.52%) was found
    for the East region using the RF algorithm. The data used in this study was not
    further sub-divided into temporal subsets for each of the regions studied as there
    may be an increased risk of overfitting the data resulting in less robust models
    being produced. Interestingly, the East region is also the only data subset where,
    for the empirical models, the RH > 90 model (81.80% accurate) outperformed the
    RH > 92 model (80.22% accurate). The F-Scores and the log loss metrics were similar
    for both the RH > 90 and the RH > 92 models for this region (Table 3). Using ML
    models to predict regional leaf wetness led to an average increase in the classification
    accuracies of 6.13% (with range of 4.18% to 8.78%) over the best performing empirical
    models. The RF classification algorithm provided the best models for all of the
    regional subsets used, this is in contrast to the temporal subsets where the MLP
    model provided the most accurate results. The next best model for the regional
    subsets was the KNN algorithm which was on average 2.64% less accurate than the
    RF algorithm. Francl and Panigrahi (1997) reported predictions of leaf wetness
    in a 5,000 m2 wheat field for the years 1992 – 1994, inclusive, using an artificial
    neural network with an accuracy of 93%. Table 3. Performance metrics and standard

    0.592 a cf. Fig. 1 b cf. Table 1 The input parameters used in this study were
    similar to those used in the model developed by Francl and Panigrahi (1997). The
    results of Francl and Panigrahi (1997) and the results of this study (Fig. 1,
    Table 1 and Table 3) show that the smaller the region used to develop the model
    the more accurate the results. However, it may not be feasible to determine the
    leaf wetness on a field level scale for every field due to the amount of weather
    stations that would be required and the data handling and processing techniques
    necessary. 4.3. Discussion RFs are powerful algorithms particularly suited to
    handling prediction and classification problems that include nonlinear relationships
    and complex interactions between variables (Breiman, 2001, Chaudhary et al., 2016)
    making them suitable for the prediction of leaf wetness. The MLP algorithm yielded
    the preferred models when the number of records used for development of the model
    was relatively large. This occurred for the temporal subsets and for the full
    dataset (Table 1 and Table 2). In these cases the RF models were the second best
    performing models (Fig. 4 and Fig. 5) with an average accuracy 1.61% lower than
    the MLP models (Table 1 and Table 2). As the use of satellites for crop and agricultural
    monitoring grows (Liu et al., 2019, Maes and Steppe, 2019, Nayak et al., 2019,
    Urban et al., 2018) leaf wetness may become an important variable for crop models
    that predict a number of crop health and agricultural practices. Ben-Asher et
    al. (2010) reported that the presence of dew on leaves (leaf wetness) plays an
    important role in the production of plant biomass at a low water cost. This would
    mean that the presence of water on the leaves of plants has an important role
    in the water use efficiency of plants. Models that determine plant growth and
    crop yields in changing climactic scenarios may need to include leaf wetness as
    a factor within their analysis in order to better determine the effect of climate
    change on the growth of crops. Hornbuckle et al., 2006, Hornbuckle et al., 2010
    found that the presence of free water on the leaves of maize plants has an effect
    on the brightness values of the horizontally and vertically polarised L-bands.
    It was also reported that the majority of microwave emission models for the determination
    of soil moisture content do not account for the presence of dew on leaves which
    may represent a significant source of error for the models (Hornbuckle et al.,
    2006). Consequently, the evaporation of moisture from the soil decreases with
    the presence of dew (Ye & Peng, 2011). Inclusion of dew events or indeed the presence
    of leaf wetness would facilitate more accurate measurements of evapotranspiration
    and soil moisture content. This would for example allow for irrigation schedules
    of high value crops to be adjusted to a more suitable frequency. The main use
    of leaf wetness measurements is as an input into disease prediction models (Bregaglio
    et al., 2011, Chungu et al., 2001, Montone et al., 2016, Morales et al., 2018,
    Rowlandson et al., 2015). The pathogens of fungi and bacteria release spores and
    infect the host plants under the presence of moisture, inducing plant disease
    easily, thus dew supplies opportunities for growth of pathogens (Ye & Peng, 2011).
    Accurate measurements of this phenomenon would allow for timely interventions
    on the part of farmers reducing the risk of yield loss and the need for increased
    levels of pesticides to deal with more major epidemics of specific diseases. The
    F-Scores of the ML models were also consistently higher than the F-Scores of the
    compared empirical models. This means that although the increased accuracy of
    the ML models may be comparatively small the confidence in the accuracy of the
    predictions is increased, which would make the predictions from ML techniques
    more suitable for inclusion in disease prediction models where accurate predictions
    are required to effectively time the applications of crop protection products.
    The presence of moisture on the leaves of crops also has an effect on the efficacy
    of crop protection due to the dilution of the active ingredients and the possibility
    of subsequent run-off (Abi Saab et al., 2017) resulting in increased levels of
    pesticides in aquatic environments (Casado et al., 2019). Application of pesticides
    when this is less likely to occur would reduce the amount of run-off from an environmental
    aspect and would reduce the amount required by the farmers from an economical
    aspect. From an assessment of the influence of each meteorological variable for
    each classification algorithm used in this paper it was found that the RH values
    were the most important for the classification of LW in all cases with coefficient
    weights ranging from 0.107 to 0.190. The other meteorological variables used as
    input variables into the classification algorithms (Air temperature, Rainfall,
    Solar Radiation, and Windspeed) all had similar influences on the classification
    results according to their model coefficients. The coefficient weights for these
    variables all range between 0.0002 and 0.032. This was particularly true when
    only the RF and MLP models were looked at, the ranges for these algorithms reduced
    to between 0.008 and 0.031. In all cases these meteorological variables had a
    higher importance for the RF algorithm than the MLP algorithm. These results align
    with Fig. 2 where Kim et al. (2002) utilised the DPD, which is related to the
    air temperature, and the windspeed along with the RH value to classify the LWD
    of sites in the United States. From our assessment it would suggest that all of
    the meteorological variables that were assessed as part of this study would be
    required for the accurate classification of LW time periods. 5. Conclusions This
    study compared machine learning algorithms with previously established empirical
    models for the prediction of leaf wetness in North Western Europe. Results from
    the empirical models show that increasing the RH threshold from 90% to 92% resulted
    in an average increase in classification accuracy of 1.12% (Range; 0.51% − 1.41%).
    Only one region studied (East) had a lower accuracy score when the RH > 92% threshold
    was used. In this region the accuracy was 1.58% lower. The machine learning classification
    algorithms used in this study consistently provided more accurate predictions
    of leaf wetness than best of breed empirical models that were studied. The average
    increase in accuracy for the machine learning algorithms over the empirical models
    was 4.85% (Range; 2.16% − 8.78%). Sub-division of the meteorological stations
    into regions had a greater effect on the accuracy of the results obtained when
    compared with that of temporal sub-division of the data. The results of this study
    show that machine learning classification algorithms are a suitable techniques
    for the prediction of leaf wetness in a more accurate and robust manner than the
    empirical methods studied. Further sub-division of data in regional and temporal
    subsets may yield further increases in the accuracy of developed models if enough
    data to create sufficiently large datasets was available. To the authors knowledge,
    this is the first paper that looks at predicting leaf wetness in North Western
    Europe, while at the same time being one of the first papers to look at common
    machine learning classification algorithms for the prediction of leaf wetness.

    \ water stress intensity during post-\nveraison on table grape quality and yield,\
    \ as well as predicting berry quality at harvest using a\nmachine learning algorithm.\
    \ The dataset was obtained by applying different irrigation regimes in two\ncommercial\
    \ table grape vineyards during seven growing seasons. From these data, it was\
    \ possible to\ntrain and validate the predictive models over a wide range of values\
    \ for the independent (water stress\nintensity and fruit load) and dependent (ﬁrmness\
    \ and berry color) variables. The supervised learning\nalgorithm Gaussian Process\
    \ Regression allowed us to predict the variables with high accuracy. It\nwas also\
    \ determined that a reduction in irrigation of up to 40% during post-veraison,\
    \ compared to\nvines without water limitations, and the accumulation of the water\
    \ stress integral of up to 30 MPa\nper day, linearly increase the irrigation water\
    \ use efﬁciency (IWUE) and promote higher berry color\nand ﬁrmness. The severe\
    \ water scarcity and the increasing uncertainty about the irrigation water\navailability\
    \ for the season that farmers are facing highlight the advantage of incorporating\
    \ these\nvalidated techniques into agricultural decision making, as they allow\
    \ for the planning of cultural\npractices and criteria to increase the IWUE and\
    \ crop sustainability.\nKeywords: Gaussian Process Regression; radial basis function\

    1. Introduction\nTable grape (Vitis vinifera L.) production in Spain for the fresh\
    \ market covers an area\nof 14,665 ha, of which around 92% is produced under irrigation\
    \ and reaches an average\nyield of 24.2 t per ha. The Region of Murcia, in Southeastern\
    \ Spain, is the main producing\narea and represents almost 50% of the national\
    \ area [1]. Its production has been stimulated\nby the high-quality production\
    \ and the market acceptance of seedless varieties such as\n‘Crimson Seedless’\
    \ [2]. This cultivar was developed by the USDA (Fresno, CA, USA) and\nis characterized\
    \ by late-harvesting, medium-sized, cylindrical, bright red berries with\nthick\
    \ skin [3] and excellent organoleptic properties, such as a crunchy texture and\
    \ a sweet\ntaste [4,5]. Clusters are generally large, conical, and compact. It\
    \ has high bud fertility and\nis therefore very productive. Vines grow on a wide\
    \ range of soil types and can exhibit\nvigorous vegetative growth, which affects\
    \ productivity and berry quality [6,7]. Likewise,\nthe main problem associated\
    \ with this cultivar is insufﬁcient berry coloring [8–10], which, in\ncombination\
    \ with berry ﬁrmness, is the key factor determining consumer acceptance [11].\
    \ In\nMediterranean climates, such as in the Region of Murcia, with high summer\
    \ temperatures\nthat inhibit the accumulation of anthocyanins [12,13] and a narrow\
    \ temperature range\nbetween day and night during ripening, clusters with heterogeneous\
    \ color can be observed,\nwith fully red and still green berries [14,15], causing\
    \ important economic losses. In this\nsense, different cultural practices have\
    \ been investigated in ‘Crimson Seedless’ to avoid\nthese problems: (i) the application\
    \ of plant growth regulators such as abscisic acid and\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1416.\
    \ https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12061416\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n2 of 15\nEthephon during berry growth, but these have\
    \ shown inconsistent results [10,14–18];\n(ii) canopy management, either by regulating\
    \ vine vigor or thinning leaves close to the\nclusters to increase light exposure\
    \ [7,9]; (iii) fruit load regulation, such as ﬂower thinning,\nremoval of set\
    \ berries, or cluster thinning; this management strategy also has the advantage\n\
    that it can be carried out at the beginning of the season until the berries have\
    \ reached a\nsize of around 5 mm [7,9,10]; (iv) the application of a deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ regime, which has\nappeared as a more sustainable alternative to prevent berry\
    \ coloring problems and also\npromote the production of bioactive compounds [4,19,20].\n\
    Deﬁcit irrigation (DI) can increase berry color and cluster homogeneity at harvest,\
    \ and,\nat the same time, increase the irrigation water use efﬁciency (IWUE) without\
    \ negatively\naffecting yield or berry quality [4,12,19,21]. The effect of climate\
    \ change has increased\nthe intensity of water scarcity in Mediterranean areas,\
    \ so different DI strategies have\nbeen studied instead [22,23]. The most common\
    \ methods are regulated deﬁcit irrigation\n(RDI) [24] and partial root-zone drying\
    \ (PRD) [25]. Both provide less irrigation during\nperiods of the crop that are\
    \ not sensitive to water deﬁcit. In ‘Crimson Seedless’, the non-\ncritical period\
    \ is during post-veraison [12,21]. Another DI method that can increase the\ncolor\
    \ of grape berries is sustained deﬁcit irrigation (SDI), although, in contrast\
    \ to RDI, the\nirrigation reduction is applied during the entire crop cycle [26–28].\
    \ However, the effect of\nSDI would reduce crop yield and vegetative growth in\
    \ the long term [29,30]. Generally, the\nreduction in irrigation is estimated\
    \ from the FAO water balance [31], but it is necessary\nto complement it with\
    \ a method to control the plant water status [32]. In this sense, the\nmost validated\
    \ plant water status indicator is the stem water potential (Ψs), as it is directly\n\
    related to environmental conditions and soil water availability [33–38]. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwater stress integral [39] is an appropriate tool for quantifying the water\
    \ stress applied\nas a function of the Ψs, and to extrapolate the protocols obtained\
    \ to other agro-climatic\nzones. Therefore, determining the magnitude of the optimal\
    \ crop water stress is essential\nto increase the sustainability of production.\n\
    The irrigation volume available to the farmer is increasingly uncertain, so it\
    \ is nec-\nessary to explore the relationships between the intensity of the water\
    \ stress to be applied\nand its effect on berry quality, as well as its interaction\
    \ with cultural practices, to optimize\nthe production. The incorporation of machine\
    \ learning algorithms has made it possible to\nobtain models for several uses\
    \ in agriculture [40,41]. Thus, using a Gaussian Process Re-\ngression [42], the\
    \ weekly water requirement of ‘Crimson Seedless’ vines could be estimated\nwith\
    \ high accuracy from the daily maximum temperature and day of the year [43]. To\n\
    obtain robust models, it is necessary to have a reliable database, obtained under\
    \ controlled\nexperimental conditions and with a wide range of values to train\
    \ and validate the model in\ndifferent scenarios. With this premise, our research\
    \ was carried out using data obtained\nduring several seasons from the research\
    \ of our team in two experimental sites and with\nvines subjected to a wide range\
    \ of water stress.\nTherefore, our research aims to (i) model the effect of water\
    \ stress intensity on berry\nquality and yield, and (ii) predict berry quality\
    \ at harvest in a Mediterranean climate with\nsevere water scarcity, based on\
    \ two easily applicable and quantiﬁable parameters: water\nstress integral and\
    \ fruit load. Both objectives were developed to provide farmers with a tool\n\
    to cope with water scarcity while maintaining the production sustainability and\
    \ increasing\nthe irrigation water use efﬁciency.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    2.1. Data Collection\nThe data were collected between 2011 and 2017, from two\
    \ commercial table grape\n(Vitis vinifera L.) cv. Crimson Seedless vineyards (named\
    \ ES1 and ES2 in the present study),\nlocated in Southeastern Spain. In these\
    \ sites, different studies were carried out on this\ncrop by Conesa et al. and\
    \ Temnani et al. [19,21,43]. The reference crop evapotranspiration\n(ET0) was\
    \ obtained by the weather stations of the “Servicio de Información Agraria de\n\
    Murcia” [44]. Data were computed as an average of the 7 previous days. The crop\
    \ evapo-\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n3 of 15\ntranspiration (ETc) was calculated\
    \ according to the FAO method (ETc = ET0 × kc) [31], with\nthe crop coefﬁcients\
    \ (kc) reported by Williams and Ayars [45], varying between 0.2 and\n0.8 according\
    \ to the phenological stage. The dataset was obtained using different irrigation\n\
    strategies, as follows. (i) Control (CTL): vines were irrigated at 110% of the\
    \ ETc to avoid\nwater restrictions throughout the irrigation season (from April\
    \ to October). (ii) Regulated\nDeﬁcit Irrigation (RDI): vines were irrigated without\
    \ water restrictions, except during\nthe non-critical period of post-veraison\
    \ [21,43], when the vines were irrigated at 50% of\nCTL. (iii) Partial Root-zone\
    \ Drying (PRD): vines were irrigated as with RDI but alternating\nthe wet and\
    \ dry sides of the root zone every 10–14 days [46–48], when 75% of the soil\n\
    ﬁeld capacity was reached in the dry root zone. (iv) Sustained Deﬁcit Irrigation\
    \ (SDI):\nvines irrigated at 50% of CTL throughout the entire irrigation season.\
    \ (v) Null Irrigation\n(NI): vines received only rainwater and occasional supplementary\
    \ irrigation when the\nstem water potential (Ψs) was below the threshold of −1.2\
    \ MPa previously determined for\n‘Crimson Seedless’ [49]. The description of the\
    \ experimental sites is detailed in Table 1.\nTable 1. Description of table grape\

    \ site (Table 1) were grouped into a single\ndataset, and outliers were eliminated\
    \ when they exceeded ±1.5 times the interquartile\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n4\
    \ of 15\nrange for each parameter evaluated, providing a total of n = 67 observations\
    \ for ﬁrmness\nand n = 64 for the color of the berries. To determine the relationship\
    \ between irrigation\nwater reduction and yield reduction, the means of the treatments\
    \ were used, and only for\nthose where the water deﬁcit was applied during the\
    \ non-critical post-veraison period.\nSimilarly, to determine the relationship\
    \ between integral cumulative water stress during\npost-veraison and yield, berry\
    \ ﬁrmness, and color, the variables were normalized with\nrespect to plants without\
    \ water limitations (CTL).\n2.2. Water Stress during Post-Veraison\nVines’ water\
    \ status was monitored by measuring stem water potential at midday (Ψs)\nwith\
    \ a pressure chamber Model 3000 (Soil Moisture Equipment, Santa Barbara, CA, USA),\n\
    which was carried out every 7–14 days from April to October, following the recommenda-\n\
    tions of Hsiao [52]. At least two shaded and mature leaves were selected in each\
    \ replicate\n(n = 8 and n = 6 leaves per irrigation treatment for the ES1 and\
    \ ES2, respectively), with\nthe leaves placed in aluminized plastic bags for at\
    \ least 2 h prior to the measurements.\nAlthough vines under SDI and NI irrigation\
    \ practices were subjected to water stress during\nthe entire crop cycle, the\
    \ intensity of water stress endured by each irrigation treatment was\nestimated\
    \ with the water stress integral (SΨs) accumulated during the post-veraison period,\n\
    using the equation deﬁned by Myers [39]:\nSΨs(MPa day) = ∑(Ψi,i+1 − Ψc)n\n(1)\n\
    where Ψi, i+1 is the mean Ψs for any measurement i and i + 1; Ψc is the maximum\
    \ Ψs value\nmeasured during the post-veraison in vines without water restrictions,\
    \ and n is the number\nof days between each evaluation.\n2.3. Yield Parameters\
    \ and Irrigation Water Use Eﬁcciency\nThe total yield, expressed in kilograms\
    \ per vine, was determined as the sum of each\nharvest of the season, which began\
    \ at the beginning of September and corresponded\nto 3–4 different dates depending\
    \ on the season studied. Fruit load was determined as\nthe number of clusters\
    \ per vine and number of berries per cluster. Irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ (IWUE) was determined as the ratio between yield and total irrigation applied.\n\
    All these measurements were determined in all the vines used in the experiment\
    \ (n = 72\nand n = 63 vines per treatment for ES1 and ES2, respectively). More\
    \ details can be found in\nConesa et al. [19].\nIt is important to note that to\
    \ determine the effect of water stress intensity on berry\nyield, color, and ﬁrmness\
    \ variables, these were normalized to the maximum value observed\nin each season\
    \ and experimental site.\n2.4. Berry Skin Color and Firmness\nFor berry color\
    \ evaluation, the color index of red grapes (CIRG) was calculated, as\nit allows\
    \ for an objective evaluation of the berries’ external color, and more sensitively\n\
    differentiates all the variations of red [53,54]. First, the CIELAB color space\
    \ coordinates\nL* (lightness), a* (red to green), and b* (blue to yellow) were\
    \ obtained by measuring\nthree equidistant points of the equatorial zone of 15\
    \ berries per replicate (n = 60 berries\nper irrigation treatment in both experimental\
    \ sites) using a Minolta CR-300 colorimeter\n(Minolta, Osaka, Japan) per experimental\
    \ unit. From these values, the color parameters\nchroma (C*) and hue angle (h◦)\
    \ were calculated by:\nC∗ =\nq\n(a∗)2 + (b∗)2,\n(2)\nh◦ = tan−1(b∗/a∗)\n(3)\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n5 of 15\nFinally, theCIRGwas determinedaccordingtotheequation\
    \ proposed byCarreño etal.[53] as:\nCIRG =\n\x10\n180 − h\n◦\x11\n/(C∗ + L∗)\n\
    (4)\nBerry ﬁrmness, expressed as N, was evaluated in 20 randomly selected berries\
    \ per\nreplicate (n = 60 berries per irrigation treatment in both experimental\
    \ sites) and was\nobtained as the maximum force needed to break the skin by 5\
    \ mm in the equatorial zone,\nwith a texture analyzer model LFRA 1500 (Middleboro,\
    \ Brookﬁeld, MA, USA) equipped\nwith a 4-mm-diameter cylindrical probe moving\
    \ at a speed of 10 mm s−1.\n2.5. Water Stress Intensity and Productive Variables’\
    \ Effects on Berry Quality\nA principal component analysis (PCA) was performed\
    \ to explore the variability be-\ntween variables and to determine the most suitable\
    \ ones for predictive models of berry\nquality at harvest. Productive variables\
    \ were used, such as total yield per vine and berry\nweight; fruit load, expressed\
    \ as the number of clusters per vine, and number of berries per\ncluster; and\
    \ water stress intensity, as SΨs. The PCA was performed with the InfoStat soft-\n\
    ware [55]. Since the variables had different units of measurement, the data were\
    \ previously\nstandardized, and the Pearson’s r correlation matrix was used.\n\
    2.6. Predictive Model Algorithm\nA Gaussian process (GP) is a stochastic and non-parametric\
    \ method, as the model\nstructure is determined from the data rather than through\
    \ a parametric model. It deﬁnes\na distribution over functions such that, if we\
    \ select any two or more points in a function\n(i.e., different input–output pairs),\
    \ observations of the outputs at these points follow a joint\nmultivariate Gaussian\
    \ distribution [42,56,57].\nTo predict two critical marketable parameters in colored\
    \ table grape cultivars such as\n‘Crimson Seedless’ at harvest, berry color, as\
    \ the color index for red grapes (CIRG), and\nberry ﬁrmness (as N), based on easily\
    \ determined input predictors, such as the water stress\nintegral (SΨs) and fruit\
    \ load, two Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms were\ndeveloped. The\
    \ advantage of GPR over other machine learning methods lies in its seamless\n\
    integration of several machine learning tasks, including hyperparameter estimation,\
    \ model\ntraining, and uncertainty estimation [58], and it works well on small\
    \ datasets [43].\nIn Gaussian Process Regression, we assume the output y of an\
    \ unknown function f at\ninput x, and it can be written as:\ny = f (x) + ε,\n\
    (5)\nwhere ε is an independent, identically distributed Gaussian noise ε ∼ N\n\
    \00, σ2\nε\n\x01\n. GPR\nassumes that the function f (x) is distributed as a Gaussian\
    \ process:\nf (x) ∼ GP\n\0m(x), k\n\0x, x′\x01\x01\n,\n(6)\nwhere m(x) is the\
    \ mean function and k(x, x′) is the covariance function or kernel. The mean\n\
    function reﬂects the expected function value at input x and the prior mean function\
    \ is often\nset to m(x) = 0 to perform an inference via the covariance function.\
    \ Empirically, setting\nthe prior to 0 is often achieved by subtracting the (prior)\
    \ mean from all observations. The\ncovariance function models the dependence between\
    \ the function values at different input\npoints x and x’. In our study, we used\
    \ the radial basis function (RBF)—also called squared\nexponential—as the covariance\
    \ function, which is the most used in GP modelling, and is\ndeﬁned by\nKRBF\n\0\
    xi, xj\n\x01 = exp\nh\n−γ∥xi − xj∥2i\n, γ > 0,\n(7)\nwhere γ is a parameter that\
    \ controls the width of the Gaussian. Given a collection of\ninputs X, in regression\
    \ modelling, we can instead model the transition function f (x) using\na GP as\
    \ f (X) ∼ GP(m(X), k(X, X′)); the vector f = f (X) has a multivariate Gaussian\n\
    distribution f |X ∼ N (m(X), K), where m(X) is the prior mean vector, and K =\
    \ k(X, X′) is\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n6 of 15\nthe covariance matrix. Considering\
    \ the regression model y = f (X) + ε, with ε ∼ N\n\00, σ2\nε\n\x01\n,\nthe distribution\
    \ of the output y is then y| f ∼ N\n\0f, σ2\nε · I\n\x01\n, and y|x ∼ N\n\0m(X),\
    \ K + σ2\nε · I\n\x01\n,\nwhere I is the identity matrix. Once a mean function\
    \ and kernel are chosen, we can use\nthe Gaussian process to draw a priori function\
    \ values, as well as posterior function values\nconditional upon previous observations\
    \ [42,56,57].\nFor the CIRG estimation, the dataset after outlier removal (n =\
    \ 64) was split into\ntraining (70%) and testing (30%) sets, and a repeated k-fold\
    \ cross-validation was performed\nwith ten folds and ﬁfty repetitions. For berry\
    \ ﬁrmness estimation, the dataset (n = 67) was\nsplit into training (70%) and\
    \ testing (30%) sets and a repeated k-fold cross-validation was\nperformed with\
    \ twenty-four folds and ﬁfty repetitions. The metrics of model performance\nused\
    \ were root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and the coefﬁcient\n\
    of determination (R2), given by\nRMSE =\ns\n∑n\ni=1(yi − ˆyi)2\nn\n;\n(8)\nMAE\
    \ = 1\nn\nn\n∑\ni=1\n|yi − ˆyi|;\n(9)\nR2 = 1 − (yi − ˆyi)2\n(yi − y)2\n(10)\n\
    where yi and ˆyi are the ith observed and predicted response for i = 1, . . .\
    \ , n; and y is the\nmean of the values.\nThe GPR with the RBF function was implemented\
    \ using R-Studio [59] with the “caret”\npackage [60].\n3. Results\n3.1. Yield\
    \ Parameters and Irrigation Water Use Eﬁcciency\nThe total irrigation water received\
    \ by the Control (CTL) treatment, as an average\nof the two experimental sites,\
    \ was 6754 m3 ha−1 to satisfy 100% of the reference crop\nevapotranspiration (ET0),\
    \ ranging from 5960 to 7466 m3 ha−1. The vines subjected to\nregulated deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation during post-veraison were irrigated with an average of 4614 m3\n\
    ha−1, corresponding to an average of 4497 and 4799 m3 ha−1 for RDI and PRD, respectively.\n\
    On the other hand, those subjected to the sustained deﬁcit irrigation (SDI) treatment\
    \ during\nthe entire crop cycle were irrigated with 3061 m3 ha−1, and those subjected\
    \ to the null\nirrigation regime (NI) were only irrigated when the Ψs was below\
    \ −1.2 MPa, amounting to\n1896 m3 ha−1.\nYield was negatively affected according\
    \ to the water stress applied to the vines. Thus,\nvines not subjected to water\
    \ stress showed values very close to their maximum potential.\nHowever, in those\
    \ vines subjected to a water deﬁcit, the yield was slightly reduced up to\napproximately\
    \ a 9% reduction, in the case of RDI and PRD, with a linear decrease observed\n\
    from a 30% water reduction onwards, in the case of NI (Figure 1).\nIn treatments\
    \ where deﬁcit irrigation was applied during the post-veraison, irrigation\nwater\

    \ water\nstress integral (SΨs) in the range between 5 and 42 MPa day, increasing\
    \ by 0.214 units\nfor each MPa day of stress applied. However, when deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ was applied during\ncritical periods, the IWUE decreased by 0.312 units, even\
    \ at SΨs similar to post-veraison\ntreatments, due to yield reduction, either\

    \ of the predictive model\non a wide range of data for the independent (SΨs and\
    \ fruit load) and dependent (berry\nﬁrmness and CIRG) variables (Figure 4). In\
    \ the previous section, it was observed that the\nSΨs interval included values\
    \ that affected berry quality and yield, so this was useful for\nestimating maximum\
    \ reference values and optimal water stress intervals. Regarding fruit\nload,\
    \ it varied from 30 to almost 200 clusters per vine, showing that ‘Crimson Seedless’\n\

    \ The average berry ﬁrmness was around\n10 N, and the ideal values obtained in\
    \ conditions without water limitation were between\nthe median and the upper quartile\
    \ [19,21]. Regarding color, expressed as CIRG, data were\ngrouped into the categories\
    \ proposed by Carreño et al. [53], i.e., pink (2 < CIRG < 4) and\nred (4 < CIRG\
    \ < 5) (Figure 4).\nFor the CIRG estimation, the coefﬁcient of determination (R2),\
    \ root mean square error\n(RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) were 0.70, 0.19,\
    \ and 0.16, respectively. The best γ\nparameter was 0.3246 (Figure 5A).\nFor berry\
    \ ﬁrmness estimation, the R2, RMSE, and MAE were, 0.59, 1.95, and 1.64,\nrespectively.\

    \ of up to 40%, as compared to well-watered vines during post-\nveraison, together\
    \ with a water stress integral of up to 30 MPa day, promotes higher color\n(CIRG)\
    \ and ﬁrmness values in Crimson Seedless vines, without negatively affecting the\n\
    ﬁnal yield [4,43]. The irrigation water use efﬁciency (IWUE) increases linearly\
    \ up to the\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n11 of 15\nspeciﬁed stress integral threshold\
    \ value and decreases linearly beyond this threshold as\nyield is reduced (Figure\
    \ 2).\nThe effect of prolonged water scarcity in semi-arid Mediterranean climates\
    \ such as\nthat found in Southeastern Spain, and the increased pressure for water\
    \ resources, have high-\nlighted the need to increase the IWUE. By means of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation, it has been possible to\nincrease the IWUE without negatively affecting\
    \ quality or yield [4,12,61,62]. Moreover, a\ncertain level of water stress can\
    \ even improve berry quality through an increase in the red\nberry color and the\
    \ production of health-promoting bioactive compounds [4,12,19,20], as\nin the\
    \ case of ‘Crimson Seedless’ table grape production.\nIn this way, to carry out\
    \ a successful deﬁcit irrigation strategy, there are three funda-\nmental factors:\
    \ (i) water deﬁcit should be carried out during periods when the crop is not\n\
    sensitive, (ii) irrigation scheduling should be based on plant water status indicators,\
    \ and\n(iii) the water stress level applied should be quantiﬁed, and the threshold\
    \ reference values\nof Ψs must be known. In this sense, the non-critical period\
    \ for a deﬁcit irrigation strategy in\n‘Crimson Seedless’ is during post-veraison,\
    \ with a stem water potential (Ψs) threshold of\n−1.2 MPa [43]. From the maximum\
    \ Ψs, it is possible to quantify the water stress intensity\naccumulated during\
    \ the established deﬁcit period [39], allowing the extrapolation of the\nirrigation\
    \ protocols to other agro-climatic zones.\nBy using these criteria, average water\
    \ savings of around 40% were achieved in Crimson\nSeedless table grapes as compared\
    \ to the water balance according to the FAO method [31],\nby applying either RDI\
    \ or PRD irrigation strategies [62,63]. When SDI irrigation strategies\nwere applied,\
    \ the water saved was higher, even close to 70%, but it is necessary to consider\n\
    that keeping the plants under deﬁcit irrigation during the entire growth cycle\
    \ can have\nnegative effects on the production in the long term, because it causes\
    \ a decrease in leaf gas\nexchange and vegetative growth before veraison [64].\n\
    We found that the optimum water stress intensity to achieve maximum yield potential,\n\
    without affecting berry ﬁrmness and improving berry color in warm climates, corresponds\n\
    to a range between 22 and 30 MPa day (Figure 3). This conﬁrms that precise irrigation\n\
    management, even with some stress to the crop, can signiﬁcantly increase the water\
    \ use\nefﬁciency and, in addition, reduce possible exogenous applications of agrochemicals\
    \ to\nincrease berry coloration [19,21]. Skin berry color was signiﬁcantly related\
    \ to the intensity\nof water deﬁcit, although there was also a negative effect\
    \ of fruit load on color when\nthe vine had a high number of clusters (Table 3).\
    \ These ﬁndings are consistent with the\nrecommendation that, under conditions\
    \ of high fruit load, it is necessary to thin the clusters\non ‘Crimson Seedless’\
    \ [9]. Moreover, the combination of thinning and trunk girdling during\nveraison\
    \ increases the concentration or modulates the pattern of anthocyanins in the\
    \ skin,\npigments that determine the coloring of the berries [65–67]. This cultural\
    \ management\nallows, especially in climates with high temperatures during fruit\
    \ ripening, the avoidance\nof coloring problems and delayed berry ripening. However,\
    \ coloring is also inﬂuenced\nby other factors, mainly associated with the accumulation\
    \ of anthocyanin pigments from\nveraison, regulated by a complex mechanism inﬂuenced\
    \ by abscisic acid (ABA), the climatic\nconditions of the crop, and their variation\
    \ during the season, either the maximum daytime\ntemperature, the day/night temperature\
    \ range, or the incident radiation, the soil, and\nthe vigor of the vines [14,26,68,69].\
    \ In the same experimental site, Conesa et al. [19] also\nfound that the accumulated\
    \ ABA was associated with a decrease in the trunk growth rate\nat the post-veraison\
    \ period. Although potential berry ﬁrmness decreases as water stress\nintensity\
    \ is higher than 30 MPa day, no linear relationships were detected with the rest\n\
    of the parameters evaluated (Table 3). In this sense, it is important to be able\
    \ to predict\nthe ﬁnal berry quality in good time, so that, where and when necessary,\
    \ cultural practices\ncan be planned, such as ﬂower or cluster thinning [5,7,9],\
    \ girdling [65–67], plant growth\nregulator application [10,14,16–18,70,71], canopy\
    \ management to improve cluster exposure\nto light [8,10], regulation of nitrogen\
    \ fertilization [10], and deﬁcit irrigation as a more\nsustainable strategy [4,12,19–21,43].\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 1416\n12 of 15\nMachine learning is used to teach machines\
    \ how to handle the data more efﬁciently\nwhen we cannot interpret the information\
    \ extracted from them [72]. In supervised machine\nlearning algorithms, a set\
    \ of input variables (for instance, water stress integral and fruit\nload) are\
    \ used to predict a response variable (for instance, berry color or ﬁrmness at\
    \ harvest).\nThe dataset is divided into training and testing sets, consisting\
    \ of a set of inputs and outputs.\nAlgorithms must “learn” patterns from the training\
    \ dataset and apply them to the testing\ndataset for prediction or classiﬁcation\
    \ [73,74].\nThe Gaussian process (GP) is a Bayesian machine learning method that\
    \ has gained\nattention due to its ﬂexibility in modelling. A GP can be applied\
    \ in regression analysis,\ncalled Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) [42,56]. GPRs\
    \ are simple to implement, ﬂexible,\nfully probabilistic models, and thus a powerful\
    \ tool in many areas of application [75], even\nwhen only small datasets are available\
    \ [43]. In agriculture, the use of GPR made possible\nthe estimation, with a high\
    \ goodness-of-ﬁt, of the weekly irrigation of Crimson Seedless\nvines under deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation or under conditions without water limitations [43]. Moreover,\nthe\
    \ GPR method was more accurate in predicting water quality than other statistical\
    \ models\nsuch as multiple linear regression or artiﬁcial neuron networks [56].\
    \ In our case, both GPR\nmodels allowed us to estimate, with a high goodness-of-ﬁt,\
    \ the berry color or ﬁrmness at\nharvest, deﬁning it as a viable option when considering\
    \ the effect of several water stress\nintensities during the non-critical period\
    \ of berry development and the vines’ fruit load\n(Figure 5).\nThe severe water\
    \ scarcity and increasing uncertainty about the seasonal irrigation\nwater availability\
    \ faced by farmers highlight the advantage of incorporating these predictive\n\
    tools, previously validated with a robust database, into agricultural decision\
    \ making as a\ncomplement to the planning of cultural practices to increase IWUE\
    \ and crop sustainability.\n5. Conclusions\nIn ‘Crimson Seedless’ table grape,\
    \ deﬁcit irrigation during post-veraison with a water\nstress integral between\
    \ 22 and 30 MPa day, and without exceeding a threshold stem water\npotential of\
    \ −1.2 MPa, allowed the plant to approach its maximum productive potential,\n\
    without affecting the berry ﬁrmness and increasing their coloring. It also allowed\
    \ water\nsavings of around 40% with respect to the control.\nGaussian Process\
    \ Regression allows the accurate prediction of berry color and ﬁrmness\nat harvest,\
    \ based on the water stress intensity and fruit load, which allows the consideration\n\
    of cultural practices to avoid possible color problems that affect consumer acceptance.\n\

    \ internet of things, monitoring and control \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nDue to rising\
    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nplant and schedule water\
    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\

    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\

    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\

    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\
    \ The review results show that researchers and \n666 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al.\
    \ - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse: recent\
    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \nfarmers can maximize the use\
    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    \ agriculture sector worldwide has experienced significant changes recently, \n\
    which have altered daily farm work activities. Due to the decrease in profit of\
    \ certain \nfarming businesses, the intensification of agricultural operations\
    \ has followed, \nwhich has resulted in a diversification of farm activities.\
    \ However, due to increasing \nindustrial regulation, the agriculture sector’s\
    \ mechanization and automation have \nsignificantly influenced the qualitative\
    \ transformation of farmers’ daily work activi-\nties and those of the entire\
    \ farming community globally. The farming industry has \ntransformed because of\
    \ new machinery, technological advancements, genetically \nInternet of Things\
    \ – New Insights\n2\nmodified seeds, new fertilizers, and organic and sustainable\
    \ farming. Innovative \ntechnologies are becoming increasingly crucial in the\
    \ agriculture industry as a tool \nfor sustainable development. Agriculture automation\
    \ is a valuable strategy that has \nenhanced product quality while reducing production\
    \ costs and manual labor and \nimproving environmental sustainability. Automation\
    \ in farming equipment, irriga-\ntion and fertigation systems, climate control,\
    \ pest and disease management, and soil \nfertility contribute significantly to\
    \ agricultural productivity [1–6].\nArtificial intelligence (AI) can help farmers\
    \ improve crop yields, reduce biomass \nwaste, and make better decisions. To build\
    \ precise maps of crops and soil, AI is used \nto analyze data recorded from sensors,\
    \ drones, and satellites. The data is used to opti-\nmize fertilizer, irrigation\
    \ application, and pest control. AI-driven irrigation systems, \nfor instance,\
    \ regulate watering schedules based on weather patterns and soil moisture \nlevels,\
    \ lowering water usage and boosting agricultural yields. AI technology is also\
    \ \nused for crop monitoring purposes. It examines satellite or drone-shot images\
    \ of crops \nto spot problem regions. For instance, it can spot disease or nutritional\
    \ deficiency \nsymptoms before they appear to the naked eye. Farmers are then\
    \ able to take mea-\nsures before the issue gets worse. AI also analyzes historical\
    \ data on weather patterns, \nsoil conditions, and crop yields to predict future\
    \ outcomes. This information can be \nused to optimize planting schedules, predict\
    \ crop yields, and identify areas at risk of \ncrop failure. Drones and robots\
    \ with AI capabilities can perform many on-farm tasks, \nfrom planting seeds to\
    \ harvesting crops. As a result, less manual labor is required, and \ncrop productivity\
    \ increases. The health and well-being of livestock can be monitored \nusing AI\
    \ technology. It can, for instance, examine sensor data from animals to find \n\
    symptoms of certain diseases [7–15].\nInternet of Things (IoT) is a network of\
    \ devices that sense real-time condi-\ntions and then trigger actions to respond,\
    \ but many IoT applications require more \ncomplex rules to link triggers and\
    \ responses. IoT applications in agriculture use \nsensors and other connected\
    \ devices to collect real-time data and automate farm-\ning operations, leading\
    \ to better efficiency, decreased costs, and improved yields. \nThe agriculture\
    \ sector is undergoing a revolution because AI and IoT technologies \nprovide\
    \ farmers access to real-time data and insights that help them make precise \n\
    decisions. Integrating AI and IoT in agriculture improves farm productivity, reduces\
    \ \nwaste, and optimizes crop yield. In order to collect real-time data on crop\
    \ health, \nsoil moisture, and meteorological conditions, IoT technology is being\
    \ employed in \nagriculture. This data can be collected by sensors placed around\
    \ a farm and trans-\nmitted to a central database for AI algorithm analysis. This\
    \ enables farmers to decide \non irrigation, fertilizer, and other farming practices.\
    \ AI and IoT in agriculture help \nlessen the environmental effects of farming\
    \ in addition to increasing crop yields and \nminimizing waste. Farmers can reduce\
    \ the use of pesticides and fertilizers, consume \nless water, and produce less\
    \ greenhouse gas emissions by optimizing their farming \noperations [5, 16–22].\n\
    The AI and IoT paradigms have seen widespread adoption by numerous businesses\
    \ \nin recent years. Modern precision agriculture practices are largely mechanized\
    \ and are \nintegrated with effective and well-developed AI and IoT technologies.\
    \ Although the \nconcept of the IoT and AI is not new, it has recently gained\
    \ massive popularity, mainly \nbecause of the upgradation in hardware technology\
    \ over the past decade. AI and IoT \ntechnologies rapidly transform the agriculture\
    \ sector through increased produc-\ntion, cost savings, and sustainability. Moreover,\
    \ contemporary precision agriculture \nresearch has recently amalgamated with\
    \ machine learning (ML) techniques to devise \ninnovative solutions for agricultural\
    \ challenges. Robots, drones, remote sensors, \n3\nApplications of AI and IoT\
    \ for Advancing Date Palm Cultivation in Saudi Arabia\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113175\n\
    computer and satellite imagery, constantly evolving ML models, and analytical\
    \ equip-\nment are used in the AI and IoT to monitor crop and livestock, storage\
    \ rooms, macro-, \nand microclimate, survey, and field mapping in real time, as\
    \ well as to provide data to \nfarmers for logical farm management strategies\
    \ that will not only simple, time, and \nresources saving but also improve crop\
    \ production. These technologies are, therefore, \nincreasingly being employed\
    \ in the agriculture sector to support more environment-\nfriendly on-farm operations\
    \ and improve ecological sustainability, all while maintain-\ning the financial\
    \ stability of farming enterprises [15, 23–27].\nDate palm (Phoenix dactylifera\
    \ L.) cultivation is an essential economic activity in \nmany arid regions, including\
    \ Saudi Arabia. Despite its economic importance, date \npalm cultivation faces\
    \ several challenges, including water scarcity, pests and diseases, \nclimate\
    \ change, and the lack of postharvest processing technologies [28]. To address\
    \ \nthese challenges, there is a need for innovative and advanced solutions that\
    \ can \nimprove crop management and increase water use efficiency in date palm\
    \ cultivation \n[29]. Recent AI and IoT advances can transform agriculture by\
    \ providing real-time \ndata on fruit quality, tissue culture systems, crop health,\
    \ soil moisture content, and \nmeteorological conditions [30]. In addition, using\
    \ AI and IoT technologies in date \npalm cultivation can bring several environmental\
    \ benefits, including optimized water \nuse, reduced pesticide use, and improved\
    \ soil health. Date palm cultivation is also \nwater-intensive and can strain\
    \ local water resources. AI and IoT technologies can \nbring several environmental\
    \ benefits to date palm cultivation. One potential benefit \nof using AI and IoT\
    \ in date palm cultivation is water use optimization.\nBy installing sensors in\
    \ the soil and on the trees, farmers can monitor soil moisture \nlevels and adjust\
    \ irrigation accordingly. AI algorithms can analyze the data collected \nby these\
    \ sensors and recommend when and how much water to apply. This can help \nreduce\
    \ water waste and increase water use efficiency, particularly in areas with \n\
    limited water resources. Another potential benefit is the reduction of pesticides\
    \ and \nfungicides. IoT devices, such as drones equipped with cameras and sensors.\
    \ Can \ndetect pest and disease infestations early, allowing farmers to act before\
    \ the infesta-\ntion becomes widespread. AI algorithms can also analyze data from\
    \ these devices to \nrecommend the most effective and least harmful pesticides\
    \ and fungicides. This can \nreduce the amount of these toxic chemicals used in\
    \ date palm cultivation, positively \naffecting local ecosystems. Using AI and\
    \ IoT in date palm cultivation can also improve \nsoil health. By monitoring soil\
    \ bionomics, moisture content, nutrient levels, and other \nfactors, farmers can\
    \ adjust their fertilization practices to ensure that they provide \ntheir trees\
    \ with the nutrients they need while minimizing excess fertilizer application.\
    \ \nThis can help reduce soil degradation and improve overall health [31–34].\
    \ However, \nthere is a lack of review research and book chapters on the application\
    \ of AI and IoT \nin date palm cultivation, particularly in Saudi Arabia. Previous\
    \ books and research on \nthe application of AI and IoT in agriculture have focused\
    \ primarily on different crops, \nwith limited attention given to date palm cultivation.\n\
    Furthermore, most previous research has been conducted in temperate regions, \n\
    where farmers face challenges that differ from those in arid regions, such as\
    \ Saudi \nArabia. Therefore, this chapter aims to address these gaps in knowledge\
    \ by investi-\ngating the applications of AI and IoT-based technologies, such\
    \ as sensors, machine \nlearning algorithms, and data analytics, and their potential\
    \ benefits and challenges \nfor promoting sustainability and advancing date palm\
    \ cultivation in Saudi Arabia. In \naddition, the chapter discusses the challenges\
    \ that must be addressed to realize the \nfull benefits of using AI and IoT in\
    \ date palm cultivation. By providing insight into \nthe modern developments and\
    \ future trends for AI and IoT in date palm cultivation, \nInternet of Things\
    \ – New Insights\n4\nthe chapter provides valuable information for researchers\
    \ and policymakers inter-\nested in using these technologies in arid regions.\n\
    The rest of the chapter is structured as follows: First, we introduce the importance\
    \ \nand challenges of date palm cultivation in Section 2, Section 3 describes\
    \ AI and IoT \ntechnologies, Section 4 provides an overview of applications of\
    \ AI and IoT in agri-\nculture, Section 5 details benefits and application of\
    \ AI and IoT in date palm cultiva-\ntion, Section 6 indicates the challenges of\
    \ implementing ai and AI and IoT in date \npalm cultivation, Section 7 suggests\
    \ future opportunities for AI and IoT in date palm \ncultivation, and Section\
    \ 8 concludes the work.\n2. Importance and challenges of date palm cultivation\n\
    Date palm is commonly grown in arid- and semiarid regions of the world on 1.31\
    \ \nmillion hectares and produces 9.82 million tons of fruit yearly. In Saudi\
    \ Arabia, date \npalm is a major fruit crop in dry regions of North Africa, the\
    \ Middle East, and parts \nof Asia, which provides food, nutrition, and building\
    \ materials to the inhabitants and \nother byproducts. More than 120 million date\
    \ palm trees are worldwide, and more \nthan 84 million trees are grown in the\
    \ Arab world (Egypt, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Algeria, \nMorocco, Tunisia, and the\
    \ United Arab Emirates). Arab countries have 70% of the \nworld’s date palm trees,\
    \ contributing 67% of global production. More than 23 million \ndate palm trees\
    \ are grown in Saudi Arabia on 152,734 hectares of land, which yield \n1.57 million\
    \ tons of dates annually [35–38].\nThe cultivation of date palms in Saudi Arabia\
    \ is significant for several reasons, \nincluding its economic importance. The\
    \ date palm industry is labor-intensive and \nhelps both males and females by\
    \ generating revenue and jobs. Due to increased \nemployment prospects in rural\
    \ areas, widespread migration to cities is lessened. \nWomen have a significant\
    \ role, especially during the palm propagation stages (using \nin vitro or conventional\
    \ methods) and postharvest stages, including packaging and \nmarketing. Date production\
    \ and trading help local economies and serve as a source of \nrevenue for farmers\
    \ and exporters. Over the past few decades, Saudi Arabia’s agricul-\ntural sector,\
    \ particularly the date palm sector, has experienced tremendous growth \nand support\
    \ [39–43].\nMany countries in the Middle East and North Africa, such as Saudi\
    \ Arabia, Iran, \nIraq, Egypt, and Tunisia, rely substantially on the export of\
    \ dates. In 2021, Saudi \nArabia was the leading global exporter of fresh or dried\
    \ dates, with an export value \nof about 322.84 million USD [44]. However, the\
    \ production and profitability of Saudi \nArabia’s date palm producers are constrained\
    \ by several challenges. These challenges \ninclude water scarcity due to the\
    \ depletion of groundwater, soil degradation by \nsalinization, soil erosion,\
    \ and desertification due to the loss of vegetation cover by \novergrazing and\
    \ overharvesting of wood for fuel, insect pest infestations, disease, an \ninsufficient\
    \ number of processing and packaging facilities and technologies, environ-\nmental\
    \ pollution, and a decline in consumer demand for date fruit [29, 38, 45–47].\n\
    In Saudi Arabia, water scarcity is one of the biggest challenges that date palm\
    \ \nproducers face. The country’s freshwater reservoirs are scarce, and most water\
    \ sources \nare saline. As a result of the country’s limited water resources,\
    \ the agricultural sector \nconsumes ca. 90% of the water. Due to the substantial\
    \ water requirements of date \npalms, farmers have experienced decreased yields\
    \ and elevated production costs. \nExtended droughts are common in the country,\
    \ limiting the amount of water used for \nagriculture. In addition, because of\
    \ urbanization and population growth, there is an \n5\nApplications of AI and\
    \ IoT for Advancing Date Palm Cultivation in Saudi Arabia\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113175\n\
    increase in water consumption, creating competition for the limited supply of\
    \ water \nresources. Farmers of date palms who rely on irrigation to sustain their\
    \ crops are \nunder strain because of this situation.\nAdditionally, date palm\
    \ farmers lack effective irrigation systems, such as drip and \nsubsurface irrigation\
    \ systems. Many farmers employ ineffective traditional flood \nirrigation systems\
    \ that cause significant water losses through evaporation and runoff. \nThe farmers\
    \ of date palms who use this method also contribute to soil salinization, \nworsening\
    \ the irrigation water shortage. To address this problem, date palm farmers \n\
    use desalinated seawater for irrigation, which is costly and unavailable to all\
    \ farmers. \nThe Saudi government has significantly invested in irrigation systems\
    \ and technolo-\ngies to encourage effective water use in agriculture to address\
    \ this issue [48–50].\nDesertification and soil erosion are further threats to\
    \ the sustainability of date \npalm production. The process of topsoil being removed\
    \ by wind or water and leaving \nunusable land that cannot support plant growth\
    \ is called soil erosion. On the other \nhand, desertification refers to degrading\
    \ formerly productive land into desert-like \nconditions because of natural or\
    \ human-caused factors such as excessive grazing, \ndeforestation, and unsustainable\
    \ farming methods. In Saudi Arabia, several causes, \nsuch as climate change,\
    \ excessive groundwater use, and unsustainable farming \nmethods, have contributed\
    \ to the deterioration of soil health and desertification. The \ncountry is especially\
    \ prone to these issues because of its arid climate and constrained \nwater supplies\
    \ [51–57].\nAnother challenge date palm farmers face in Saudi Arabia is the prevalence\
    \ of \npests and diseases. Date palms are susceptible to various pests, including\
    \ red palm \nweevils, long horn borer, dust mites, fruit flies, scale insects,\
    \ and fungal diseases. \nThe red palm weevil is an invasive species that infects\
    \ young and mature palm trees, \ndamaging their vascular system. The weevil larvae\
    \ bore into the tree trunk, feeding \non the soft tissues and creating tunnels\
    \ that damage the tree structure. The leaves of \ninfested trees display wilting\
    \ and yellowing symptoms, resulting in death [58–66].\nPostharvest losses are\
    \ estimated to be around 10% in Saudi Arabia, where date \npalm farming is an\
    \ important industry. Limited postharvest facilities in the country \nare one\
    \ of the key reasons for these losses. Postharvest facilities are essential for\
    \ \nthe proper storage, processing, and packaging of dates. They help prevent\
    \ spoilage, \nminimize losses, and maintain the fruit’s quality. However, due\
    \ to various issues such \nas high costs, lack of knowledge, and inadequate infrastructure,\
    \ many date palm \nfarmers in Saudi Arabia do not have access to these facilities\
    \ [67–71].\nAnother issue Saudi Arabian date palm growers deal with is a skilled\
    \ manpower \nshortage. Many date palm farmers rely on skilled migrant labor during\
    \ harvest and \nperform different cultural practices such as pollination, pruning,\
    \ fertilization, irriga-\ntion, chemical application, etc. However, changes in\
    \ immigration policies and geopo-\nlitical strains have made it difficult for\
    \ farmers to access skilled labor when needed. \nThis has resulted in labor shortages\
    \ during critical periods, which can lead to reduced \nyields and financial losses\
    \ for farmers. As a result, skilled labor shortages during criti-\ncal periods\
    \ reduced production and financial losses for farmers [72, 73].\n3. AI and IoT\
    \ technologies\nAI refers to a group of technologies that allow computers to do\
    \ a wide range of \ncomplex tasks, such as seeing, comprehending and translating\
    \ spoken and writ-\nten language, analyzing data, making suggestions, and more.\
    \ It revolutionized \nInternet of Things – New Insights\n6\nagriculture by making\
    \ farming more efficient, sustainable, and profitable. In \naddition, many businesses\
    \ are embracing IoT, which offers simple means to collect \nand evaluate technical\
    \ data to identify and improve the performance of numerous \ndaily operations.\
    \ The technological revolution reveals new challenges and issues \nwith our current\
    \ IoT technologies. New technologies, such as AI, 5G, and block-\nchain, promise\
    \ to solve these challenges. We can create intelligent machines with the \nhelp\
    \ of IoT and AI integration. These innovative automation technologies not only\
    \ \nmake monotonous tasks more accessible but they also make smart decisions without\
    \ \nhuman assistance. The IoT and AI are two of the most significant technologies\
    \ in the \ncomputing industry, completely transforming how we communicate with\
    \ machines \nand our environment. It is speculated that ca. 64 billion AI and\
    \ IoT devices will \nbe available by 2025. AI and IoT technologies work effectively\
    \ together and are at \nthe top of the latest innovations influencing the information\
    \ technology sector. \nThe industrial and agribusiness sectors have benefited\
    \ from the duet’s redesign of \ntraditional solutions [74, 75].\nMachine learning\
    \ (ML) is a subset of AI that involves training algorithms to make \npredictions\
    \ or decisions based on training data. ML is a rapidly growing field with \nnumerous\
    \ applications and opportunities for scientific innovation. It is a branch \n\
    of AI that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that\
    \ allow \ncomputer systems to automatically improve their performance on a specific\
    \ task as \nthey gain experience. ML aims to develop intelligent systems capable\
    \ of learning from \ndata and making predictions or judgments without being specifically\
    \ programmed to \ndo so. In IoT, ML is a technique that can be applied to analyze\
    \ sensor data and forecast \nfuture events. Deep learning has become a potent\
    \ ML method in recent years. Deep \nlearning includes putting multiple-layer neural\
    \ networks through training to learn \nhow to represent data hierarchically. As\
    \ a result, developments have been made in \nfields such as speech recognition,\
    \ natural language processing, and image recogni-\ntion. Numerous industries,\
    \ including agriculture, healthcare, finance, marketing, \nand transportation,\
    \ use ML in various ways. ML in agriculture has the potential to \nbe applied\
    \ in a variety of ways with exceptional results from weed, pests and disease \n\
    detection, crop yield, and quality prediction, to data collection, providing insights,\
    \ \nand livestock production forecasting. It can be used in the healthcare industry\
    \ to find \nnovel medicines and disease diagnoses. It can be applied to finance\
    \ to assess risk and \ndetect fraud. It can be used in marketing for personalized\
    \ advertisements and cus-\ntomer segmentation. It can be applied to autonomous\
    \ driving and traffic forecasting \nin the transportation sector [29, 76–81].\n\
    Natural language processing (NLP) is a field of AI that applies to the interaction\
    \ \nbetween computers and humans using natural language. NLP is vital to contempo-\n\
    rary AI systems because it enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate\
    \ \nhuman language. The development of smart homes, smart cities, and other intelligent\
    \ \nsystems now has more opportunities since integrating NLP in IoT devices. Users\
    \ can \ncommunicate more effectively and easily with IoT devices by adding voice\
    \ recognition \nand natural language understanding capabilities. One of the most\
    \ significant applica-\ntions of NLP in IoT is voice assistants such as Amazon’s\
    \ Alexa, Google Assistant, and \nApple’s Siri to turn on/off lights, play music,\

    \ Farmers may find new customers and bargain for higher prices with the \naid\
    \ of NLP algorithms. Improved consumer-farmer communication is another area, \n\
    where NLP can be employed. Farmers can learn more about consumer preferences by\
    \ \nexamining customer feedback analysis. Using NLP algorithms, farmers can commu-\n\
    nicate more effectively with each other, sharing their best agriculture practices\
    \ and \nworking together on research initiatives [82–86].\nComputer vision is\
    \ a field of AI that enables computers and machine systems to \nextract useful\
    \ information from visual data (digital images and videos) and then take \nactions\
    \ or make recommendations. This technology is widely used in IoT to enable \n\
    devices to see and interpret the physical entity through object, facial, and gesture\
    \ \nrecognition, thus making them more intelligent and responsive. With the help\
    \ of deep \nlearning algorithms, computer vision systems can identify objects\
    \ in real time and \nclassify them into different categories. This capability\
    \ has been used in various IoT \napplications, such as autonomous vehicles, security\
    \ cameras, and smart home devices. \nSimilarly, computer vision systems can extract\
    \ valuable environmental informa-\ntion by analyzing images captured by cameras\
    \ or sensors. For example, they can \ndetect anomalies or changes in a scene,\
    \ monitor traffic flow, or track the movement \nof people or objects. IoT has\
    \ also used this technology for gesture recognition and \nhuman-computer interaction.\
    \ Computer vision systems can enable users to interact \nwith devices more naturally\
    \ and intuitively by analyzing hand movements and ges-\ntures. This capability\
    \ has been used in various applications, such as gaming consoles, \nvirtual reality\
    \ systems, and smart home devices. Many agricultural activities are \nbeing automated\
    \ and optimized using computer vision technology. Crop monitoring, \nyield prediction,\
    \ and insect and disease detection are a few applications of computer \nvision\
    \ technology in agriculture [87–91].\nRobotics technology is a branch of engineering\
    \ that entails creating and program-\nming robots and is crucial to advancing\
    \ AI and the IoT. It is used in IoT to create \nintelligent machines that can\
    \ exchange data and connect. Robotics is using machines \nto carry out jobs that\
    \ are either harmful or too difficult for humans. How we interact \nwith machines\
    \ has changed dramatically because of the inclusion of robotics technol-\nogy\
    \ in AI and IoT, improving their efficiency, dependability, and autonomy. These\
    \ \nrobots’ 24/7, nonstop operation, which is also utilized for data entry and\
    \ processing \ntasks, minimize errors, and boost efficiency. Automation of robotic\
    \ processes has \nbeen widely used in several sectors, including agriculture,\
    \ manufacturing, healthcare, \nlogistics, and finance. The development of autonomous\
    \ robots is another way that \nrobotics technology is used in AI. Robots operating\
    \ independently of humans may use \nsensors, cameras, and other cutting-edge technologies\
    \ to navigate their environment. \nRobotic technology is being employed more frequently\
    \ in agriculture to improve \nthe productivity and efficiency of farming operations.\
    \ Many benefits are reported \nfrom using robots in agriculture, such as improved\
    \ crop yields, lower labor costs, and \nincreased accuracy [15, 92–95].\nEdge\
    \ computing represents a decentralized computing model that moves compu-\ntation\
    \ and data storage nearer to the requirement point, enhancing response speed \n\
    and minimizing bandwidth consumption. In IoT, edge computing can process sensor\
    \ \ndata in real time at the network’s edge. ML models used in AI are substantially\
    \ trained \nusing massive volumes of data. This training can be carried out locally\
    \ via edge \ncomputing, reducing the need to send large amounts of data to centralized\
    \ servers. \nBy storing sensitive data on local devices rather than transferring\
    \ it over the internet, \nedge computing can decrease network congestion, enhance\
    \ privacy and security, and \nInternet of Things – New Insights\n8\nincrease reliability.\
    \ Edge computing can also be utilized to run AI models in real time, \nenabling\
    \ rapid response and decision-making. Edge computing, for instance, can be \n\
    utilized to analyze sensor data from a localized area in real time and identify\
    \ possible \nproblems before they escalate [96–101].\nCloud computing technology\
    \ plays a crucial role in developing and deploying AI \nand IoT applications.\
    \ It provides an infrastructure that allows organizations to store, \nmanage,\
    \ and process large amounts of data generated by IoT devices and AI applica-\n\
    tions. Within the cloud computing framework, the vendor hosts and provides infra-\n\
    structure, data, and software as a service to the user. Scalability is one of\
    \ the most \nsignificant benefits of cloud computing for AI and IoT. Because cloud-based\
    \ services \nare easily scaled up or down according to demand, businesses and\
    \ organizations can \nmanage the massive amounts of data and processing power\
    \ needed for AI and IoT \napplications.\nAdditionally, cloud computing offers\
    \ an affordable solution for users who need to \nstore and process large amounts\
    \ of data. By utilizing cloud-based ML platforms, cloud \ncomputing also enables\
    \ the development of AI and IoT applications. These platforms \ngive programmers\
    \ access to robust machine-learning algorithms, resources, and \nlibraries that\
    \ they can utilize to develop sophisticated applications.\nAdditionally, developers\
    \ can scale up or down their ML models in response to \ndemand using cloud-based\
    \ ML platforms. Additionally, cloud computing offers a safe \nenvironment for\
    \ processing and storing private data produced by IoT and AI applica-\ntions.\
    \ To safeguard customer data from cyber threats, cloud service providers have\
    \ \nimplemented several security measures such as firewalls, access controls,\
    \ and encryp-\ntion [102–106].\nBlockchain technology is a decentralized and distributed\
    \ ledger system that \nsecurely and transparently records transactions across\
    \ multiple computers. It enables \nsecure transactions between parties without\
    \ the need for intermediaries. It can be \nused for secure device authentication,\
    \ data sharing, and supply chain management. \nThis technology can enhance AI\
    \ and IoT systems’ security, privacy, and interoper-\nability. Increased security\
    \ is one of the main benefits of adopting blockchain in AI \nand IoT. It secures\
    \ data and transactions using cryptographic algorithms, making \nit difficult\
    \ for hackers to tamper with or steal data. Blockchain can also be used to \n\
    develop secure digital identities for users and devices, which can help restrict\
    \ unau-\nthorized access. Improved privacy is a benefit of using blockchain in\
    \ AI and IoT. Users \ncan choose who can access their data and maintain control\
    \ over it. This technology is \nessential when sensitive data needs to be protected,\
    \ such as in healthcare and financial \napplications.\nAdditionally, blockchain\
    \ can improve the interoperability of various IoT and AI \nsystems. It enables\
    \ different methods to communicate with each other more easily by \nestablishing\
    \ a shared decentralized ledger of transactions. This can make it simpler \nfor\
    \ developers to create new applications and lessen the difficulty of integrating\
    \ vari-\nous systems [107–111].\n4. Applications of AI and IoT in agriculture\n\
    By 2025, it is anticipated that global spending on intelligent, interconnected\
    \ \nagricultural technology and systems, including AI and IoT, will triple in\
    \ size, reach-\ning $15.3 billion. Understanding how factors such as sunlight,\
    \ weather, animal, bird, \nand insect movements, crop use of specific fertilizers\
    \ and pesticides, and planting \n9\nApplications of AI and IoT for Advancing Date\
    \ Palm Cultivation in Saudi Arabia\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113175\n\
    and irrigation cycles affect crop production is a perfect subject for machine\
    \ learning. \nExcellent data has never been vital for determining a crop cycle’s\
    \ profitability. For this \nreason, farmers and the agricultural sector are stepping\
    \ up their data-centric strate-\ngies and broadening the scope and scale of the\
    \ application of AI and IoT technology to \nimprove crop yields and quality [112–116].\n\
    Crop yields are being increasingly optimized using AI and IoT. Farmers can \n\
    understand more about the health of their crops and make intelligent decisions\
    \ about \nwater and fertilizer requirements and disease and pest control by utilizing\
    \ data from \nsensors and other connected devices. Precision farming is a significant\
    \ area, where AI \nand IoT are used in agriculture. This entails creating precise\
    \ field maps and real-time \ncrop growth monitoring using data from sensors, drones,\
    \ and other sources. Farmers \ncan identify areas that need water, fertilizer,\
    \ or disease/pest control by examining this \ndata and areas that are vulnerable\
    \ to disease or pest infestation. Due to their increased \nability to deploy resources\
    \ effectively and efficiently, crop yields increase and costs \ndecrease [117–120].\n\
    Predictive analytics is yet another approach AI and IoT use in agriculture. Farmers\
    \ \ncan use machine learning algorithms to accurately predict future yields by\
    \ analyz-\ning historical data on weather patterns, soil conditions, and crop\
    \ performance. This \nenables them to plan for planting and harvesting crops and\
    \ make smart decisions \nabout pricing and marketing. Before a vegetation cycle\
    \ even begins, it is now possible \nto know the potential yield rates of a field\
    \ using AI and IoT technology. The potential \ncrop yield can be estimated using\
    \ machine learning techniques to analyze 3D map-\nping, sensors’ soil analysis\
    \ data, and drone-based soil color data. Farmers can auto-\nmate the irrigation\
    \ schedule of their crops based on real-time data on soil moisture \ncontent via\
    \ remotely connected devices, such as smart sprinklers and soil sensors. \nSatellite-based\
    \ thermal-infrared imaging remote sensing AI and IoT technology also \nmonitor\
    \ irrigation rates and crop water requirements. Automating tasks, such as \nfertilization\
    \ is another possible application of AI and IoT in crop farming. Farmers \ncan\
    \ apply fertilizer more precisely based on real-time data on soil nutrient levels\
    \ via \nGPS-connected fertilizer spreaders. The technology is used to apply fertilizer\
    \ variably \non most needy soil areas.\nSimilarly, the normalized difference vegetation\
    \ index images recorded through \ndrones or satellites can be used to apply variable\
    \ nitrogen application at different crop \ngrowth stages. Variable seed rates\
    \ of different crops can be estimated by scanning the \nelectric conductivity\
    \ of the field. The seed spreader is then connected to the GPS-kit \nwith the\
    \ field electric conductivity map, guiding the spreader to apply seed variably.\
    \ \nLarge-scale agricultural firms turn to robotics when they cannot find enough\
    \ skilled \nworkers. Self-propelled robotics machinery that can be programmed\
    \ to apply seed \nand fertilizer evenly along each row of crops lowers operational\
    \ costs and increases \ncrop yield. Farmers can detect symptoms of disease or\
    \ stress before they are notice-\nable to the naked eye, for instance, by employing\
    \ computer vision algorithms to \nexamine photographs of plants. This enables\
    \ them to take corrective action before the \nproblem worsens, resulting in healthier\
    \ plants and better-quality produce. Farmers \nemploying AI and IoT technologies\
    \ can predict and detect disease/pest infestations \nbefore they occur by combining\
    \ drone infrared camera data with sensors on fields \nthat can monitor plants’\
    \ relative health.\nMoreover, the AI and IoT systems can identify disease/pest-affected\
    \ areas by \ncombining intelligent sensor data with visual data streams from drones.\
    \ Farmers \ncan gain more knowledge about the health of their crops and decide\
    \ how to allocate \nresources and control pests/diseases by analyzing data from\
    \ sensors and other \nInternet of Things – New Insights\n10\nconnected devices.\
    \ Crop quality can also be improved as well with the use of AI and \nIoT [121–131].\n\
    All agricultural supply chains have adopted track and traceability, and this trend\
    \ is \nexpected to continue. A well-managed track-and-trace system increases visibility\
    \ and \ncontrol throughout supply chains, which reduces inventory shrinkage. Modern\
    \ AI and \nIoT-based track-and-trace systems can distinguish between batch, lot,\
    \ and container-\nlevel material assignments in inbound shipments. Most cutting-edge\
    \ track-and-trace \nsystems rely on sophisticated sensors to record data for each\
    \ shipment. Agricultural \nsupply chains and shipments are increasingly using\
    \ AI and IoT sensors. AI and IoT \nsystems show different marketing scenarios\
    \ to farmers to get the maximum return \non their produce. When deciding on pricing\
    \ strategies for a particular crop, price \nforecasting for crops based on yield\
    \ rates that help forecast total volumes produced \nis crucial. Understanding\
    \ yield rates and quality standards enables agricultural \nbusinesses to negotiate\
    \ effectively for the best harvest price. The pricing strategy is \ndetermined\
    \ by analyzing the total demand for a crop to determine whether the price \nelasticity\
    \ curve is inelastic, unitary, or highly elastic [7, 118, 132–135].\nOne of the\
    \ fastest-growing applications of AI and IoT in agriculture is monitoring \nlivestock\
    \ health, including daily activity and food intake. Various aspects of livestock\
    \ \nmanagement and monitoring, such as behavior, detection, counting, identification,\
    \ \ngrazing tracking, health issues, estimating the herd distribution, etc., can\
    \ be achieved \nusing AI and IoT technologies. The best way to care for livestock\
    \ over the long \nterm is to understand how each livestock responds to diet and\
    \ boarding conditions. \nProducing more milk requires AI and IoT to comprehend\
    \ what keeps cows happy and \ncontented daily. AI and IoT technologies reduce\
    \ the chances that domestic and wild \nanimals may accidentally destroy crops\
    \ or commit a break-in or burglary at a remote \nfarm. Farmers can secure the\
    \ perimeters of their fields and buildings through image \nanalysis powered by\
    \ AI and machine learning algorithms [136–141].\n5. Benefits and application of\
    \ AI and IoT in date palm cultivation\nAdvances in technology have led to the\
    \ integration of AI and IoT into the date \npalm farming sector, aiming to improve\
    \ yield, reduce costs, and increase efficiency. \nOne recent development in AI\
    \ and IoT in date palm cultivation is using sensors to \nmonitor soil moisture.\
    \ These sensors are connected to a central system that uses AI \nalgorithms to\
    \ analyze the soil moisture data and determine the time and amount \nof irrigation\
    \ water requirement. This approach has been shown to reduce water \nconsumption\
    \ by up to 30–60% and improve date palm yields. Another application \nof AI and\
    \ IoT in date palm cultivation is using drones for crop monitoring. Drones \n\
    equipped with cameras and other sensors collect data regarding plant health, growth\
    \ \nrates, and other factors affecting palm growth and yield. This information\
    \ can then \nbe analyzed using ML algorithms to identify patterns and predict\
    \ future crop perfor-\nmance. In addition to these applications, AI and IoT are\
    \ also used to optimize fertil-\nizer usage, predict weather patterns, and automate\
    \ the harvesting time of different \ndate palm varieties. For example, autonomous\
    \ robots with AI algorithms can harvest \ndates more efficiently than human laborers,\
    \ reducing costs and increasing productiv-\nity [20, 29, 63, 65].\nIn many parts\
    \ of the world, date palm cultivation is a significant economic activ-\nity. Using\
    \ AI and IoT technology in date palm farming can have several economic \nbenefits.\
    \ Enhanced crop management efficiency is one potential benefit. AI-powered \n\
    11\nApplications of AI and IoT for Advancing Date Palm Cultivation in Saudi Arabia\n\
    DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113175\nsensors can monitor soil moisture,\
    \ aerial temperature, humidity, and other environ-\nmental variables that impact\
    \ the development and production of date palms. Date \npalm growers can optimize\
    \ irrigation schedules, fertilizer applications, and disease \nand pest management\
    \ strategies by analyzing AI and IoT data, leading to higher crop \nyields and\
    \ lower input costs. Improved quality control is another potential benefit. \n\
    AI algorithms can examine images of date palm trees to identify signs of water\
    \ stress, \ndiseases, or nutrient deficiencies. This can help farmers identify\
    \ problems early and \nresolve them before they worsen. IoT devices can also track\
    \ the shipment of date palm \noffshoots from the field to the market, ensuring\
    \ that they are treated carefully and \nadhere to quality standards. Increased\
    \ market access is a third potential advantage. \nFarmers can produce higher-quality\
    \ dates that fetch higher prices in domestic and \nforeign markets by applying\
    \ AI and IoT technology to enhance crop management and \nquality control.\nFurthermore,\
    \ IoT devices can deliver real-time information about market demand, \nallowing\
    \ farmers to modify their production strategies accordingly. AI techniques \n\
    made identifying different date palm varieties possible through leaf and fruit\
    \ image \nscanning. In general, date palm farming could benefit from AI and IoT\
    \ technology by \nincreasing productivity, enhancing quality assurance, and giving\
    \ farmers more mar-\nket access. The economic benefits of these technologies are\
    \ expected to significantly \nincrease as they develop and become more accessible\
    \ [19, 20, 30, 32, 38, 43, 142–144].\nThe following are some of the applications\
    \ of AI and IoT that have been employed \nfor advancing date palm cultivation\
    \ technology:\n5.1 Date palm irrigation management\nFresh water is an urgent priority\
    \ in semiarid- and arid regions. With the steady \nincrease in population, water\
    \ is urgently needed to irrigate palm trees and increase \nthe production of dates,\
    \ food products rich in nutrients necessary for human health. \nThe reclaimed\
    \ and desalinated water can be used for irrigation, but these technolo-\ngies’\
    \ high energy and cost hinder this irrigation utilization [19, 145]. There is\
    \ a need \nfor intelligent irrigation and standalone photovoltaic systems, and\
    \ new smart irriga-\ntion techniques to ensure sustainable energy and water for\
    \ agriculture [20, 21, 146]. \nMohammed et al. [29] implemented AI to predict\
    \ optimum water and energy require-\nments for solar-powered sensor-based microirrigation\
    \ systems. This study is a good \nexample of how AI can improve agricultural practices.\
    \ The study also found that the \noptimum water use efficiency was achieved when\
    \ the maximum setpoints of irriga-\ntion control were adjusted at the field capacity\
    \ and by adjusting the minimum set-\npoints at 40 of the available water for the\
    \ subsurface irrigation system. The optimum \nyield was achieved by adjusting\
    \ the minimum setpoints for subsurface irrigation, \nsubsurface drip irrigation,\
    \ and bubbler irrigation, respectively. Several ML algorithms \nwere used in the\
    \ study, including support vector regression (SVR), long short-term \nmemory (LSTM)\
    \ neural network, linear regression (LR), and extreme gradient \nboosting (XGBoost)\
    \ were developed and validated for predicting the optimum \nirrigation water and\
    \ solar energy requirements based on the limited meteorological \ndata (average\
    \ temperature, RH, wind speed, and solar irradiance) and date palm age \nfor each\
    \ microirrigation system used. The study evaluated the performance of the ML \n\
    models using three performance metrics of root mean square error (RMSE), coef-\n\
    ficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The dataset was\
    \ pre-\npared at various levels for 4 years to train and test the prediction models,\
    \ and the fifth \nyear was used to validate the performance of the most suitable\
    \ model. The evaluation \nInternet of Things – New Insights\n12\nof the ML models\
    \ indicated that the LSTM and XGBoost models were more accurate \nthan the SVR\
    \ and LR models in predicting the optimum irrigation water and energy \nrequirements.\
    \ The validation results showed that the LSTM model could predict \nthe water\
    \ and energy requirements for all irrigation systems with R2 values ranging \n\
    from 0.90 to 0.92 based on date palm age and limited meteorological variables.\
    \ The \nauthors stated that the benefits of implementing AI in sustainable farming\
    \ include \npredicting optimum water and energy requirements for sensor-based\
    \ microirrigation \nsystems powered by solar PV, contributing to sustainable farming\
    \ practices. They also \nhighlighted the potential significance of AI in effectively\
    \ overseeing irrigation water \nscheduling. AI could achieve this by handling\
    \ gathered data and comprehending \nthe evolving weather patterns, soil, and plant\
    \ conditions throughout the cultivation \nphases. The LSTM model they created\
    \ could serve as a potent instrument for super-\nvising water allocation in date\
    \ palm cultivation [29].\nConsequently, AI’s influence extends to water conservation\
    \ in irrigation, foster-\ning plant development, and augmenting crop yield. In\
    \ addition, the study’s results \nhave significant implications for sustainable\
    \ agriculture in arid regions. By using AI \nto predict the optimum irrigation\
    \ requirements, farmers can save water and energy \nwhile still achieving optimal\
    \ yields. This is essential for ensuring the long-term \nsustainability of agricultural\
    \ production in arid regions [29].\nA previous study highlighted the benefits\
    \ of using the Internet of Things (IoT) in \nagriculture, especially irrigation\
    \ management. Mohammed et al. [38] developed an \nautomated system for scheduling\
    \ irrigation using a cloud-based IoT platform, which \npositively impacted the\
    \ yield of date palm and water use efficiency using FTTT (If \nThis Then That)\
    \ interface and Ubidots platform. Figure 1 shows the main compo-\nnents of the\
    \ cloud-based IoT platform used to monitor the meteorological variables \nin real\

    \ The \nfigure illustrates the flow of data from the sensors to the cloud platform\
    \ and the con-\ntrol of the irrigation system through the Arduino UNO board and\
    \ IFTTT interface. \nThe meteorological variables were collected by the sensors\
    \ and transmitted to the \nArduino microcontroller in real time through the Wi-Fi\
    \ module. The microcontroller \nFigure 1. \nA simple diagram for the components\

    \ platform, where the user could access the real-time \ndata through the graphical\
    \ user interface using the private channel. The electronic \nrelays of contactors,\
    \ electronic valves, and irrigation pumps were controlled using the \nIFTTT interface\
    \ to schedule the irrigation water of the irrigation system.\nImplementing IoT\
    \ procedures and creating sophisticated sensors for smart \nagriculture exert\
    \ a significant influence on both crop yield enhancement and the \npreservation\
    \ of irrigation water. Furthermore, integrating cloud computing and IoT \nadvancements\
    \ has bolstered the interaction and remote oversight between users and \ntheir\
    \ agricultural operations. This enhancement permits multilayered cloud IoT and\
    \ \ncomputing frameworks to orchestrate, supervise, and administer crop cultivation\
    \ \nwithin a comprehensive automated structure. This has the potential to tackle\
    \ the chal-\nlenges posed by limited water availability and insufficient labor\
    \ in the agricultural \nsector. The operation was overseen through a cloud-based\
    \ IoT platform, allowing \nusers to remotely observe the farm and retrieve pertinent\
    \ meteorological information. \nThis data empowered users to make informed decisions,\
    \ considering the irrigation \nmicrocontroller’s existing parameters. The IFTTT\
    \ interface seamlessly integrated \nwith the irrigation hardware, introducing\
    \ functionalities that managed irrigation \nvalves and pumps or dispatched SMS\
    \ notifications to users based on their predefined \nactions. The IoT system optimized\
    \ water use in date palm cultivation and improved \nyield and water use efficiency.\
    \ In addition, the Ubidots platform was used in this \nstudy to monitor the meteorological\
    \ variables data. The platform allows users to \nconnect, visualize, and analyze\
    \ data from various sources, including sensors, devices, \nand applications. The\
    \ Ubidots platform provides a graphical user interface (GUI) that \nallows users\
    \ to create custom dashboards, charts, and widgets to visualize data in real \n\
    time. The platform also provides tools for data analysis, including statistical\
    \ analysis, \nmachine learning, and predictive analytics. This study used the\
    \ Ubidots platform to \ncollect and store real-time meteorology measurements on\
    \ the farm to analyze and \nvisualize the irrigation parameters [38].\nMohammed\
    \ et al. [20] employed cloud-based IoT solutions to control a modern sub-\nsurface\
    \ irrigation system in date palm farms in the arid region of Saudi Arabia, which\
    \ \nimproved irrigation management. They designed and constructed a fully automated\
    \ \ncontrolled subsurface irrigation system (CSIS) and validated its performance\
    \ to moni-\ntor the irrigation process remotely. An efficient control system for\
    \ subsurface irrigation \nutilizing marvelous cloud computing and IoT capabilities\
    \ was used to manage date \npalm water. The user can be automatically notified\
    \ by either a short or email message. \nThe optimum water per tree can be applied\
    \ by controlling the subsurface irrigation \nsystem in a date palm field. The\
    \ methodology used in this study involves designing and \nimplementing a cloud-based\
    \ CSIS for date palm trees. CSIS is an IoT-based system that \nemploys cloud computing\
    \ and various sensors to monitor and control the subsurface \nirrigation system\
    \ for date palm trees. A sensor-based subsurface irrigation scheduling \n(S-BIS)\
    \ was considered. Based on the data received from the sensors, the amount of \n\
    water can be scheduled. The measured data from sensors is uploaded to the ThingSpeak\
    \ \ncloud platform for analyzing and sending the decision to the subsurface irrigation\
    \ \nsystem. Figure 2 shows the designed system that used the direct measurement\
    \ of \nvolumetric water content to make irrigation decisions, meanwhile monitoring\
    \ different \nfactors such as ambient air temperature, relative humidity, solar\
    \ intensity, wind speed, \nand water flow rate per minute. The results indicated\
    \ that the automatically irrigating \ndate palm trees controlled by S-BIS were\
    \ more efficient than the time-based irrigation \nscheduling (T-BIS). The amount\
    \ of irrigation water was reduced by 64.1% and 61.2% \nbased on S-BIS and T-BIS,\
    \ respectively, compared to traditional surface irrigation \nInternet of Things\

    \ Furthermore, IoT technology is progressively gaining traction \nwithin agriculture,\

    \ of Things – New Insights\n16\nPhotovoltaic (PV) solar energy is an important\
    \ power source for operating off-grid \nrefrigeration. Due to a reduction in PV\
    \ system cost, solar-powered refrigerators \nhave become more economical [30,\
    \ 71, 149, 150]. Refrigerators are considered one \nof the types of equipment\
    \ that consumes a significant amount of electricity. Hence, \nreducing energy\
    \ consumption and efficient systems are most important to reduce \ngreenhouse\
    \ gas emissions and the costs of PV systems [30, 151]. Eltawil et al. [152] \n\
    developed and evaluated a machine learning-based intelligent control system (ICS)\
    \ \nusing artificial neural networks (ANN) for the performance optimization of\
    \ solar-\npowered display refrigerators (SPDRs). The SPDR functioned initially\
    \ at a consistent \nfrequency of 60 Hz, and subsequently, it was operated at various\
    \ frequencies ranging \nfrom 40 to 60 Hz. An integrated ANN-based ICS facilitated\
    \ this frequency adjustment \nwith a variable speed drive. An independent PV system\
    \ provides the energy necessary \nfor its operation. The performance of the newly\
    \ developed SPDR was assessed and \ncontrasted against its performance under a\
    \ conventional control system (TCS). These \nevaluations were conducted at refrigeration\
    \ temperatures of 1, 3, and 5°C, which align \nwith ambient temperatures. The\
    \ researchers employed an ANN-based regression \nmodel to enhance the SPDRs. The\
    \ ANNHUB software’s ANN technique created an \noptimal predictive model. This\
    \ model was used to forecast the requisite power and \nideal frequency for the\
    \ SPDR, leveraging training data.\nThe Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm was employed\
    \ in the training phase, allocat-\ning 75% of the data for training and 25% for\
    \ testing. This algorithm optimized the \nweights in a composite estimation of\
    \ outputs, thereby refining the prediction model. \nFigure 4 shows the ANN architecture\
    \ used in this study had a three-layered network \nconsisting of one input layer,\
    \ a hidden layer, and an output layer. The input layer has \nsix nodes of six\
    \ independent variables: target temperature (T1), ambient temperature \n(T2),\
    \ cabinet temperature (T3), solar radiation intensity, and temperature differences\
    \ \nof T2-T1 and T2-T1. The optimum hidden layer was one and contained eight nodes.\
    \ \nThe output layer had a single dependent variable, frequency, which was also\
    \ standard-\nized. The outputs were the optimum frequency to control the compressor\

    \ Furthermore, the research demonstrated that this approach can \nbe extended\

    \ storage revolves around monitoring factors influencing \nthe quality of stored\
    \ products, with the goal of safeguarding them against potential \ncontamination\
    \ arising from external conditions. Among these crucial factors, cold \nstorage\
    \ rooms and warehouses focus on tracking parameters such as relative humidity\
    \ \n(RH), temperature, alcohol gases, and light [71, 153].\nMohammed et al. [30]\
    \ designed a smart IoT-based control system to manage cold \nstorage facilities\
    \ remotely. This study is a good example of how IoT can improve food \nsafety\
    \ and quality control. The study found that the IoT-based control system could\
    \ \nprecisely control the modified cold storage room, provide reliable data about\
    \ the \ninterior microclimate atmosphere, and send the necessary alerts in an\
    \ emergency. \nThis indicates that the IoT-based control system can improve the\
    \ safety and quality \nof food products stored in cold storage rooms. The study\
    \ also found that the IoT-\nbased control system had no significant effect on\
    \ the quality of date fruits stored in \nthe modified cold storage room compared\
    \ with the traditional cold storage room. \nThis indicates that the IoT-based\
    \ control system can maintain the quality of food \nproducts stored in cold storage\
    \ rooms without affecting their taste or nutritional \nvalue. The study’s results\
    \ have significant implications for the food industry. By \nusing IoT to monitor\
    \ and control cold storage rooms, the food industry can reduce \nthe risk of food\
    \ spoilage and improve the quality of their products [30, 71]. Figure 5 \nshows\
    \ the main components of the designed IoT-BC. The figure illustrates the vari-\n\
    ous elements of the system, including the IoT microcontroller, sensors, and cloud\
    \ \nplatform. The IoT microcontroller collects data from the sensors, which monitor\
    \ \nvarious parameters such as temperature, humidity, and light. The collected\
    \ data is \nthen transmitted to the cloud platform, where it is analyzed in real\
    \ time. The cloud \nplatform is also responsible for sending notifications to\
    \ the user in case of any issues \nthat may arise [30].\n5.4 Postharvest management\n\
    Climate change positively impacts date palm fruit growth and development by \n\
    delaying fruit ripening, reducing color development and quality, inadequate pol-\n\
    lination, fruit sunburn, poor fruit quality and fruit set, and lowering fruit\
    \ yield \n[154, 155]. Date palm fruits can be ripened artificially using controlled\
    \ temperature \nand relative humidity, such as the fruit drying process. Mohammed\
    \ and Alqahtani \n[144] designed an automated sensor-based artificial ripening\
    \ system (S-BARS) inte-\ngrated with ultrasound pretreatment for unripe Khalas\
    \ Biser fruits of date palm. They \ndeveloped a straightforward technique for\
    \ data acquisition and system control. Data \non temperature and relative humidity\
    \ were monitored using six DHT22 sensors. An \nArduino Mega board collects the\
    \ data sent by these sensors. Figure 4 shows real-time \ndata acquisition for\
    \ temperature and relative humidity inside the treatment chamber \nof the designed\
    \ S-BARS integrated with Arduino and Excel.\nInternet of Things – New Insights\n\
    18\nThe control system in the study is an automated sensor-based artificial ripening\
    \ \nsystem (S-BARS) that combines ultrasound pretreatment with automated sensors\
    \ to \nenhance the ripening process of date fruits. The S-BARS are controlled\
    \ by an open-\nsource microcontroller board (Arduino Mega) and three relays (RL1,\
    \ RL2, and RL3) \nthat control the heating unit, ultrasonic humidifier, and main\
    \ power of the S-BARS. \nThe system also includes six DHT22 sensors that collect\
    \ data on temperature and \nrelative humidity (RH) and send the data to the Arduino\
    \ Mega board’s open-source \nmicroprocessor (ATmega328P). The acquired data is\
    \ displayed in real time on a liquid \ncrystal display (LCD) and stored in Microsoft\
    \ Excel using the PLX-DAQ Excel Macro. \nThe control system allows for precise\
    \ monitoring and control of the ripening process, \nwhich can improve the quality\
    \ and yield of date fruits [144].\nMohammed et al. developed ANNs-based models\
    \ for predicting date fruit qual-\nity attributes based on their electrical properties\
    \ during cold storage. This study is \na good example of how machine learning\
    \ can be used to improve food safety and \nquality control. The study found that\
    \ ANNs were more accurate than multilinear \nregression (MLR) models in predicting\
    \ the physicochemical properties of date fruits \nduring cold storage. Therefore,\
    \ ANNs can be used to develop nondestructive meth-\nods for predicting the quality\
    \ of date fruits. Ensuring a consistent provision of pre-\nmium fruits to meet\
    \ market requirements is paramount. The research also identified \nthat the most\
    \ effective prediction model utilizing ANNs comprised an input layer \nwith 14\
    \ neurons, a single hidden layer with 15 neurons, and an output layer with four\
    \ \nneurons. The study’s findings have significant implications for the food industry.\
    \ By \nusing ANNs to predict the quality of date fruits, the food industry can\
    \ reduce the \namount of food waste, improve the quality of their products, and\
    \ meet the demands \nFigure 5. \nA schematic diagram of IoT-based control system\

    of consumers. The study is a valuable contribution to food safety and quality\
    \ control. \nThe study’s results have significant implications for the food industry,\
    \ and food \nmanufacturers and policymakers should consider them [78]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a block \ndiagram of the applied ANNs prediction model. The ANNs predict\
    \ date quality \nparameters of the pH, total soluble solids (TSS), water activity\
    \ (aw), and moisture \ncontent (MC) of date fruits during cold storage, which\
    \ is based on 14 electrical \nparameters of the capacitance value at the series\
    \ equivalent circuit model (Cs, nF), \nthe dissipation factor (D), the equivalent\
    \ series resistance (Rs, kΩ), the equivalent \nparallel resistance (Rp, kΩ), the\
    \ capacitance value at the parallel equivalent circuit \nmodel (Cp, nF), the inductance\
    \ value in the series equivalent circuit model(Ls, H), \nthe inductance value\
    \ in the parallel equivalent circuit model (Lp, H), the resistance \n(R, kΩ),\
    \ the direct current resistance (DCR, kΩ), the reactance (X, kΩ), the absolute\
    \ \nvalue of the impedance (Z, kΩ), the phase angle (θ°, degree), the phase radian\
    \ (θ, \nrad), and the quality factor (Q).\nSrinivasagan et al. [156] used a TinyML-based\
    \ multispectral sensor for the shelf \nlife estimation of fresh date fruits packed\
    \ under modified atmospheres. This sensor \nuses ML algorithms to estimate the\
    \ shelf life of fresh dates based on various fruit \nproperties such as moisture\
    \ content, total soluble solids, tannin content, and sugar \ncontent. Figure 7\
    \ shows a block diagram of the applied ANNs prediction model. The \nANNs predict\
    \ shelf life and fruit quality based on 18 spectroscopy reflectance, pack-\naging\
    \ types, and storage temperatures. The ANN used in the study has three layers:\
    \ \nan input layer with 20 nodes, two hidden layers, and an output layer with\
    \ one node. \nThe input layer collects the AS7265x Triad optical sensor data via\
    \ the I2C port of the \nArduino Nano33 BLE Sense microcontroller. The hidden layers\
    \ perform data trans-\nformation and feature extraction. The output layer is a\
    \ single neuron that produces a \ncontinuous output value. The ANN layers are\
    \ designed to predict the shelf life of fresh \ndate fruits based on various fruit\
    \ properties such as color, texture, and temperature. \nThe authors conducted\
    \ experiments to validate the sensor’s accuracy and found that it \ncould accurately\
    \ estimate the shelf life of fresh dates. This technology can potentially \nimprove\
    \ the efficiency of the date fruit industry by reducing waste and increasing \n\

    \ atmosphere packaging (MAP) can extend \nthe shelf life of date fruits. The researchers\
    \ observed variations in fresh fruit shelf life \nestimations across the three\
    \ main stages of fruit maturity from the Khalal to the Tamr \nstage. The study\
    \ suggests that using TinyML for shelf life estimation can improve the \nefficiency\
    \ of the date fruit industry by reducing waste and increasing profits. Overall,\
    \ \nthe study provides a promising approach for estimating the shelf life of fresh\
    \ date \nfruits using TinyML and low-cost sensors [156, 157].\n5.5 Pest management\n\
    One of the most critical problems of date palm mite control is an objective \n\
    decision-making method for monitoring and predicting date palm mite infestation\
    \ \non date fruits. Mohammed et al. developed, evaluated, and validated prediction\
    \ \nmodels for date palm mite infestation on fruits based on meteorological parameters,\
    \ \ni.e., relative humidity, temperature, solar radiation, and wind speed and\
    \ the physi-\ncochemical parameters of date fruits, i.e., firmness, weight, moisture\
    \ content, total \nsugar, total soluble solids, and tannin content, using two\
    \ ML models, i.e., linear \nregression and decision forest regression. The study\
    \ is a good example of how ML \ncan improve agricultural practices. The study\
    \ found that the decision forest regres-\nsion model was more accurate than the\
    \ linear regression model in predicting the \ndate palm mite based on the input\
    \ parameters. This indicates that the decision forest \nregression model can be\
    \ used to consider several factors that can affect the infesta-\ntion of date\
    \ fruits by the date palm mite. The study’s results have important implica-\n\
    tions for date palm cultivation. The study also found that the developed model\
    \ could \npredict the date palm mite count on date palm fruits based on the combination\
    \ of \nmeteorological and physicochemical properties variables. Farmers can take\
    \ pre-\nventive measures to protect their crops by using ML to predict the date\
    \ palm mite \ninfestation. This can help to reduce the impact of the date palm\
    \ mite on the date \npalm industry and ensure the availability of high-quality\
    \ dates [66]. Figure 8  \nillustrates an experiment to predict date pam infestation\
    \ on date palm fruits based \nFigure 7. \nA simple block diagram of the applied\
    \ ANNs model for estimating shelf life and quality of date fruit using \nmultispectral\

    on the study area’s meteorological parameters data, the date fruits’ physicochemical\
    \ \nparameters data during the development stages, and the combined data of meteoro-\n\
    logical variables and physicochemical properties.\n6. Challenges of implementing\
    \ AI and IoT in date palm cultivation\nThe transformation brought about by integrating\
    \ AI and IoT is undeniable, \nsignificantly revolutionizing the cultivation of\
    \ date palms. Farmers can optimize \noperations, reduce costs, and improve yields\
    \ using AI and IoT technologies. However, \nthere are several challenges to implementing\
    \ AI and IoT systems in date palm cultiva-\ntion. The main challenges to using\
    \ AI and IoT technologies in date palm cultivation \nare the lack of infrastructure\
    \ and connectivity in rural areas, where most farms are \nlocated. There is a\
    \ lack of the necessary infrastructure to support these technologies in \nmany\
    \ regions, where date palms are grown. For instance, there might not be a stable\
    \ \npower source or internet connection to power the devices needed for AI and\
    \ IoT \nimplementation. This makes it challenging for farmers to gain access to\
    \ and efficiently \nutilize these techniques. IoT devices require a stable internet\
    \ connection to function \neffectively, and in areas with poor connectivity, the\
    \ data collected may be inaccurate \nor incomplete. This can lead to incorrect\
    \ decision-making and ultimately impact date \npalm yields and profitability.\
    \ The high cost of implementing AI and IoT technologies \nis another challenge.\n\
    Implementing IoT and AI systems demands a substantial hardware, software, and\
    \ \ntraining investment. Many small-scale farmers may lack the funding necessary\
    \ to \nFigure 8. \nA screenshot for the architecture of the developed models using\
    \ Microsoft Azure Machine Learning.\nInternet of Things – New Insights\n22\npurchase\
    \ these technologies. The initial investment required to purchase and install\
    \ \nsensors, drones, and other IoT devices can be unaffordable for small-scale\
    \ farmers. \nAdditionally, the cost of maintaining and upgrading these technologies\
    \ can increase \nover time. Furthermore, the expense of maintenance and repairs\
    \ can deter farmers \nfrom adopting these technologies. Data security and privacy\
    \ are other significant \nproblems applying AI and IoT in date palm farming. Large\
    \ amounts of data are \ncollected for these technologies from numerous sources,\
    \ including sensors, drones, \nand cameras. Sensitive information about the farm’s\
    \ operations is contained in this \ndata, making it vulnerable to misuse or cyberattacks.\
    \ This is particularly important \nas farming data can be sensitive and valuable,\
    \ providing insights into crop yields, soil \nhealth, weather patterns, and more.\n\
    Special skills are needed to install and manage AI and IoT systems on farms. Many\
    \ \nfarmers may not have the technical expertise to install and maintain these\
    \ systems \nthemselves, requiring them to hire outside experts or invest in training\
    \ their staff. It is \nalso a concern that AI and IoT technologies may replace\
    \ human labor on farms, lead-\ning to job losses. While these technologies can\
    \ increase efficiency and productivity, \nthey may also lead to a decrease in\
    \ demand for manual labor. Moreover, integrating \nAI and IoT technologies with\
    \ conventional farming practices is another challenge. \nMany farmers may have\
    \ little or no prior experience utilizing these technologies, \nwhich can cause\
    \ resistance or reluctance to adopt them. Some farmers may prefer to \nrely on\
    \ traditional methods they have used for generations. Finally, several challenges\
    \ \nmust be overcome before AI and IoT technologies in date palm farming may be\
    \ widely \nadopted. Limitations in the infrastructure, high implementation costs,\
    \ security and \ndata privacy concerns, and reluctance to change are some of these\
    \ challenges.\n7. Future opportunities for AI and IoT in date palm cultivation\n\
    Advances in AI and IoT technologies offer new opportunities to improve the \n\
    efficiency and sustainability of date palm farming. One potential application\
    \ of AI \nin date palm cultivation is predictive analytics. By analyzing weather\
    \ patterns, soil \nconditions, and other environmental factors, AI algorithms\
    \ can help farmers predict \nwhen to propagate offshoots, irrigate, and harvest\
    \ their crops for optimal yields. This \ncan help reduce farm waste, increase\
    \ crop productivity, and improve profitability. \nAnother potential application\
    \ of AI is precision agriculture. By using sensors and \nother IoT devices to\
    \ collect data on soil moisture, temperature, and other environ-\nmental factors,\
    \ farmers can use AI algorithms to optimize water amounts, irrigation \nschedules,\
    \ and optimum doses of fertilizer applications. This can help reduce water \n\
    usage and minimize environmental impact while maximizing palm yields. AI and IoT\
    \ \ncan also be used to monitor the health of date palm trees. AI algorithms can\
    \ detect \nearly signs of disease or pest infestations by analyzing images of\
    \ leaves and trunks. \nAI noses or electronic noses can diagnose insect pests\
    \ and diseases, which is a fast \nand noninvasive approach. This can help farmers\
    \ take corrective action before the \nproblem spreads, reducing yield losses and\
    \ minimizing the need for pesticides and \nfungicides. In addition to AI, IoT\
    \ technologies such as drones and robots offer new \nopportunities for precision\
    \ agriculture in date palm cultivation. Drones equipped \nwith cameras and sensors\
    \ can provide high-resolution images of date palms, allowing \nfarmers to monitor\
    \ their health and growth more closely.\nMeanwhile, robots can be used for tasks\
    \ such as pruning and harvesting, reducing \nlabor costs and increasing efficiency.\
    \ AI and IoT technologies can be used for fruit \n23\nApplications of AI and IoT\
    \ for Advancing Date Palm Cultivation in Saudi Arabia\nDOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.5772/intechopen.113175\n\
    sorting purposes based on fruit size, weight, color, maturity indices, etc., saving\
    \ \ntime, labor, and resources. Uneven in situ fruit ripening is a common problem\
    \ in \ndate palms. AI and IoT technologies can also sort out ripe and unripe fruits.\
    \ Then the \nunripe fruits can be ripened artificially using the same technologies\
    \ to avoid wastage \nand to enhance farm income.\n8. Conclusion\nThe application\
    \ of AI and IoT in date palm cultivation in Saudi Arabia shows \nenormous potential\
    \ for enhancing productivity, sustainability, and quality manage-\nment. There\
    \ is a growing interest in applying AI and IoT in cultivating and managing \n\
    date palm trees in Saudi Arabia. Several studies have explored AI and IoT technologies\
    \ \nin various aspects of date palm cultivation, including pest management, postharvest\
    \ \nquality management, yield improvement, and mapping of date palm trees. Using\
    \ AI \nand IoT technologies in date palm cultivation offers benefits such as improved\
    \ crop \nyield, efficient pest management, and enhanced postharvest quality control.\
    \ These \ntechnologies enable real-time monitoring and data analysis, which can\
    \ help farmers \nmake informed decisions and optimize resource allocation. Integrating\
    \ AI and IoT \ncan contribute to the sustainability of date palm cultivation by\
    \ reducing water con-\nsumption and mitigating the impact of climate change. However,\
    \ it is essential to note \nthat while AI and IoT technologies hold promise, challenges\
    \ still need to be addressed. \nThese include the need for robust data collection\
    \ and analysis, ensuring data security \nand privacy, and addressing the digital\
    \ divide in rural areas. Further research and \ndevelopment are required to fully\
    \ harness the potential of AI and IoT in date palm \ncultivation. Continued research\
    \ and innovation in this field can contribute to advanc-\ning date palm cultivation\
    \ practices and support the agricultural sector.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors\

    \ at the regional scale has always been a persistent challenge\nin the agricultural\
    \ sector. With the vigorous emergence of remote sensing land surface\nobservations\
    \ in recent decades, data assimilation methodology has become an effective\nmeans\
    \ to promote the accuracy and efﬁciency of yield estimation by integrating regional\n\
    data and point-scale crop models. This paper focuses on the black soil area of\n\
    Northeast China, a national strategic grain production base, applying the AquaCrop\n\
    crop growth model to simulate the fractional vegetation cover (FVC) and maize\
    \ yield\nfrom 2000 to 2020 and then forming a reliable FVC optimization dataset\
    \ based on\nan ensemble Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF) assimilation algorithm with remote\
    \ sensing products.\nUsing the random forest model, the regression relationship\
    \ between FVC and yield\nwas established from the long-term time series data,\
    \ which is crucial to achieve better\nyield estimation through the optimized FVC.\
    \ The major ﬁndings include the following: (1)\nThe R2 of the assimilated FVC\
    \ and maize yield can reach 0.557. (2) When compared\nwith the local statistical\
    \ yield, our method reduced the mean absolute error (MAE) from\n1.164 ton/ha (based\
    \ on GLASS FVC products) to 1.004 ton/ha (based on the calibrated\nAquaCrop model)\
    \ and then to 0.888 ton/ha (the result after assimilation). The above\nresults\
    \ show that we have proposed a yield estimation method to provide accurate yield\n\
    estimations by combining data assimilation and machine learning. This study provided\n\
    deep insights into understanding the variations in FVC and revealed the spatially\
    \ explicit\nyield prediction ability from the time series land surface parameters,\
    \ which has signiﬁcant\npotential for optimizing water and soil resource management.\n\

    Maize Yield Estimation\nThe northeastern Chinese black soil area is a major black\
    \ soil\nzone of the world and a strategic guarantee base for national\nfood security\
    \ by producing crops such as maize and soybean (Lin\net al., 2019). The special\
    \ soil properties and natural geographical\nconditions make its rain-fed agricultural\
    \ production mode\ndiﬀerent from other main grain-producing areas. Atmospheric\n\
    precipitation has become one of the main inﬂuencing factors of\ncrop yield (Cui\
    \ et al., 2021). According to these characteristics of\nthis area, there is an\
    \ urgent need to carry out detailed research\non crop yield estimation, especially\
    \ on maize with large planting\nscale and appreciable economic beneﬁts (Qian et\
    \ al., 2018).\nCrop growth models are an important tool to quantitatively\ndescribe\
    \ the growth and yield formation process of speciﬁc\ncrops under speciﬁc environments\
    \ based on point scales (Van\net al., 1989; Monteith, 1996; Steduto et al., 2009),\
    \ and it\nis diﬃcult to characterize the spatial low of crop growth\ndue to the\
    \ limitation of scale. The current research trend\nis to run models on a regional\
    \ scale and then establish the\nresponse system of crop growth to soil and meteorological\n\
    environment changes to provide macro decision-making for\nprecision agriculture.\
    \ Diﬀerent from photosynthetic eﬀective\nradiation driving mechanism of WOFOST\
    \ model and the other\ncrop model (Todorovic et al., 2009), AquaCrop model is\
    \ driven\nby water factors and simulates crop yield based on water use\neﬃciency\
    \ (Raes et al., 2009) and is widely used in arid and\nrain-fed areas with great\
    \ research prospects in water-eﬃcient\nutilization (Eshete et al., 2020). This\
    \ model evolved from the crop\nwater response equation in the irrigation and drainage\
    \ Document\nNo. 33 of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United\nNations\
    \ (FAO) (Passioura, 1996). Several studies have applied\nAquaCrop model to simulate\
    \ and evaluate typical crops growth\nin diﬀerent regions and got great results.\
    \ Iqbal et al. (2014)\ndemonstrated that the yield of winter wheat in North China\n\
    Plain simulated by AquaCrop model performed unsatisﬁed under\nstrong water stress,\
    \ and the accuracy is signiﬁcantly improved\nafter parameter calibration. Sandhu\
    \ and Irmak (2019) found the\nAquaCrop simulated yield and evapotranspiration\
    \ quite well in\nMidwestern America, but encountered substantial diﬃculties in\n\
    simulating biomass and soil-water. The AquaCrop model driven\nby water has advantages\
    \ for crop research in Northeast China, but\nrelevant research has lacked.\nSimulation\
    \ and observation are two basic strategies of\ngeoscience research (Li, 2016).\
    \ Since almost all surface variables\nhave high spatiotemporal heterogeneity,\
    \ there is bound to be\ndeviation and uncertainty in any parameterization process.\
    \ From\nthe perspective of simulation, although the crop model has\nsorted out\
    \ the material cycle and other growth processes very\nclearly on the micro level,\
    \ complex error transmission will\naccumulate, and the uncertainty reﬂected will\
    \ be ampliﬁed\nin the simulation results when it is extended to the macro\nscale.\
    \ From the perspective of observations, ﬁeld measurements\nhave high accuracy\
    \ but low spatial representation. Obtaining\nabundant observations will be very\
    \ laborious when studying\na large-scale area with high heterogeneity. Although\
    \ remote\nsensing observations already provide suﬃcient surface data, a\nsophisticated\
    \ inversion algorithm is needed to gain eﬀective\ninformation indirectly. The\
    \ inversion and sensor accuracy greatly\nlimit the reliability of remote sensing\
    \ data. Therefore, integrating\nmultisource observations and decreasing the uncertainty\
    \ of\nthe simulation is key to ameliorating the limitations of\nmodel application.\n\
    Data\nassimilation\n(DA)\nis\nan\nimportant\nintegrating\nmethodology that automatically\
    \ adjusts the process model\nforward direction continuously by relying on observations\n\
    and then generates the minimum-deviation state variable set\nwith spatiotemporal\
    \ consistency, which is usually used for\nmodeling and dynamic prediction of complex\
    \ systems (Li and\nBai, 2010; Qin et al., 2018). With the rapid development of\n\
    remote sensing technology, a large amount of earth observation\ndata has emerged\
    \ as crucial support for regional precision\nagriculture research. By reanalyzing\
    \ the prior crop growth model\nwith multi-temporal observation data, the reliability\
    \ of the\nsimulation results is improved, which is of great signiﬁcance to\nagricultural\
    \ dynamic monitoring, yield prediction, and regional\nresource management.\nLooking\
    \ at the relevant studies integrating crop model and\nremote sensing data in recent\
    \ years (Table 1), the most common\ncrop models are WOFOST, CERES and AquaCrop.\
    \ The main\ncrop types are winter wheat and other food crops. Optical remote\n\
    sensing data is generally used for remote sensing observation\ndata, and a few\
    \ literatures show that InSAR has a good eﬀect\non retrieving soil water content\
    \ (Wigneron et al., 2017). The\nassimilation variable generally selects LAI (leaf\
    \ area index)\nfor various crop models, while there are diﬀerent options for\n\
    AquaCrop model. In terms of assimilation algorithm, both\ncost function algorithm\
    \ and ﬁltering algorithm have more\napplications and innovations. The research\
    \ objectives mostly\nfocus on improving the accuracy of yield estimation. Most\
    \ of\nthe available studies using short-term data, mostly less than three\ngrowing\
    \ seasons and may neglect the inter-annual variability in\nenvironmental conditions.\n\
    Although many studies have indicated the eﬀectiveness of\nusing crop models and\
    \ remote sensing data assimilation for yield\nmapping, the expansion accuracy\
    \ from the ﬁeld to regional scale\nstill lacks exploration (Steele-Dunne et al.,\
    \ 2017). Silvestro et al.\n(2017) used the updating assimilation method, the ensemble\n\
    Kalman ﬁlter (EnKF), assimilated leaf area index (LAI) into the\nSAFY model, and\
    \ used the calibration assimilation method, PSO,\nand assimilated canopy cover\
    \ (CC) into the AquaCrop model\nto demonstrate the possibility of estimating wheat\
    \ yield. The\nresults show that the relative root-mean-square error (RRMSE)\n\
    between the predicted and the measured yield ranges from 0.18\nto 0.24 t/ha. SAFY\
    \ with the EnKF method was more suitable\nthan Aquacrop with PSO, which is mainly\
    \ due to the high\ncomputational cost and the diﬃcult calibration of the AquaCrop\n\
    model. For the AquaCrop model, CC achieved a lower RMSE\nthan LAI. Another ﬁnding\
    \ of this article is that the accuracy\nof the assimilation method is greatly\
    \ limited by the number of\nremote sensing images, three or four images with an\
    \ error in\nLAI estimation of 30% and an error in the yield estimation of\napproximately\
    \ 18%. Feng et al. (2019) used the multivariable\nlinear regression model (MLR)\
    \ and the RF model as external\nmodiﬁcations of the APSIM crop model to predict\
    \ wheat yield,\nwhile RF has a higher accuracy gain than MLR. The R2 and\nFrontiers\

    \ used forcing, calibration, and EnKF, three assimilation\nmethods for improving\
    \ sugarcane crop simulation. The results\nshow that EnKF performed the best in\
    \ estimating soil water\ncontent, LAI development, and sugarcane yield. Assimilating\n\
    LAI alone works better than assimilating LAI and SWC both\nunder slight water\
    \ stress levels, which demonstrates that the\nchoice of assimilated variable relies\
    \ on a reasonable diagnosis\nof the environment. In summary, the direct assimilation\
    \ of\nremote sensing data to update vegetation assessments is very\npromising.\
    \ Very limited literature available in Northeast China\nfor yield estimation using\
    \ data assimilation, especially for long-\nterm study.\nThis study completed the\
    \ calibration and validation of the\nAquaCrop model in Northeast China via ﬁeld\
    \ test data and\napplied 21 years of regional-scale simulations from 2000 to\n\
    2020. Then we selected FVC for AquaCrop model assimilation\nnot only because it\
    \ is one of the outputs of AquaCrop\nbut also because it considers the important\
    \ role it plays\nin surface process simulation. Due to the accumulation of\nsuﬃcient\
    \ assimilated FVC data and crop yield data, which reﬂect\nvarious environmental\
    \ conditions, the relationship between\nyield and environmental factors was established\
    \ through the\nmachine learning method of random forest. Relying on the\nFVC assimilation\
    \ curve, a high-precision estimation of crop\nyield can be obtained. This study\
    \ aims to establish an\nassimilation system to better monitor FVC growth and provide\n\
    better maize yield estimation, which is signiﬁcant for local\nagricultural management.\n\

    \ set of cultivar\nparameters from the previous study (see Appendix B for details).\n\
    Sequential Filter Assimilation\nReferring to the application summary of remote\
    \ sensing and\ncrop model assimilation, modern data assimilation methods are\n\
    mainly divided into the following two categories: parameter\noptimization methods\
    \ based on cost functions and sequential\nﬁltering methods based on estimation\
    \ theory (Huang et al.,\n2018). The former minimizes the diﬀerence between the\n\
    remote sensing observation value and the model simulation\nvalue using iterations\
    \ to achieve the optimal estimation,\nwhile the latter constantly relies on external\
    \ observations to\nadjust the model simulation trajectory in real time to achieve\n\
    the optimal prediction. For the yield estimation proposition,\nﬁlter assimilation\
    \ is more widely used because of its real-\ntime performance. The most representative\
    \ method is the\nEnKF, which is based on linear and Gaussian assumptions.\nIn\
    \ the context that the AquaCrop model simulated a daily\nFVC curve in the growing\
    \ season and the GLASS FVC\nalso provides multitemporal FVC values, it is possible\
    \ to\nmake FVC as the assimilation variable attempt to obtain a\nhigher accuracy\
    \ estimation based on ensemble Kalman ﬁlter\n(EnKF) algorithm.\nKF is an assimilation\
    \ algorithm that uses the linear system\nstate equation to estimate the optimal\
    \ system state through the\nsystem input and output observation data. Since the\
    \ observation\ndata include the inﬂuence of noise and interference in the system,\n\
    the optimal estimation can also be regarded as a ﬁltering process.\nThe AquaCrop\
    \ simulated FVC_AC and remote sensing inversion\ncalculated FVC_RS contribute\
    \ to the following dynamic models,\nwhich are constructed to evolve FVC in time\
    \ and used to provide\nshort-range prediction of FVC:\nFVCt = Ft × FVCt−1 + wt\n\
    (8)\nwt = FVC_RSt − FVC_ACt\n(9)\nwhere FVCt−1 is the FVC value of the previous\
    \ time, FVCt\nrepresents the present FVC value, wt is the model error. FVC_RSt\n\
    represents the FVC data observated from GLASS FVC products\nat time t. FVC_ACt\
    \ represents the FVC data simulated by the\nAquaCrop model at time t, which is\
    \ from the daily dataset during\nthe crop growth period. Ft is a linear state\
    \ transition operator:\nFt = 1 +\n1\n|FVC_ACt + ε| × dFVC_ACt\ndt\n(10)\nwhere\
    \ is an uncertainty factor that is set to 0.0001 to prevent the\ndenominator from\
    \ being 0. The observation operator is set to 1\ndue to the same parameter of\
    \ simulation and observation.\nEnKF integrates the model forward with the new\
    \ observation\ndata to obtain a set of analysis ﬁeld sets, which are updated by\n\
    the KF equation; the updated set, as the background ﬁeld of the\nnext moment,\
    \ continues to make forward short-term forecasts\nand is assimilated with the\
    \ new observation data of the next\nmoment. EnKF overcomes the weakness that KF\
    \ is limited to\ndealing with linear problems and solves the problem caused\n\
    by the KF method requiring too much computing resources\nwhen calculating the\
    \ covariance of prediction error. For KF\nassimilation, the observation operator\
    \ H in EnKF is set to 1, but\nthe process model error is set to 5% of the predicted\
    \ value, the\nobservation error is set to 5%, and the number of set elements is\n\
    set to 20, 100, and 200.\nRandom Forest\nIn order to extend the improvement of\
    \ FVC accuracy to\nyield estimation accuracy, this section build a regression\n\
    model of time series FVC and maize yield in a data-driven\napproach. Machine learning\
    \ is currently the most eﬀective\nand rapidly developing data research method,\
    \ which enable\nalgorithmic models to learn knowledge from data autonomously\n\
    and then have the ability of judge and predict in new\nproblems. Random forest\
    \ (RF) is a typical classiﬁer that\nuses multiple decision trees to train and\
    \ predict from input\nsamples. It determines the category of test samples by voting\n\
    and then takes the average output of each decision tree as\nthe ﬁnal result.\n\
    Referring to the Scikit-learn python machine learning library,\nthis study uses\
    \ the daily FVC value to estimate yield optimally\nthrough the RF model. In order\
    \ to compare the impact on yield\nestimation accuracy before and after FVC assimilation,\
    \ three\nrandom forest models were established to describe the regression\nrelationship\
    \ between the FVC curve and yield. The diﬀerence is\nin the input FVC, including\
    \ the FVC simulated by AquaCrop,\nthe FVC provided by the GLASS remote sensing\
    \ product and the\nFVC obtained by data assimilation. Finally, the model with\
    \ the\nhighest accuracy is selected for maize yield prediction, so as to\nachieve\
    \ the research goal of optimal yield estimation.\nThe total dataset of RF1-3 is\
    \ composed of 21 growing\nseasons from 2000 to 2020, three types of FVC data of\

    \ the corresponding statistical yield data.\nEach RF model should have 3255 records,\
    \ each record have\na set of FVC and a statistical yield. The actual number of\n\
    records is ﬁnally determined by the amount of data with well\nassimilation eﬀect.\
    \ The scale of statistical yearbook data is\nsuitable, which is of 258 districts\
    \ and counties can be matched\nwith the three series of FVC data on 155 simulation\
    \ units.\nAnother consideration of choosing statistical yield instead of\nAquaCrop\
    \ simulated yield is to avoid the accuracy interference\ncaused by the same model\
    \ output as FVC_AC, and more\nobjectively reﬂect the real harvest. The samples\
    \ were randomly\ndivided into two parts with a ratio of 8:2 the large part\nused\
    \ for training and the other part used for accuracy\nevaluation (Table 5). The\

    \ Simulation of the\nAquaCrop Model\nRunning the AquaCrop model of multithread\
    \ scheduling for the\n155 soil representative cells in Songnen black soil region\
    \ from\n2000 to 2020, we explored the spatial pattern of predicted yield\nby mapping\
    \ the results after two empirical Bayesian Kriging\ninterpolation to Figure 6.\n\
    In\ngeneral,\nthe\nspatial\ndistribution\nand\nthe\ntemporal\ndiﬀerences of predicted\
    \ yield are reasonable reproduced, which\nis consistent with that of statistical\
    \ yield (shown in Figure 7).\nAmong them, the output of the southeast is the highest,\n\
    followed by the southwest, and the northeast is the lowest.\nThis spatial pattern\
    \ is mainly caused by temperature and soil\ntexture. During the growing season,\
    \ the northern part of the\nstudy area is approximately 5◦C lower than the southern\
    \ part\nas a whole, as shown in Appendix A. A lower temperature\nmakes it more\
    \ diﬃcult for crops to reach the eﬀective\naccumulated temperature required for\
    \ maturity, resulting in\na lower ﬁnal yield. Regarding the soil texture diﬀerence,\n\
    although the fertility of chernozem is higher than that of\nphaeozem, it requires\
    \ supplementary irrigation to eﬀectively\nimprove growth due to its relatively\
    \ poor water storage\ncapacity. For Northeast China, which relies on precipitation\
    \ to\nprovide water supply, phaeozem is more suitable for cultivated\nland than\
    \ chernozem.\nIn\nterms\nof\ntime\nseries,\nthe\ninter-annual\ndiﬀerences\nwere\n\
    mainly\ncaused\nby\nthe\ndiﬀerences\nof\nhydrothermal\nconditions in each growing\
    \ season, especially the water\nfactor. The output showed a stable trend, with\
    \ 2000, 2001,\n2004, 2007, 2010, 2017 being the good harvest years for\nthe entire\

    \ yield formation\nafter ﬂowering, are easy to cause low crop yields. Mild and\n\
    continuous\nnatural\nprecipitation\nprovides\noptimal\nwater\nconditions for crop\
    \ growth and development. The neglected\nsoil erosion and the administration policies\
    \ also aﬀect the\nestimation accuracy.\nField Scale Assimilation of Fractional\n\

    \ algorithm based on MATLAB language, which\ncan realize the optimal estimation\
    \ combining the daily FVC\nsimulated by the AquaCrop model and the multitemporal\n\
    remote sensing FVC in the corresponding growing season.\nThe results show that\
    \ EnKF assimilation can indeed integrate\nremote sensing data into simulation\

    \ of FVC_Optimal showed poor performance owing to\nthe abnormal maize canopy growth\
    \ reﬂected by FVC_AC,\nwhich diﬀered greatly from the remote sensing observations\n\
    at these points. c) A few FVC_RS fails to maintain coherence\nand showed the FVC\

    \ this study established three RF models to describe\nthe regression relationship\
    \ between the three FVCs and\nthe yield of the statistical yearbook. RF1 used\
    \ the FVC\nsimulated by the AquaCrop model, RF2 used the remote\nsensing GLASS\

    \ that the unsatisfactory\nassimilation results reﬂected the unreliability of\
    \ FVC_AC\nor FVC_RS, the three random forest models only used the\ndata corresponding\
    \ to well-assimilated fraction of FVC in\nFigure 8. The veriﬁcation results of\

    \ FVC curve, RF3 showed the best\nperformance on maize yield prediction in the\
    \ black soil area of\nNortheast China. RF3 is slightly better than RF1, which\
    \ proves\nthat the addition of remote sensing observation data still has a\ngain\
    \ on the yield simulation model, R2 increases from 0.555 to\n0.557, and MAE decreases\
    \ from 1.004 ton/ha to 0.888 ton/ha.\nRF2, the yield estimation model based on\
    \ remote sensing values\nalone has the lowest accuracy, probably because the amount\
    \ of\ndata input is far less than that of the other two models, and the\nquality\
    \ of the data is greatly inﬂuenced by the scale eﬀect. RF3\nproved the feasibility\
    \ of estimating yield with optimal FVC curve.\nDISCUSSION\nYield Estimation Beneﬁts\
    \ From\nAssimilating Fractional Vegetation Cover\nFrom the results, the addition\
    \ of assimilation only nets a\nslight improvement to the yield estimation accuracy,\
    \ which may\nlead to doubts about the method eﬀectiveness. Therefore, we\nestablish\
    \ the following assumptions to explain the beneﬁt of the\nassimilation algorithm\
    \ on yield estimation accuracy:\nFirst, assume that Fs(t) is the FVC simulated\
    \ by the AquaCrop\nmodel at time t, Fo(t) is the FVC observed by remote sensing\
    \ at\ntime t, and Ft(t) is the real FVC, which is unknown. Then, there\nare two\
    \ errors, observation error o and simulation errors s:\nεo = Fo (t) −Ft(t)\n(13)\n\
    εs = Fs (t) −Ft(t)\n(14)\nFurthermore, assuming that the error of observation\
    \ value and\nthe simulation value are unbiased and have no correlation:\nE (εo)\
    \ = E (εs) = 0\n(15)\nE (εoεs) = 0\n(16)\nAt this time, by calculating the variance\
    \ of the observation\nerror σo2 and variance of simulation error σs2 and determining\n\
    the corresponding weight coeﬃcient, we obtained an FVC\nestimation value Fa (t)\
    \ that is closer to Ft(t). The reciprocal of\nvariance is deﬁned as the data precision.\n\
    Fa (t) = aFo (t) + bFs (t)\n(17)\nAssuming that the estimated value is unbiased:\n\
    E (Fa) = E (Ft)\n(18)\na + b = 1\n(19)\nThen, minimize the variance σa2 of the\
    \ estimated value Fa (t):\nσa2 = E[Fa(t)−Ft(t)]2 = E(aFo(t)−Ft(t))\n+ (bFs(t)−Ft(t))2\n\

    \ necessary to control and reduce\nthe reliability of each input data of the assimilation\

    Uncertainties and Future Work\nThis paper mainly has uncertainty and limitations\
    \ in the\nfollowing two aspects: data assimilation by remote sensing\nand machine\
    \ learning. In the ideal case, the AquaCrop model\nassimilation system coupled\
    \ with multitemporal remote sensing\nproducts integrates the advantages of the\
    \ two. On the one hand,\nthe addition of a mechanism model makes up for the lack\
    \ of\nbiophysical signiﬁcance of the system. On the other hand, the\naddition\
    \ of remote sensing observations improves the reliability\nof the system and expands\
    \ the application scope. But in fact,\nthe analog of state variables in the crop\
    \ model is not detailed\nenough, and many variation characteristics of FVC observed\
    \ by\nremote sensing are not reﬂected in the simulation results. It\nshould also\
    \ focus on developing regional crop models to allow\nthe input and output of surface\
    \ parameters to better integrate\nand utilize regional products and serve regional\
    \ research. In\nregional studies, remote sensing data are generally expected to\n\
    be used due to their large scale and ready availability. However,\nthe unveriﬁable\
    \ authenticity of remote sensing data caused by\nmixed pixels must not be overlooked,\
    \ and the ﬁnal error may\nbe three times the input LAI error (Fang et al., 2018).\
    \ Although\nhigh spatial resolution imagery ensures the maximum number of\npure\
    \ pixels, the time resolution and width are sacriﬁced, resulting\nin high costs\
    \ in regional applications. Research should balance\nthe system investment and\
    \ its eﬃciency. Above all, deliberately\ncombining the advantages of diﬀerent\
    \ data resources to improve\nthe practical value of crop models is still a valuable\
    \ problem for\nagricultural research.\nIntroducing the data-driven method, this\
    \ study established the\nregression relationship between time series FVC and yield\
    \ based\non the machine learning method of random forest. According to\nthe crop\
    \ yield predicted by the assimilated FVC and the statistical\nyield, the R2 of\
    \ random forest reached 0.557, demonstrating that\nthe construction logic of the\
    \ system is tenable. It revealed that\ncrop yield is not only reﬂected by FVC,\
    \ which may account for\n55.7% of the representation. The maize yield estimation\
    \ accuracy\nwas limited by the correlation between FVC and maize yield\nitself,\
    \ which can hardly be surpassed by technology. For regional\nyield estimation,\
    \ this is still a rare attempt to provide a relatively\naccurate yield forecast\
    \ based only on time series FVC data.\nSeveral previous studies have also found\
    \ the signiﬁcant\nassociation between surface state variables and crop yield,\n\
    and all committed to estimating yield through these variables.\nPresent yield\
    \ estimation accuracy of 0.888 ton/ha through FVC\nassimilation has an advantage\
    \ over previous assimilation studies.\nHank et al., 2015) estimated winter wheat\
    \ yield by assimilating\nLAI into PROMET model, the R2 was 0.93 and the RMSE\n\
    was 1.15 ton/ha. Gilardelli et al. (2019) estimated rice yield in\nnorthern Italy\
    \ by assimilating LAI into WARM rice model, the\nMAE was 0.66 ton/ha and the RRMSE\
    \ was 13.8%. Their study\ngot higher accuracy by using ﬁne spatial resolution\
    \ (30 meters)\non an area lower than 3 km2, while our study using 500 m\nresolution\
    \ product so as to achieved 20 km2 of yield estimation. Li\net al., 2019) estimated\
    \ winter wheat yield by assimilating LAI into\nWheatSM model, the RMSE was 1.641\
    \ ton/ha through SCE-UA\nassimilation method and 1.587 ton/ha through EnKF assimilation\n\
    method. Wang P. X. et al. (2020) integrated remote sensing LAI of\n4 phases to\
    \ CERES-Maize model based on EnKF data assimilation\napproach in North China,\
    \ the R2 of the estimated yield was 0.33,\nand the root mean square error (RMSE)\
    \ was 0.371 ton/ha. Their\nstudy has only been veriﬁed in 8 research points for\
    \ 5 years, while\nour study veriﬁed on 155 points for 21 years.\nThe results of\
    \ this paper also show that there are many\npotential development space for the\
    \ method of yield estimation\nbased on the assimilation of surface state variable\
    \ and machine\nlearning. This ﬁnding is similar to those reported by Silva\net\
    \ al. (2020), which concluded that “big data” are useful to\ncharacterize cropping\
    \ systems at the regional scale but need more\nprogress to explain yield variability.\
    \ Directions for improvement\nincluding optimizing machine learning algorithms\
    \ to isolate and\nenhance the eﬀect of FVC features on crop yield; and exploring\n\
    multivariable joint assimilation integrating relevant biophysical\nindicators,\
    \ such as evapotranspiration and temperature. It may\nalso be necessary to apply\
    \ continuous assimilation of multiple\nimages into crop models to retain their\
    \ spatial information.\nFrontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org\n13\n\

    This study proposed a yield prediction method based on a\ncrop model and remote\
    \ sensing data assimilation for maize\nin the black soil region of Northeast China.\
    \ The calibrated\nAquaCrop model already has a good simulation eﬀect at the\n\
    point scale, which conﬁrms the availability of the AquaCrop\nmodel in this area.\
    \ Proﬁt from the physiological response of\ncrops to environmental and management\
    \ conditions is intuitively\nreﬂected by the AquaCrop model. We applied the model\
    \ to\nsimulate the growth of maize crops in the Songnen black soil\narea from\
    \ 2000 to 2020 and accumulated a large database.\nAfter conﬁrming the accuracy\
    \ of the remote sensing surface\nparameter products, synchronous time series observations\
    \ are\nadded to the AquaCrop simulation results of 21 years through\nthe EnKF\
    \ ﬁltering assimilation algorithm, and an optimal\nFVC dataset is established.\
    \ Using the optimal FVC and the\nregression relationship between FVC and statistical\
    \ yield trained\nby random forest, a yield estimation method is formed. Data\n\
    assimilation combines the two geodetic research methodologies\nof simulation and\
    \ observation, while this study proposed that\nthe method further integrates the\
    \ idea of a mechanism model\nand machine learning and provides a feasible idea\
    \ for crop yield\nestimation. Overall, the main contribution of current study\
    \ is\noﬀering new insights and perspectives for the following two\nissues: one\
    \ is how to integrate satellite remote sensing data\ninto the crop model at the\
    \ regional scale; the second is how\nto obtain more useful yield information from\
    \ the available\nsurface parameter data.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe raw\

    Abstract\nThe agriculture 4.0 revolution is an opportunity for farmers to meet\
    \ the challenges in food production.  \nIt has become necessary to adopt a set\
    \ of agricultural practices based on advanced technologies following \nthe agriculture\
    \ 4.0 revolution. This latter enables the creation of added value by combining\
    \ innovative \ntechnologies: precision agriculture, information and communication\
    \ technology, robotics, and Big Data.  \nAs an enterprise, a connected farm is\
    \ also highly sensitive to strategic changes like organizational changes, \nchanges\
    \ in objectives, modified variety, new business objects, processes, etc. To strategically\
    \ control \nits information system, we propose a metamodeling approach based on\
    \ the ISO/IS 19440 enterprise  \nmeta-model, where we added some new constructs\
    \ relating to new advanced digital technologies for Smart \nand Connected agriculture.\n\

    Introduction\nThe Digitalization of agriculture refers to the \nuse of modern\
    \ machinery, computerized tools,  \nand information and communication technologies\
    \ \nin the agricultural sector (Sung, 2018). These \ntechnologies make it possible\
    \ on the one hand  \nto \naccess, \nstore, \ntransfer, \nand \nmanipulate \ninformation,\
    \ but also to analyze it and give it \nmeaning, to transform agriculture into\
    \ a more \nprofitable, sustainable, and inclusive sector (Fielke \net al., 2020).\n\
    Today agriculture is a highly variable area. It is \nsubject to climate change\
    \ and impacted by diverse \nand varied parameters that make the farmer ask \n\
    several questions about which fertilizer to use?  \nAnd with how much quantity?\
    \ Is it profitable? \nWhich \nphytosanitary \ntreatment \nto \nuse  \nfor a particular\
    \ disease? What is the estimated \nharvest at the end of the season? What measures\
    \ \nshould be taken to limit the impacts of climate  \nchange? \nThese \nare \n\
    repeated \nquestions  \nfor the farmer and the entire agricultural value chain.\
    \ \nOf course, the farmer’s experience and his ability  \nto react to similar\
    \ events and situations are  \nimportant in this regard. What is even more \n\
    important today is that we have data more digitalized \nand with large quantities\
    \ coming from the farm. \nThis data can be management data, climate data, \ndata\
    \ fed back by IoT sensors, or data that come \nfrom satellite imagery or drones...\
    \ (Triantafyllou, \nTsouros, et al., 2019). The Internet of Things has \nthe potential\
    \ to impact every part of modern life \nfrom healthcare to education, to manufacturing,\
    \ \nand agriculture will be no exception. Connected \nsensors, cameras, and other\
    \ devices will give \nfarmers a better understanding of what is going \non in\
    \ their fields. These smart farming equipment, \nranging from tractors to planters\
    \ to sprayers, will \nbe able to monitor problems and fix issues without  \nthe\
    \ farmer's direct involvement (Marcu et al., 2019).\nSome IoT devices are developed\
    \ for specific tasks. \nFor instance, instead of digging ditches by hand  \nor\
    \ with an excavator, farmers can use robot \nmowers to trim weeds and grass around\
    \ ditches. \nOther devices may be more application-specific.  \nFor example, the\
    \ agricultural drone which connects \n[94]\nA Connected farm Metamodeling Using\
    \ Advanced Information Technologies for an Agriculture 4.0\nto a tablet or phone\
    \ for controlling and viewing \nvideo from a drone can be used to count cows \
    \ \nor scout for pests (Radhi, 2018). The cost  \nof connected devices will decline\
    \ as the number  \nof \nmanufacturers \nproducing \nthese \nproducts \nincreases.\
    \ It will make it easier for smaller farmers \nto afford internet-connected devices.\
    \ As more \nfarming equipment incorporates connected features, \nfarmers will\
    \ be able to manage their operations  \nfrom home or on the go and forego having\
    \ expensive \nIT infrastructure at their farms.\nOne of the goals of big data\
    \ is to process massive \ndata to get out knowledge. So typically, processing\
    \ \nimages from drones or satellite images help  \nto estimate the harvest over\
    \ large areas. Moreover, \nthrough this imagery, it is possible to detect \ndeficiencies\
    \ or diseases, or pests in plants in a very \nautomatic way and with a high level\
    \ of precision. \nThen, by capturing patterns and agricultural \npractices, for\
    \ example, we can know the impact  \nof using such fertilizer with such a quantity\
    \  \non \na \ngiven \ncrop \nand \nvariety. \nTherefore,  \nthe combination of\
    \ this data, which can be  \nof \ndifferent \nforms \nand \ndifferent \nquantities\
    \  \nwith a high generation speed, allows having metrics \nin hand to make the\
    \ right decisions at the right \ntime. Big Data is a technological tool for the\
    \ farmer \nthat precisely makes him achieve a high level  \nof \nproductivity\
    \ \nand \nprofitability, \nmonitor  \nthe quality of production, and respect the\
    \ environment  \nwith precision (Li and Niu, 2020). \nThis article is structured\
    \ as follows: in section 2, \nwe first recall Related works of Smart agriculture\
    \ \nbased on digital advanced technologies. Section 3 \ndeals with the ISO 19440\
    \ metamodel to understand \nthe different views of the model. Then, a new \nconnected\
    \ farm metamodel is proposed as a research \nmethod. For each view of the model,\
    \ we specify \nthe IT entities and their contribution to the farm.  \nIn section\
    \ 4, we describe the 4 views of the irrigation \nscheduling process case study.\
    \ The conclusion  \nof this work situates the action plan proposed in this  \n\
    article to underline its contribution as well  \nas the future investigations\
    \ to be developed.\nMaterials and methods\nSmart agriculture based on digital\
    \ advanced \ntechnologies: Related works\nAgriculture 4.0 is the most recent technological\
    \ \ndevelopment in agriculture based on Big Data \nAnalytics, the Internet of\
    \ Things, and Artificial \nIntelligence (Symeonaki et al., 2020). It is \nexpected\
    \ to enhance productivity, efficiency,  \nand sustainability in agriculture. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 will \nbe a game-changer that can lead to more productivity \nin agriculture\
    \ and increase the incomes of farmers \nby \nusing \nhigh-technology \nsensors,\
    \ \nsatellite \nimagery, and remote sensing applications. Together  \nwith the\
    \ use of drones, artificial intelligence,  \nand robotics, agricultural transformation\
    \ towards \nagribusiness entrepreneurship can be achieved.\nSmart agriculture\
    \ is the application of modern \ninformation and communication technologies  \n\
    in the practice of agriculture. It implements a variety  \nof techniques including\
    \ sensors, robotics, drones, \nand data analytics technologies. Several processes\

    \ reproductive period. In this \ncase, the example comes from connected collars\
    \ \nfor cattle and sheep farms. This very advanced \ntechnology allows breeders\
    \ to know precisely  \nthe heat periods of cows but also, for dairy farms, \n\
    the quantity of milk produced per day or their need \nfor food supplements. This\
    \ means that digital affects \nagriculture as a whole, upstream and downstream.\
    \ \nAlso, these sensors can be set to detect different \nbehaviors of animals\
    \ and automatically update data \nabout their health. They are connected to networks\
    \ \nand servers and send information over the internet. \nModern farmers can now\
    \ improve their genetics \nwith the help of wireless sensor networks and save\
    \ \ntime, while also knowing where the animals are  \nand what they're doing.\
    \ \n- Weather forecasting\nEnvironmental factors like weather influence crop \n\
    growth and agricultural production in general. This \nlatter has spatial yield\
    \ variability, partly because  \nof \nspatial \nvariability \nin \nsoil \nproperties\
    \  \nand interactions with the weather, which is also \nspatially varied. Artificial\
    \ intelligence techniques, \nlike machine learning, could be used to predict \
    \ \nthe weather for farmers to assist them in their \ndecision-making (Yang et\
    \ al., 2018).\nAuthors (Verma et al., 2020) implement a real-\ntime weather prediction\
    \ system that can be used  \nin agriculture. The system utilizes a temperature\
    \ \n[95]\nA Connected farm Metamodeling Using Advanced Information Technologies\
    \ for an Agriculture 4.0\nand humidity sensor. Then the sensed data are \nuploaded\
    \ to a cloud server. A logistic regression \nmodel is used for setting up the\
    \ machine learning \nenvironment. The result of this model is compared \nwith\
    \ other works available that used Decision Tree \nand Artificial Neural Network\
    \ models. The proposed \nsystem is slightly better in terms of accuracy.\n- Crop\
    \ yield prediction and crop selection\nPopular artificial intelligence techniques\
    \ such  \nas artificial neural networks and machine learning \ntechniques have\
    \ proven to be effective in crop \nselection and yield prediction. They are based\
    \ \non various factors such as weather, soils, natural \ncalamities, famine, and\
    \ other inputs. Using several \nsoil characteristics such as soil depth, phosphorous,\
    \ \npotassium, salt, organic matter, and magnesium \nsaturation as input of artificial\
    \ neural networks, \n(Coble et al., 2018) confirmed the prediction  \nof corn\
    \ and soybean yields.\n- Irrigation\nThe \nirrigation \nsystem \nscheduling \n\
    is \none  \nof the most critical processes in agriculture that \ncould affect\
    \ crop productivity and quality. A farmer \nmust answer the questions “When do\
    \ I water?” \nand “How long do I water?” during irrigation \nscheduling. Watering\
    \ crops is an important part  \nof \ncrop \nmanagement. \nTo \nensure \nadequate\
    \  \nand timely water supply, it is essential to select  \nthe most effective\
    \ irrigation system to meet the needs \nof crops. Both overwatering and underwatering\
    \ can \ncause crop damage, reduced yields, and poor crop \nquality which hurt\
    \ crop yield and profit margins. \nThis latter can improve the water use efficiency\
    \ \nby a better understanding of soil moisture, crop \nhealth, and weather forecasting\
    \ and providing \nonly as much water to the plants as needed. \nWireless sensor\
    \ networks are used to automate \nirrigation systems. They transmit water information\
    \  \nfrom sensors to irrigation controllers, which \ndecide when to measure soil\
    \ moisture and adjust  \nthe irrigation system. The farmer doesn’t have  \nto\
    \ be at the field all day or argue about when  \nto water plants with someone\
    \ else (Muangprathub \net al., 2019).\n- Nurturing and crop protection\nThe easiest\
    \ way to meet the growing need  \nfor food is by applying Fertilizers. Measurement\
    \  \nof soil Nitrogen (N),  Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), \ntemperature, and\
    \ humidity of the soil is necessary \nto determine the suitable fertilizer. Authors\
    \ (Naresh \net al., 2020) and (Bondre and Mahagaonkar, \n2019) have researched\
    \ the topic of Crop Yield \nPrediction and Fertilizer Recommendation. They  \n\
    tented \nto \nprovide \nan \naccurate \ndecision  \nin predicting crop yield and\
    \ deliver the end-user \nwith proper recommendations about the required \nfertilizer\
    \ based on atmospheric and soil parameters  \nof the land (N, P, K, moisture,\
    \ rainfall, etc.). They \nhave used data mining techniques to organize  \nthe\
    \ data set and gather the required data using \nmachine learning and algorithms.\
    \ These goals \nare achieved by applying data science models  \non agriculture\
    \ data to recommend a suitable \nfertilizer for every particular crop.\nBindu\
    \ et al. (2020) have realized a review  \non Smart Fertilizer Distribution System\
    \ with Crop  \nYield \nPrediction. \nThey \nconclude \nthat  \nwith the help of\
    \ technologies like IoT, Machine \nlearning, Data mining, and big data, they can\
    \ \nachieve yield prediction and proper fertilizer \ndistribution. Fertilizer\
    \ distribution is feasible based \non Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and Potassium\
    \ \n(K) NPK values of soil. Alex and Kanavalli (2019) \ndesign, prototype and\
    \ implement intelligent \ncomputational techniques for the prediction \nof crop\
    \ yield based on the big data from a large \nnumber of scattered agriculture fields.\
    \ They built \na big data analytics model for precision agriculture  \nand fertilizer\
    \ management to improve the agriculture \nfield using a convolutional neural network\
    \ (CNN). \nDahikar et al. (2015) proposed an Artificial Neural \nNetwork Approach\
    \ for Agricultural Crop Yield \nPrediction based on various parameters. They \n\
    allowed suggesting fertilizer by using ANN. They \nconfirmed that the result was\
    \ satisfactory.\n-  Plowing\nTractors have been used in agriculture for a long\
    \ \ntime, but the advent of autonomous tractors \nunderlines and allows you to\
    \ use them effectively. \nThese tractors can be equipped with machines that \n\
    spray liquid fertilizers or plant protection products. \nWith this equipment,\
    \ farmers can improve their \nproduction by reducing labor costs. An autonomous\
    \ \ntractor operates on a private road whose operation \ncan \nbe \nautomated\
    \ \nthrough \nroute \nplanning  \nand automatic or manual deflection of the vehicle\
    \  \nto avoid incidents. The invention also has \ntechniques for detecting obstacles\
    \ and automatic  \nor manual deflection of the vehicle to avoid \ncollisions with\
    \ them. It can even stop and start \nautomatically within the presence of a moving\
    \ \nbarrier. with GPS-guided features, it allows farmers \nto operate under better\
    \ conditions and improve their \ncrop production. However, obtaining an expensive\
    \ \ntransporter is not enough for many farmers; they \nneed more assistance to\
    \ develop this strategic \nbusiness model.\n[96]\nA Connected farm Metamodeling\
    \ Using Advanced Information Technologies for an Agriculture 4.0\n- Agricultural\
    \ policy and trade\nBig Data Analytics can be beneficial when \nsimulating agricultural\
    \ policy impacts. Indeed, \nA larger quantity of data like crops' production,\
    \ \nchanges in costs' input, market demand, market \nsupply, market price trends,\
    \ cultivation costs, \nwages, transportation costs, and marketing costs \ncould\
    \ be learned by Advanced algorithms to predict \nsupport prices for farmers by\
    \ governments in both \ndeveloped and developing countries.\n- Poultry farming\n\
    Poultry farming is the process of raising \ndomesticated birds such as chickens,\
    \ turkeys, \nducks, and geese to farm meat or eggs for food. \nWeatherproof sensors\
    \ can be attached to the bird  \nor the building to track such parameters as the\
    \ birds' \nlocation, temperature, and humidity and monitor \ntheir health and\
    \ hygiene. The sensors can send \nalerts when a flock is on the farm where they\
    \ should \nbe and if there is an unauthorized movement. Also, \nsensors can be\
    \ implanted under the skin of chickens \nto provide information on their sleep\
    \ cycle which \ncan then be used by software to predict egg \nproduction.\nTo\
    \ sum up, agriculture is becoming impacted  \nby various parameters, namely climate\
    \ change, \ncrop and soil conditions, etc. What is even \nmore important today\
    \ is having Big Data that is \nincreasingly digital and with large amounts coming\
    \ \nfrom the farm. Moreover, the mastery of data is  \na wealth for the actors\
    \ of the agricultural world \nwhose actors use it wisely. Big Data, for its part,\
    \ \nmakes it possible to analyze data and thus guide \nfarmers in their choices\
    \ and procedures.\nISO 19440/DIS 2007 Enterprise Metamodel\nResearchers done in1990s,\
    \ in terms of enterprise \nmodeling, led to a standardized framework \nthat meets\
    \ the needs of a systemic approach  \nto the enterprise. It’s the ISO 19440 meta-model-\n\
    oriented process model. The standard offers four \nviews on these models: the\
    \ organizational view, \nthe informational view, the functional view,  \nand the\
    \ view of resources (Falih et al., 2019).  \nThe ISO/IS 19440 standard proposes\
    \ a set  \nof modeling elements for the representation  \nof the enterprise. In\
    \ this section, we present  \nthe meta-model proposed in the framework  \nof ISO/DIS\
    \ 19440. This model integrates the four \nviews (Figure 1).\nThe functional view\
    \ aims to model enterprise \nfunctionality and enterprise behavior. It describes\
    \  \nthe tasks or activities that must be done  \nand in which order they must\
    \ be accomplished. \nIt contains Domain, event, Business process,  \nand Enterprise\
    \ Activity constructs. A domain \nrepresents \nthe \nboundary \nand \nthe \ncontent\
    \  \nof an enterprise or a part of an enterprise. A business  \nprocess represents\
    \ a part of the enterprise’s \nbehavior. It is an aggregation of the business\
    \ process  \nand/or business activity and the information \ndescribed by the business\
    \ rules. The business \nactivity is the realization of a transformation  \nfrom\
    \ inputs to outputs by specific resources.  \nAn event initiates the execution\
    \ of a business \nprocess or an activity.\nThe informational view aims to model\
    \ objects \nSource: Boulmakoul, Falih, and Marghoubi, 2009)\nFigure 1: Meta-model\
    \ ISO 19 440.\n[97]\nA Connected farm Metamodeling Using Advanced Information\
    \ Technologies for an Agriculture 4.0\nof the enterprise, their states, and their\
    \ flows \n(Vernadat, 2020). Enterprise Object and Object \nview constructs constitute\
    \ the informational view. \nEnterprise Object represents the set of information\
    \ \nthat describes a generalized or a real or an abstract \nentity. Object View\
    \ defines the object’s nature \n(material or information) and represents the object\
    \ \nstate by a subset of the Enterprise Object attributes.\nResource view aims\
    \ to model human, technical, \nor IT agents and components required to execute\
    \ \noperations and which roles, capabilities, and skills \nare required. The resource\
    \ represents the provided \ncapabilities required to execute an Enterprise \n\
    Activity. A functional Entity is a specialization \nof the Resource construct\
    \ able to perform  \na functional operation(s) required by an Enterprise \nActivity.\
    \ Capability Set represents the capability \ncharacteristics of either a Resource\
    \ or an Enterprise \nActivity.\nThe \norganizational \nview \naims \nto \nmodel\
    \ \norganization units, decision centers, decision \nlevels, and their relationships\
    \ as well as associated \nresponsibilities and authorities. Organization Unit\
    \ \nrepresents an entity of the organizational structure  \nof the enterprise.\
    \ Below, we briefly recall  \nthe semantics of each construct (Kosanke et al.,\
    \ \n2014).\nA new Connected Farm Metamodel\nIn this section, we propose a holistic\
    \ meta-modeling \nbased on a formal extension of the ISO/DSI 19440 \nmeta-model.\
    \ \nThis \nmeta-modeling \nhighlights  \nthe alignment between functional, informational,\
    \ \norganizational, and resource views and supports \nan arrangement of constructs\
    \ allowing to deal \nwith a connected farm to model an agriculture 4.0. \nOur\
    \ proposed formal extension of the meta-model \nintegrates aspects of Big Data\
    \ Analytics into smart \nfarms.\nModeling the farm as a complex socio-technical\
    \ \ndynamic system is an indispensable means  \nof organizational research to\
    \ extract useful \nknowledge. The modeling of relationships between \nthe different\
    \ entities of the farm and the analysis \nof their impacts on the overall performance\
    \ is \ncalled structural analysis (Jones et al., 2017). \nBy highlighting associations\
    \ between specific \nentities, the analysis can define different views  \nof an\
    \ enterprise and, therefore, gain in-depth \ninsight into the performance from\
    \ multiple points \nof view. Structural analysis can be used to produce \na \n\
    functional, \norganizational, \ninformational,  \nor resource viewpoint. Such\
    \ analysis is helpful  \nin a wide range of business scenarios, from business\
    \ \ndesign to real-time performance monitoring.\nThe figure below (Figure 2) presents\
    \ our holistic \nmeta-modeling \nincorporating \nthe \nBig \nData \nAnalytics\
    \ approach and allowing us to look  \nat the farm from an overhead perspective\
    \ to establish \nthe different views of the farm. The proposed  \nmeta-modeling\
    \ provides a formal framework \nthat gives global representativeness through \
    \ \na holistic view of the farm. In this paper, our study \ngoes beyond the explicit\
    \ definitions of functional, \norganizational, informational, and resource entities\
    \ \nto also delve into the relationships and associations \nlinking these entities.\

    A Connected farm Metamodeling Using Advanced Information Technologies for an Agriculture\
    \ 4.0\nMetamodel to allow a semantic representation  \nof a digital farm. Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 is a concept that \ncombines ideas of precision farming with sensors, \n\
    cloud-based analytics, and artificial intelligence \n(AI) in the context of a\
    \ new IoT farm model. \nThe agriculture 4.0 model proposes a new set  \nof stakeholders\
    \ and entities, relationships between \nthese entities, and models of how the\
    \ actors interact \nwith the various entities. It is enabled through  \na combination\
    \ of new sensor technologies, cloud-\nbased analytics, artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI), mobile \ntechnology, robotics, and autonomous control \nsystems. \nSmart\
    \ \nfarming \nmodeling \nprovides  \na holistic view using interlinked components\
    \ \nthat work together to provide innovative design \nsolutions required to meet\
    \ future agricultural needs \nin increasing productivity, improving sustainability,\
    \ \nand supporting rural communities (Cho Yongbeen, \n2019).\n- Functional view\
    \ of the extended Metamodel\nAgriculture 4.0 in general refers to two domains.\
    \ \nThe first one concerns land issues (smart agriculture) \nlike plowing, Fertilizing,\
    \ harvesting, afforestation, \netc. The second one concerns breeding cattle issues.\
    \ \nThe functional view of smart agriculture aims  \nto meet the different processes\
    \ and activities \ninvolved in smart agriculture (Figure 3). To carry out \nthese\
    \ processes and activities in a smarter manner, \nit is important to exploit IT\
    \ processes (Perakis  \net al., 2020). They can be done towards increasing \n\
    the efficiency of irrigation, selecting the optimal \nstage of planting or harvest,\
    \ identifying anomalies, \nand more services by the analysis of large data sets\
    \ \nto find useful information that helps make decisions. \nBased on the data\
    \ collected by sensors, farmers can \nalso modify their processes to improve their\
    \ land \nyields. For example, the amount of fertilizer that \nis required for\
    \ optimal growth can be determined. \nFurthermore, soil type and moisture levels\
    \ can \nbe identified which will allow farmers to make \nadjustments to their\
    \ irrigation methods based  \non the needs of the crops. Indeed, based on the\
    \ data \nthat is being collected from agricultural sensors  \nand gathered from\
    \ weather satellites it is possible  \nto maintain finer control over irrigation\
    \ systems. \nThis will allow for optimal water usage to save \nmoney and replenish\
    \ groundwater stores for later \nuse. Climate data from satellites and ground\
    \ stations \nallows for early forecasting to minimize risks such \nas floods and\
    \ droughts. This information collects \ndata on soil moisture levels, surface\
    \ temperatures, \nprecipitation patterns, and more are fed into climate \nmodels\
    \ that then simulate future conditions thus \nallowing farmers to plan accordingly.\
    \ By utilizing \nthis technology, it is possible to predict droughts \nbefore\
    \ they happen to help prevent crop loss (Rabhi \net al., 2021b). \nIT Process\
    \ refers to the Big Data Analytics process. \nWe inspired it by the Functional\
    \ big data analytics-\nbased \nframework \nfor \nconnected \nagriculture \n(Rabhi\
    \ et al., 2021a). It includes Data Collection, \nData Aggregation, Data Analytics,\
    \ and Data \nVisualization processes.\n- Informational view of the extended Metamodel\n\
    The informational view regroups the used sources \nof agricultural data (Figure\
    \ 4). Data is the core  \nof the proposed extension of ISO 19440 metamodel. \n\
    It is based on a comprehensive set of agricultural \nobjects. It classifies agricultural\
    \ objects according \nto the functionalities they support. Each process \nrequires\
    \ data information such as climate data, soil \nmoisture content, real-time crop\
    \ status, etc. (Ngo, \n2020). Agricultural objects are now more and more \nSource:\

    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), \nwhich incorporates a variety of objects,\
    \ systems, \nand \nservices \nthat \ncommunicate \ninformation \nusing Internet\
    \ connections. Agricultural objects \ninclude tractors, harvesters, GPS devices,\
    \ robots, \ndrones, etc. (Triantafyllou, Sarigiannidis, et al., \n2019). The set\
    \ of these agricultural objects is \nclassified into functionalities entities\
    \ that they \nsupport such as planting, spraying, harvesting, \nrepairs, etc.\
    \ Sensors are placed on the ground  \nor on the plant to characterize its soil\
    \ and its health \n(water, temperature), as well as drones that fly \nabove the\
    \ farm to measure certain parameters such \nas the presence of snow or insects.\
    \ The proposed \nextension metamodel highlights machine learning \n(ML) and deep\
    \ learning (DL) technologies that are \nnecessary for handling massive amounts\
    \ of big data \nproduced by sensors (Jabir et al., 2021). Besides, \nIoT enables\
    \ the collection of huge amounts  \nof agricultural data using sensors. Machine\
    \ learning \ncan be used by exploiting this data with Big Data \nand cloud technologies\
    \ to create a new level  \nof intelligence in agriculture practices (Symeonaki\
    \ \net al., 2020; Rabhi et al., 2021a).\n- Resource view of the extended Metamodel\n\
    The proposed metamodel is a classification  \nof different types of agricultural\
    \ resources  \n(Figure 5). The resource is a superclass that defines \nSource:\

    \ problem-solving in complex domains; or even \nfor alerting people about possible\
    \ problems in their \nenvironment.\n- Organizational view of the extended Metamodel\n\
    The Organizational view is a farm model view \nthat enables the representation\
    \ and modification \nof the organizational and decisional structure  \nof the\
    \ farm and the responsibilities and authorities  \nof \nthe \npersons \nand \n\
    organization \nunits  \nwithin the farm. It describes the relations \nbetween\
    \ the different organizational entities  \non the farm and identifies their responsibilities.\
    \ \nThese responsibilities can be on different levels \nof the organization and\
    \ are usually carried out  \nby members of the organization entity authorized\
    \ \nfor the decision-making. \nThe Organizational Unit is a construct that \n\
    represents an entity of the organizational structure \nof the farm such as IT\
    \ Governance, Data Security, \nData Analytics, and Data Visualization Units. \
    \ \nThe organizational Unit’s content shall be \ndetermined by naming the assigned\
    \ entities  \nfor which it has authority or responsibility, or both. \nIndeed,\
    \ Each Organizational Unit shall contain  \nat least one relationship to an Organizational\
    \ Role \nspecifying the required or provided organizational \nskills and responsibilities.\n\
    IT governance is a construct that aims to improve \nthe overall management of\
    \ IT and derive \nimproved value from investment in information  \nand technology.\
    \ It enables organizations to manage \ntheir IT risks effectively and ensure that\
    \ the activities \nassociated with information and technology are \naligned with\
    \ their overall business objectives.\nRisk consideration in smart agriculture\
    \ modeling \nis of increasing importance since the business \nenvironment \nis\
    \ \nbecoming \nmore \nand \nmore \ncompetitive and unpredictable. This need has\
    \ given \nrise to the risk-aware agricultural business process \nmanagement paradigm.\
    \ It consists of the integration \nof risk aspects into business process management\
    \ \nto increase the risk awareness of a farm’s business \nprocesses (Lamine et\
    \ al., 2020) (Figure 6).\nSource: author\nFigure 6: Organizational view of the\

    \ Technologies for an Agriculture 4.0\nResults and discussion\nAs an application\
    \ of the meta-model explained \nabove, we will use the case study treated in one\
    \  \nof our previous articles named \"Digital agriculture \nbased on big data\
    \ analytics: a focus on predictive \nirrigation for smart farming in Morocco\"\
    \ (Rabhi \net al., 2021b). This article deals with the issue  \nof predictive\
    \ irrigation using the Big Data Analytics \napproach. In this section, we will\
    \ show the 4 views \nof the metamodel: Functional, Informational, \nOrganizational,\
    \ and Resource views.\n- Functional view\nThe goal of the irrigation scheduling\
    \ process is  \nto control the timing and amount of water used  \non a given field\
    \ or farm. Irrigation scheduling is \nused on crops to help manage growth, optimize\
    \ \nyields, and improve fertilizer efficiency. It also helps \nreduce soil erosion\
    \ and improve crop yields. When \na crop is unnecessarily watered too much, either\
    \  \nso it's overwatered or has irrigation water sitting  \nin the soil without\
    \ being taken up by the plant \nroots. This can cause plant damage and reduced\
    \ \nyields. With so many ways to damage crops, it's \nimportant to implement a\
    \ smart irrigation system.  \nWith the big data analytics process, we can catch\
    \ \nhow much water is being lost and track areas that \nneed more water. This\
    \ way can maximize crop \nyields while minimizing the financial and practical\
    \ \nimpact of damage on crops (Figure 7).\nWe have predicted whether the soil\
    \ is dry or not \nbased on its state of moisture and crop temperature. \nThus,\
    \ we used Big Data Analytics technics  \nto predict the position of the pumping\
    \ motor.  \nIf the soil is dry, the pump will be set to \"ON\" else \nto \"OFF\"\
    .\n- Informational view \nThrough sensors placed directly on the plant \nand soil,\
    \ connected devices allow measures \nthat concern soil and crop conditions. Coupled\
    \  \nwith weather data, these Big data will be transmitted \nvia a wireless sensor\
    \ network and then stored  \nand analyzed with advanced tools of big data \nanalytics\
    \ to extract useful insight (Figure 8).  \nWe worked with an existing dataset\
    \ where \ninformation is collected from sensors (temperature \nand moisture).\
    \ We used a dataset containing  \na large amount of data. If the pump state contains\
    \ \none, that means the pump is ON and the soil \nis dry. If it contains zero,\
    \ that means it's OFF  \nand the soil is watered. We've imported a CSV file  \n\
    with information on the moisture and temperature. \nThe first columns have the\
    \ parameters of moisture \nand temperature, while the last one represents  \n\
    a class (pump).\nThe Databricks platform is also used to create  \na combination\
    \ of big data storage and analytics  \nto quickly build, manage and share data\
    \ pipelines.  \nIt is a big data processing platform founded  \nby \nApache \n\

    \ a central role in safeguarding the region’s food supply and achieving the \n\
    second UN Sustainable Development Goal of zero hunger by 2030. However, the agriculture\
    \ \nsector faces challenges from changing consumer demand, demographics, inefficient\
    \ value \nchains, climate change and water shortage. Climate change is already\
    \ impacting significantly \non agriculture and food production in developing countries.\
    \ Agriculture has been able to keep \nup with the rising demand for food and other\
    \ agricultural goods because of the development \nof new farming techniques throughout\
    \ the previous century. Natural resources will \nundoubtedly be further stressed\
    \ as result of rising food demand, population growth, income \nlevels, etc. New\
    \ methods and approaches should be able to meet future food demands while \nmaintaining\
    \ or lowering agriculture’s environmental imprint as the detrimental effects of\
    \ \nagriculture on the environment become more widely acknowledged. \nThe application\
    \ of remote sensing in agriculture can aid the evolution of agricultural practices\
    \ \nthat face different types of challenges by providing information related to\
    \ crop status at \ndifferent scales all through the season. Making educated management\
    \ decisions with the help \nof emerging technologies including geospatial technology,\
    \ the Internet of Things (IoT), Big \nData analysis, and artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI). To maximize agricultural inputs, boot \nagricultural production, and decrease\
    \ input losses, precision agriculture (PA) uses a variety \nof such technologies.\
    \ Over the past few decades, there has been a sharp expansion in the use \nof\
    \ remote sensing technology for PA (precision agriculture). It is crucial to investigate\
    \ and \ndesign an easy-to-use yet dependable workflow for the real-time use of\
    \ remote sensing in PA \n(precision agriculture) given the complexity of image\
    \ processing and the quantity of technical \nknowledge and skill required. Wider\
    \ usage of remote sensing technologies in commercial and \nnon-commercial PA (precision\
    \ agriculture) applications is likely to result from the \ndevelopment of accurate\
    \ yet simple-to-use, user-friendly systems. \n \nKeywords: Agriculture, Remote\
    \ sensing, Precision Agriculture \n \nINTRODUCTION: \n Techniques for remote sensing\
    \ are frequently employed in agronomy and agriculture. Remote \nsensing is required\
    \ because agricultural activity monitoring presents unique challenges not \nencountered\
    \ in other economic sectors (FAO) (2011). The first thing to note is that agricultural\
    \ \noutput adheres to distinct seasonal patterns linked to the biological lifespan\
    \ of crops. \nProduction is further influenced by climate driving factors, agricultural\
    \ management \ntechniques, and the physical environment (such as soil type). In\
    \ both space and time, all \nvariables are highly changeable. Moreover, timely\
    \ agricultural monitoring systems are \nnecessary since productivity might fluctuate\
    \ quickly due to unfavourable growing conditions. \nConsequently, as the Food\
    \ and Agriculture Organization noted a key element of agricultural \nstatistics\
    \ and related monitoring systems is the requirement for timeliness; information\
    \ is of \nlittle use if it is made available too late. As it is extremely suitable\
    \ for gathering information \nacross vast areas with high revisit frequency, remote\
    \ sensing may greatly contribute to \npresenting a timely and accurate picture\
    \ of the agriculture sector. \nWith the first deployment of the Landsat Multispectral\
    \ Scanner System (MSS) satellite in \n1972, RS technologies were first used in\
    \ agriculture. Landsat MSS was utilised by Bauer and \nCipra to categorise the\
    \ agricultural landscapes of the US Midwest into corn or soybean farms. \nHowever,\
    \ due to the limited supply of high spatial (>5m) and temporal (daily) resolution\
    \ \nINTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BIOLOGICALS AND COMPUTATIONAL DIGEST \nInternational\

    \ 2023 \nPage109 \nhttps://iabcd.org.in/ \nsatellite data, the use of satellite-based\
    \ data for PA (precision agriculture) has, until recently, \nbeen minimal and\
    \ restricted only to the large-scale monitoring and mapping of agricultural \n\
    health. RS technologies can now be applied at a scale considerably smaller than\
    \ a field thanks \nto technical improvements in global positioning systems (GPS),\
    \ machinery, hardware, and \nsoftware, cloud computing and the Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). \nVarious RS systems, including as handheld, aeroplane, and satellite\
    \ are currently in use. \nThese platforms can be used to collect data at various\
    \ spatial, temporal and spectral \nresolutions. The best PA (precision agriculture)\
    \ resolutions will rely on a number of variables, \nsuch as management goals,\
    \ crop growth stages, field size and the ability of farm equipment \nto alter\
    \ inputs (fertiliser, pesticides, irrigation). For instance, in order to distinguish\
    \ crop \ntraits (such as leaves and area) at the stand level, better spatial resolution\
    \ data (0.1m) are \ncrucial for the ability to identify crop emergence (1-3m)\
    \ (Fernandez-Ordonez et al., 2017). \nVisible imagery cannot identify some patterns\
    \ in multispectral imagery that are used to \nmonitor crop health (Yao, X. et\
    \ al., 2017). Moreover, thermal imaging is effective for identifying \npest pressure\
    \ soil moisture and crop water stress that cannot be seen with the human eye \n\
    (Calderon et al., 2013). Microwaves, which are less susceptible to air attenuation\
    \ than visual \nand infrared-based RS (Park et al., 2017), can assist is determining\
    \ the biophysical \ncharacteristics of crops and soil in both day and night-time\
    \ environments (Betbeder et al., \n2016). \n \nHistory of remote sensing in Agriculture\
    \ \nAgriculture-related activities have long been observed and analysed using\
    \ remote sensing. \nLong before Eveyln Pruitt of the U.S. Office of Naval Research\
    \ initially used the phrase “remote \nsensing” in 1958 (Estes and Jensen, 1998).\
    \ Scientists were conducting soil and crop studies \nrelated to agricultural areas\
    \ in the United States and other countries using aerial \nphotography (Goodman\
    \ et al., 1959). The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s general crop \ninventories\
    \ and the U.S. Soil Conservation Service’s work on soil survey mapping made up\
    \ \nthe majority of this type of work in the 1930s. During World War II, advances\
    \ in infrared \nphotography led to the development of remote sensing methods that\
    \ improved knowledge of \ncrop status, water management and crop-soil conditions.\
    \ \nRobert Colwell at the University of California conducted ground-breaking research\
    \ on remote \nsensing in agriculture in the 1950s, and in the 1060s, new labs\
    \ focused on agricultural \napplications (Landgrebe et al., 1986), like the one\
    \ at Purdue, were created. Early goals \nincluded crop identification and areal\
    \ coverage, and (Bauer et al., 1985) details initiatives like \nthe Crop Identification\
    \ Technology Assessment for Remote Sensing (CITARS) programme and \nthe Corn Blight\
    \ Watch Experiment. \nIn an effort to promote the use of remote sensing technologies,\
    \ NASA started sponsoring a \nfew colleges through its University Affairs Program\
    \ in the early 1970s. As a result, states \nwhere agricultural constituted a significant\
    \ component of the economy started using remote \nsensing in that industry. Early\
    \ contributors to the development of remote sensing science in \nagriculture included\
    \ centres and laboratories like those at Purdue and Kansas, and their \nwork was\
    \ crucial in determining the spectral bands that would eventually be used in sensor\
    \ \nsystems. \nMany different types of sensors have been used in subsequent investigations\
    \ and remote \nsensing has shown to be capable of supplying the necessary timely\
    \ and trustworthy data for \na fraction of the price of conventional information\
    \ gathering techniques.  \nThe Large Area Crop Inventory Experiment (LACIE) was\
    \ the first U.S. government-sponsored \nproject designed to test the viability\
    \ of estimating wheat production across wide geographic \nareas using remotely\

    \ sensing \nscience historically offers agricultural applications as well (Reeves\
    \ 1975). \n \nRemote sensing applications in Agriculture \nApplications for remote\
    \ sensing in agriculture rely on the interaction of electromagnetic \nradiation\
    \ with plant or soil components. Instead of measuring transmitted or absorbed\
    \ \nradiation, remote sensing often measures reflected radiation (Apostol et al.,\
    \ 2003). Non-\ncontact measurements of radiation reflected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ fields are referred \nto as “remote sensing”. \nSatellites, aircraft, tractors\
    \ and handheld sensors are some of the platforms used to collect \nthis data.\
    \ Proximal sensing refers to measurements taken with tractors and handheld \n\
    sensors, particularly if they do not include measurements of reflected radiation.\
    \ In addition \nto reflecting, transmitting and absorbing light, plant leaves\
    \ can also glow or release heat \n(Cohen et al., 2005). \nHistorically, crop type\
    \ mapping, overall crop condition assessment and agricultural acreage \nestimation\
    \ have all been accomplished using satellite photography. Due to the low spatial\
    \ \nresolution of sensors, these applications were typically applied over wide\
    \ areas. However, \nmore contemporary satellite sensors with finer resolutions\
    \ are now making it possible to \nmonitor issues like drought stress, flooding\
    \ and hail damage on-site. \nStafford (2000) emphasised that changing weather\
    \ conditions can have an impact on satellite \nphotographs. According to Lamb\
    \ and Brown (2001), low-resolution satellite pictures are only \nuseful for large-scale\
    \ studies and might not be suitable for small-scale farms. Furthermore, \nsatellites\
    \ with higher resolution images, such as QuickBird (2.4 m in VNIR) and ASTER (15\
    \ \nm ), have lengthy revisit times (1-3.5 and 16 days, respectively), which limits\
    \ their usefulness \nfor any application that could need frequent photographs.\
    \ Satellites are frequently placed in \nconstellations of a new synchronised satellites\
    \ that cooperate and overlap in ground coverage \nin order to shorten revisit\
    \ times. \nThe amount of radiation reflected from plants varies depending on the\
    \ wavelength of incident \nradiation and is inversely related to the amount of\
    \ radiation absorbed by plant pigments. \nChlorophyll is a pigment found in plants\
    \ that substantially absorbs light in the visible \nspectrum between 400 and 700\
    \ nm (Pinter et al., 2003), especially at wavelengths like 430 \n(blue or B) and\
    \ 660 (red or R) for chlorophyll a and 450 (B) and 650 (R) for chlorophyll \n\
    b.Anthocyanins and carotenoids are two more crucial plant pigments (Blackburn,\
    \ 2007). \nIn contrast, leaf density and canopy structure effects cause plants\
    \ to reflect more light in the \nnear infrared (NIR 700-1300 nm) region. The development\
    \ of spectral indices that are based \non ratios of reflectance values in the\
    \ visible and NIR regions was motivated by this stark \ncontrast in reflectance\
    \ behaviour between the red and NIR portions of the spectrum (Sripada \net al.,\
    \ 2006). Many different characteristics of plant canopies, including leaf area\
    \ index (LAI), \nbiomass, chlorophyll content, or N content, are evaluated using\
    \ these spectral indices.  \nBased mostly on statistical-empirical connections\
    \ between yield and vegetation indices, \nremote sensing has been utilised to\
    \ anticipate crop yields (Thenkabail et al., 2002; Casa and \nJones 2005). For\
    \ government organisations, commodities dealers and farmers, information \non\
    \ predicted yield is crucial for organising harvest, storage, transportation and\
    \ marketing \nactivities. Clay minerals, calcium or iron oxides, as well as soil\
    \ moisture and organic matter \ncontent, all have an impact on how much radiation\
    \ bare soil reflect (Thomasson et al., 2001; \nViscarra Rossel et al., 2006).\
    \ \nAccording to (Ben-Dor et al., 2010), each soil component has a distinct spectral\
    \ signature \nand a particular spectral area where reflectance is strongest. In\
    \ remotely sensed image, bare \nsoil and crop canopies are frequently present,\
    \ and the combination of the two spectral \nsignatures frequently makes it difficult\
    \ to interpret reflectance data. When the reflectance is \nimpacted by both sources,\
    \ spectral unmixing techniques (Demetriades et al., 1990), derivative \nspectra,\
    \ or spectral indices that account for soil impacts are frequently employed to\
    \ separate \ninformation about plant properties (Haboudane et al., 2002). \nAgricultural\
    \ remote sensing applications are often categorised based on the platform used\
    \ to \nmount the sensor, including satellite, aerial and ground-based platforms.\
    \ Based on the \nplatform’s altitude, the image’s spatial resolution, and the\
    \ minimum return frequency for \nsequential imaging, these platforms and the imaging\
    \ systems that go with them can be \ndistinguished from one another. The lowest\
    \ identifiable pixel’s area is impacted by spatial \nresolution. The smallest\
    \ pixel’s area reduces as spatial resolution rises, while the \nINTERNATIONAL\

    \ is less impacted by this \nrestriction (Moran et al., 1997). \n(Dbrowska-Zieliska\
    \ et al., 2008) used the technique to track the development and yield of \nwheat\
    \ in Polish circumstances using AVHRR/NOAA pictures. The authors created a model\
    \ \nthat used the LAI and evapotranspiration indices derived from AVHRR pictures\
    \ to estimate \nwheat yield. (Galvo et al., 2009) investigated the feasibility\
    \ of estimating soybean production \nusing satellite Hyperion hyperspectral pictures\
    \ and found a strong connection (r = 0.74) \nbetween vegetation indices and weight\
    \ of harvested seed. The artificial neural network-based \nmodel created by Li\
    \ et al., (2008) allowed for the regional-scale prediction of maize and \nsoybean\
    \ yields using MODIS sensor data. Results from the model have an accuracy of 85%.\

    \ investigated the \npotential use of MODIS satellite data for yield predictions\
    \ (2008). Using measurements of \nground reflectance, the model was calibrated.\
    \ Simulated yield figures for maize and soybeans, \nwhich differed by 3.12 and\
    \ 6.62 percent, respectively, were in good agreement with yields \nreported by\
    \ the USDA-National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS).  \nFarmers are using\
    \ the GIS (Geographic Information System) as a potent tool to aid in better \n\
    decision-making. Due to the fact that technology gives farmers precise, timely\
    \ and spatially \nexplicit information about their land and crops, GIS has become\
    \ a crucial part of modern \nagriculture.  \nPrecision Agriculture is one of the\
    \ most important GIS applications in agriculture. GIS is used \nin precision agriculture\
    \ to produce maps that depict the field’s variability, including the \nterrain,\
    \ vegetation and soil characteristics. Farmer decision about planting, fertilising\
    \ and \nirrigation can be improved by the analysis of these maps, leading to increased\
    \ crop yields and \nlower input costs (Mishra & Lal, 2017). \nBy providing spatially\
    \ explicit information on the land and its potential for agricultural use, \n\
    GIS is used to enhance land planning. With consideration for elements like soil\
    \ type, climate \nand geography, GIS can be used to pinpoint farm regions that\
    \ are suited for certain crops. \nWith better agricultural planting and location\
    \ choices made using this information, \nproductivity and profitability are increased\
    \ (Tishechkin et al., 2016). \nUsing spatially explicit information about water\
    \ supply, demand and use GIS is used to \nsupport water management in agriculture.\
    \ GIS may be used to pinpoint the farm’s water-\nscarce zones, choose the best\
    \ spots for irrigation systems, and keep and eye on water use un \nreal time.\
    \ Making better judgements about when to irrigate, how much water to apply and\
    \ \nwhen to convert to more drought-tolerant crops is possible with the help of\
    \ this knowledge \n(Abde-Hamid et al., 2018). \n GIS, which gives farmers and\
    \ researchers the ability to analyse and interpret spatial data, is \nbecoming\
    \ more and more significant in the agricultural sector. Although precision \n\
    agriculture, crop monitoring, land use planning and water management have all\
    \ been \ntransformed by GIS, there is still a tremendous possibility for new applications.\
    \ \nTo estimate future agricultural yields, GIS can be used to assess past crop\
    \ yields in a specific \narea coupled with environmental parameters like climate\
    \ and soil composition. Farmers may \nmake data-driven decisions about which crops\
    \ to plant, when to plant them, and how to \nmanage them for the best yield by\
    \ combining these predictions with machine learning \nalgorithms (Kartika et al.,\
    \ 2021). Farmers may automate numerous farming chores by \ncombining GIS with\
    \ precision agriculture technologies like GPS-guided tractors, drones and \nsensors.\
    \ This can lead to increased productivity, lower labour costs, and more accurate\
    \ crop \nmanagement (Giasi et al., 2021).  \nThe distribution and make-up of agro-forestry\
    \ systems, which integrate trees with crops or \nlivestock, can be mapped using\
    \ GIS. Farmers can maximise their use of land and resources \nby comprehending\
    \ the spatial linkages between these systems and their effects on the \nenvironment\
    \ (Stocker et al., 2019). GIS can be used pinpoint regions most at risk from \n\
    drought, flooding and other climate-related problems as climate change continues\
    \ to affect \ncrop-growing conditions. Farmers can create plans to modify their\
    \ methods and lessen the \neffects of climate change by studying these risks (Folberth\
    \ et al., 2016). \nINTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF BIOLOGICALS AND COMPUTATIONAL\

    \ supply chain, GIS may be used to track the movement of livestock and crops,\
    \ \nenhancing traceability and ensuring food safety. Farmers may monitor the conditions\
    \ under \nwhich crops are grown and transported, lowering the danger of contamination,\
    \ by integrating \ndata from sensors and other sources (Chung et al., 2019). By\
    \ providing real-time information \nregarding soil moisture, weather and crop\
    \ water requirements, GIS can be utilised to optimise \nirrigation management.\
    \ Farmers can make data-driven decisions about when and how much \nto irrigate,\
    \ minimising water loss and increasing crop output, by combining this information\
    \ \nwith decision support systems (Yu et al., 2021). \nGIS may be used to map\
    \ the location and density of cattle on a farm as well as other \nenvironmental\
    \ elements like humidity and temperature. Farmers may monitor the health and \n\
    wellbeing of their animals by combining this data with sensors and other technologies,\
    \ which \nminimises the need for antibiotics and other interventions (Berckmans\
    \ et al., 2019). GIS may \nbe used to map the distribution, composition and physical\
    \ and chemical characteristics of \ndifferent types of soil. Farmers may employ\
    \ fertilisers and other soil amendments to the best \nof their ability by understanding\
    \ the spatial correlations between different soil types and \nenvironmental elements\
    \ like water availability and nutrient content (Deb and Shukla, 2017). \nRooftop\
    \ gardens, community gardens and vertical farms are just a few examples of urban\
    \ \nagriculture systems whose distribution and attributes can be mapped using\
    \ GIS. Planners \ncan create plans to increase food security and lessen the environmental\
    \ impact of \nmetropolitan areas by examining the spatial relationships between\
    \ these systems and their \neffects on the environment (Castillo et al., 2018).\
    \ Using GIS and block-chain technology can \nresult in a secure and transparent\
    \ system for following agricultural items from the farm to \nthe customer. Customers\
    \ can track the origin and travel of their food by utilising GIS to \ngenerate\

    \ record of transaction, while farmers can get fair pricing for their goods (De\
    \ \nLongueville et al., 2021). \nRemote sensing techniques have revolutionized\
    \ sustainable agriculture and green farming \npractices by providing valuable\
    \ information on soil, vegetation and water resources (Huang \net al., 2017).\
    \ Remote sensing can monitor large areas and capture data that is difficult to\
    \ \nobtain by conventional ground-based methods (Lu et al., 2019). Remote sensing\
    \ can be used \nto manage resources more efficiently, optimize inputs and reduce\
    \ environmental impacts \n(Duan et al., 2020). Remote sensing has several applications\
    \ in sustainable agriculture, such \nas crop classification, yield estimation\
    \ and soil moisture mapping (Jiang et al., 2021). Remote \nsensing can be used\
    \ to assess crop health and detect stress caused by pests, diseases or \nenvironmental\
    \ factors (Santos et al., 2020). This information can be used to optimize fertilizer\
    \ \nand irrigation inputs, leading to more efficient resource use and increased\
    \ yields (Shao et al., \n2019). \nRemote sensing techniques can be used to estimate\
    \ crop yields accurately by analysing the \nspectral data from crops. Machine\
    \ learning algorithms such as random forests, artificial \nneural networks (ANNs),\
    \ and support vector machines (SVMs) can be used to process this \ndata and generate\
    \ accurate predictions (Gholizadeh et al., 2020; Khan et al., 2021). Satellite\
    \ \nimagery and aerial photographs can be used to classify crops based on their\
    \ spectral \nproperties. ML (machine learning) techniques such as SVMs, decision\
    \ trees and object-based \nimage analysis (OBIA) can be used for crop classification.\
    \ This information can be used for \nprecision agriculture practices such as variable\
    \ rate application of fertilizers, pesticides and \nirrigation (Chakraborty et\
    \ al., 2020; Jiang et al., 2021). Remote sensing and GIS can be used \nto monitor\
    \ crop growth and development. This includes monitoring plant health, identifying\
    \ \nnutrient deficiencies and detecting pest and disease outbreaks. ML (machine\
    \ learning) \nalgorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep\
    \ learning models can be \nused to analyse the large amounts of data generated\
    \ by these technologies (Luo et al., 2020; \nLu et al., 2021). Remote sensing\

    \ sensing can \nbe used to optimize irrigation schedules and detect leaks, leading\

    \ such as the need for specialized training \nand equipment, limited accessibility\
    \ in some regions, and data processing and interpretation \nissues (Liang et al.,\

    \ platforms that can integrate remote sensing data with other sources of information\
    \ to \nprovide actionable insights for farmers (Yu et al., 2020). Additionally,\

    \ \n \nCONCLUSION  \nThere is unquestionably a need for better management of the\
    \ world’s agricultural resources \ndue to growing population pressure and the\
    \ requirement for enhanced agricultural \nproduction. To accomplish this, it is\
    \ first important to gather trustworthy information on the \ntypes, quality, amount\
    \ and locations of resources. Aerial or satellite-based RS technologies \nwill\
    \ be crucial instruments for enhancing the current systems for collecting and\
    \ producing \ndata on agriculture and natural resources. Currently, surveys on\
    \ agriculture are carried out \nall over the world to collect empirical data on\
    \ crops, rangeland, livestock and other \nagricultural resources. Remote sensing\
    \ has revolutionized sustainable agriculture and green \nfarming practices by\
    \ providing valuable information on soil, vegetation and water resources. \nIt\
    \ can optimize inputs and reduce environmental impacts. Challenges to its implementation\
    \ \ninclude limited accessibility, the need for specialized training and data\
    \ processing issues. \nFuture research should focus on developing user-friendly\
    \ tools and platforms to integrate \nremote sensing data with other sources to\
    \ provide actionable insights. Remote sensing holds \nimmense potential in promoting\
    \ sustainable agriculture and green farming practices. \nThe use of remote sensing\
    \ in precision agriculture, which has been increasing quickly in \nrecent years,\
    \ is often related to the examples given above. This farm management strategy’s\
    \ \nprimary goal is to maximise input returns while promoting environmental stewardship.\
    \ \nPrecision agriculture uses very modern technologies, which means that it needs\
    \ ongoing \naccess to information about the environmental factors affecting this\
    \ production. Such data \nare essential for the efficient management of finite\
    \ and diminishing resources. The planning \nand distribution of scarce resources\
    \ to various economic sectors can be facilitated by surveys \nthat are based on\
    \ the PA idea. Based on the biophysical characteristics of crops and/or soils,\
    \ \nRS technology has the potential to revolutionise the detection and characterisation\
    \ of \nagricultural productivity. The information obtained from RS data is, in\
    \ essence, more useful \nwhen combined with ground data, just like other PA components.\
    \ Agronomic and economic \ndecision-making can be reliably supported by precise\
    \ and timely information provided by RS, \ndespite the fact that it cannot collect\
    \ all sorts of agricultural information.  \n \nREFERENCES \n1) Abdel-Hamid, M.\

    in India 1. Introduction Modern day farming demands increased production of food
    to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal, new technologies
    and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos et al., 2014,
    Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2014,
    Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez et
    al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide an
    optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image

    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    soil and plant sensors in various agricultural applications. Such kind of heterogeneous
    placement ensures intelligent and improved decision making. Table 6 lists the
    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    Plant related The sensors deployed or attached to a plant are also an integral
    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    in alfalfa crop (Saha et al., 2011). The system is very useful for a large-scale
    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    Dynamic adjustments ET and real-time weather based Flow management Available Fault
    detection Can detect leak Alert notification Automatic Reaction to faults due
    to leak and weather related events Automatic shut down Overall, irrigation management
    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    The design parameters related to the COMMON-Sense Net project are listed in Table

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described
    below. • Calibration: The soil moisture sensors are first calibrated using the
    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m   9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

    the agricultural process, the reality is that today''s agriculture industry is
    data-centered, precise, and smarter than ever. The rapid emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) based technologies redesigned almost every industry including “smart agriculture”
    which moved the industry from statistical to quantitative approaches. Such revolutionary
    changes are shaking the existing agriculture methods and creating new opportunities
    along a range of challenges. This article highlights the potential of wireless
    sensors and IoT in agriculture, as well as the challenges expected to be faced
    when integrating this technology with the traditional farming practices. IoT devices
    and communication techniques associated with wireless sensors encountered in agriculture
    applications are analyzed in detail. What sensors are available for specific agriculture
    application, like soil preparation, crop status, irrigation, insect and pest detection
    are listed. How this technology helping the growers throughout the crop stages,
    from sowing until harvesting, packing and transportation is explained. Furthermore,
    the use of unmanned aerial vehicles for crop surveillance and other favorable
    applications such as optimizing crop yield is considered in this article. State-of-the-art
    IoT-based architectures and platforms used in agriculture are also highlighted
    wherever suitable. Finally, based on this thorough review, we identify current
    and future trends of IoT in agriculture and highlight potential research challenges.

    I. Introduction To improve the agricultural yield with fewer resources and labor
    efforts, substantial innovations have been made throughout human history. Nevertheless,
    the high population rate never let the demand and supply match during all these
    times. According to the forecasted figures, in 2050, the world population is expected
    to touch 9.8 billion, an increase of approximately 25% from the current figure
    [1]. Almost the entire mentioned rise of population is forecasted to occur among
    the developing countries [2]. On the other side, the trend of urbanization is
    forecasted to continue at an accelerated pace, with about 70% of the world’s population
    predicted to be urban until 2050 (currently 49%) [3]. Furthermore, income levels
    will be multiples of what they are now, which will drive the food demand further,
    especially in developing countries. As a result, these nations will be more careful
    about their diet and food quality; hence, consumer preferences can move from wheat
    and grains to legumes and, later, to meat. In order to feed this larger, more
    urban, and richer population, food production should double by 2050 [4], [5].
    Particularly, the current figure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production
    should touch approximately 3 billion tons, and the annual meat production should
    increase by more than 200 million tons to fulfill the demand of 470 million tons
    [6], [7]. Not only for food, but crop production is becoming equally critical
    for industry; indeed crops like cotton, rubber, and gum are playing important
    roles in the economies of many nations. Furthermore, the food-crops-based bioenergy
    market started to increase recently. Even before a decade, only the production
    of ethanol utilized 110 million tons of coarse grains (approximately 10% of the
    world production) [7], [8]. Due to the rising utilization of food crops for bio-fuel
    production, bio-energy, and other industrial usages, food security is at stake.
    These demands are resulting in a further increase of the pressure on already scarce
    agricultural resources. Unfortunately, only a limited portion of the earth’s surface
    is suitable for agriculture uses due to various limitations, like temperature,
    climate, topography, and soil quality, and even most of the suitable areas are
    not homogenous. When zooming the versatilities of landscapes and plant types,
    many new differences start to emerge that can be difficult to quantify. Moreover,
    the available agricultural land is further shaped by political and economic factors,
    like land and climate patterns and population density, while rapid urbanization
    is constantly posing threats to the availability of arable land. Over the past
    decades, the total agriculture land utilized for food production has experienced
    a decline [9]. In 1991, the total arable area for food production was 19.5 million
    square miles (39.47% of the world’s land area), which was reduced to approximately
    18.6 million square miles (37.73% of the world’s land area) in 2013 [10]. As such,
    the gap between demand and supply of food is becoming more significant and alarming
    with the passage of time. Further examination showed that every crop field has
    different characteristics that can be measured separately in terms of both quality
    and quantity. Critical characteristics, like soil type, nutrient presence, flow
    of irrigation, pest resistance, etc., define its suitability and capability for
    a specific crop. In most of situations, the differentiations of characteristics
    can exist within a single crop field, even if the same crop is being cultivated
    in entire farm; hence, site-specific analyses are required for optimal yield production.
    Further, adding the dimension of time, specific crops in the same field rotate
    season-to-season and biologically reach different stages of their cycle within
    a year in areas where locational and temporal differences result in specific growth
    requirements to optimize the crop production. To respond to these demands with
    a range of issues, farmers need new technology-based methods to produce more from
    less land and with fewer hands. Considering the standard farming procedures, farmers
    need to visit the agriculture sites frequently throughout the crop life to have
    a better idea about the crop conditions. For this, the need of smart agriculture
    arises, as 70% of farming time is spent monitoring and understanding the crop
    states instead of doing actual field work [11]. Considering the vastness of the
    agriculture industry, it incredibly demands for technological and precise solutions
    with the aim of sustainability while leaving minimum environmental impact. Recent
    sensing and communication technologies provide a true remote “eye in the field”
    ability in which farmers can observe happenings in the field without being in
    the field. Wireless sensors are facilitating the monitoring of crops constantly
    with higher accuracy and are able to, most importantly, detect early stages of
    unwanted state. This is the reason why modern agriculture involves the usage of
    smart tools and kits, from sowing to crop harvesting and even during storage and
    transportation. Timely reporting using a range of sensors makes the entire operation
    not only smart but also cost effective due to its precise monitoring capabilities.
    Variety of autonomous tractors, harvesters, robotic weeders, drones, and satellites
    currently complement agriculture equipment. Sensors can be installed and start
    collecting data in a short time, which is then available online for further analyses
    nearly immediately. Sensor technology offers crop and site-specific agriculture,
    as it supports precise data collection of every site. Recently, the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) is beginning to impact a wide array of sectors and industries, ranging from
    manufacturing, health, communications, and energy to the agriculture industry,
    in order to reduce inefficiencies and improve the performance across all markets
    [12]–[16]. If looking closely, one feels that the current applications are only
    scratching the surface and that the real impact of IoT and its uses are not yet
    witnessed. Still, considering this progress, especially in the near past, we can
    predict that IoT technologies are going to play a key role in various applications
    of the agriculture sector. This is because of the capabilities offered by IoT,
    including the basic communication infrastructure (used to connect the smart objects—from
    sensors, vehicles, to user mobile devices—using the Internet) and range of services,
    such as local or remote data acquisition, cloud-based intelligent information
    analysis and decision making, user interfacing, and agriculture operation automation.
    Such capabilities can revolutionize the agriculture industry which probably one
    of most inefficient sectors of our economic value chain today. To summarize this
    discussion, figure 1 provides the main drivers of technology, while figure 2 highlights
    the major hurdles of technology implementation in smart agriculture. FIGURE 1.
    Key drivers of technology in agriculture industry. Show All FIGURE 2. Major hurdle’s
    in technology implementation for smart agriculture. Show All Researchers and engineers
    around the globe are proposing different methods and architectures and based on
    that suggesting a variety of equipment to monitor and fetch the information regarding
    crop status during different stages, considering numerous crop and field types.
    Focusing on the market demand, many leading manufactures are providing a range
    of sensors, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), robots, communication devices, and
    other heavy machinery to deliver the sensed data. In addition, various commissions,
    food and agriculture organizations, and government bodies are developing polices
    and guidelines to observe and regulate the use of these technologies in order
    to maintain food and environment safety [17]–[20]. There are reasonable efforts
    that highlight the role of the IoT in the agriculture industry, but most of the
    published work focuses only on applications [10], [21], [22]. Most of the existing
    articles either provide no insight or show limited focus on the various IoT-based
    architectures, prototypes, advanced methods, the use of IoT for food quality,
    and other future issues considering the latest facts and figures. This manuscript
    examines the trends in IoT-based agriculture research and reveals numerous key
    issues that must be addressed in order to transform the agriculture industry by
    utilizing the recent IoT developments. The major contribution of this article
    is to provide real insight regarding: Expectations of the world from the agriculture
    industry Very recent developments in IoT, both scholarly and in industry are highlighted
    and how these developments are helping to provide solutions to the agriculture
    industry. Limitations, the agriculture industry is facing. Role of IoT to cope
    these limitations and other issues like resources shortage and their precise use,
    food spoilage, climate changes, environmental pollution, and urbanization. Strategies
    and policies that need to be considered when implementing IoT-based technologies
    Critical issues that are left to solve and possible solutions that are further
    required, while suggestions are provided considering these challenges. This article
    is a compendium of knowledge that can help the researchers and agriculture engineers
    implementing the IoT-based technologies to achieve the desired smart agriculture.
    The rest of this document is organized as follows. Section II provides a deep
    overview of major applications of IoT in agriculture and what we can achieve by
    utilizing these technologies. Section III gives insight regarding the role of
    IoT in advanced agriculture practices, like vertical farming (VF), hydroponics,
    and phenotyping, to manage the issues of increased urban population. Section IV

    and communication devices, being used to implement IoT in this industry. Accepting
    the worth of UAVs in precision agriculture, Section V caters application achievements
    that are not possible even using other latest technologies. Food safety and transportation
    are other critical areas requiring focus to overcome the hunger issues which did
    not get the attention of researchers as it deserves. Section VI supplies the role
    of the IoT to ensure food quality for longer periods and to deliver to remote
    areas. Section VII identifies current and future trends of this technology in
    the crop industry by highlighting potential research challenges. Finally, Section
    VIII concludes this article. SECTION II. Major Applications By implementing the
    latest sensing and IoT technologies in agriculture practices, every aspect of
    traditional farming methods can be fundamentally changed. Currently, seamless
    integration of wireless sensors and the IoT in smart agriculture can raise agriculture
    to levels which were previously unimaginable. By following the practices of smart
    agriculture, IoT can help to improve the solutions of many traditional farming
    issues, like drought response, yield optimization, land suitability, irrigation,
    and pest control. Figure 3 lists a hierarchy of major applications, services and
    wireless sensors being used for smart agriculture applications. While, major instances
    in which the advanced technologies are helping at various stages to enhance overall
    efficiency are discussed below. FIGURE 3. General hierarchy of possible applications,
    services and sensors for smart agriculture. Show All A. Soil Sampling and Mapping
    Soil is the “stomach” of plants, and its sampling is the first step of examination
    to obtain field-specific information, which is then further used to make various
    critical decisions at different stages. The main objective of soil analysis is
    to determine the nutrient status of a field so that measures can be taken accordingly
    when nutrient deficiencies are found. Comprehensive soil tests are recommended
    on an annual basis, ideally in Spring; however, based on soil conditions and weather
    consents, it may be done in in Fall or Winter [23]. The factors that are critical
    to analyze the soil nutrient levels include soil type, cropping history, fertilizer
    application, irrigation level, topography, etc. These factors give insight regarding
    the chemical, physical, and biological statuses of a soil to identify the limiting
    factors such that the crops can be dealt accordingly. Soil mapping opens the door
    to sowing different crop varieties in a specific field to better match soil properties
    accordingly, like seed suitability, time to sow, and even the planting depth,
    as some are deep-rooted and others less. Furthermore, growing multiple crops together
    could also lead to smarter use of agriculture, simply making the best use of resources.
    Currently, manufacturers are providing a wide range of toolkits and sensors that
    can assist farmers to track the soil quality and, based on this data, recommend
    remedies to avoid its degradation. These systems allow for the monitoring of soil
    properties, such as texture, water-holding capacity, and absorption rate, which
    ultimately help to minimize erosion, densification, salinization, acidification,
    and pollution (by avoiding excessive use of fertilizer). Lab-in-a-Box, a soil
    testing tool kit developed by AgroCares, is considered a complete laboratory in
    itself based on its offered services [24]. By using this, any farmer, without
    having any lab experience, can analyze up to 100 samples per day (overall, more
    than 22,000 nutrient samples a year) without visiting any lab. Drought is a major
    concern which limits the productivity of crop yield. Most of the regions around
    the globe face this issue with various intensities. To deal with this issue, especially
    in very rural areas, remote sensing is being used to obtain frequent soil moisture
    data which helps to analyze the agricultural drought in far regions. For this
    purpose, the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) satellite was launched in
    2009 which provides global soil moisture maps every, one to two days. Authors
    in [25] used SMOS L2 to calculate the Soil Water Deficit Index (SWDI) in Spain
    in 2014. In this effort, they followed different approaches to obtain the soil
    water parameters in order to compare with the SWDI acquired from in situ data.
    In [26], authors used the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS)
    sensor to map various soil functional properties to estimate the land degradation
    risk for sub-Saharan Africa. The soil maps and field survey data, which covered
    all major climate zones on the continent, were used to develop the prediction
    models. Sensors and vision based technologies are helpful to decide the distance
    and depth for sowing the seed efficiently. Like in [27], sensor and vision based
    autonomous robot called Agribot is developed for sowing seeds. The robot can perform
    on any agricultural lands on which the self-awareness of the robot’s placement
    is ascertained through the global and local maps generated from Global Positioning
    System (GPS) while the on-board vision system is paired with a personal computer.
    Advancing further, various non-contact sensing methods are proposed to determine
    the seed flow rate as in [28] where the sensors are equipped with LEDs; consist
    of infrared, visible light and laser-LED as well as an element as a radiation
    receiver. The output voltage varies based on the movement of the seeds through
    the sensor and band of light rays, and falling of shades on the elements of receiver.
    The signal information, linked to the passing seeds, is used to measure the seed
    flow rate. B. Irrigation About 97% of Earth’s water is salt-water held by oceans
    and seas, and only the remaining 3% is fresh water—more than two-third of which
    is frozen in the forms of glaciers and polar ice caps [29], [30]. Only 0.5% of
    the unfrozen fresh water is above the ground or in the air, as the rest lies underground
    [31]. In short, humanity relies on this 0.5% to fulfill all its requirements and
    to maintain the ecosystem, as enough fresh water must be kept in rivers, lakes,
    and other similar reservoirs to sustain it. It is worth mentioning that solely
    the agriculture industry uses approximately 70% of this accessible fresh water
    [32], [33]. In many countries, situation rises to 75% e.g. Brazil, further in
    some underdeveloped countries, even it exceeds 80% [34]. The main reason for this
    high water consumption is the monitoring procedure as even in 2013, crops visual
    inspection for irrigation decision-making was very common, as nearly 80% of farms
    in United States were observed by this [10], [35]. According to the UN Convention
    to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) estimates in 2013 show that there were 168 countries
    affected by desertification and by 2030, almost half of the world population will
    be living in areas with high water shortages [36]. Considering the figures of
    water crises around the globe, same time its increasing demands in agriculture
    and many other industries, it should be provided to places only where it is needed,
    most importantly, in required quantities. For this purpose, increased awareness
    has been implemented to conserve the existing under-stress water resources by
    employing more efficient irrigation systems. Various controlled irrigation methods,
    like drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, are being promoted to tackle the
    water wastage issues, which were also found in traditional methods like flood
    irrigation and furrow irrigation. Both the crop quality and quantity are badly
    affected when facing water shortage, as irregular irrigation, even excess, leads
    to reduced soil nutrients and provokes different microbial infections. It is not
    a simple task to accurately estimate the water demand of crops, where factors
    like crop type, irrigation method, soil type, precipitation, crop needs, and soil
    moisture retention are involved. Considering this fact, a precise soil and air
    moisture control system using the wireless sensors not only makes an optimal use
    of water but also leads to better crop health. The current situation of irrigation
    methods is expected to be changed by adopting the emerging IoT technologies. A
    significant increase in crop efficiency is expected with the use of IoT based
    techniques, such as crop water stress index (CWSI)-based irrigation management
    [10], [35]. For this, attaining crop canopy at different periods and air temperature
    are needed for the calculation of CWSI. A wireless sensors based monitoring system
    where all the field sensors are connected to collect the mentioned measurements,
    further transmit to processing center where corresponding intelligent software
    applications are used to analyze the farm data. Not only this but information
    from other sources including weather data and satellite imaging is applied to
    CWSI models for water need assessment, and finally specific irrigation index value
    is produced for each site. A prominent example is VRI (Variable Rate Irrigation)
    optimization by CropMetrics [37], which works according to topography or soil
    variability, ultimately improves the water use efficiency. C. Fertilizer A fertilizer
    is a natural or chemical substance that can provide important nutrients for the
    growth and fertility of plants. Plants mainly need three key macronutrients: nitrogen
    (N) for leaf growth; phosphorus (P) for root, flowers, and fruit development;
    potassium (K) for stem growth and water movement [38]. Any sort of nutrients deficiency
    or applying them improperly can be seriously harmful for the plant health. More
    importantly, excessive use of fertilizer not only results in financial losses
    but also creates harmful impacts to the soil and environment by depleting the
    soil quality, poisoning ground water, and contributing to global climate changes.
    Overall, crops absorb less than half the nitrogen applied as fertilizer, while
    remaining either emitted to the atmosphere or lost as run off. Unbalanced use
    of fertilizer leads to an imbalance in both soil nutrient levels and global climate
    as, reportedly, around 80% of the world’s deforestation has occurred due to agricultural
    practices alone [39]. Fertilization under smart agriculture helps to precisely
    estimate the required dose of nutrients, ultimately minimize their negative effects
    on the environment. Fertilization requires site-specific soil nutrient level measurements
    based on various factors, such as crop type, soil type, soil absorption capability,
    product yield, fertility type and utilization rate, weather condition, etc. The
    reason is that the measurement of soil nutrient level is not only expensive but
    also time consuming, as, typically, investigations of soil samples at each location
    are required. To better depict this discussion, figure 4, summarizes the major
    inputs, processes and resultant outputs of smart agriculture. FIGURE 4. Some key
    inputs, processes involved and possible outputs of smart farming. Show All New
    IoT-based fertilizing approaches help to estimate the spatial patterns of nutrients
    requirements with a higher accuracy and minimum labor requirements [40], [41].
    For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) uses aerial/satellite
    images to monitor crop nutrient status [42], [43]. Basically, NDVI is based on
    the reflection of visible and near-infrared light from vegetation and is used
    to estimate the crop health, vegetation vigor, and density, further contributing
    to assess the soil nutrient level. Such precise implementation can significantly
    improve the fertilizer efficiency, simultaneously reducing the side effects to
    the environment. Many recent enabling technologies, like GPS accuracy [44], geo
    mapping [45], Variable Rate Technology (VRT) [46], [47], and autonomous vehicles
    [48], are strongly contributing to IoT-based smart fertilization. Other than precision
    fertilization, fertigation [49] and chemigation [50], [51] are other benefits
    of IoT. In these methods, water-soluble matters, such as fertilizers, soil amendments,
    and pesticides, can be applied through the irrigation system. Although, these
    methods are not new to agriculture and have been applied over last three decades,
    their precise use with real results has been witnessed only with IoT integration
    [52], [53]. Based on recent outcomes, fertigation is considered as the best management
    practice to improve the effectiveness of many agriculture matters; most importantly,
    it can be integrated with IoT-based smart farming infrastructure seamlessly. D.
    Crop Disease and Pest Management The Great Famine, also known as the Irish Potato
    Famine, in which approximately one million Irish people died around 1950, resulted
    due to crop failure and yield reduction caused by “potato blight” disease [54].
    Even today, corn growers in the US and southern Canada are facing an economic
    loss of approximately one billion USD due to “southern corn leaf blight” disease
    [55]. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) estimates that 20–40% of global
    crop yields are lost annually due to pests and diseases [56]. To control such
    vast production losses, pesticides and other agrochemicals became an important
    component of the agriculture industry during the last century. It is estimated
    that, in each year, around half a million tons of pesticide are used in the US
    alone, while more than two-million tons are used globally [57]. Most of these
    pesticides are harmful to human and animal health, leaving severe, even irreversible,
    impact to the environment, ultimately causing significant contamination to entire
    ecosystems [58], [59]. Recent IoT based intelligent devices, such as wireless
    sensors, robots and drones are allowing the growers to slash pesticide uses significantly
    by precisely spotting crop enemies. Compared to traditional calendar or prescription
    based pest control procedures, modern IoT-based pest management provides real-time
    monitoring, modeling, disease forecasting, hence proving more effective [60],
    [61]. Generally, the reliability of crop disease monitoring and pest management
    depends on three aspects: sensing, evaluating, and treatment. The advanced disease
    and pest recognition approaches are based on image processing in which raw images
    are acquired throughout the crop area using field sensors, UAVs, or remote sensing
    satellites. Usually, remote sensing imagery covers large areas and, hence, offers
    higher efficiency with lower cost. On the other hand, field sensors are capable
    to support more functions in collecting data, like environment sampling, plant
    health, and pest situations, in every corner throughout the crop cycle. For example,
    IoT-based automated traps [62], [63] can capture, count, and even characterize
    insect types, further uploading data to the Cloud for detailed analysis, which
    is not possible through remote sensing. Approaches like vehicle precise spray
    and automatic VRT chemigation [64], commonly used under smart fertilization, can
    also be utilized for disease treatment and other pesticide applications. Moreover,
    the advancement of robotic technology offers new solutions. When equipping an
    agricultural robot with multispectral sensing devices and precision spraying nozzles,
    it can locate and deal with pest problems more precisely under the manipulation
    of a remote IoT disease management system. This IoT-based pest management system
    has many advantages, as it can reduce the overall expenditures while, at the same
    time, support the restoration of the natural climate. For example, recently, it
    has been found that yields of many crop types are facing severe threat due to
    the lack of pollination [65], [66]. In fact, the pollination is being affected
    due to bee colony collapse disorder resulting from the uncontrolled pesticides.
    E. Yield Monitoring, Forecasting, and Harvesting Yield monitoring is the mechanism
    used to analyze various aspects corresponding to agricultural yield, like grain
    mass flow, moisture content, and harvested grain quantity. It helps to accurately
    assess by recording the crop yield and moisture level to estimate, how well the
    crop performed and what to do next. Yield monitoring is considered an essential
    part of precision farming not only at the time of harvest but even before that,
    as monitoring the yield quality plays a crucial role. Yield quality depends on
    many factors, e.g. sufficient pollination with good quality pollen especially
    when predicting seed yields under changing environmental conditions [67]–[69].
    Currently, when we are dealing with more open markets, buyers around the world
    become more particular about fruit quality; hence, effective production depends
    on the right fruit size to the right market at the right time [13]. Crop forecasting
    is an art to predict the yield and production (tons/ha) before the harvest takes
    place. This forecasting helps the farmer for near-future planning and decision
    making. Furthermore, analyzing the yield quality and its maturity is another critical
    factor which enables the determination of the right time for harvesting. This
    monitoring covers various development stages and uses fruit conditions like its
    color, size, etc., for this purpose. Predicting the right harvesting time not
    only helps to maximize the crop quality and production but also provides an opportunity
    to adjust the management strategy. Although, harvesting is the last stage of this
    process, proper scheduling can make a clear difference. To obtain the real benefits
    from crops, farmers need to know when these crops are actually ready to harvest.
    Figure 5 represents a snapshot of a farm area network (FAN) that can portrait
    the whole farm to the farmer in real time. FIGURE 5. An IoT based farm area network
    (FAN). Show All A yield monitor, developed in [70], can be installed on any harvester
    combine and linked with the mobile app FarmRTX, which displays live harvest data
    and uploads it automatically to the manufacturer’s web-based platform. This app
    has the ability to generate high-quality yield maps and share these maps with
    an agronomist, and the farmer also has the option to export to other farm management
    software to analyze them. To estimate the production and quality of yield precisely,
    the measurement of fruit growth can be highly beneficial. This idea is used in
    [71], where authors considered the fruit growth as the most basic and relevant
    parameter to estimate that how well the crop is progressing. Satellite images
    can be a good option to monitor the yield of crops with vast areas. This method
    is utilized in [72], where authors used Sentinel-1A Interferometric images to
    map the rice crop yield and intensity in Myanmar. As we mentioned earlier in this
    section, fruit size always plays a critical role to estimate its maturation, making
    decisions regarding harvesting, and targeting the right market, for this purpose,
    color (RGB) depth images are used in [73] to track the different fruit conditions
    in mango farms. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used in [74] to monitor
    the shrinking of papayas, especially during drying conditions. SECTION III. Advanced
    Agricultural Practices Adopting the novel methods to enhance the quality and quantity
    of food is not something new, as humans have been doing this for centuries. Initially,
    we tried to enhance the crop production by focusing on seed variety, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. Soon it was realized that these conventional ways were not adequate
    enough to fit this demand gap; hence, agriculture scientists have begun thinking
    of other alternatives, like bioengineered (BE) foods. BE foods, also known as
    genetically modified (GM) or genetically engineered (GE) foods, are foods produced
    by introducing changes into their DNA using the methods of genetic engineering.
    However, several studies highlight their serious effects on human health, including
    infertility, disruption in immune system, accelerated aging, faulty insulin regulations,
    etc. [75], [76]. All these and many other similar technologies did not receive
    much popularity and acceptance in society because people prefer bio and organic
    food. In this regards, massive research has been conducted for decades in which
    sensors and IoT-based technologies are helping to improve conventional agriculture
    processes to enhance yield production without, or with minimum, effect on its
    originality. For this purpose, new sophisticated and more controlled environments
    are projected to tackle the above-mentioned issues. The importance and involvement
    of new technologies is more critical, as we are moving toward more cultured and
    urban farming. In fact, it would not be incorrect for one to say that the success
    of these advanced practices is in doubt without using sensor-based technologies.
    A. Greenhouse Farming Greenhouse farming is considered the oldest method of smart
    farming. Although, the idea of growing plants in controlled environment is not
    new as found since Roman times but it gained popularity in 19th century where
    largest greenhouses were built in France, Netherlands and Italy. Further, the
    practice was accelerated in the mid-20th century and highly promoted in countries
    that facing harsh weather conditions [77]. Crops grown indoors are very less affected
    by environment; most importantly, they are not limited to receiving light only
    during the daytime. As a result, the crops that traditionally could only be grown
    under suitable conditions or in certain parts of the world are now being growing
    anytime and anywhere. This was the actual time in which sensors and communication
    devices started to support various agriculture applications genuinely. The success
    and production of various crops under such controlled environment depend on many
    factors, like accuracy of monitoring parameters, structure of shed, covering material
    to control wind effects, ventilation system, decision support system, etc. A detailed
    analysis is provided in [78], where all these factors, their impacts, and how
    wireless sensors can help for all this are considered. Precise monitoring of environment
    parameters is the most critical task in modern greenhouses, where several measurement
    points of various parameters are required to control and ensure the local climate.
    In [79], an IoT-based prototype is proposed to monitor the greenhouses where MicaZ
    nodes are used to measure the inside parameters like humidity, temperature, light,
    and pressure. B. Vertical Farming The world needs more farmable lands to fulfill
    increased food demands, but reality is that one-third arable land was lost during
    the last four decades due to erosion and pollution [80], [81]. Unfortunately,
    current agricultural practices based on industrial farming are damaging the soil
    quality far faster than nature can rebuild it. Overall, it is estimated that erosion
    rates from cultivated fields is 10 to 40 times greater than the soil formation
    rates [82]. Considering the reduction of arable land issues, it could be a disaster
    for food production in the near future with current agriculture practices. Further,
    as we mentioned, 70% of fresh water is only used for agriculture purpose, which
    can increase the burden on existing limited water reservoirs. Vertical Farming
    (VF) is an answer to meet the challenges of land and water shortages. VF in the
    form of urban agriculture offers an opportunity to stack the plants in a more
    controlled environment resulting in, most importantly, significant reduction in
    resource consumption. By following this method, we can increase the production
    multiple times, as only a fraction of ground surface is required (depending on
    the number of stacks) as compared to traditional agriculture practices. Not only
    for ground surface, this system is highly efficient in terms of other resources,
    as well. For example, according to Mirai, a Japan based indoor farm developer
    presented the figures regarding a Japanese farm comprised of 25,000 square meters.
    The figures are highly encouraging, as it is producing 10,000 heads of lettuce
    per day (double the production when compared with traditional methods) and is,
    most importantly, consuming 40% less energy and up to 99% reduced water consumption
    compared to outdoor fields [83]. Aerofarms, a leader in VF, growing agricultural
    products with upto 390 times higher yields while utilizing 95% less water at Newark
    [84]. Under this farming method, many parameters are important, but CO2 measurements
    are most critical; hence, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR) CO2 sensors play a critical
    role to track and control the conditions in vertical farms. Boxed Gascard, developed
    by Edinburgh Sensors [85], is especially designed by considering such an environment,
    which employs a pseudo dual beam NDIR measurement system to enhance the stability
    and reduced optical complexity. Human hands are not required to touch the crops
    at any stage when following the IoT-connected vertical farm; this is the claim
    made by Mint Controls [86] developers who offer a wide range of solutions, like
    waste containers and sensors and their integration for various VF applications.
    C. Hydroponic In order to enhance the benefits of greenhouse farming, agriculture
    experts moved forward another step and provided the idea of hydroponic, a subset
    of hydroculture in which plants are grown without soil. Hydroponic is based on
    an irrigation system in which balanced nutrients are dissolved in water and crop
    roots stay in that solution; in some cases, roots can be supported by medium like
    perlite or gravel. When combining hydroponics with VF, a farm of 100 sq. meters
    can produce the crop equivalent to 1 acre of traditional farm, most importantly
    upto 95% less water and fertilizers utilization and without pesticides/herbicides
    [87]. Currently, available systems and sensors e.g. [88], [89] are not only used
    to monitor a range of parameters and take readings at predefined intervals but,
    also, the measurements are stored so that can be used to analyze and diagnostic
    purpose later on. Under this application, the precision of nutrient measurements
    is crucial, as such, a highly reliable wireless control system for tomato hydroponics
    is proposed in [90] in which they focused on various communication standards that
    are least effected by plants’ presence and their growth. The monitoring of solution
    contents and their precision is most critical under this method; for this purpose,
    many systems are offered to check the presence of contents considering the plant
    demands. In [91] a wireless-sensor-based prototype is proposed to deliver a turn-key
    solution for the hydroponic cultivation which offers real-time measurements for
    soilless indoor growing. Further, a compact sensor module is presented in [92],
    which uses oscillator circuits to measure the presence and concentrations of various
    nutrients and water levels. D. Phenotyping The previously discussed smart methods
    look more promising for the future of agriculture, as they are already being used
    to produce different crop products under precise environments. Other than these,
    a few advanced techniques are under experiment to further enhance the crop capabilities
    by controlling their limitations with the help of advanced sensing and communication
    technologies. Among these methods, the more prominent is phenotyping, which is
    based on emerging crop engineering, which links plant genomics with its ecophysiology
    and agronomy, as shows in Figure 6. The progress in molecular and genetic tools
    for various crop breeding was significant in the last decade. However, a quantitative
    analysis of the crop behavior, e.g. grain weight, pathogen resistance, etc., was
    limited due to the lack of efficient techniques and technologies that we can now
    enjoy. FIGURE 6. The process of phenotyping [96]. Show All Research investigations,
    completed in [93], conclude that plant phenotyping can be highly beneficial to
    investigate the quantitative characteristics, such as those are responsible for
    its growth, yield quality and quantity, and resistance capabilities to handle
    various stresses. Similarly, the role of sensing technologies and image-based
    phenotyping are highlighted in [94] and describes how these solutions can help
    to boost the progress not only for screening numerous biostimulants but also their
    role in understanding the mode of actions. Furthermore, an IoT-based phenotyping
    platform, CropQuant, is designed to monitor the crop and relevant trait measurements
    that can provide facility for crop breeding and digital agriculture [95]. Here,
    an automatic in-field control system was developed to process the data generated
    by platform. The provided trait analyses algorithms and machine-learning modeling
    help to explore the relation among the genotypes, phenotypes, and environment
    where it grows. SECTION IV. Major Equipment and Technologies Different from ancient
    farming, most of the tasks in modern, large-scale agriculture are being done by
    heavy and urbane equipment, such as tractors, harvesters, and other robots which
    are fully or partially supported by remote sensing and other communication technologies.
    In precision agriculture, when tasks like sowing, fertilizing, irrigation, and
    harvesting are being performed, the operating vehicles are equipped with GPS and
    GIS facilities so that they can work precisely, site-specifically, and autonomously.
    In fact, the idea of site-specific crop management is not possible without involving
    the recent advanced technologies. The success of precision agriculture is based
    on the accuracy of collected data, which is usually done in two ways [10]. The
    first entails the usage of multifunctional imaginary devices equipped with remote
    sensing platforms, such as satellites, agriculture airplanes, balloons, and UAVs;
    the second is from various types of sensors—those that are mostly deployed for
    specific purpose across various sites of our interest. The gathered data is identified
    with the precise location information by using GPS devices so that the site-specific
    treatment can be provided afterwards. Agriculture has transformed during the last
    few decades from small/medium farming operations to highly industrialized and
    commercial farming. This transition allows the leading corporations to treat agriculture
    like other industries, e.g., manufacturing where the measurements, data, and control
    are very important to provide a balance between costs and production in order
    to boost the profits. Accordingly, every aspect of agriculture that can be automated,
    digitally planned, and managed will benefit from IoT technologies and solutions.
    Based on this fact, efforts are being focused to offer more sophisticated tools
    such as agricultural robots to perform a range of activities, like planting, watering,
    weeding, picking, thinning, fertilizing, spraying, packing and transporting. This
    revolution is being driven not only due to the advancement of technology, but
    is also a result of factors like fear of losing the low-cost labor, most importantly
    need for better and cheaper food. Based on these facts, during the period of 2017
    to 2022, the global smart farming market is predicted to rise at a growth rate
    of 19.3% per year to touch $23.14 billion in 2022 [97]. Here it is worth mentioning
    that UAV/drones are generating and further expected to generate the highest revenue
    amongst all agricultural robots utilized in smart farming (UAVs are discussed
    in Section V). Evergreen demand for higher crop yield, increased incorporation
    of information and communication technology (ICT) in farming and the rapid global
    climatic changes are some of the major drivers resulting to such high market growth.
    Manufacturers in the market offer a variety of products and solutions, mostly
    based on sensors and efficient communication for a range of applications; a few
    are shown in figure 7. The key technologies and equipment’s that are currently
    available for this purpose are discussed in following. FIGURE 7. Selected IoT
    based products and prototypes for smart agriculture. Show All A. Wireless Sensors
    Among all the equipment for smart farming currently available in the market, wireless
    sensors are the most crucial and play a key role when it comes to collecting the
    crop conditions and other information. Wireless sensors are being used standalone
    wherever required, further integrated with almost every portion of advanced agricultural
    tools and heavy machinery, depending on application requirements. In the following,
    major sensor types are discussed according to their working procedure and purpose
    and the benefits they offer. 1) Acoustic Sensors Acoustic sensors offer a miscellaneous
    appliance in farm management, including soil cultivation, weeding, fruit harvesting,
    etc.; the main benefit of this technology is its low-cost solutions with fast
    response, especially when considering portable equipment. It functions by measuring
    the change in the noise level as the tool interacts with other materials, e.g.,
    soil particles [98]. Acoustic sensors are commonly used for pest monitoring and
    detection [99] and classifying the seed varieties according to their sound absorption
    spectra [100]. 2) Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA)-Based Sensors FPGA based
    sensors are starting to be used in agriculture recently due to their flexibility
    of reconfiguration. The major options where these can be employed include measuring
    real-time plant transpiration, irrigation, and humidity [101], [102]. However,
    their utilization in agriculture is in the early stages due to their limitations,
    such as size, cost, and power consumption. These sensors require more power; hence,
    they are not suitable for continuous monitoring, further high in cost even compromising
    on performance [103]. By overcoming these issues, FPGA-based sensors can offer
    satisfactory solutions according to specific application requirements. 3) Optical
    Sensors These sensors use light reflectance phenomena and help to measure soil
    organic substances, soil moisture and color, presence of minerals and their composition,
    clay content, etc. [104], [105]. These sensors test the soil’s ability to reflect
    light based on different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum. The changes occurred
    in wave reflections help to indicate the changes in soil density and other parameters.
    Fluorescence-based optical sensors are used for basic plant assessment, especially
    to supervise the fruit maturation [106]. Further, when integrating optical sensors
    with microwave scattering, it can be used for characterizing grove canopies, like
    olives and other similar crops [107]. 4) Ultrasonic Ranging Sensors Sensors of
    this category are considered a good choice being low cost, potential to operate
    in a variety of applications, and ease of use and adjustability, such as the sampling
    rate. Common uses are tank monitoring, spray distance measurement (e.g., boom
    height and width control in order to perform uniform spray coverage, object detection,
    and collision avoidance), and monitoring crop canopy [108], [109]. When combined
    with a camera, these sensors can then be used for the weed detection [110], where
    the heights of plants are identified using the ultrasonic sensors and the camera
    determines the weed and crop coverage. 5) Optoelectronic Sensors Optoelectronic
    sensors can differentiate plant type; hence, they help to detect weeds, herbicides,
    and other unwanted plants, especially in wide-row crops [111]. When combining,
    an optoelectronic sensor and location information, it can map the weed distribution
    and resolution [112]. Optoelectronic sensors are also capable of differentiating
    between vegetation and soil from their reflection spectra. 6) Airflow Sensors
    These sensors are capable of measuring soil air permeability and percentage of
    moisture and identifying soil structure to distinguish different types of soils.
    Measurements can be made at singular locations or dynamically while in motion,
    e.g., can be used on a fixed position or in mobile mode. The desired output is
    the pressure required to push a predetermined amount of air into the ground at
    a prescribed depth. It follows the procedure of various soil properties, including
    compaction, structure, and moisture levels, producing unique identifying signatures
    [113]. 7) Electrochemical Sensors These are mostly used to assess the significant
    soil characteristics to analyze the soil nutrient levels, such as pH [114]. The
    standard chemical soil analysis, which are mostly expensive and time consuming,
    can be easily substituted with these sensors. To be more precise, the macro and
    micro nutrients in the soil, salinity and pH [115], are measured using sensors
    of this nature. 8) Electromagnetic Sensors Electromagnetic sensors are used to
    record electrical conductivity and transient electromagnetic response, identify
    electrical response, and adjust variable rate applications in the actual situation.
    Sensors based on this technology use electric circuits to measure the capability
    of soil particles to conduct or accumulate electrical charge, which is mostly
    done by the following two methods: contact or non-contact [116]. Residual nitrates
    and organic matter in the soil can also be measured using the electromagnetic
    sensors, as done in [117]. 9) Mechanical Sensors Mechanical sensors assess the
    soil mechanical resistance (compaction) to indicate the variable level of compaction.
    The mechanical sensors enter or cut through the soil and record the force assessed
    by strain gauges or load cells [118]. A pressure unit is used to measure the soil’s
    mechanical resistance, which is actually the ratio of the force needed to go into
    the soil medium using the frontal part of the tool, actually engaged with the
    soil. 10) Mass Flow Sensors Category of this sensors are used for yield monitoring,
    as it provides the yield information by measuring the amount of grain flow, e.g.,
    when passing through the combine harvester. Sensing the mass flow of grain to
    determine the crop yield is not new, as it has been performed the last two decades
    [119]. The mass flow sensor is the most critical component, but, overall, the
    yield monitoring system consists of several other modules, like the grain moisture
    sensor, data storage device, and an internal software to analyze the data, which
    are within the interface provided in the John Deere tractors [120]. 11) Eddy Covariance-Based
    Sensors This type of sensors can be used for quantifying exchanges of carbon dioxide,
    water vapor, methane or other gases, and energy between the surface of the earth
    and the atmosphere. This method offers an accurate way to measure surface-atmosphere
    fluxes of energy and trace gas fluxes over a variety of ecosystems for, most importantly,
    agricultural applications [121]. Currently, the sensors based on this technology
    are preferred over other similar options, like the close chamber, due to high
    precision and its ability to measuring continuous flux over large areas [122].
    12) Soft Water Level-Based (SWLB) Sensors SWLB sensors are being utilized in agriculture
    catchments to characterize hydrological behaviors, such as water level and flow,
    at adjustable time-step acquisitions. This is done by measuring rainfalls, stream
    flows, and other water presence options [11], [123]. 13) Light Detection and Ranging
    (LIDAR) This technology is widely used in a range of agriculture applications,
    such as land mapping and segmentation, determining soil type, farm 3D modelling,
    monitoring erosion and soil loss, and yield forecasting [124]–[126]. LiDAR is
    also commonly used to obtain dynamic measurement information regarding fruit-tree
    leaf area, and, when combined with GPS, it can produce a 3D map [127]. Moreover,
    this technology is often used when estimating the biomass of various crops and
    trees [128]. 14) Telematics Sensors Telematics sensors support telecommunication
    between two places—more precisely, among two vehicles when considering the agriculture-based
    applications. Telemetry sensors are used to collect data from remote locations
    (especially inaccessible points), operations of machines that report on how the
    components are working, and record location and travel routes to avoid visiting
    the same patch [129]. These services enable farm managers to record and store
    all information related to farm operations automatically, which maximizes the
    utilization of environmental benefits, further can minimize threats like farm
    equipment theft as utilized in [130], [131]. 15) Remote Sensing Sensors belong
    to this category are used to capture and store the geographic information, further
    analyze, manipulate, manage and present all types of spatial or geographical data.
    Similar to LiDAR, these sensors also found significant use in agriculture applications
    including crop assessment, forecasting yield dates, yield modelling and forecasting,
    identification of plants and pests, land cover and degradation mapping etc [132]–[134].
    Argos sensor is one of leading example, a satellite-based sensor system used to
    collect, process and disseminates environmental data from fixed and mobile platforms
    worldwide [135]. Moreover, automatic packet reporting system (APRS) is being integrated
    to report telemetry data through satellite communication [136]. Table 1 lists
    a few sensors to provide the idea about their possible uses and the environment
    where they can be placed. TABLE 1 Some Selected Sensors and Their Possible Uses
    in IoT Based Agriculture B. IoT Based Tractors As rural labor resources have started
    to come under stress due to the expansion of the crop industry, tractors and other
    automatic heavy machinery started to enter the agriculture sector. Where available,
    an average size tractor can work 40 times faster with significantly less expenses
    than traditional farm labor [157]. To fulfill the continuously increasing demands,
    agricultural-based equipment manufacturers, like John Deere, Hello Tractors, Case
    IH and CNH (New Holland), have started to provide better solutions focusing on
    the grower’s requirements. With the advancement of technology, most of these manufacturers
    are offering tractors with automatic-driven and even Cloud-computing capabilities.
    This technology is not new, as self-driving tractors have been in the market even
    before semi-autonomous cars. One of the main advantages of self-driving tractors
    is their ability to avoid revisiting the same area or row by reducing the overlap
    even less than an inch. In addition, they can make very precise turns without
    a driver’s physical presence. This facility offers better precision with reduced
    errors, especially when spraying insecticide or targeting weeds; those are mostly
    unavoidable when a human controls the machinery. Although, at the moment, no fully
    autonomous tractor is available in market, many researchers and manufactures are
    hardly working to mature the technology. Based on current progress and future
    demands of high-tech tractors, it is predicated that around 700,000 tractors equipped
    with facilities like autosteer or tractor guidance will be sold in 2028 [158],
    while the same study expects that around 40,000 unmanned, fully-autonomous (level
    5) tractors will be sold in 2038 [159]. When talking about such cultured machines,
    most farmers can’t afford to own them while most of the tractor service providers
    and manufacturers operate well below their potential. Considering the challenge,
    Hello Tractor has developed a solution to sort these issues. The company has developed
    a low-cost monitoring device that can be placed on any tractor, provides powerful
    software and analytics tools [160]. The benefits of this device are twofold- on
    one side it ensures that overall cost of tractor remains affordable for the most
    of growers while at the same time it monitors the condition of the tractor and
    reports if any problems occur. The software connects tractor’s owner to farmers
    in need of tractor services, just like Uber for tractors. Another major example
    is Case IH’s Magnum series [161] tractor which uses on board video cameras and
    LiDAR sensors for object detection and collision avoidance. Recently, Case IH
    used this tractor to plant soybeans by following the concept of autonomous tractors.
    In another development made by standards group ETSI where world’s first tractor
    connected to a car in France, using IoT [162] to control the accidents due to
    farm vehicles. After collecting all the important crop data, the next step is
    pushing computing from the Cloud to the edge, as John Deere [163] wants. In their
    proposed system, an analytics engine works locally on the farmer’s tractor rather
    than in the Cloud in order to adjust the local inputs. For this purpose, they
    considered all the existing analytics and recommendations to modify the current
    data in real time depending on the field conditions. Based on this phenomenon,
    the manufacturer is bringing their tractors to next level by connecting their
    machine to the Internet and creating a method to display the information wherever
    farmer wants to see it. C. Harvesting Robots Harvesting is the most critical stage
    during the production process, as this last phase dictates the crop’s output and,
    ultimately, its success. In some crops, this is done a single time while, in some
    others, performed several times, even on a daily basis, as crop reaches a certain
    stage. Harvesting the crop at the right time is very critical, as doing so either
    early or late can affect the production significantly. When talking about the
    labor, it is estimated that the US faces a $3.1 billion decline in crop production
    on a yearly basis due to labor shortage [164]. Not only this, but, according to
    a study conducted by the United States Department of Agriculture, overall 14 %
    of farm costs go to wages and labor costs, while it can be upto 39% in some labor
    intensive farms [165]. Considering the worth of this stage and labor issues, farm
    experts expect that involvement of agriculture robotics may not only ease the
    labor pressure but also provide the flexibility to harvest whenever needed. In
    order to automate the harvesting process and make it more precise, the role of
    robots has been increasing over the recent decades. Considering the robot services,
    many researchers have done intensive research in order to mature the sensitivity
    of fruit detection, its shape, size, color, and localization [166]–[169]. Automatic
    harvesting of fruits requires deep investigation of sophisticated sensors that
    are capable of collecting precise and unambiguous information of that particular
    crop and fruit. The task of detecting the right target in natural scenes is not
    simple since most of the fruits are occluded partially—sometimes even fully—under
    the leaves and branches or are overlapped with other fruits [170]. Here, most
    of the prominent studies found in regard to this purpose are deeply based on computer
    vision, image processing, and machine learning techniques. This process needs
    very specialized and sophisticated tools to differentiate the fruit conditions,
    as there are more than sixty shapes, sizes, and colors for a pepper alone when
    it is ready to harvest. Considering such complexity, many robots are being developed
    for specific crops. Some of the leading robots being used for crop harvesting
    include SW 6010 [171] and Octinion [172] for strawberries, SWEEPER robot [173]
    for peppers, and FFRobot [174] for tree-based fruits like apples which can pick
    up to 10,000 fruits per hour. Strawberries are one of the most consumed fruits,
    available mostly throughout the year while labor is the major contributor to the
    high cost of this fruit, especially during harvesting and packaging stages [175].
    As the strawberry farms are grown mostly under greenhouse systems hence the harvesting
    robots are designed to move on defined paths like rails where the translational
    motion is restricted and robots can move backward and forward only. Robots developed
    by Agrobot are able to collect strawberries along the side of strawberry plant
    rows in the field, further packed by human operators [176]. For example, SW6010
    by Agrobot is a specialized and semi-automatic robot towards the specific task
    of strawberry harvesting [177]. Tektu T-100 is an all-electric rechargeable strawberry
    harvester run silently with zero emission inside the poly-tunnels [178]. The installed
    pickers are able to position over the crop rows and gather the fruit quickly and
    efficiently, directly into punnets. D. Communication in Agriculture Communication
    and reporting the information on a timely basis are considered the backbone of
    precision agriculture. The real purpose cannot be achieved unless a firm, reliable,
    and secure connection among various participating objects is provided. To achieve
    communication reliability, telecom operators can play a crucial role in the agricultural
    sector. If we truly want to implement IoT on a large scale in the agriculture
    industry, we have to provide a suitably large architecture. Here, the factors
    like cost, coverage, energy consumption, and reliability are critical and have
    to be considered before choosing the mean of communication. Low-energy networks
    can provide connectivity only on one site and mostly do not offer services in
    remote areas where sensed data need to be transmitted to the farm management system
    (FMS). Depending on availability, scalability and application requirements, various
    communication modes and technologies are being used for this purpose, most common
    are discussed here, 1) Cellular Communication Cellular communication modes from
    2G to 4G can be suitable, depending on the purpose and bandwidth requirement;
    however, the reliability, and even availability, of a cellular network in rural
    areas is a major concern. To tackle this, data transmission via satellite is another
    option, but, here, the cost of this communication mode is very high, which makes
    it not suitable for small- and medium-sized farms. The choice of communication
    mode also depends on application requirements, such as some farms required sensors
    that can operate with low data rate but need to work for long periods hence demand
    long battery life. For such scenarios, a new range of Low Power Wide Area Network
    (LPWAN) is considered a better solution for cellular connectivity, not only in
    terms of long battery life but also a larger connectivity range with affordable
    rates (2 to 15 USD per year) [179]. Currently, crop and pasture management are
    two of the main applications where LPWAN networks are highly suitable, and, further
    considering its success, it can be utilized in many other farming-related uses.
    Besides WAN connectivity option, many short range and medium level communications
    are being used in mesh networks [180]. For example, a mesh-network of sensor nodes
    collects data and transmits it to the gateway which is located somewhere in the
    same area. The gateway further sends this data to the farm management system using
    the WAN network. The communication technologies used within the mesh networks
    vary e.g. Bluetooth and Zigbee can be used to provide connectivity for peer-to-peer
    wireless communications. From here, the sensed data forwarded to the FMS, which
    gathers and analyses the information about all the activities happening at different
    parts even the historical data regarding the weather and climate updates, economic,
    products being used and their specifications etc, in short making it decision
    farming. It is important to mention that, the communication technology has its
    own worth but the FMS also plays a critical role which must be custom designed
    considering the specific application requirements. Generally, based on communication
    data rates and power consumption, wireless sensors for agriculture applications
    are divided in three broad categories as shown in table 2. TABLE 2 Data and Power
    Specifications of Wireless Sensors Commonly Used for Agriculture Applications
    2) Zigbee Zigbee is primarily designed for a wide range of applications especially
    to replace existing non-standard technologies. Depending on the application requirements,
    the devices based on this protocol can be one of three types including Coordinator,
    Router and End User. Further, three different topologies are supported by Zigbee
    networks named, Start, Cluster Tree and Mesh [34]. Based on these characteristics,
    and further considering the agriculture application requirements, Zigbee can play
    vital role especially targeting the greenhouse environment where usually short
    range communications are required. During monitoring the various parameters, the
    real time data from the sensor node is transferred through Zigbee to end server.
    For the applications like, irrigation and fertilization, Zigbee modules are networked
    for communication, e.g. in drip irrigation used to monitor soil contents like
    moisture. Further, SMS is forwarded to the farmer to update about the field data
    where GSM is required at long distance or Bluetooth module can help at the shorter
    distances. 3) Bluetooth Bluetooth is a wireless communication standard that connects
    small-head devices together over shorter distances usually cooperating in a close
    proximity. Due to its advantages of low power requirements, easy to use and low
    cost, this technology is being utilized in many smart farming applications. Further,
    Bluetooth making advancements in many IoT systems with the release of Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) or commonly known as Bluetooth Smart. The study conducted in
    [181] which tests Bluetooth and PLC (programmable logic controller) with ICS (integrated
    control strategy), timer control and soil moisture control approach for smart
    irrigation. The target of this study is to find an optimum utilization of water
    and energy consumption for various greenhouse or field applications. A moisture
    and temperature sensor based on BLE is developed in [182] especially focusing
    on the agriculture environments and weather conditions of crop fields. Here the
    reason of choosing BLE for communication purpose is due to its inherent support
    for smart phone accessibility. Further, a similar effort is done in [183] where
    a new sensor node is designed to monitor ambient light and temperature employing
    BLE communication protocol preferable for IoT based agriculture applications.
    Other than short range, WiFi is utilized whenever LAN communications are required
    in smart agriculture. Along short range connectivity, WiFi is utilized whenever
    LAN communications are required in smart agriculture. Study presented in [184]
    investigates a remote monitoring system using WiFi, where the sensor nodes were
    based on WSN802G modules. The deployed nodes communicate wirelessly with a central
    server, which is responsible to collect and store the monitored data and further
    allow displaying the information after required analysis. 4) LoRa LoRa wireless
    technology is a long-range, low-power platform used extensively in IoT applications.
    Being low in power consumption, it offers LPWAN connectivity between the wireless
    sensors and the Cloud. It has proved itself much more effective and reliable than
    Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, etc. especially in restaurants or kitchen environments. Sensors
    based on LoRa can be installed in smaller devices for reliable monitoring. Most
    importantly, LoRa signals can penetrate thick and insulated objects, even buildings,
    and can, hence, cover a larger network area. Overall, LoRa-based networks perform
    higher in terms of lifespan and, at the same time, pose reduced maintenance and
    upkeep burden [185]. Considering the advantages, many researchers tested this
    communication method in kitchens, storage rooms, and transport systems. In [186],
    a test was conducted in a warehouse with a capacity to store 40 tons of apples,
    and results show that it provided full coverage, where the temperature and airflow
    readings transferred successfully with a packet rate of more the 96%. Similarly,
    [187] presents a system to achieve information traceability in the grain transport
    system to ensure the food quality by monitoring the temperature and humidity levels.
    5) Sigfox Sigfox is also used to provide network connectivity services to low-powered
    objects as “things” required. It is based on narrowband or ultra-narrowband technology;
    hence, it takes very narrow chunks of spectrum and changes the phase of the carrier
    radio wave to encode the data. Based on these characteristics, it offers high
    level performance, even if 100 sensors need to transmit data at the same time,
    as experiments done in [188]. Figure 8 gives an idea that how end-to-end communication
    possibilities can be divided in various layers to interact with each other in
    order to provide the services for smart agriculture. FIGURE 8. End to end communication
    for smart farming. Show All E. Smartphones Despite its availability concerns for
    remote fields, cellular communication is the major technology in rural areas;
    mobile phones are a very common source and primary mode of communication whenever
    the need arises to contact or update most of the farming community. Recent advancements
    in the smartphone industry have resulted in sharp price decreases, making this
    industry more attractive, especially to the smallholder growers in remote areas.
    The rapid spread of cellular networks in developing countries offers the opportunity
    to reach remote and dispersed farms with improved services. Mobile-phone-based
    agriculture services (m-services) are far from their assumed potential; according
    to an analysis done by GSM Association, only at 8 per cent [189]. However, the
    flexibility and functionality, such as the camera, GPS, microphone accelerometer,
    proximity, and gyroscope, attract the IT experts, and they are developing more
    appealing mobile apps that consider the farmer’s various needs [190], [191]. The
    conclusion of FAO’s 10-year investigations states that “solid information is needed
    regarding the impact of previous initiatives, including lessons learned, in order
    to inform the design and approach of future efforts” [192]. Interestingly, the
    smartphone is the first device that comes to mind when planning how to achieve
    this goal, especially considering the often dispersed and poorly serviced areas.
    Recent years have seen rapid expansion of research, with researchers conducting
    a growing number of studies and developing various models to highlight the scope
    of smartphone crop applications. These researchers mostly belong to developing
    nations, as proposed systems are based primarily in countries like Kenya [193],
    [194], Ghana [195], [196], Nigeria [197], [198], Mali [199], Uganda [200], and
    Zimbabwe [201], [202]. Although, the scope of smartphone utilization in agriculture
    has been more commonly observed in Africa, experiments in countries like Cameroon
    [203], China [204], [205], Turkey [206], [207], and India [208], [209] are also
    increasing. Analysing the success of m-services depends on many factors. One of
    the most comprehensive studies regarding the use of mobile phones for various
    agriculture applications was conducted to review all the important factors [210].
    This study concludes that the service will be of no effect if the developer of
    the application does not truly understand the farmer needs. Obviously, the most
    important factor for such applications is that the farmer should access and use
    them. In other words, an easy-to-use, free or low-cost app that supports various
    languages could attract the farmer’s attention. In addition, developers should
    study and consider the relevant factors before making their suggestions. For example,
    market prices are of great interest to farmers, but would be of no use in cases
    of bad roads and unavailability of proper transport vehicles. The developers should
    target the problems of the wider community instead of focusing only on farmers,
    considering the transporters, brokers, and other agriculture experts as well.
    Unfortunately, most of the applications are developed on growers’ perceptions,
    instead of using independent and verified market data. For this purpose, the developer
    should not only focus on the data retrieved by independent investigators but also
    assess it under various usage patterns covering longer durations. Table 3 lists
    smartphone based sensors that are attracting the researchers to utilize them for
    various agriculture purposes. While, last column provide some of the references
    where these sensors have been used. Further, Table 4 includes some of the important
    mobile apps developed for various agriculture applications along their features
    and achievements. TABLE 3 Smartphone Based Sensors That Being Used in Various
    Agriculture Applications TABLE 4 Selected Important Smartphone Applications for
    Various Agriculture Applications F. Cloud Computing Precision agriculture is showing
    its potential and benefits by improving agricultural operations through better
    data-driven decision making. However, to continue this success, precision agriculture
    not only requires better technology and tools to process data efficiently but
    also at a reasonable cost such that the received data can be used to make field
    decisions efficiently. For this purpose, farmers can use Cloud services to access
    information from predictive analysis institutes so that they can choose the right
    product available according to their specific requirements. Cloud computing offers
    an edge to farmers to use knowledge-based repositories that contain a treasure
    of information and experiences related to farming practices as well as on equipment
    options available in the market with the necessary details. In most cases, all
    this comes along with expert advice from a wide range of sources (for example,
    on farming and the processing of agricultural products). To make it more effective,
    the scenario can be extended further to include access to consumer databases,
    supply chains, and billing systems. Surely, moving towards Cloud-based services
    offer opportunities to explore advancements, but it comes with new challenges,
    as well. First, a vast range of sensors are being developed and used in precision
    agriculture, each of which has its own data format and semantics. Secondly, most
    of the decision-support systems are application-specific while, on the other hand,
    a farmer can be in the need of accessing various systems for a specific application,
    e.g., soil monitoring. Considering both of these cases, the Cloud-based decision-support
    system not only needs to handle the diversity of data and their formats but also
    must be able to configure these formats for different applications. An open Cloud-based
    system has been established by AgJunction [243] which gathers and disseminates
    the data on a form from different precise agriculture controllers, leading to
    a decrease in costs and environmental impacts. Furthermore, “Akisai” Cloud [244],
    proposed by Fujitsu, focuses on food and agricultural industries and incorporates
    information communication technology for increasing the food supply in the coming
    years. Similarly, SourceTrace developed and offering Cloud-based mobile applications
    to provide visibility and relations between farms and markets, further tracking
    the value chain at the source, e.g., ’eService Everywhere’ [245]. An important
    note about their applications is that, during the development, they considered
    the farms’ remoteness and low bandwidth environments. Figure 9 presents possible
    infrastructure and relationship scenario of fluid computing including Edge, Mist
    and Fog for smart agriculture. FIGURE 9. Fluid computing infrastructure for smart
    farming. Show All SECTION V. UAVs in Agriculture Recently, the IoT has made remarkable
    progress in many industries, including farming sectors like poultry, fishing,
    etc. but when we talk about agriculture, the communication facilities like base
    stations or Wi-Fi are very limited, which prevents the growth of the IoT in this
    sector. Such communication infrastructure and related facilities are even worst
    in developing counties and rural areas, which is one of the major hurdles when
    introducing the IoT in the agriculture industry. The data acquired through the
    wireless sensors cannot be transmitted in the absence of reliable communication
    infrastructure. In such a scenario, UAVs offer an alternative, as they visit and
    communicate with the wireless sensors spread over large areas in order to harvest
    data for further processing and analysis. Furthermore, UAVs, better known as drones,
    fitted with high-resolution cameras and precise sensors, can be flown over thousands
    of hectares of farms. The role of surveillance in all agriculture applications
    is highly critical, especially in forestry and crop monitoring due to the need
    to cover large areas [246]. Therefore, a fast, low-cost, real-time, and large-scale
    surveillance supported with an accurate data acquisition and transmission facility
    is crucial for agriculture production. Currently, mostly two options are used
    to obtain aerial images of a field area: satellite and airplanes. Both of them
    are good for a macro view of a landscape, but they face serious issues in terms
    of quality when it comes to micro views. These macro-view images are not good
    in resolution and cannot offer the image quality which is required during the
    analyses and decision making. Secondly, not only the resolution but visiting frequency
    also matters and, through both of these, it is not simple to take and collect
    images frequently (on average, four times a month [247]). Another serous issue
    is that these operate above the cloud level where there is a strong possibility
    that both are obstructed in bad weather. When we talk about UAVs that provide
    an “eye in sky”, we can overcome— or even eliminate— the above mentioned issues
    when we consider the micro views. The quality of images taken through UAVs depends
    on the attached camera’s resolution—normally dozens of times better than satellite
    images—and, most importantly, we can adjust according to application requirements.
    More specifically, UAVs supports faster and better NDVI to assess crop conditions,
    like weed mapping, leaf assessments, etc., and provide immediate feedback so that
    farmers can take timely actions. Similarly, UAVs are better in terms of frequency,
    even if requires multiple times in a single day, and are also the option least
    affected by weather conditions, unless it is raining. Due to the mentioned advantages,
    UAVs are considered the future of precision agriculture, and this is the reason
    they are generating the highest revenue amongst all agricultural robots developed
    for precision agriculture. According to quoted figures by a report published by
    FAO in 2018, it is estimated that the agriculture drone-related market to be worth
    USD 32.4 billion [248]. The current condition of the entire field is one of the
    most valuable pieces of information to obtain in the precision program. With the
    help of this collected data, a farmer can spot problems early and rapidly; hence,
    appropriate interventions can be applied. Agricultural drones represent a new
    way to collect field-level data; the results are on-demand whenever and wherever
    needed, as the drone can be easily and quickly deployed. Most importantly, it
    is not all about their hardware but the convenience, quality, and utility they
    are offering, as the drone-enabled surveillance offers the real facility to have
    an idea of what is happening in the farm fields at that moment. The UAVs, used
    for agricultural applications usually fall into two categories: fixed-wing and
    multi-rotor drones [249] (figure 10). Although both are available in various ranges
    in terms of cost, payload capacity and mostly distinguished based on hardware
    differences. For example, when it is required to cover a large area, fixed-wing
    drones are suggested due to their long-range flight capacity, most importantly
    they are crash tolerant e.g senseFly’s eBee SQ [250] and DATAhawk [251]. On the
    other hand, multi-rotor drones are more common due to their easy and faster set
    up as can take off and land vertically. Multi-rotors actually have many advantages
    over the fixed wings as they are easier to operate, require no advance wind planning
    and have the ability to fly more precisely. Moreover, in scenarios where low altitude
    flight is required in order to capture extremely detailed images, which is more
    common in agriculture applications then the multi-rotor are considered the better
    choice, some major examples belongs to this type are DJI Matrice 200 [252] and
    Introducing Scout by American Robotics [253] which considered a fully autonomous
    drone for daily agriculture scouting. FIGURE 10. Types of agricultural drones.
    Show All Generally, drones collect information through the light reflected by
    the ground it is maneuvering, over, either from soil or plants. For agricultural
    applications, specific cameras and sensors are used, depending on the grower’s
    interest—most commonly mentioned are thermal and hyper-spectral. Thermal sensors
    can help to recognize the water quantity, as leaves of plants with more water
    access appear cooler in an image. The same phenomenon is used in near-infrared
    (NIR) sensors; commonly used to note the difference between the NIR reflectance
    and the visible reflectance, such as NDVI [254]. The resultant NDVI-based images
    help to distinguish the water stress areas, as shown in figure 11. Hyper-spectral
    based sensors or cameras record the wavelengths of both visible and invisible
    lights, are able to identify the specific type of plant by measuring the color
    of reflected light. This reflected light is used to distinguish various plant
    types, ultimately helping to detect the unwanted herbicide and weeds [255]. The
    idea is used in [256], where authors used the multispectral images to classify
    various weeds. FIGURE 11. NDVI based water stress map of 160 acre walnut orchard
    [258]. Show All Due to their nature and flexibility, UAVs are being used in a
    range of agricultural applications, including crop health monitoring, planting,
    plant counting, spraying, agriculture photography, and many other variable rate
    applications. After being equipped with automation and GPS capabilities, they
    are ready to take the agriculture sector to a further-modernized level. With every
    passing day, drones are becoming more inexpensive and reliable, hence, making
    themselves an ideal choice for new farming applications. Focusing on the success
    of this technology, SAP (Systems, Applications, and Products), one of the largest
    vendors of enterprise resource planning, has brought three of its major technologies
    together in order to make the information harvested through UAVs more effective
    [257]. The technologies include the HANA, a Cloud database which supports speedy
    data capture, retrieval, and analytics; the Leonardo IoT suite to connect and
    exchange information over any protocol; and the Connected Agriculture suite to
    provide a GUI-based, graphical-use interface to the farmers. While it depends
    on the situation, in most cases, few hours delays doesn’t leave serious impact
    in most of the agriculture applications but flight time is more important as need
    to cover larger areas due field vastness. Not only vastness, but in some applications
    of pesticide and fertilizer, UAVs need to carry heavy payloads. In such situations,
    optimum battery utilization becomes crucial to extend the flight time. For this
    purpose, many factors can be considered to increase the drone efficiency. Firstly,
    when flying, choose right conditions e.g. weather or air direction. Next, try
    to include optimum payload and place it appropriately. For this situation, it
    can be helpful to attach the payload near the field, better in smaller quantities
    and the refilling again instead of putting heavy quantities. Further, depending
    on area size and visiting frequency, optimum path selection plays a critical role.
    For this purpose, many routing schemes like [259], [260] are proposed especially
    for the UAVs so choosing and implementing the right scheme can provide clear difference.
    Considering the application of pesticide and UAV based irrigation where drone
    need to fly with heavy payloads then new procedures like tethering system can
    be helpful. In UAV tethering, a connection that provide power through the long
    cable, is provided so that it can fly as long as you have power backup on the
    ground, most importantly it doesn’t require to lift heavy batteries. Currently,
    agriculture is being considered one of the most favorable fields where UAVs can
    offer solutions to resolve many dominant and long-lasting issues. Some of key
    areas in which drones are already playing key roles to assist farmers throughout
    the crop cycle are highlighted below. A. Soil and Field Analysis Drones are able
    to produce precise information to analyze the soil before sowing the crop, which
    helps to determine the most suitable crop for specific land; furthermore, it suggests
    the seed type and its planting patterns. In [261] authors shared their experimental
    results using Sirius I, a fixed-wing aircraft, affixed with a Lumix GF1 digital
    camera by Panasonic to capture images from different sites to monitor the soil
    erosion issues in Morocco. Similarly, authors in [262] targeted the issues of
    soil analyses where they used Lumix DMC-LX 3 to take the images and Pix4UAV for
    mapping the results. B. Planting Millions of acres of land are currently under-utilized
    due to being human inaccessible or lack of suitable workers. Safety concerns of
    rough terrain are main reason not to utilize these areas for forestry or agriculture
    purpose. For this purpose, drone based planting systems are being developed that
    decrease planting costs upto 85 percent [263]. Not only cost, but within shorter
    time as some recently developed drones can plant 100,000 trees in a single day
    [264]. These systems shoot pods which include the seeds and necessary nutrients
    required to grow the plant. This method is found very effective for rough terrain;
    most importantly the success rate is more than 75% [265]. Due to the success and
    flexibility they offer, UAVs are being considered the best candidate for plantation
    all over the world, from NASA engineer [266] to countries like Pakistan [267]
    and India [268]. C. Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is one of tough jobs and facing
    low efficiency due to covering large area. Drones are offering the solutions by
    allowing real-time monitoring of far farms, more accurately and cost-effectively
    comparing with previously used satellite imagery. The Microdrones +m [269] is
    an accessory toolkit which provides aerial imaging facility to observe the crop
    nutrients, moisture levels and monitoring of other necessary parameters. A study
    conducted in [270] where authors used UAVs along digital camera to monitor the
    crop conditions. The purpose of the study was to find the relationship between
    the crop spectral characteristics and effect of fertilizer availability for plant
    health. Further, [271] presents an innovative procedure to compute and map the
    3-dimensional geometric characteristics of trees and tree-rows. The generated
    maps can be helpful to understand the relation between the trees’ growth and field
    related factors like its geometry and nutrients ultimately help to optimize the
    crop management operations. D. Irrigation Use of drones for irrigation applications
    is, again, two-fold. On one side, equipping UAVs with a variety of sensors and
    cameras can help to identify areas that are under water stress and conclude what
    irrigation changes are required. At the same time, they can be used for sprinkling
    water and pesticides on the crops precisely, especially in emergency cases, which
    would save both time and wastage. In [272], multispectral images of citrus crops
    were acquired using the fixed-wing UAV, where the retrieved data was used to assess
    and detect structural and physiological changes in the targeted crop. Further,
    [273], [274] are similar efforts in which UAVs were used to estimate the crop
    water stress. Furthermore, UAVs are not only used to analyze the irrigation properties
    but also provide solutions by sprinkling water precisely over the water stress
    areas as in [275]. Due to this application of UAVs, they are being considered
    the newest water-saving tool, while their use is helping not only to increase
    watering efficiency but also detect possible pooling or leaks in irrigation. Examples
    like ’JT20L-606’ [276] and ’AGRASMG-1’ [277] are specialized drones that were
    developed and are being used for this purpose. E. Plant Counting and Gap Detection
    Precision agriculture critically needs the spatial data on crop density when making
    decisions during various applications. The quantity and plant numbering not only
    reflects the field emergence but allows better and more precise assessment of
    the yield production, in fact, determining the crop fate. Again, UAVs are offering
    flexible solutions for this purpose. In [278], authors performed digital counting
    of Maize plants with the help of UAVs. Further, in [279], authors proposed a method
    in which they used UAVs to estimate the density of wheat plants at the emergence
    stage while a Sony ILCE α5100L RGB camera was used to take the images. F. Spraying
    the Pesticides/Herbicides Similar to irrigation, UAVs can be used to spray herbicides/
    pesticides on crops, but their use for these applications is more critical. Spraying
    application would be highly efficient compared to current procedures; herbicides/pesticides
    are usually sprayed over the entire farm, which is not required in most cases.
    If using an UAV to spray herbicide, it can spray directly on the unwanted weeds
    or can target the affected areas only. Furthermore, as spraying using drones would
    be highly targeted, the drone would figure out and spray as per requirements,
    helping to reduce the overall expenditures. Handling the sudden environment changes
    like wind direction or speed is another issue for an UAV especially when being
    used for spraying applications. For this purpose, [280] proposed a computer based
    system that autonomously adopt the UAV control rules to keep precise pesticide
    deposition. G. Health Assessment Scanning crops with visible and Infrared (IR)
    light sensors fitted on drones can identify which plants may be infected by bacteria
    or fungus. Using UAVs, this can be done frequently and with flexibility. The early
    detection of any such issues helps to prevent the disease being spread to other
    plants or crop areas. Multispectral images can help to detect the disease or sickness
    at early stages even before reaching the level in which it is possible to detect
    with the human eye. Experiments done in [280] present the data collection campaign
    performed over a sorghum crop which was severely damaged by white grubs. Further,
    in [281], UAVs are used to collect data from ground-based sensors, including a
    chlorophyll meter, water potential meter, and spectroradiometer, and the collected
    information was used to evaluate the plant health and crop condition, ultimately
    reflecting the ground truth. H. Detection/Recognition of Plant Species Recently,
    UAVs are being started to detect and recognize the plant species, especially those
    are considered extinct or remains only few on our Earth. An UAV is a best candidate
    to perform this task as it can go in very remote locations those are almost inaccessible
    to humans. As National Tropical Botanical Garden (NTBG) stated that, Hibiscadelphus
    woodi, a Hawaiian flower, which thought to be extinct in 2009, is discovered on
    a vertical cliff face using the drone [282]. Similarly, using the special cameras
    that can detect the forest biomass and fuel, forest fuel estimation is possible
    through UAVs which is mostly being done from radars and satellites [283], [284].
    SECTION VI. Food Safety and Transportation With the increasing population, we
    have to feed around 25% more mouths until 2050, as compared to 2010, which appears
    to be a monumental task when considering the vast hunger issues that the world
    is currently facing. The numbers are shocking, as more than one-quarter of the
    planet’s population suffers from malnutrition [285] and nearly one billion people
    are chronically hungry [286]. Considering this current hunger scenario, it could
    be big ask to feed the new billions of mouths in the future. In order to handle
    the situation, some believe the solution lies simply in growing more food. This
    has also been reinforced by a latest research, published in the journal Bioscience,
    which concludes that from the present time until 2050, the rise in total food
    production should be in the bracket of 25–70%. [287]. However, what if someone
    tells you that there’s already enough food currently grown on farms to feed 10
    billion people? [288]. Yes, the good news is that we are already producing enough
    food for that many people; however, it is a crucial matter to figure out that
    how to distribute this food while maintaining its quality. Considering this fact,
    one can say that increasing the food production is also important, but transporting
    the existing available food safely and efficiently to more people is the real
    subject of issue of the food industry [289]. A comprehensive report regarding
    the future food requirements published by World Resources Institutes (WRI) in
    2018, highlights that we need sustainable food industry to feed 10 billion people
    by 2050. The report suggests a five-course menu of solutions to tackle the future
    food issues where “reduction in food losses and waste” is declared as the first
    and most important course [290]. Further it conclude that, reducing the food loss
    and waste only by 25% can help to reduce the food gap by 12%, the land gap by
    27% and greenhouse gas mitigation gap by 15%. To have better idea, detailed figures
    about the food loss are highlighted in figure 12 based on various geographical
    locations and considering the stages along food supply chain where these losses
    are occurring. FIGURE 12. Food losses occurring along food supply chain [290].
    Show All Other than WRI, the figures released by United Nations’ FAO are also
    shocking as it is estimated that one-third of all the global food produced for
    human use, valued at $1 trillion, is lost or wasted each year [291]. The US food
    waste alone represents 1.3% of its total GDP [292]. Based on these scary figures,
    it can be concluded that food waste is massive market inefficiency—the kind of
    which does not persist in other industries [293]. Although, the loss of $1 trillion
    has its own worth, but, more crucially, environmental implications of these losses
    are real, such as the water wasted to produce the food that is never eaten being
    equal to the water that can fulfill the needs of all of Africa [285]. Furthermore
    the CO2 emissions that resulted during the growing process of this food are equivalent
    to removing every car off the road across the world [290]. Moreover, according
    to another study conducted by FAO, if you consider food waste as a source of greenhouse
    gas emissions, it would be the third biggest emitter in the world behind only
    China and the United States [294]. In addition, when food waste goes to the landfill,
    where it mostly ends up, it decomposes in the absence of oxygen and produces methane,
    which is 23 times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of negative effects.
    In short, every which way you look at it; food waste is a major culprit in destroying
    our planet. Among all perishable food produced in the world today, only 10% is
    preserved properly [295]. When we talk about most of the developed countries,
    a robust food cold chain is maintained where essential quality checks are followed,
    entailing temperature-regulated refrigerated warehouses to refrigerated trucks
    to ensure that food gets from farm to market safely. On the other hand, many developing
    countries lack such proper cold chain infrastructure, simply resulting the majority
    of food spoiling when being transported to the end-user. Considering this fact,
    there is a huge opportunity to cut food waste and improve food distribution by
    simply implementing a controlled-temperature transportation system. Based on the
    facts, one can conclude that increasing food production is not sufficient to achieve
    food security, but, rather, some practical actions are required to find skillful
    ways for efficient distribution of the already available food. There are different
    ways to monitor and control food temperature. The manual method of checking a
    thermometer and recording the temperature has many drawbacks, where someone must
    actually do it and, most importantly, take the readings correctly. On other side,
    implementing an automatic method that uses wireless sensors to electronically
    measure and record temperatures can substantially improve food safety. This method
    allows for a continuous data stream of temperatures simply—24 hours a day, 7 days
    a week. By doing so, temperatures can be recorded consistently and on time, leaving
    little room for interpretation; in short, the entire process is based on facts
    and nothing more. Further, utilizing the recent technologies, the recorded data
    can be stored in the Cloud and accessed via any type of internet-connected device.
    Notifications can be established that will send real-time alerts if the temperature
    strays outside preset limits, allowing for immediate action to remedy the situation.
    Further, IoT offers predictive maintenance and indicate when the monitoring equipment
    itself is going to end its useful life so it can be replaced before it fails and
    compromises product quality. These are only couple of scenarios, now if we consider
    the figures presented in figure 12, IoT has the potential to monitor and keep
    the food quality at every stage of the supply chain, from production to consumption.
    A research study conducted by Indian School of Business in which students worked
    with a local grower to transport fruits and vegetables in refrigerated trucks
    from Punjab to Bangalore, a distance of more than 2,500 km through rough roads
    under high temperatures. The results were highly encouraging to implement the
    cold chain to transport the agriculture products. The out of conducted study brought
    benefits in three ways: (1) increased food shelf-life from one week to two months;
    (2) an up to 23% higher profit for everyone linked in the supply chain was observed;
    (3) a 76% reduction of food wastage (post-harvest). Besides all this, another
    critical factor is the emission of greenhouse gases was observed to be reduced
    by 16% [296]. To provide the recommended environment, a device with supported
    technology can be installed at the storage site, even in transport trucks. Further,
    it is linked to an online dashboard that can be configured to send alerts in the
    event of abnormal temperature levels to trigger swift remedial action. Some of
    key technologies available for this purpose and their use cases are mentioned
    here. A. Compliancemate Compliance with hazard analysis and critical control points
    (HACCP) offers a food safety and quality monitoring program which collects temperature
    data inside coolers and other kitchen equipment continuously. For example, its
    integration with Touchblock is used to capture temperatures in coolers and prep
    rooms at every minute [297]. B. Laird’s Sentrius A battery-powered and long-range
    integrated sensor platform that leverages the benefits of LoRaWAN and Bluetooth
    Low Energy (BLE) connectivity. It provides LoRaWAN options at 868/915 MHz, based
    on the Semtech SX1272 and Nordic nRF51 silicon. Further, it offers high RF performance
    in a precise temperature and humidity. Two major series, including RS1xx and RG1xx
    (multi-wireless gateways), work together in order to provide Cloud-based services.
    Most importantly, it requires an inexpensive endpoint radio and a more sophisticated
    base station to manage the network. As compared to LoRa, Sigfox communication
    tends to be better if it is headed up from the endpoint to the base station. Although
    it supports the bidirectional functionality, its capacity going from the base
    station back to the endpoint is constrained, as it provides less link width going
    down than going up. C. CCP Smart Tag (RC4) CCP claims to be a complete monitoring
    solution for the food service and food retail industry [298]. It is capable to
    automate the temperature environment which meets the food safety regulations suggested
    for various food items. Further, temperature and other data are interpreted and
    viewed on a service provider Cloud platform via web and mobile applications. D.
    Tempreporter In compliance with HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points),
    it is used to monitor temperatures 24/7. Further, it logs the readings automatically.
    Reports are auto-filled by considering HACCP & HPRA (Health Products Regulatory
    Authority) recommendations regarding temperature monitoring. According to Finistere
    Ventures report, as of 2018, around $2 billion has been invested globally in AgTech.
    Several investments are expected to cross these figures in 2019. Considering the
    future needs of IoT in agriculture applications, almost all leading technological
    giants are supporting this progress in their own way. Table 5 provides a list
    of several of the leading global organizations who have proposed and are proposing
    initiatives in AgTech, especially in regard to IoT-based agriculture solutions.
    TABLE 5 Current Status and Future Vision of Major Technological Giants Regarding
    the IoT in Agriculture Industry SECTION VII. Current Challenges and Future Expectations
    According to a plan announced in 2015 under “The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”,
    the UN and international community set a target to end hunger by 2030. However,
    recent figures released by WHO (World Health Organization) do not look encouraging
    enough to support the agenda, as more than 800 million people worldwide are facing
    the food shortage—one out of every nine people [313]. Although these figures are
    quite alarming on their own, what is more shocking is the quality of food. Other
    than availability, the quality of food is becoming another serious issue and even
    more critical. According to a research supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation
    published in “The Lancet”, either shortage or poor diets are diverting 11 million
    people to an early grave annually, making it more deadly than smoking [314]. The
    research, which reflects the effect of poor diet on health, was conducted in 195
    countries from 1990 to 2017 and concluded that one out of five deaths per year
    could be prevented by providing better diet. The report summarizes that, globally,
    a diet lower in whole grains was the most common and leading risk factor for deaths.
    Other than the basic food needs, per capita incomes of most of the countries in
    2050 are expected to be a multiple as compared to today’s levels [315]. Such an
    increase in income will result in a more health-conscious population that expects
    quality food that is rich in fiber and other minerals. Trends, like increased
    population where the world needs to feed one third more mouths with increased
    demand of quality food, show that food demands continue to grow rapidly. In response
    to all this, overall crop production needs to increase not only for food but cash-crops
    are also required to grow in order to fulfill the demands of industry, like cotton
    and rubber, and, most importantly, increasing demands for bioenergy like ethanol.
    Figure 13 presents a snapshot of major challenges that future agriculture expected
    to face in 2050. This diagram, basically presents three major issues: how to feed
    around 10 billion people; without using more land and; by reducing the emission
    of greenhouse gasses by more than 60%. However, when we look closely then these
    three challenges lead to many new, including smaller rural labor, continuously
    shrinking arable land, water scarcity, harsh weather conditions, and many more.
    As the world moves toward urbanization, the rural populations are not only shrinking
    but are rapidly aging; hence, fewer and younger growers need to step up to take
    the responsibility. Such population imbalance and generation shift can create
    serious implications, not only for the remaining workforce but also for production
    patterns and land tenure. Furthermore, on one side, arable land is shrinking while,
    among the remaining regions, many are only suitable for specific crops due to
    certain geographic and environmental limitations. Moreover, harsh climate changes
    are starting to affect almost every aspect of crop production. These changes are
    expected to enhance the intensity of many of the existing long-term environmental
    issues, like droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, soil degradation, etc. FIGURE
    13. Major challenges for sustainable future agriculture. Show All During the 20th
    century, in most regions, growers kept following the traditional agricultural
    methods while trying to meet the food demands by greater utilizing fertilizers
    and pesticides. Implementation of such chemicals is facing two issues: these can
    help to increase the production to only a certain level and, at the same time,
    their blind use is creating irreversible implications to the environment. Furthermore,
    implementation of any resource, like water, seed, fertilizers, and pesticides,
    uniformly across an entire field is not going to solve the problem. Rather than
    dealing with every farm and crop in same way, farmers need to use these resources
    according to the requirement of specific areas, even if they have to consider
    the requirement of every plant. Focusing on the above discussion, one can feel
    that the farms and relevant crop operations need to be run differently than the
    past practices. One of the major reasons is the advancements in technology, including
    sensors, communication methods, machines, and even robots. In fact, technology
    has proved this already, as, in most developing countries; more than 50% of the
    population is somehow engaged in the agriculture industry yet are far behind in
    providing both the quantity and quality when compared with the developed countries,
    where less than 2% of the population is performing much better. The difference
    is clear, as countries like Australia, the US, and most of Europe are pioneers
    to employ the advanced tools and methods multiplying the crop yields during the
    last five decades. These comparisons show that recent technologies and advanced
    methods are making the farms not only highly profitable but safe and environmentally
    friendly. Considering this scenario, future agriculture is expected to evolve
    as a high-tech industry where interconnected systems will enjoy the luxury of
    artificial intelligence and Big Data facilities. The resultant systems will converge
    into a single unit where farm machinery and management, starting from seeding
    to production forecasting, are combined. By involving the advanced technologies
    like agricultural robots, Big Data, and cloud-computing artificial intelligence,
    agriculture can create a new era of superfusion. Following are some of the key
    technologies and methods that need to apply; focusing to achieve sustainable future
    agriculture. A. Wireless Sensors and the IoT Wireless sensors placed strategically
    around fields are providing farmers with up-to-date information in real time,
    allowing them to adapt the care that the crops need, which results in higher food
    production with less waste. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are also being used
    to inform farmers about nearly all aspects of their crop growth as well as about
    the readiness state of the farm’s machinery, thus, helping in preventing loss
    of crop as well as enhancing the readiness of the equipment which cultivates it.
    WSNs with GPS capability are helping tractors in compensating for uneven terrain
    and optimizing land preparation for growing crops. Recently, advances in image
    recognition and digital signal processing gave even more capabilities to WSN to
    accurately determine crop quality and health. In order to make agriculture sustainable,
    the use of the IoT will be at the center and forefront in agricultural operations.
    This includes everything from water and power usage, crop transportation, farm
    machinery operation and maintenance alerts, and market price updates. The IoT
    has the capability to make these tasks streamlined and more predictable by recognizing
    the crop’s needs at every stage. It has already proved a breakthrough and is further
    going to change the way we look at various agriculture activities by providing
    the farmer control over their land and assets in an unprecedented way, thus, maximizing
    their effectiveness and efficiency. Further, the future of the IoT can be shaped
    by the phenomenal advances in WSNs and the fifth generation (5G) of cellular mobile
    communication technologies to provide farmers with real-time data and information
    anytime and everywhere their land is. Based on recent success, it is estimated
    that more than 75 million IoT-based devices will be operating in the agriculture
    industry by 2020. Further, the average farm is expecting to generate 4.1 million
    data points on a daily bases by 2050 [316]. B. Communication Real success of IoT
    in agriculture largely depends on advances in connectivity. From telecom’s perspective,
    providing mainly connectivity and other value-added services has an immense potential
    and can influence the entire chain greatly [317]. Most of the telecom operators
    around the globe offer connectivity services, but such services only represent
    a tiny amount of the entire smart agriculture market. Considering its worth, especially
    in rural areas, the cellular operators have to offer a new range of services targeting
    the growers’ demands. Accepting the fact that most of the community belong to
    this industry are not highly educated and mostly unaware of new technologies,
    hence the operator should provide end-to-end solutions other than just providing
    the connectivity. If so, then it will certainly help to increase the market share
    of mobile and telecom operators. Further, these operators need partnerships with
    the investors to provide end-to-end solutions, which demands higher investment,
    even before advantages can be seen. The results of success when inviting the investors
    depend on the nature of the partnership and the involved bodies, like device manufacturers,
    solution providers, non-cellular connectivity service providers, system integrators,
    etc. On one side, the outcome of this partnership would help operators to enter
    deeper into the industry, ultimately boosting their market share. At the same
    time, this opportunity can create strong relationships among the organizations
    and farmers to help to educate them about the benefits of smart agriculture. The
    success of cellular technology is only possible when service providers leverage
    its real benefits like portability, flexibility and luxury of two way communication
    to offer low cost but customized solutions. They must provide what the farmer
    is in need, at the place they choose. Furthermore, to provide fast penetration
    in agriculture industry, policy changes are required in order to provide access
    of reliable and quality inputs. The research conducted in [172] which considers
    23 studies where mostly belong to developing countries, concludes that the cellular
    services and smartphone technology carry a promising future for smallholder farmers
    being capable to improve their yields. Furthermore, licensed LPWA (low-power wide-area)
    technology is expected to be a game changer for smart agriculture. Due to its
    characteristics and supported services including low power consumption and efficient
    coverage are well suited to the geography and economics of agriculture hence expected
    to play a critical role in future smart farming. Consequently, narrowband IoT
    (NB-IoT) got strong industry support and becoming an effective global standard
    for LPWA connectivity. It has the potential to provide major connectivity changes
    in agriculture industry by changing the perceptions about Internet capabilities.
    Believing in its future success, it is expected that leading cellular operators
    with strong IoT ambitions can generate significant revenues by providing smart
    agriculture services when collaborating with LPWA technology providers. In order
    to achieve long term success of these short, mid and long range communication
    technologies, necessary steps for infrastructure construction are required towards
    attaining the technology-based agriculture. C. UAVs and Other Robots Drones are
    being widely used by farmers for crop growth monitoring and as a means to combat
    hunger and other harmful environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are being used
    to spray water and other pesticides efficiently, considering the tough terrains,
    especially when the crops possess different heights. Drones have proven their
    value, not only in terms of spraying speed but precision, as well, when compared
    with traditional machinery of same purpose. With recent advances in swarm technology
    and mission-based control, groups of drones equipped with heterogeneous sensors,
    including 3D cameras, can work together to provide farmers with comprehensive
    capabilities to manage their land. With the inclusion of UAVs in agriculture,
    farmers are able to put their eye in sky, but many challenges need to be addressed
    in order to enjoy the real advantages of this technology, especially the integration
    of other technologies and how to use them in poor weather conditions. Beside drones,
    robotics within agriculture have improved productivity and resulted in higher
    and faster yields. Such robots, like spraying and weeding robots, are reducing
    agrochemical use. Robots equipped with laser and camera guidance are being used
    for identifying and removing weeds without human intervention. They navigate between
    rows of crops on their own, ultimately increasing the yield with reduced manpower.
    More recently, plant-transplanting and fruit-picking robots are emerging to add
    a new level of efficiency to traditional methods. D. Machine Learning and Analytics
    Machine learning and analytics are used to mine data for trends. In farming, machine
    learning is used, for example, to predict which genes are best suited for crop
    production. This has been giving growers all over the world the best seed varieties,
    those which are highly suitable to respective locations and climate conditions.
    Machine-learning algorithms, on the other hand, have indicated which products
    are of high demand and which products are currently unavailable in the market.
    Thus, for the farmer, this has given valuable clues for future farming. Recent
    advances in machine learning and analytics will make it possible for farmers to
    accurately classify their products and weed out less desirable crops before they
    arrive to customers. E. Power Consumption, Renewable Energy, Microgrids, and Smart
    Grids Despite its future opportunities, smart agriculture facing some limitations
    that are holding back the growth of IoT. One of them is power issue as due to
    its nature; smart farming requires wide use of energy. Among the main reasons
    of extensive power consumption some are including, long term sensor deployment,
    use of GPS repeatedly and transmission of sensed data via GPRS. Traditionally,
    farmers in remote areas have bought and utilized renewable energy sources randomly
    and at a hefty price, which has limited their ability to use them in farming to
    a great extent. However to solve the power issues in long term, deep analysis
    of power consumption sources like remote data transmission can help to tackle
    the problem at some extent. Further, smart grids and microgrids, however, lend
    themselves to seamless integration of distributed energy sources (DERs), thus,
    making them appealing for adoption by farmers. The emergence of smart power meters
    has further given the farmers the confidence to invest in DER, especially since
    they have the option to sell the excess power to the grid. Recent advances in
    energy storage devices, integrated electricity and heat systems will make DER
    even more attractive for farmers, as they will be able to store energy and use
    the heat generated by cooling and heating when needed. However, healthy investment
    requirements and public perceptions are two other barriers on the way to making
    these solutions successful. F. Hydroponics and Vertical Farming (VF) Other than
    employing the advanced technologies, new agricultural practices can be very crucial
    to overcome the geographic and resource limitation challenges. On one side, arable
    land is shrinking, and, at the same time, it is estimated that three million people
    around the globe are migrating to cities, resulting in more pressure on the existing
    limited urban resources [318]. Considering this rapid migration, it is estimated
    that by 2030, 60% of the world’s population is going to depend on cities, and
    this number is further expected to rise to 68% until 2050 [319]. Considering both
    of these issues, it could be disaster for food production in the near future with
    current agriculture practices. VF is an answer of these issues, as it meets the
    challenges of land and water shortage and, at the same time, looks highly suitable
    to be adopted near the cities. VF is portrayed as the answer to the looming shortage
    of food and shrinking arable land, at least in some areas of the world. Further,
    hydroponics can play a key role, as this method lowers the requirements of water
    and space to a great extent. Rapid growths in computer power are propelling scientific
    discoveries in plant nutrition and growth that would make VF even more appealing
    to growers. Along VF and hydroponics, new and advanced solutions are required
    to increase the arable land without disturbing the forests and other natural animal
    habitats. For this, we have to focus on the deserts as these cover one third of
    the Earth’s land surface. The solutions are started already as Norwegian and Chinese
    firms/experts are doing efforts in Dubai, Qatar, Jordan and Chinese deserts [320]–[322].
    Agriculture is not just an industry; in fact, it provides the basis of human society,
    as the goal is not just to grow crops, but the target is the perfection of human
    being. A vibrant and prosperous agriculture sector can provide the basis for a
    happy and healthy society, as recent decades witnessed this. The presence of advance
    technologies, especially the involvement of the IoT, matters a great deal in regard
    to reaching this goal. Environmental issues continue to cage the planet, which
    increases the need for safe and clean agriculture. This is the reason humanity
    is witnessing a second green revolution, largely based on the IoT. The use of
    these technologies makes the farming industry highly productive with reduced labor
    and other resource consumption; same time, minimizing the impact on the environment.
    Our planet has the resources, but we have to learn how to utilize them wisely
    and precisely. Sensible use of technology can lead us where we can utilize these
    resources efficiently in order to ensure the food security of the current and
    coming generations. For this purpose, we need collective efforts to build such
    institutions that can shape long-term decisions and polices to eliminate hunger
    effectively. On this route, the experience, tools, and support from those nations
    that have succeeded in overcoming hunger should provide to those regions that
    are fighting to feed its local mouths. Although growth in every industry matters,
    growth in agriculture, particularly among small growers, can be highly effective
    to control the undernourishment issues, as more than 70% of the population of
    developing countries belongs to rural areas and somehow depends on agriculture
    sector. SECTION VIII. Conclusion The focus on smarter, better, and more efficient
    crop growing methodologies is required in order to meet the growing food demand
    of the increasing world population in the face of the ever-shrinking arable land.
    The development of new methods of improving crop yield and handling, one can readily
    see currently: technology-weaned, innovative younger people adopting farming as
    a profession, agriculture as a means for independence from fossil fuels, tracking
    the crop growth, safety and nutrition labeling, partnerships between growers,
    suppliers, and retailers and buyers. This paper considered all these aspects and
    highlighted the role of various technologies, especially IoT, in order to make
    the agriculture smarter and more efficient to meet future expectations. For this
    purpose, wireless sensors, UAVs, Cloud-computing, communication technologies are
    discussed thoroughly. Furthermore, a deeper insight on recent research efforts
    is provided. In addition, various IoT-based architectures and platforms are provided
    with respect to agriculture applications. A summary of current challenges facing
    the industry and future expectations are listed to provide guidance to researchers
    and engineers. Based on all this, it can be concluded that every inch of farmland
    is vital to maximize crop production. However, to deal with every inch accordingly,
    the use of sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication technologies is not
    optional—it is necessary. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\

    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\

    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\

    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\

    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the ones\
    \ that\njust oﬀer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in this\
    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\
    \ 83\ninclude diﬀerent levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only indicate\
    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\

    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ \nMost of the included papers in this section do not describe the target agriculture\

    \ This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil\n\

    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\
    Diﬀerent sensors are used, [84] used a sensor based on optical signals while [46]\
    \ utilized a commercial\nFC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).\n \n\
    Figure 5. Monitored environments in papers that propose an irrigation system.\
    \ \nFollowing, the details about the number of monitored parameters are presented\
    \ (see Figure 6). \nFrom the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals\
    \ measure between three and four \nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\
    \ or two) represents 31% of the cases (17% one \nparameter and 14% two parameters).\
    \ There are some rare cases (10% of them) where more than four \nparameters are\
    \ monitored. The papers where more parameters are measured are [64,67], with six\
    \ \nmeasured parameters and [31,45,46,61,68,75,76] that measured five parameters.\
    \ On the other hand, \nthere are five papers (6% of cases) that do not measure\
    \ any parameter [33,41,77–79].  \n \nFigure 6. Number of monitored parameters\
    \ in papers that propose an irrigation system. \nNext, the details about the measured\
    \ parameters are shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, \nplants, and water (see\
    \ Figure 7), the most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor,\
    \ it is \nused in 76 papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze\

    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\
    \ wetness was \nconsidered in their system [46,84,85]. Different sensors are used,\
    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\
    \ from the soil, water, and plants in papers that propose an irrigation \nsystem.\
    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\
    \ no data regarding the equipment \nused are given. Regarding the pH of water,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\

    \ only the irrigation system as an actuator.\nThere are seven papers (8% of cases)\

    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\
    \ not include the use of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized\
    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\
    \ periods to increase\nproductivity, but they can also be used for operational\
    \ purposes. Fans are included in ﬁve proposals\nand their use is related to modifying\
    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\

    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\

    \ can estimate the potential ET given a location. For ET monitoring, remote sensing\
    \ is the\nbest option as many papers point out [106–108]. Among the possibilities\

    \ complex; it can be estimated with the data of sensors that measure radiation,\n\
    leaf area index, and vapor pressure deﬁcit [109]. Due to the complexity of its\
    \ measurement, it is not\nincluded as a monitored variable in most of the papers\

    \ that the \nsensor used was a hygrometer. A total of 24 proposals clearly indicate\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\
    \ is ±0.5 °C. The operation principle of this sensor is \nnot specified in the\
    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\
    \ not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only \npaper that clearly indicates\
    \ the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes an 1185 \nSunRom\
    \ color sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor is based on\
    \ RGB color \ndetection, in [80] authors relate the color of the soil with the\
    \ nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured \nin four proposals [66,67,72,110].\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ wet, the intensity of the\nreceived IR light decreases. It is manufactured by\
    \ Bosch (BOSCH, Gerlingen, Germany) and it is\ncommonly used in the automotive\
    \ industry. The SEN-08942 is a meteorology station manufactured\nby Sparkfun (SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It allows monitoring both wind speed and\ndirection\
    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\

    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\

    \ reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and\
    \ 5-\nlayered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is\
    \ comprised of the sensor nodes \nand the actuators. The middle layer is comprised\
    \ of a gateway and contemplates data transmission. \nLastly, the third layer is\
    \ usually tasked with performing data storage and analysis. Typical third \nlayers\
    \ are conformed of cloud services, databases or applications. \nA novel take on\
    \ IoT deployments for precision agriculture is being considered on the Internet\
    \ of \nUnderground Things [219]. The authors define the functionalities as in-situ\
    \ sensing, wireless \ncommunication in underground environments and the connection\
    \ between the elements of the \narchitecture such as sensors, machinery or the\
    \ cloud. For the case of IoUT, the sensors are deployed \nunderground. The authors\
    \ performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and \nunderground\
    \ devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached\
    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\
    \ 10 m for -80 \ndBm. The authors also comment on the effects of soil moisture\

    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\

    \ information through\nthe soil medium.\nThe use of LoRa is increasing for irrigation\
    \ and precision agriculture applications due to its\nlong-range, which allows\
    \ wireless communication to remote ﬁelds. However, the advances in 5G may\nlead\
    \ to a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one hand, if the designed\
    \ irrigation system\nproduces lower amounts of data, as these types of systems\
    \ present low variability in the data, LoRa\npresents itself as a very good solution.\
    \ However, on the other hand, for IoT systems that require the\ntransmission of\
    \ large amounts of data, 5G would solve the problem of the limited amount of data\
    \ that\nLoRa can transmit. Considering these aspects, a possible future is the\
    \ use of LoRa and 5G hybrid\nwireless networks to attempt in satisfying those\
    \ needs [223].\nThere are diverse opinions on the existence and eﬀects of climate\
    \ change on earth. However,\nthere is no doubt that many governments, companies\
    \ and the citizens themselves are increasing\ntheir awareness regarding sustainable\
    \ consumption. This not only aﬀects their view on the energy\nconsumption of IoT\
    \ systems for irrigation but also, the origin of the components of the devices\
    \ and the\nimpact of IoT devices on the environment and the fauna of the area\
    \ where they are deployed. Therefore,\nthe reduction in energy consumption and\
    \ the use of alternative powering methods will continue to be\na research trend.\
    \ Furthermore, it may be a challenge to ﬁnd new materials that are weather-resistant\n\
    and do not increase severely the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable\
    \ materials in some of the\nelements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203].\n\
    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\
    \ schemes was also highlighted by several scholars [106–108] to further lower\n\
    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\
    \ technique\nbased on a combination of power reduction schemes for previous research\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\

    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\

    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\

    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    • The role of Internet of Things in arable farming is reviewed. • Internet of
    Things is leading arable farming to become data-driven. • Implementation and application
    are described in depth. • Challenges, corresponding solutions and potentials are
    discussed thoroughly. The Internet of Things is allowing agriculture, here specifically
    arable farming, to become data-driven, leading to more timely and cost-effective
    production and management of farms, and at the same time reducing their environmental
    impact. This review is addressing an analytical survey of the current and potential
    application of Internet of Things in arable farming, where spatial data, highly
    varying environments, task diversity and mobile devices pose unique challenges
    to be overcome compared to other agricultural systems. The review contributes
    an overview of the state of the art of technologies deployed. It provides an outline
    of the current and potential applications, and discusses the challenges and possible
    solutions and implementations. Lastly, it presents some future directions for
    the Internet of Things in arable farming. Current issues such as smart phones,
    intelligent management of Wireless Sensor Networks, middleware platforms, integrated
    Farm Management Information Systems across the supply chain, or autonomous vehicles
    and robotics stand out because of their potential to lead arable farming to smart
    arable farming. During the implementation, different challenges are encountered,
    and here interoperability is a key major hurdle throughout all the layers in the
    architecture of an Internet of Things system, which can be addressed by shared
    standards and protocols. Challenges such as affordability, device power consumption,
    network latency, Big Data analysis, data privacy and security, among others, have
    been identified by the articles reviewed and are discussed in detail. Different
    solutions to all identified challenges are presented addressing technologies such
    as machine learning, middleware platforms, or intelligent data management. Previous

    The global population and its food consumption are growing alarmingly quickly,
    while climate change effects are simultaneously complicating the challenge of
    ensuring food security in a sustainable manner (Godfray et al., 2010, Tilman et
    al., 2011). Data-driven agriculture is one of the main strategies and concepts
    proposed to increase production efficiently while decreasing its environmental
    impact (Foley et al., 2011). Data-driven technologies in general are quickly advancing
    with the development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and may become an important
    part of the future of farming (Brewster et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2016,
    Verdouw, 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Smart Farming, also called Agriculture 4.0
    or digital farming (CEMA, 2017), is developing beyond the modern concept of precision
    agriculture, which bases its management practices on spatial measurements largely
    thanks to Global Positioning System (GPS) signals. Smart farming bases its management
    tasks also on spatial data but is enhanced with context-awareness and is activated
    by real-time events, improving the performance of hitherto precision agriculture
    solutions (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Wolfert et al., 2017). Additionally, Smart
    Farming usually incorporates intelligent services for applying and managing Information
    and Communication Technologies (ICT) in farming, and allows transverse integration
    throughout the whole agri-food chain in regards to food safety and traceability
    (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). IoT is therefore a key technology in smart farming
    since it ensures data flow between sensors and other devices, making it possible
    to add value to the obtained data by automatic processing, analysis and access,
    and this leads to more timely and cost-effective production and management effort
    on farms. Simultaneously, IoT enables the reduction of the inherent environmental
    impact by real-time reaction to alert events such as weed, pest or disease detection,
    weather or soil monitoring warnings, which allow for a reduction and adequate
    use of inputs such as agrochemicals or water. IoT eases documentation and supervision
    of different activities as well as the traceability of products, improving the
    environmental surveying and control in farms by the appropriate authorities. The
    IoT concept was introduced by Kevin Ashton in 1999 in relation to linking Radio-Frequency
    Identification (RFID) for supply chains to the internet (Ashton, 2009), but has
    no official definition. It implies, however, the connection of a network of “things”
    to or through the internet without direct human intervention. “Things” can be
    any object with sensors and/or actuators that is uniquely addressable, interconnected
    and accessible through the world-wide computer network, i.e. the Internet. The
    application of IoT in agriculture is advantageous because of the possibility to
    monitor and control many different parameters in an interoperable, scalable and
    open context with an increasing use of heterogeneous automated components (Kamilaris,
    Gao, Prenafeta-Boldu, & Ali, 2016), in addition to the inevitable requirement
    for traceability. As a result of IoT, agriculture is becoming data-driven, i.e.
    making informed real-time decisions for managing the farm, reducing uncertainties
    and inefficiencies, and as a consequence reducing its environmental impact. The
    application of IoT in agriculture, also called Ag-IoT (Zhai, 2017), AIoT (Zou
    & Quan, 2017), or IoF meaning Internet of Farming (Alahmadi, Alwajeeh, Mohanan,
    & Budiarto, 2017) or Internet of Food and Farm (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), has received exponentially increasing attention in the scientific
    community (Fig. 1). Even though the publications are mainly dominated by Asian
    scientists (Talavera et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016), in Europe several large scale
    international pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016, Verdouw
    et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019), are aiming to implement IoT technologies in the agricultural
    industry in Europe. Similar projects elsewhere include the Accelerating Precision
    Agriculture to Decision Agriculture (P2D) project in Australia (Zhang, Baker,
    Jakku, & Llewellyn, 2017), which complement additional major investments with
    the aim to help farmers convert to smart farming (Higgins et al., 2017, Pham and
    Stack, 2018). Download : Download high-res image (95KB) Download : Download full-size

    searching criteria: (Internet of things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    Several reviews have been done on IoT in agriculture in the relatively short time
    period in which publications about the subject have emerged (Ray, 2017, Stočes
    et al., 2016, Talavera et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). In
    addition, review papers have been published with a focus on specific subjects
    related to IoT applied in agriculture, such as Big Data (Kamilaris et al., 2017,
    Wolfert et al., 2017), modelling (O''Grady & O''Hare, 2017), Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017), food supply chain (Ramundo,
    Taisch, & Terzi, 2016), Internet of Underground Things (Vuran, Salam, Wong, &
    Irmak, 2018), chemical wireless sensors (Kassal, Steinberg, & Murkovi, 2018),
    or Farm Management Information Systems (FMIS) (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015;
    Kaloxylos et al., 2012). However, to the authors'' knowledge, no existing review
    has focused on arable farming, which has specific characteristics and challenges
    that differ from those in a controlled environment, i.e. greenhouses, or permanent
    crops such as fruit orchards. Arable farming poses particular challenges due to:
    • much larger farm sizes, which affect the design of the sensor networks, the
    data processing, analysis and extrapolation of limited stationary sensor data,
    and the consequent decision making with regards to actuators, vehicle logistics,
    etc.; • the larger farm sizes also imply that spatial data has a central role
    in arable farming, affecting the data processing, decision making and precision
    machinery employed to address in-field variability not at plant level as in most
    permanent crops, but at subfield level with automatic recognition and actuation
    (Zude-Sasse, Fountas, Gemtos, & Abu-Khalaf, 2016); • greater use of mobile sensors
    and other devices on vehicles, which have specific challenges. While other cropping
    systems may also use sensors and devices on operating machinery, arable farming
    often requires a fleet of vehicles to operate in a co-ordinated fashion. This
    creates issues particularly regarding network infrastructure (Martínez, Pastor,
    Álvarez, & Iborra, 2016), e.g. connectivity to the cloud of moving things that
    rely mainly on mobile networks, or vehicle to implement communication, which implies
    real-time interoperability between machines and devices from different manufacturers
    (Peets, Mouazen, Blackburn, Kuang, & Wiebensohn, 2012); • larger amounts of heterogeneous
    spatial data generated at different rates and from very disparate sources: stationary
    sensors, moving vehicles and implements, satellites, data from web services, etc.,
    which need to be intelligently integrated; • highly varying and uncertain environmental
    conditions, as annual crops are more susceptible to weather changes and other
    external factors than permanent crops, which are more resilient mainly due to
    their deeper roots (Zude-Sasse et al., 2016), or crops in controlled environments.
    This obligates the IoT system to handle both spatial and temporal data, increasing
    the complexity of the data processing as well as the decisions based on the data
    collected. • more diverse types of field tasks per growing season in arable farming,
    from soil preparation and crop establishment, through highly varying plant nursing
    tasks, to coordinated harvest, which increase the complexity and also the risks.
    The IoT in agriculture is a fast-developing field, which can make reviews obsolete
    quickly. This challenge can be overcome by focussing a critical view on the general
    principles, main application areas and identify the limitations and challenges.
    Summarising, the aim of the paper is to provide an up to date novel analytical
    review of the role of IoT in arable farming, with the following specific objectives:
    • Provide an overview of the current situation of IoT technologies deployed in
    arable farming. Focussing on the current use of communication technologies and
    protocols, the generation and analysis of data, and IoT architectures. • Outline
    the different applications and capabilities of IoT in arable farming. • Investigate
    the main challenges encountered by IoT enabling technologies applied to arable
    farming. • Present key potential fields of application where IoT could be employed,
    as well as future directions of the current trends. The remaining part of this
    paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes the methodology used in this
    review paper. Section 3 provides an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies
    used in arable farming; Section 4 presents an outline of the current and potential
    IoT-based applications in arable farming; Section 5 discusses the challenges and
    solutions found in its implementation; and lastly, the review closes with Section
    6 in which future directions are summarised. 2. Review methodology In order to
    address the specific objectives identified above, the literature listing from
    the SCOPUS database of the last 11 years has been reviewed. More precisely, the
    timeframe investigated was from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2018, selected as
    the whole period in which any literature about the subject turned up in the studied
    database. SCOPUS was selected as the primary literature source as it is a key
    peer-reviewed research literature database. The specific keywords used in the
    search criteria where: (Internet of Things OR IoT) AND (agriculture OR farming).
    To ease the searching process, the keywords needed to be present in at least the
    title, abstract, highlights or keywords. Additionally, the articles had to be
    published in English. Articles concerning greenhouse, livestock or permanent crops
    were excluded from the survey, as were supply chain related articles. However,
    issues concerning traceability at farm level were included. The survey was performed
    in a systematic manner following three steps (see Fig. 2): • Firstly, a list of
    1193 articles meeting the search criteria mentioned above was retrieved from the
    database. • In the second step, by reading the titles, any article that was clearly
    not related to arable farming was excluded, leaving a list of 293 articles. •
    In the last step, a second screening was made by reading the abstracts, where
    articles outside the focus of this review were omitted. After this step, 167 articles
    were studied in detail, from which 69 articles were considered relevant, 27 as
    partially relevant, while the rest were considered of little relevance. Relevance
    concerned mainly the connection of the article to the subject studied. The content
    of a relevant article directly addresses the application of an IoT technology
    in an arable farming scenario. A partially relevant article studies a certain
    IoT technology in agriculture in a broader sense. In the distinction made regarding
    little relevant articles included off-topic, lack of novelty, as well as non-peer-reviewed
    articles that lacked scientific rigour, e.g. ambiguous information or absence
    of materials or methods description. Download : Download high-res image (208KB)

    The final 167 articles studied included: 77 journal papers, 88 conference papers
    and 4 book chapters, of which 19 were review papers. The final list of articles
    was complemented with other publications that expanded on some of the IoT related
    subjects and technologies mentioned in the studied articles, and did not contain
    the specified keywords. These were found by a targeted search for specific subjects.
    Lastly, in each article from the final list a special focus was made on the IoT
    technologies employed, the applications, the challenges encountered and, finally,
    on potential future perspectives. 3. IoT implementation in arable farming IoT
    has recently been gaining momentum in the farming industry as it can fulfil the
    urgent necessity for interoperability across brands, scalability and traceability
    (Kamilaris et al., 2016). Different technologies are implemented as IoT is still
    evolving, adapting to a great diversity of uses. To cover the range of technologies,
    protocols, standards, etc. employed, this review is addressing the layers in the
    IoT architecture. Three layers normally describe the architecture of the IoT in
    the literature reviewed (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Khattab et al., 2016,
    Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Na and Isaac, 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw,
    2016), though some authors divide it into more layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Ramundo et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Talavera et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2014),
    depending on their definitions. More than three layers can especially be relevant
    in IoT systems with edge or fog computing, where an edge/fog computing layer can
    be considered in between the device and network layers (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016). Even though the naming of the layers also varies depending on the author,
    there is nonetheless a general trend to divide the layers into device, network
    and application layers (Fig. 3). Thus, this has been the adapted structure in
    this review. The device layer consists of the physical objects (things) that are
    capable of automatic identification, sensing or actuation, and connection to the
    internet. The network layer communicates the data to a gateway (or proxy server)
    to the internet (cloud) by the use of communication protocols. And the application
    layer typically stores and facilitates access for the end-user to the processed/analysed
    information. Download : Download high-res image (222KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 3. IoT architecture represented by device, network and application
    layer, in which the middleware platform is not always present. The collected data
    experience diverse stages during their transition from sensors to cloud, interfaces,
    and occasionally actuators, and these stages have considerable influence on the
    technologies applied in an IoT context. Six main stages regarding data flow have
    been identified in the literature reviewed: sensing/perception, communication/transport/transfer,
    storage, processing, analytics, and actuation and display (Fig. 4). The order
    of the stages is different depending on the IoT setup employed and the computing
    techniques used, e.g. fog and edge computing processes the data before communicating
    it to the cloud, an example of its application in precision farming is given by
    Ferrández-Pastor et al. (2016); while cloud computing processes the data in the
    cloud, examples of this are given by Hernandez-Rojas, Mazon-Olivo, Novillo-Vicuña,
    and Belduma-Vacacela (2018) and Na and Isaac (2016). Nonetheless, sensing/perception
    is normally the first stage, where data are captured by sensors, then the data
    can follow different paths and does not necessarily go through all the steps listed.
    In summary, IoT data is identified to be gathered or generated through three main
    processes: machine generated, which come from sensing devices; process-mediated,
    i.e. commercial data coming from business processes; and human-sourced, recorded
    by humans and digitalised later on (Balducci, Impedovo, Informatica, & Moro, 2018).
    These different sources have an influence on how to process, analyse and use the
    data in IoT solutions, and this needs to be taken into account in the overall
    data acquisition planning process. Download : Download high-res image (171KB)

    in arable farming. 3.1. Device layer As mentioned above, the device layer consists
    of the physical objects (things) that are capable of automatic identification,
    sensing or actuating, and providing connection to the internet. Sensor devices
    measure and collect one or more parameters automatically and transmit the data
    wirelessly to the cloud. And, when the devices become actuators, they generally,
    in turn, receive data from the cloud in order to activate or deactivate some mechanical
    component, e.g. a valve in an irrigation system. The device layer is also often
    called perception layer (Tzounis et al., 2017, Zou and Quan, 2017), sensing layer
    (Na and Isaac, 2016, Wang et al., 2014), or physical layer (Ramundo et al., 2016,
    Talavera et al., 2017). The devices are constituted of a transceiver, a microcontroller,
    an interfacing circuit and one or more sensors and/or actuators. The sensor measures
    a physical parameter, e.g. air temperature that is interpreted and transformed
    into an equivalent analogue signal, i.e. electric voltage or current, which is
    then converted by the interfacing circuit, i.e. Analogue-to-Digital Converter
    (ADC), into a corresponding digital format. Afterwards, the microcontroller, sometimes
    also in the form of microprocessors or single-board computers (Talavera et al.,
    2017), collects the data in digital format from one or more sensors through the
    ADC, and sends them to the transceiver, i.e. a wireless communication module,
    which communicates the data to a gateway. A comparison of microcontrollers and
    single-board computers used in IoT in agriculture has been made by Ray (2017).
    In the case of edge computing, the microcontroller or single-board computer processes
    the data from one or more sensors before communicating them, with the intention
    of, for example, reducing the amount of data to be transferred to the cloud and
    accelerating the data processing (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et
    al., 2016). In fog computing the data are processed in the local area network
    level, i.e. in a fog node or IoT gateway (Ahmed, Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed,
    De et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018). When employing an actuator, the
    signal is received by the transceiver, communicated to the microcontroller, where
    it is then converted to analogue signal by a Digital-to-Analogue Converter (DAC),
    i.e. the interfacing circuit, or to a digital signal by a Digital-to-Digital Converter,
    and finally interpreted by the actuator, which acts in accordance to the signal
    received. In arable farming, when agricultural machinery data are used, i.e. data
    from sensors and devices mounted on tractors or other agricultural machinery,
    the data in digital format is normally collected and accessible through the Controller
    Area Network (CAN) bus in the machine, although in some cases some data are accessible
    through other ports (Oksanen et al., 2016, Peets et al., 2012). Machine and operator
    performance information is accessible through the Machine and Implement Control
    System (MICS) of the machine, which can also be accessed through the CAN bus data.
    MICS data are used to allow machinery operators and farm managers to monitor and
    potentially improve the efficiency of their machines, by employing e.g. smart
    alerts or recommendation systems (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015). Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GNSS) data, e.g. Real Time Kinematics GPS (RTK-GPS), are often also available
    through the CAN bus port, which allows, among others, vehicle monitoring and dynamic
    optimised route planning Edwards et al., 2017, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018. Many
    different sensors and actuators are employed in arable farming. The type of device
    used depends on the purpose of the system in addition to the technologies implemented
    in the system. And the number of devices is steadily increasing. The number of
    IoT device installations in farms is expected to increase globally from 30 million
    installations in 2015 to 75 million in 2020. Furthermore, data points generated
    per day and farm are expected to increase from 190000 in 2014 to over half a million
    by 2020 (Meola, 2016). It was also estimated that by 2018 there would be 10 billion
    IoT devices employed in agriculture. However, the great amount of data generated
    is often unused or underutilised (Bennett, 2015), e.g. in countries like Denmark
    with a relative high ICT adoption in farms, in 2016 only 2–5% of farmers worked
    actively with the data generated (SEGES, 2016). Even if data usage is still relatively
    low, it is expected to increase rapidly (Bennett, 2015, Wolfert et al., 2017,
    World Bank, 2017) An overview about how they are implemented for different purposes
    is presented in the Applications section. 3.2. Network layer The network layer
    communicates the data initially to an intermediary platform and eventually to
    the internet (cloud), and from there to, for example, employed actuators. When
    the data are transferred to the intermediary platform, it typically uses wireless
    communication technologies, for instance RFID, WSN with Zigbee, LoRa (Long Range),
    etc., and more recently Near-Field Communication (NFC) (Kassal et al., 2018, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). The intermediary platform
    is normally an internet gateway located in the vicinity of the connected devices,
    also including sometimes a proxy server, where the data are collected and occasionally
    processed in order to send the information further to the end user through the
    internet by the use of e.g. MQTT standards, or HTML or XMPP protocols. The use
    of Android smart devices or other operating systems is also increasing in popularity
    among agricultural applications, as they can be employed as a gateway for 3G and
    4G networks, and they frequently include other wireless communication technologies,
    e.g. Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPRS and NFC. They also automatically conform to communication
    standards and protocols, in which way interoperability is increased (Balmos et
    al., 2016, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Gao and Yao, 2016, Hernandez-Rojas et
    al., 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). In addition, Android and other smart
    devices can include GNSS and RGB camera sensors, and can relatively easily be
    programmed for computing data and displaying Graphical User Interface (GUI) applications
    being able to straightforwardly update the software if necessary. In that manner,
    Android and similar smart devices are represented in all three IoT layers, i.e.
    sensing in the device layer, node or gateway in the network layer, and computing
    data and displaying GUI in the application layer. Furthermore, the automatic software
    updating possibilities of smart devices allow remote installation of updates with
    new functionalities, bug fixes, etc. and easily improve the interoperability of
    the system (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). Many different wireless technologies
    have been applied for diverse purposes in agriculture, depending on economic,
    accessibility and capability factors. Jawad et al., 2017, Ray, 2017 and Tzounis
    et al. (2017) have presented good overviews of the specifications of wireless
    communication technologies implemented in IoT in an agricultural context, which
    have been here collected in Table 1 and complemented with information from other
    relevant articles (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Elijah et al., 2018, Kassal et al.,
    2018, Sinha et al., 2017, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). The great variety of technologies,
    standards and frequency bands used exposes the relevant interoperability and application
    challenges found when applying IoT technologies. Potential communication standards
    for smart farming can be classified into short-range and long-range according
    to their communication distance, which determines their specific usability in
    different requirement settings. This is particularly the case in arable farming,
    where mobile network accessibility can be an issue in many rural areas, and where
    large farm sizes limit the use of some wireless technologies due to their reduced
    communication distance and due to the necessity to replace/recharge device batteries
    on nodes over large areas. These issues are addressed in the challenges section
    later. Table 1. Wireless communication technologies (adapted from Jawad et al.,

    m 1 mW a Not yet publicly available. A WSN is formed by pervasive devices called
    motes or sensor nodes, which integrate sensors and actuators that communicate
    wirelessly forming a spatial network (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). In a WSN, base stations act as gateways forwarding
    the data to the cloud. Different communication technologies support different
    network node architectures, e.g. star, tree or mesh. Depending on the application,
    different wireless communication technologies are employed in a WSN as each has
    different node architecture possibilities, data rates, ranges, standards, among
    others, with the use of ZigBee, LoRa, Bluetooth/BLE, WiFi and SigFox being relatively
    common in agriculture. In arable farming, BLE has for example been employed for
    soil and air monitoring and irrigation control (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018);
    ZigBee was used in a WSN for monitoring soil conditions and actuating an irrigation
    system (Mafuta et al., 2012) and crop monitoring (Zhai, 2017); and LoRa for air
    and water temperature of rice paddy fields (Tanaka, 2018) and smart irrigation
    control (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018). In order to cover
    larger distances, GPRS is appropriate and has been used for irrigation control
    (López-Riquelme et al., 2017), and for remote maintenance of machinery (Miettinen,
    Oksanen, Suomi, & Visala, 2006). GPRS, or other technologies, such as LTE, or
    3G/4G, are also commonly used at the gateway to transmit data to the cloud. Regarding
    other less common communication technologies used in WSNs, RFID can be integrated
    into a WSN too by connecting the RFID tag readers to a radio-frequency transceiver
    (Costa et al., 2013). Passive and active RFID technologies are used to a great
    extent in agricultural research and industry (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), especially
    for animal production (e.g. Kamilaris et al., 2016), as well as vegetable or fruit
    product traceability (e.g. Kodali, Jain, & Karagwal, 2017); however, in arable
    farming only few examples have been found: e.g. RFID tags used for irrigation
    scheduling (Vellidis, Tucker, Perry, Kvien, & Bednarz, 2008), for agrochemical
    traceability (Peets, Gasparin, Blackburn, & Godwin, 2009), for vehicle monitoring
    (Sjolander, Thomasson, Sui, & Ge, 2011), and even on a prototype for soil temperature
    monitoring (Hamrita & Hoffacker, 2005). Regarding NFC, no concrete examples of
    NFC used in arable farming have been found in the literature reviewed. Finally,
    the latest generation of mobile communications, i.e. 5G, has higher data rates,
    large coverage areas, higher peak throughput, and also improved flexibility, which
    can open new possibilities and may solve some of the challenges encountered by
    many IoT solutions (Alahmadi et al., 2017, Marsch et al., 2016). 5G allows new
    options for monitoring rural areas with no previous infrastructure for Internet
    connection (Faraci, Raciti, Rizzo, & Schembra, 2018). 5G can also improve vehicle-to-vehicle
    or vehicle-to-anything communication in e.g. logistics solutions, due to its low
    latency and new frequency bands (Marsch et al., 2016). A challenge for the 5G
    networks will be the great increase in devices to support once IoT becomes a standard
    solution not only in agriculture, but also in any sphere of everyday life. 3.3.
    Application layer The application layer is crucial in an IoT context as it is
    this layer that actually adds value to the sensed and communicated data through
    directly controlling devices, supporting farmers'' decision making, etc. In this
    layer, several important services occur such as data storage, data analytics,
    data access through an appropriate Application Programming Interface (API), as
    well as possibly a user interfaced software application. The layer may also include
    middleware platforms that aid handling the heterogeneous cloud data improving
    interoperability. Data storage can be cloud based, i.e. on multiple servers, or
    more local based, where data are stored in different types of databases, depending
    on the application and design. Even if relational databases, such as Structured
    Query Language (SQL) databases (Gao and Yao, 2016, Goap et al., 2018, Ray, 2017,
    Wang et al., 2014), MySQL (Kaloxylos et al., 2014), or PostgreSQL (Mazon-Olivo,
    Hernández-Rojas, Maza-Salinas, & Pan, 2018) are employed in some of the reported
    applications in the reviewed articles, non-relational databases, such as Not only
    SQL (NoSQL), or also SPARQL, a semantic query language based database, are gaining
    attention due to their flexibility and scalability, especially when dealing with
    Big Data. Their ability to store and manage large amounts of heterogeneous data
    makes them suitable in many IoT agricultural contexts (Huang and Zhang, 2017,
    Kamilaris et al., 2017). Examples of NoSQL employed in agriculture are Cassandra
    (Huang & Zhang, 2017), Dynamo (Xian, 2017), HBase (Ray, 2017, Wang et al., 2014)
    and MongoDB (Martínez et al., 2016). An example of SPARQL has been given by Jayaraman
    et al. (2016). Data analytics can be achieved by cloud computing, where computer
    resources are managed remotely to analyse data, often Big Data, or by distributed
    computing, e.g. edge and fog computing. Cloud computing has the advantage that
    it provides high quality services that allow independent execution of multiple
    applications as if they were isolated, even if they are on the same platform,
    e.g. in data centres, which is especially relevant when dealing with Big Data
    (Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Martínez et al., 2016, Tzounis et al., 2017). However,
    cloud computing techniques mostly rely on general purpose cloud providers that
    do not comply with specific agricultural service requirements (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017) and can experience latency issues, which are not acceptable in IoT
    solutions where monitoring, control and analysis require fast performance (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2018). Examples of application of cloud computing related to arable farming
    are given by Khattab et al., 2016, Na and Isaac, 2016 and López-Riquelme et al.
    (2017). Khattab et al. (2016) present an IoT architecture with a cloud-based back-end
    where weather and soil data are processed and analysed for automatic activation
    of irrigation and spraying actions. Na and Isaac (2016) describe a human-centric
    IoT architecture with a list of cloud services, such as language translation,
    data simplification or updated market price information. And López-Riquelme et
    al. (2017) use FIWARE components for a cloud service for smart irrigation tasks,
    focussing on the benefits of using FIWARE as cloud provider. Regarding Big Data
    analysis and Big Data in general in an agricultural context, Kamilaris et al.
    (2017) and Wolfert et al. (2017) respectively have performed exhaustive reviews
    on the subject. The use of IoT middleware platforms is gaining interest due to
    its potential for solving different challenges found in the application of IoT,
    especially interoperability. IoT middleware platforms try to simplify the complex
    communication through the cloud due to heterogeneity of devices, communications
    and networks, by using enablers like standardised APIs and protocols (Jayaraman
    et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017). Examples of
    these are HYDRA, UBIWARE, UBIROAD, UBIDOTS, SMEPP, SIXTH, Think Speak, SensorCloud,
    Amazon IoT and IBM IoT, with focus on context aware functionality; SOCRADES, GSN
    and SIRENA, with more focus on security and privacy; Aneka, WSO2, PubNub, SmartFarmNet
    and FIWARE, with a wider services-oriented approach; and projects like IoT-A,
    OpenIoT, or ArrowHead (Gill et al., 2017, Jayaraman et al., 2015, Jayaraman et
    al., 2016, Kamilaris et al., 2016, Martínez et al., 2016, Ray, 2017, Sundmaeker
    et al., 2016). Even if all these and more solutions are found in the IoT market,
    an intelligent middleware solution that addresses most issues observed in smart
    farming successfully is yet to be implemented (Jayaraman et al., 2016, Martínez
    et al., 2016, Sundmaeker et al., 2016). However, FIWARE (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    López-Riquelme et al., 2017, Martínez et al., 2016, Rodriguez et al., 2018) and
    SmartFarmNet (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Jayaraman et al., 2016) have been
    implemented effectively for precision and smart farming applications. In order
    to communicate data across platforms and IoT devices, ensuring interoperability,
    APIs are essential. These should adapt to evolving or new standards in order to
    ensure a longer life span, which may become a limitation if the APIs are not updated.
    It is through the APIs that data are made available for the IoT applications (e.g.
    Goap et al., 2018, Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018). These services may include tracing,
    monitoring, event management, forecasting or optimisation for agricultural activities
    and products. These applications related to arable farming are described in the
    next section. 4. Current and potential applications Multiple applications can
    be derived from the implementation of IoT in arable farming. These applications
    can always be conceptualised into the three IoT layers described previously, and
    are not to be confused with the application layer. Elaborations of the reviewed
    articles show that the applications have been differentiated and categorised as
    follows: monitoring, documentation, forecasting and controlling. Monitoring refers
    to timely sensing of very diverse parameters and is mostly the initial point of
    entry for other applications. Documentation covers the storing of sampled data
    for later use in e.g. farm management or traceability of produce. Forecasting
    employs different sources of data through precisely designed analytic methods
    for predicting concrete events. And controlling is the result of active monitoring,
    where processed data are used to automatically activate and control actuators
    in a predefined manner. A summarising table collects all the IoT applications
    in arable farming described in this chapter (Table 2). Most IoT-based systems
    include at least two of these applications and isolated applications are seldom
    seen. In addition, special attention has been paid to FMIS and associated decision
    support to improve operations and production processes involving vehicle positioning
    analytics, optimisation and logistics, which are key elements in arable farming
    (Bochtis et al., 2011, Bochtis et al., 2014) and have consequently got a section
    of their own. Table 2. IoT applications in arable farming. Applications Examples

    Automatic monitoring is the obvious first step in IoT applied to agriculture.
    Strategically placed sensors can automatically sense and transmit data to the
    cloud for further documentation, forecasting or controlling applications. Sensors
    are used to monitor crop parameters such as leaf area index (e.g. Bauer & Aschenbruck,
    2018), plant height and leaf colour, size and shape (e.g. Okayasu et al., 2017);
    soil parameters such as soil moisture (e.g. Brinkhoff et al., 2017, Kodali and
    Sahu, 2016) or soil chemistry (e.g. Kassal et al., 2018); irrigation water parameters
    such as pH and salinity (e.g. Popović et al., 2017); or weather parameters such
    as air temperature, air pressure, air relative humidity, rainfall, radiation,
    wind speed and wind direction (e.g. Yan et al., 2018). In addition, remote sensing
    can also be employed, i.e. instead of sensors placed in the field they are installed
    on satellites or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV). However, these measurements mostly
    require some form of processing and interpretation as the values sampled are not
    directly related to the targeted parameters. An example of monitoring through
    remote sensing is the estimation of crop biomass and nitrogen content by the use
    of hyper- and multispectral images (Näsi et al., 2018), or the use of thermal
    remote sensing, which has been applied for e.g. irrigation scheduling or plant
    disease detection (Khanal, Fulton, & Shearer, 2017). Furthermore, agricultural
    machinery can also be remotely monitored, e.g. vehicle position and yield data
    (Oksanen et al., 2016), or machine performance (Miettinen et al., 2006). This
    is especially relevant with the increasing appearance of autonomous vehicles and
    robots in agriculture (Sundmaeker et al., 2016). Finally, at farm level the storage
    of crops can also be monitored to ensure the correct control of, for example,
    temperature and moisture, and avoid losses due to damage (Green et al., 2009,
    Juul et al., 2015). Environmental impact indicators should be integrated into
    farm monitoring applications, so that leaching (Burton, Dave, Fernandez, Jayachandran,
    & Bhansali, 2018), contaminants (Severino, D’Urso, Scarfato, & Toraldo, 2018)
    or emissions (Manap & Najib, 2014) are addressed too. 4.2. Documentation and traceability
    Collected operations and process data once stored can be used for documentation.
    Documentation is usually the natural application of monitored data but it must
    be noted that it can also include other types of sampled data, such as manually
    input or documentation of performed control actions (Sørensen, Pesonen, Bochtis,
    Vougioukas, & Suomi, 2011). The data are stored as raw data or as processed data
    at different levels. Documentation is essential for decision-making, controlling
    or analytics, and is an indispensable element in FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    Mapping is also a form of documentation where data are spatially projected onto
    a map. On-the-go sensors installed on vehicles and implements can be used for
    automated field mapping (Fountas, Sørensen et al., 2015), e.g. yield mapping used
    for later fertilisation planning (Lyle, Bryan, & Ostendorf, 2014), or soil mapping
    for site-specific amendment measures (Godwin and Miller, 2003, McBratney et al.,
    2003). Remote sensing can also be used for mapping crop development (Khanal et
    al., 2017, Näsi et al., 2018, Viljanen et al., 2018), or soil texture and residue
    coverage (Khanal et al., 2017). Remote sensing is becoming a popular tool for
    monitoring and mapping, but is yet to be proven feasible for all its potential
    applications. When documentation data sets extend beyond the farm level so that
    they can be traced throughout the supply chain, it is often referred as traceability
    and this notion is a key element in agri-food supply chain management as a measure
    to satisfy, for example, consumer demands (Bochtis and Sørensen, 2014, Pesonen
    et al., 2014). 4.3. Forecasting Forecasting is one of the fundamental functions
    for decision making that IoT brings to agriculture. Access to “real-time” data
    and historical data is used for forecasting events that require some form of action
    for managing successfully the crop or field operation. Therefore, both monitoring
    and documentation are important prerequisites for enabling forecasting. Forecasting
    is employed as preventive measures that require some action due to a predicted
    event, e.g. weeding, irrigating or harvesting. Machine learning and scientific
    modelling are examples of tools employed for forecasting. Different machine learning
    models have been employed, e.g. Artificial Neural Networks for forecasting maximum
    and minimum temperatures at field level (Aliev, 2018) or for estimating levels
    of phosphorus (P) in the soil (Estrada-López, Castillo-Atoche, Vázquez-castillo,
    & Sánchez-Sinencio, 2018); support vector regression method for forecasting soil
    moisture (Goap et al., 2018) or plant disease detection (Aasha Nandhini, Hemalatha,
    Radha, & Indumathi, 2017); gradient boosting for predicting irrigation recommendations
    (Goldstein, Fink, & Meitin, 2018); Bayesian networks and random forest for frost
    prediction (Diedrichs, Bromberg, Dujovne, Brun-laguna, & Watteyne, 2018); multiple
    linear regression and random forest in estimating yield and fertilisation requirements
    for forecasting harvest and fertilisation dates (Viljanen et al., 2018); or also
    for frost prediction using four different machine learning algorithms: decision
    tree, boosted tree, random forest, and regression (Moon, Kim, Zhang, & Woo, 2018).
    A rather different forecasting approach was employed by Jain, Sarangi, Bhatt,
    and Pappula (2018), where three different models, i.e. random forest, support
    vector machine and artificial neural network were used for forecasting diseases
    and at the same time for adaptive data collection from the network of nodes in
    order to reduce data traffic and energy consumption of the network. Summarising,
    IoT is allowing the sampling of large amounts of data, which can be employed as
    training data by the machine learning algorithms to build predictive mathematical
    models. Machine learning is opening new possibilities for effectively forecasting
    events in arable farming, which might change the very nature of decision making
    in agriculture. Scientific modelling has also been employed for forecasting in
    an IoT context, e.g. soil moisture dynamics and contaminant migration forecasting
    using soil sensor data and precipitation forecasts for irrigation scheduling (Severino
    et al., 2018); fungal disease forecast in winter wheat (El Jarroudi et al., 2017)
    and barley (Mäyrä, Ruusunen, Jalli, Jauhiainen, & Leiviskä, 2018); or forecasting
    field trafficability and workability for field operations (Edwards, White, Munkholm,
    Sørensen, & Lamandé, 2016). These modelling tools have an important role in agriculture
    as they are conscientiously developed and validated by the scientific community,
    and can forecast events for which machine learning models are very limited. There
    is also considerable potential for integrating existing and acknowledged modelling
    tools such as the soil-crop-atmosphere system model DAISY (Abrahamsen & Hansen,
    2000) or the soil erosion model RUSLE (Renard, Foster, Weesies, & Porter, 1991)
    into an IoT solution. Many of these solutions can make agriculture in general,
    and arable farming in particular, more resource efficient, e.g. through smart
    irrigation, as well as environmentally friendly, e.g. by smart pest and disease
    management. 4.4. Controlling In IoT, controlling is the result of active monitoring
    in an automated system, where the monitored variables are automatically adjusted
    to, for example, predefined thresholds. Forecasting can also play an important
    role in controlling. This is, for example, the case in smart irrigation systems,
    where irrigation is activated before drought damage in the crop is recognised,
    thus reducing yield losses. Goap et al. (2018) employed real-time sensing of soil
    moisture and soil temperature in combination with weather forecasts to control
    a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. Sensors on-the-go installed in tractors
    and implements can also be used to control e.g. variable rate fertilisation (Peets
    et al., 2012), site-specific weed control technologies (Christensen et al., 2009),
    or in-row cultivation controlled by plant patterns in precision seeding (Midtiby,
    Steen, & Green, 2018). Controlling is crucial in smart farming as it allows the
    automation of systems, especially considering the operations of autonomous vehicles
    and robots in the fields (Bechar & Vigneault, 2016), where site-specific actions
    and sensing-based safety systems will play an important role, e.g. for in-field
    obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles (Christiansen, Nielsen, Steen, Jørgensen,
    & Karstoft, 2016). 4.5. FMIS FMIS can be defined as systems that store and process
    farm-related collected data and provide decision supporting tools for farm management
    (Paraforos et al., 2016). FMIS assist farmers in the execution and documentation
    of farm activities, their evaluation and optimisation, as well as in strategic,
    tactical and operational planning of the farm operations (Kaloxylos et al., 2014).
    FMIS are consequently systems that can encapsulate all the applications previously
    described, and are vital elements in smart farm management. However, the adoption
    of FMIS targeted to the new IoT technologies is slow. A study published in 2015
    showed that most FMIS architectures used at that time had been designed in the
    1980s by researchers. This may explain why most FMIS currently have a structure
    and an architecture that is not suitable for distributed and service oriented
    decision support required for supporting precision agriculture and smart farming
    solutions, e.g. 75% of FMIS are still PC-based, and functionalities regarding
    traceability, quality assurance and agronomic best practice estimate are still
    missing or in their initial development stages in most commercial FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al., 2015). FMIS are key in smart farming and they should support
    automatic data acquisition, monitoring, documenting, planning and decision making
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). The latest research on IoT-based FMIS is expected
    to become part of the commercial FMIS available in the near future and will cover
    different needs across the supply chain and needs of IoT-based agriculture as
    a whole, as well as complying with standards ensuring interoperability between
    systems. In addition, decision support systems (DSS) are essential in dealing
    with Big Data and assisting the farm manager in management and decision making
    in tasks such as farm financial analysis, business processes or supply chain functions
    (Fountas, Carli et al., 2015, Kaloxylos et al., 2012). In order to design an up-to-date
    FMIS, it is beneficial to make preliminary use of dedicated system analysis methodologies,
    such as soft system methodologies (SSM), for identifying required changes and
    constraints and proposing solutions, followed by a later hard system modelling
    for designing the required specifications and components of the system (Sørensen
    et al., 2010, Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015). It is also necessary to base FMIS
    on the cloud as it allows interconnection with diverse additional services (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). This development points out the inevitable need for standardisation
    of APIs in order to achieve interoperability among applications and services as
    part of the FMIS. New technologies such as distributed management systems can
    also enhance the capabilities of FMIS to a great extent (Fountas, Sørensen et
    al., 2015). Furthermore, the introduction of agricultural moving robots in the
    near future, as well as the wireless and automatic control and monitoring of agricultural
    machinery, also needs to be considered in the design and development of FMIS (Fountas,
    Sørensen et al, 2015, Paraforos et al., 2016). The future FMIS will also be capable
    of emulating farmers different work habits, as the system will automate certain
    tasks previously performed by farmers, which will require additional training
    (Sørensen et al., 2011). Consequently, it is important to provide supportive adoption
    and transition strategies for conventional farming to convert into smart farming
    (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018). Examples of current FMIS employed in arable farming
    are offered by different technology providers: machine manufacturers, institutions
    or targeted private companies. Some manufacturers provide their own farm management
    tools, such as Agricultural Management Solutions (AMS) from John Deere, or Precision
    Land Management (PLM) from New Holland. Across brands some FMIS have a more local
    approach, e.g. the Dutch Akkerweb developed by Wageningen University and Research,
    while other commercial solutions have a global approach, e.g. 365FarmNet, Agworld
    or FarmWorks. 4.6. Vehicle navigation, optimisation and logistics Navigation systems
    are widely used in arable farming with the successful implementation of auto-steering
    systems in tractors and harvesters. However, IoT-based solutions are still in
    their early stages. IoT-based field operation monitoring (Oksanen et al., 2016)
    or monitoring of motor and machine performance (Pfeiffer & Blank, 2015) have been
    effectively implemented on harvesting operations. Commercial examples of agricultural
    telematics are Trimble''s Connected Farm, AGCO''s AgCommand, John Deer JDLink,
    New Holland''s PLM Connect or CLAAS’ telematics; however, they are all closed
    systems, which limits greatly the possibilities of the IoT technologies, especially
    interoperability (Oksanen, Piirainen, & Seilonen, 2015). Regarding optimised route
    planning, pre-planning harvest operations based on field data using simulation
    models can improve the harvest capacity of the vehicle or fleet saving working
    hours as well as fuel consumption (Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Bochtis and Sørensen,
    2009, Busato et al., 2007, Jensen et al., 2012, Zhou et al., 2014). However, field
    complexity and vehicle fleet size can become major hurdles for the algorithms
    employed (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019, Skou-Nielsen et al., 2017). The accessibility
    of field and harvest data can be eased by IoT technologies that allow automated
    data collection and sharing via common communication protocols and standards,
    in interoperable data formats, with compatible data model hierarchies; however,
    this is not always the case (Tzounis et al., 2017). IoT also allows cloud or fog
    computing to be employed to solve the high computational requirements of these
    route planning models (Seyyedhasani et al., 2019), even though the computing can
    also be achieved at the edge (Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Data communication
    costs, latency problems and unstable mobile connectivity may pose important challenges
    for route planning applications that rely only on cloud computing, making mobile
    edge computing more adequate and robust for these systems. Nevertheless, true
    IoT-based dynamic route planning is still in its infancy but gaining increasing
    attention, especially with the arrival of agricultural robots (Bechar and Vigneault,
    2016, Kayacan et al., 2015). Concerning its application, until recently, harvest
    logistics has employed field sampled data, i.e. boundaries, obstacles, gates,
    etc., to optimise the route of the vehicles involved in the operation statically
    (e.g. Bakhtiari et al., 2011, Jensen et al., 2012), where the complete routes
    of all vehicles are planned a priori. Nevertheless, these plans often do not comply
    with real-world challenges as they do not adapt to variating inputs, e.g. vehicle
    speed changes or in-field yield variations, or to unforeseen situations, e.g.
    machine breakdowns, eventual out of field delays, non-trafficable wet spots, undefined
    obstacles, etc. There is consequently the need to integrate route optimisation
    and operation logistics in IoT systems, where the optimisation can adapt dynamically
    to varying input and unforeseen events. It is only in the last few years that
    harvest logistics really started adapting dynamically to parameters such as vehicles''
    behaviour or in-field yield variations (Edwards et al., 2017, Seyyedhasani and
    Dvorak, 2018, Villa-Henriksen et al., 2018). Today, new possibilities for optimising
    infield operations arrive with the large amount of data available via internet,
    e.g. remote sensing data or other collected spatial data. These could be adaptive
    planning based on trafficability maps for reducing soil compaction or avoiding
    vehicles getting stuck in wet spots; or selective harvesting based on predicted
    grain quality maps, which is expected to increase the value of the crop harvested.
    5. Challenges and solutions When implementing IoT in arable farming, as well as
    in other contexts, diverse challenges limit or affect the performance of the systems
    employed. The challenges identified in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5) can indicate
    which areas need to be taken into account when designing an IoT-based system or
    point out areas that require further research. However, the results presented
    in the figure are indicative and do not necessarily describe the importance of
    the challenges included, especially because of the multiple applications and implementation
    designs that are conceivable in arable farming. Any of the challenges can become
    crucial in different setups, and are therefore described. In addition, all challenges
    can be related to or have consequences for other challenges. Download : Download

    of challenges mentioned by the literature reviewed, divided by time periods and
    grouped in IoT layers. Interoperability, in general, is a major hurdle in the
    application of IoT. There are different dimensions related to it: technical, syntactical,
    semantic and organisational (Serrano et al., 2015, Veer and Wiles, 2008). Technical
    interoperability refers mostly to the communication protocols which affect the
    hardware and software components implemented. Syntactical interoperability is
    usually related to data formats, their syntax and encoding. Semantic interoperability
    concerns the interpretation of data contents, i.e. the meaning of the information
    exchanged. And organisational interoperability involves intercommunication of
    meaningful information across organisations regardless of information systems
    and infrastructures in a world-wide scale. As interoperability is such a generic
    term, in this section, technical interoperability has been addressed as part of
    the communication protocol challenge, syntactical and semantic interoperability
    have been included under the data heterogeneity challenge, and organisational
    interoperability have been described under the scalability challenge. 5.1. General
    challenges 5.1.1. Revenue and affordability Often the investment for establishing
    an IoT-based solution is high and as such challenging for small-scale farmers,
    while larger farms can more easily acquire IoT-based technologies when investing
    in new equipment (Brewster et al., 2017). The uncertainty regarding required costs,
    e.g. fuel or water allocations, and selling prices of the product give little
    margin for many farmers for investing in new technologies (Higgins et al., 2017).
    Trust plays an important role when investing in IoT systems, and relieving the
    perceived risks by demonstrating the revenues from their adoption is essential
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016, Jayashankar et al., 2018). For example, in Europe
    70% of all fertilising and spraying machinery is equipped with at least one precision
    agriculture technology, but only 25% of farmers actually use precision agriculture
    components on their farms (Say, Keskin, Sehri, & Sekerli, 2017). Technology providers
    need to increase the perceived value by demonstrating the financial return from
    IoT in order to diminish the perceived risk of adoption many farmers have. Technology
    providers need also to provide robust tools that are aligned with farmer needs
    and practices in order to gain acceptance and trust of IoT technologies. These
    technologies need to reduce the workload, assist in decision making and improve
    the efficiency of the targeted practice. Additionally, technology providers need
    to develop interoperable and flexible solutions that can easily be integrated
    and comply with accepted standards. Governments can also incentivise IoT adoption
    by policies and regulations, especially regarding documentation and traceability
    as ICT eases paperwork and bureaucracy. A reduction in the percentage of mentions
    regarding this challenge (see Fig. 5) could indicate that IoT is being more adopted
    in arable farming. In addition, IoT is likely to reshape the arable farming business.
    The implementation of monitoring and control of farming operations are generating
    substantial amounts of valuable data that are essential for the business of technology
    providers. The way farmers will dive into the data economy, i.e. connecting their
    data to work in vertical and horizontal networks beyond the farm, will have an
    effect on their business models, as well as on the business models of technology
    providers. The point of view of the farmer''s business regarding IoT has not been
    fully addressed in the literature reviewed and will require further investigation.
    5.1.2. Data heterogeneity The diverse data sources and sensor manufacturers imply
    use of different unit systems, data structures and nomenclatures in different
    data formats, which result in reduced syntactical and semantic interoperability
    among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded in binary, or represented in
    formats such as json, xml, text (e.g. csv), shapefile, or even proprietary formats.
    The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also affect the performance of
    a protocol employed for communicating the information. Furthermore, this challenge
    becomes critical in situations such as system integration or sharing data with
    other systems (e.g. FMIS), which could imply developing data conversion tools
    or even redesign of the IoT setup. The use of standardised formats can help with
    this challenge. Some attempts have been made at producing standards or standardised
    formats that cover the great heterogeneity of agricultural data, e.g. ISO 11783
    (ISOBUS) developed by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming
    (Fountas, Sørensen et al, 2015, Miettinen et al., 2006, Oksanen et al., 2015,
    Peets et al., 2012) or AgroXML developed by the Association for Technologies and
    Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) mainly for FMIS (Kaloxylos et al., 2014, Köksal
    and Tekinerdogan, 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Peets et al., 2012). These
    are now being integrated by the non-profit organisation AgGateway through the
    ADAPT framework and SPADE project for seamlessly communicating agricultural machinery
    data to FMIS, trying to enhance the existing standards and as a consequence improve
    interoperability (Brewster et al., 2017). A drawback of comprehensive data models,
    which try to describe all attributes of agricultural data, is that they become
    too cumbersome to handle in many applications. Finally, the use of middleware
    platforms applicable in smart farming, e.g. FIWARE or SmartFarmNet, can also reduce
    the problems caused by data heterogeneity (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018, Ferreira
    et al., 2017, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). 5.1.3. Scalability
    and flexibility Organisational interoperability is a key element concerning scalability
    and flexibility (Serrano et al., 2015, Tzounis et al., 2017, Verdouw, 2016). Many
    of the systems described in the literature reviewed are centralised, closed, difficult
    to integrate in other existing platforms or difficult to implement on larger scales,
    different farming systems or geographical areas. They are also challenging to
    integrate beyond the farm level and across the supply chain in order to provide
    agri-food safety and traceability. The use of standardised dynamic protocols,
    such as SOAP protocol (cloud-based infrastructures with extensible ontologies
    that cover the broad and diverse agricultural production systems and environments),
    fast and reliable APIs (e.g. RESTful) and middleware platforms applicable for
    smart agriculture, such as FIWARE with its generic enablers, are tools that are
    employed to achieve organisational interoperability and make the system developed
    more scalable and flexible (Ferreira et al., 2017, López-Riquelme et al., 2017,
    O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Serrano et al., 2015). Service-Oriented Architectures
    (SOA) also bring possibilities to effectively integrate ecosystems through open
    and standardised interfaces, increasing organisational interoperability (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014, Köksal and Tekinerdogan, 2018, Kruize et al., 2016, Pesonen et al.,
    2014, Sørensen and Bochtis, 2010). Scalability and flexibility may also refer
    to WSNs in the literature, to their capacity to support an increasing number of
    devices/nodes, with the network architecture, the gateway and protocols used being
    the main constrains (Elijah et al., 2018). This challenge has been considered
    under the network size challenge. 5.1.4. Robustness and fault tolerance Many different
    factors can affect the overall robustness and fault tolerance of a system. Robust
    wireless connectivity is an important limitation in many setups (Oksanen et al.,
    2016, Vuran et al., 2018). In the design of an IoT-based solution dealing with
    faults, errors and unforeseen events need to be taken into account in order to
    ensure the reliability of the system. Many of these issues are related to the
    other challenges presented here and can be handled at the device level, but also
    need to be thought of in the overall IoT system design (Ferreira et al., 2017,
    Ray, 2017). 5.1.5. Complexity The agricultural system is complex and can be challenging
    to work with. It is complex not only because of the multifaceted nature of the
    physical, chemical and/or biological processes in the soil-crop-air system, but
    also because of the technical complexity of hardware and software interacting
    with it. Depending on the novelty of the IoT technology implemented and the background
    of the developer and user, the systems can become more or less complex. For example,
    software and hardware incompatibilities can challenge its implementation and integration
    (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016), as well as many other challenges, e.g. the great
    field task diversity in arable farming, that can add complexity to the system.
    Technical knowledge can become a major hurdle for the implementation of IoT in
    farms, and it is therefore important that user-friendliness and plug-and-play
    basis have a high priority for the technology providers (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Zou and Quan, 2017). Complexity should be an issue for the technology provider
    and not for the customer. In addition, the co-created development and implementation
    of IoT systems in agriculture by a multi-actor approach is needed to overcome
    the complexity at different levels of integrating IoT in agriculture. Good examples
    of this are the European Union supported research and development efforts through
    multi-actor large-scale pilot projects, such as IoF2020 (Sundmaeker et al., 2016,
    Verdouw et al., 2017), AIOTI (Pérez-Freire & Brillouet, 2015), SmartAgriFood (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2012), SMART AKIS (Djelveh & Bisevac, 2016), or more recently SmartAgriHubs
    (Chatzikostas et al., 2019). 5.1.6. Lack of products In the early stages of precision
    agriculture and IoT in agriculture, products that integrated agronomy and ICT
    engineering were lacking, which hindered their adoption (Ferrández-Pastor et al.,
    2016, Kitchen and Roger, 2007). The large scales and diversity of environments
    in arable farming can challenge the products used even more than in controlled
    environments, as they are to be modelled to describe larger areas, send information
    through larger distances and be exposed to harsher environments. Even if Figure
    5 shows lack of references in the last couple of years, it is still relevant for
    some applications, e.g. for in-situ real-time soil nutrient sensing is still a
    real challenge, especially regarding calibration (Bünemann et al., 2018, Marín-González
    et al., 2013). 5.2. Device layer challenges 5.2.1. Power consumption The use of
    wireless devices has major advantages over wired systems, as they are more economical
    to establish and can cover much wider areas. However, their power consumption,
    with limited battery life, is a major drawback of many wireless systems, and needs
    to be accounted for. This issue is so important that it is the main identified
    challenge in the literature reviewed (Fig. 5), especially for WSNs (Jawad et al.,
    2017, Tan and Panda, 2010). The large distances to cover in arable farming make
    wireless devices indispensable, and solutions to reduce their power consumption
    and/or extend their battery life are required. These solutions can include energy
    harvesting, low power consumption sensors and communication technologies or power
    efficient management. Energy harvesting techniques can include solar cells, micro
    wind turbines or other interesting solutions which have been well described by
    Tuna and Gungor (2016) and Jawad et al. (2017). The power consumption of the communication
    technologies and sensors employed are also to be considered in the design of the
    IoT solution as there are big differences between devices (Balmos et al., 2016,
    Hernandez-Rojas et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). Choosing low power sensors
    and communication devices needs to be taken into account when designing the IoT
    system (Estrada-López et al., 2018). Low power wireless technologies, such as
    BLE, have low power consumption but also low communication range, while Wi-Fi
    has somewhat higher communication range, but much higher power consumption (Table
    1), however data rates and other parameters are important factors to consider
    too. ZigBee and LoRa have been identified as appropriate candidates for many farming
    applications (Jawad et al., 2017). Power efficient management techniques of WSNs
    include sleep/active schemes, e.g. duty-cycling algorithms (Ahmed, Abdalla et
    al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Alahmadi et al., 2017, Balmos et al., 2016,
    Dhall and Agrawal, 2018, Temprilho et al., 2018); data mitigation schemes, e.g.
    data aggregation (Abdel-basset, Shawky, & Eldrandaly, 2018) or data compression
    (Moon et al., 2018); energy-efficient routing schemes, e.g. mobile sinks by the
    use of UAVs (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018,
    Uddin et al., 2018); and other combined solutions, e.g. LEACH, a cluster architecture
    with Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) based MAC protocol and data aggregation
    scheme (Kamarudin, Ahmad, & Ndzi, 2016), or dynamic power management by combining
    sleep/active states with dynamic data rates schemes (Estrada-López et al., 2018).
    Jawad et al. (2017) have provided a good overview and description of WSN power
    efficient management techniques. Lastly, techniques such as edge computing may
    have higher power requirements on the device, making cloud computing more desirable
    if power consumption is a constraint in the projected IoT solution. On the other
    hand, mounting sensors and devices on agricultural vehicles and implements allows
    connection to the power supply of the vehicle and as a consequence eliminate power
    consumption as a limiting factor. The type of sensors that are mounted on vehicles
    and their implements is quite limited, being currently mainly camera-based (e.g.
    Midtiby et al., 2018, Steen et al., 2012). Nevertheless, there is for example
    potential in employing sensors on the coulters of seed-drills for mapping soil
    properties (Nielsen et al., 2017), or other on-the-go sensors for mapping soil
    or crop variations (Peets et al., 2012). 5.2.2. Harsh device environment The natural
    environment in which sensors and other devices are placed can greatly challenge
    their functionality and longevity. Harsh weather conditions, e.g. large temperature
    variations, intense rainfall or prolonged high humidity can cause water condensation
    inside devices and consequently provoke corrosion and short circuits (Bauer &
    Aschenbruck, 2018). Sensors and other devices situated close to the ground experience
    exposure to dust, mud, or even corrosive chemicals, e.g. agro-chemicals, which
    can seriously damage the performance of the device or cause its total failure
    (Aliev, 2018, Bauer and Aschenbruck, 2018). Underground chemical sensors are also
    exposed to soil chemical and biological processes that deteriorate the sensors
    and can mislead the measurements, requiring unfeasible maintenance and re-calibrations
    (Burton et al., 2018, Kassal et al., 2018). Choosing adequate casing that does
    not interfere with the functionality of the device and also tolerates the environment
    they are located in is essential in the design of the IoT system. Sensors are
    also developed for different conditions, and need to match the system''s minimum
    requirements. RFID tags have been reported to perform flawlessly under extreme
    conditions and environments (Costa et al., 2013, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011);
    however, RFID technology is quite limited in its applications in arable farming,
    and suitable sensors and communication devices are therefore primarily dependent
    on the application and design of the IoT system. 5.3. Network layer challenges
    5.3.1. Latency, throughput and rate The large amounts of data generated in IoT
    applications do not only cause problems regarding data storage or handling, but
    also latency problems that reduce the throughput of the network employed. In arable
    farming, latency problems can be of great importance in some IoT solutions, e.g.
    in WSNs where high latency implies higher power consumption of a node (López-Riquelme
    et al., 2017), or in dynamic optimised route planning in vehicle logistics, which
    requires rapid responses to deviations in the route plan (Villa-Henriksen et al.,
    2018). For reducing latency problems, fog and edge computing can be employed,
    as these computing techniques decrease latency and network congestion (Elijah
    et al., 2018, Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2018), e.g. data compression at the edge
    reduces the large volumes of data communicated through the network (Moon et al.,
    2018). In addition, the use of lightweight protocols can also reduce latency problems,
    e.g. LP4S for sensors (Hernández-rojas, Fernández-Caramés, Fraga-Lamas, & Escudero,
    2018), or MQTT messaging protocol, which has a faster throughput than HTTP and
    works well for bandwidth limited networks (Estrada-López et al., 2018). The communication
    rate is important to have in mind when planning the wireless communication technology
    to implement, e.g. 5G can handle high-rates, while SigFox or IEEE 802.15.4-based
    protocols are for low-rates (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton,
    Gotta et al., 2018, Jawad et al., 2017). The throughput of the network affects
    the communication rate, and the communication rate also influences the power consumption,
    which equally has to be carefully considered. Fast response to events is achieved
    by data processing techniques such as data merging (Tanaka, 2018), data compression
    (Zhao, Lin et al., 2018, Zhao, Lucani et al., 2018), or dynamic and complex event
    processing rules for conditioning input data and immediately acting accordingly
    (Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018). These processes can be on the cloud or at the edge,
    i.e. devices. Finally, test-bed analysis prior to implementation of the network
    can simulate communication rates and possible latency and throughput issues (Stewart,
    Stewart, & Kennedy, 2017). 5.3.2. Wireless link quality A low wireless link quality
    affects greatly the QoS of an IoT system as it ends in unreliable communication
    between nodes (Klaina, Alejos, Aghzout, & Falcone, 2018). This can be caused by
    multipath propagation (Ruiz-Garcia & Lunadei, 2011), background noise (Mazon-Olivo
    et al., 2018), routing problems, e.g. packet collision or limited band width (Jawad
    et al., 2017), or even by harsh environmental conditions, which affect the transceivers
    and the quality of the data transmitted (Elijah et al., 2018). Adequate design
    and testing of the network are crucial for avoiding or reducing this challenge.
    However, techniques such as channel access methods, e.g. TDMA, can improve the
    link quality by reducing packet collisions (Temprilho et al., 2018). Regarding
    testing, the calculation of signal strengths in real-time on the base station
    helps estimating the wireless link quality of a WSN when establishing the system
    (Klaina et al., 2018). Packet loss characterisation can also be used to assess
    the wireless link quality of a connection (Bacco, Berton, Ferro et al., 2018,
    Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018). Additionally, blind entity identification
    can also help estimating the wireless link quality of a network (Mukherjee, Misra,
    Raghuwanshi, & Mitra, 2018). 5.3.3. Communication range The different wireless
    communication technologies have very diverse ranges, which need to be accounted
    for when designing the IoT solution, together with other factors such as data
    rate, power consumption, communication protocols or costs (Table 1). In arable
    farming, due to the larger farm sizes and because of the employment of mobile
    sensors and devices on vehicles, this challenge becomes even more critical. Furthermore,
    relying on the approximate communication range of a wireless technology can be
    misleading, e.g. WiFi is often described to have 100 m range, but a test analysing
    the packet delivery ratio with respect to distance to gateway shows packet losses
    at ≥ 60 m (Giordano, Seitanidis, Ojo, Adami, & Vignoli, 2018), while in another
    test using WiField devices, 2.6 km range was claimed to be reached still having
    reliable internet connection (Brinkhoff et al., 2017). Testing the communication
    range is therefore important for some settings. In addition to the choice of wireless
    technology, network topology in WSNs, such as mesh topologies can also increase
    the communication range by using nodes to communicate with the central node (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018). Reduced range due to obstacles
    or topography is addressed in the propagation losses challenge later. 5.3.4. Communication
    protocols Differences in communication protocols can cause technical interoperability
    issues, which can lead to connectivity and compatibility issues among the hardware
    and software employed (Stočes et al., 2016). Network protocols are separated into
    diverse layers forming a protocol stack, where tasks are divided into smaller
    steps (Suhonen, Kohvakka, Kaseva, Hämäläinen, & Hännikäinen, 2012). In the infrastructure
    layer, some wireless standards that define communication protocols are commonly
    used by different wireless technologies, e.g. IEEE 802.15.4, which is used by
    ZigBee or 6LowPAN among others, or 3GPP, which is used by GPRS, LTE or 5G among
    others (see Table 1). In the application layer, standards such as HTTP (Ahmed,
    Abdalla et al., 2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Kaloxylos et al., 2014), MQTT (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016, Mazon-Olivo et al., 2018) or XMPP (Köksal & Tekinerdogan, 2018)
    are commonly used in IoT applications in arable farming. Adequate protocols are
    especially relevant and challenging in vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and crucial
    in arable farming. Different standards in different layers require careful planning
    of the whole IoT solution, as they are not always compatible and can also have
    an effect on the data formats used, or sensors and gateways employed (Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018). Middleware platforms can ease the integration of diverse protocols
    and standards by offering enough abstraction levels so that this diversity is
    effectively managed (O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Tuna et al., 2017). Edge computing
    can also ease technical interoperability issues as a local computing layer is
    created to process data and create control rules before sending the data to the
    cloud (Ferrández-Pastor et al., 2016). 5.3.5. Network management Managing a WSN
    can imply battery change, software updates, calibration of sensors, replacement
    of devices and similar maintenance activities that can be very time-consuming.
    Smart mobile devices, e.g. smart phones, can make remote software updating possible,
    and can sometimes even be used for updating some other IoT devices (Ferrández-Pastor
    et al., 2016). Using energy efficient devices and communication techniques can
    also be employed to extend the battery life of devices (Jawad et al., 2017). Some
    sensors may require recalibrations with a certain periodicity, which has to be
    accounted for in the projected IoT solution (Kassal et al., 2018). Nonetheless,
    the management of the network is always to be considered when implementing IoT
    solutions in arable farming, where distances and number of devices/nodes can be
    vast. 5.3.6. Network size WSN configuration schemes have a maximum number of sensor
    nodes per gateway that the network can handle, i.e. the network size. According
    to the analysis of the reviewed literature, network size is being identified more
    often in the last two years (see Fig. 5), which seems to indicate new possibilities
    for exploiting the capabilities of WSNs. Network size depends on the wireless
    communication technology employed and can affect other parameters, such as data
    latency or scalability of the network (Balmos et al., 2016). Network topologies
    can also influence the network size and vary from simple star network (e.g. Hernandez-Rojas
    et al., 2018) to more advanced multi-hop mesh networks (Ahmed, Abdalla et al.,
    2018, Ahmed, De et al., 2018, Langendoen et al., 2006) that can increase the network
    size by using network nodes as relays to reach a central node and gateway. Optimisation
    algorithms have been used to find the best spatial distribution of WSN nodes,
    and therefore to assist in the optimisation of its network size (Abdel-basset
    et al., 2018). 5.3.7. Propagation losses Even though propagation losses can become
    a big problem for WSNs in application areas like fruit orchards and tree plantations,
    in arable farming hedges, trees, big rocks or sheds, as well as pronounced topography,
    like hills and valleys, can also block, diffract or scatter the signal reducing
    the communication range and causing data packet losses. Additionally, weather
    conditions can also degrade the wireless connectivity propagation of signals (Jawad
    et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Stewart et al., 2017). To avoid or reduce
    these problems, adequate planning of the location of the sensor nodes, the antenna
    height, the communication protocols and the network topology is necessary. Regarding
    network topologies, mesh networks compared to star networks can reduce propagation
    losses as well as increase communication range (Kamarudin et al., 2016, Ruiz-Garcia
    and Lunadei, 2011). Moreover, propagation modelling can help planning, reduce
    communication tests and ensure Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous wireless
    networks (Jawad et al., 2017, Stewart et al., 2017, Kamarudin et al., 2016, Klaina
    et al., 2018, Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011). 5.4. Application layer challenges
    5.4.1. Data analysis Data analysis can in some cases become an important challenge,
    especially when dealing with Big Data, which is data in such amounts, heterogeneity
    and complexity that they need new data management techniques for analysis (Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Agricultural Big Data are worthless unless analysed; however, analysis
    can be very challenging because of the volume, diversity, and quality (e.g. errors
    and duplications). This is especially challenging in arable farming, where larger
    amounts of heterogeneous data are generated at diverse rates and from very different
    sources. The literature reviewed show an increased identification of this challenge
    in the last two years compared with the previous 6 years (see Fig. 5). This evolution
    might be caused by increased access and use of agricultural Big Data in recent
    times (Kamilaris et al., 2017, Pham and Stack, 2018). Techniques for lowering
    data dimensionality can ease the analysis by applying feature reduction models,
    which reduce data size by eliminating unnecessary data dimensions (Sabarina &
    Priya, 2015). Cloud computing provides the flexibility and scalability necessary
    for Big Data analysis, where numerous users operate simultaneously with the large
    and complex datasets (Gill et al., 2017). Likewise, cloud platforms are perfect
    for storing such large amounts of data, where NoSQL databases can store and manage
    these large unstructured datasets (Kamilaris et al., 2017). The analysis of Big
    Data can potentially be used, for example, for policy-making, reducing environmental
    negative impact, improve food-safety, as well as improved farm management and
    production, benefiting the different stakeholders involved (Kamilaris et al.,
    2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). Another facet to data analysis is the growing use
    of machine learning techniques, which are being used for exploring Big Data and
    identifying important factors and their interrelationship that affect agricultural
    production systems like, for example, identifying diverse patterns (e.g. crop
    development stages, weeds or diseases) as part of machine vision systems (Bacco,
    Berton, Ferro et al., 2018, Bacco, Berton, Gotta et al., 2018, Reshma and Pillai,
    2018). In these cases, the model is built upon a sample of data, often called
    training data, whose size and quality directly affects the final model. Choosing
    the adequate approach for building the model with the available data is also essential
    for the success of the IoT solution. 5.4.2. Data security and privacy Even though
    data security and privacy do not constitute a high challenge in the literature
    reviewed, they are certainly major concerns for the farmers, i.e. the suppliers
    of data and also end-users of the technology developed, who have little trust
    in service providers'' use of data (Jayashankar et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2017).
    Also, data ownership needs to be taken into consideration as raw data and processed
    data in IoT systems have different ownership and are accessible by different actors,
    affecting the necessary requirements for data security and privacy (Kaloxylos
    et al., 2014). Research and development focus has been on sensing, processing,
    controlling and computing, while less effort has been devoted to solving security
    threats, risks and privacy (Tuna et al., 2017). Other issues like cost effectiveness
    in, for example, cloud services are also affecting the security of the data, which
    eventually affects the whole privacy and security of the IoT solution, as low-cost
    services have lower security (Dhinari, Newe, Lewis, & Nizamani, 2017). Technology
    providers should prioritise data security and privacy in their business models.
    The availability of privacy and security technologies that are dynamic enough
    to support the vast numbers and variety of stakeholders, as well as the complexity
    of the network, is still a major challenge that needs to be overcome (Verdouw,
    2016). Many solutions are being employed to reduce data security and privacy issues
    in each of the IoT layers of the system, e.g. encryption algorithms, intrusion
    detection mechanisms, authentication, secure routing protocols, anonymisation,
    etc. (Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Middleware platforms are employed
    to add a security layer between network and applications, which can include confidentiality,
    anonymity and security to the system (Rodriguez et al., 2018, Serrano et al.,
    2015, Tuna et al., 2017, Tzounis et al., 2017). Additionally, newer technologies
    such as blockchain are aiming to solve many of the challenges related to privacy
    and security as well as transparency of the IoT. In agriculture, it is mainly
    being applied in the food supply chain (Bermeo-Almeida et al., 2018). Blockchain
    make sense for IoT platforms where large amounts of confidential data are handled.
    5.4.3. Data quality and availability Some of the challenges previously described
    have a direct influence on data quality, e.g. propagation losses, wireless link
    quality, robustness and fault tolerance. Anomaly detection and similar methods
    have been employed to identify faulty data before analysis (Cadavid et al., 2018,
    Lyle et al., 2014). The poor quality of data or its limited availability can limit
    many applications that involve Big Data analytics, modelling and machine learning,
    which can affect or even compromise the success of some IoT solutions (Balducci
    et al., 2018, O''Grady and O''Hare, 2017, Wolfert et al., 2017). In these setups,
    and specifically in arable farming, many datasets are integrated from different
    sources and sensors, and the quality or scarcity of some data can become a major
    hurdle to overcome. Ensuring quality and availability of the data before starting
    such a project is required. Even if it is not always possible to gather all the
    data necessary to develop models, perform correct analytics or train machine learning
    algorithms, scientific assumptions (Severino et al., 2018), data augmentation
    (Diedrichs et al., 2018) or simulated data (Wolanin et al., 2019) are used to
    help or solve the encountered challenge. 5.4.4. Context-awareness (metadata) Context-awareness
    is an important and distinctive feature of Smart Farming as compared to Precision
    Farming, because it automatically includes descriptive data from e.g. fields,
    sensors, machines, i.e. metadata. Metadata can include information about the date
    and time, node identification number, data of calibration, height and position
    information, or even descriptive data about an experiment objective, field, machinery,
    crop genotype or soil information at the sensor placement (Jayaraman et al., 2015).
    Metadata about sensor nodes in the system are crucial for providing contextual
    information so that correct data analysis can be performed (Jayaraman et al.,
    2016, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness helps computing techniques to decide what
    data is to be analysed, and consequently easing the computations, and the lack
    of this data complicate data analysis substantially. This is especially relevant
    in arable farming, where the system has to handle both spatial and temporal data
    and make decisions based on the data collected. The use of standards, formats
    and middleware that support metadata is therefore important to have in mind during
    the planning of an IoT solution (Peets et al., 2009, Ray, 2017). Context-awareness
    facilitates new business models and strategies for data analytics and DSS software
    providers. 6. Conclusions and future perspectives A literature review of current
    and foreseeable IoT technologies and systems in arable farming was carried out.
    This has included an overview of the state of the art of IoT technologies, an
    outline of the current and potential applications, and a thorough description
    of the challenges and solutions. From this survey, the role smart mobile phones
    play is highlighted, especially Android devices, which are employed in different
    ways for a wide diversity of applications, due to their availability, connectivity,
    interoperability, programmable ease and computational power. The introduction
    of 5G networks in the near future will enhance the capabilities of smart mobile
    devices due to their enhanced performance. The intelligent management of WSN as
    well as the capabilities of improved communication technologies can also solve
    some of the challenges IoT-based solutions are experiencing. The role of middleware
    platforms and generic enablers are expected to gain acceptance and importance,
    as they can solve system integration issues and interoperability challenges. In
    general, regarding challenges, interoperability is a main challenge throughout
    the whole IoT architecture, where development and/or acceptance of standards and
    protocols is required to ease the issues encountered by many IoT implementations.
    Furthermore, challenges such as revenue and affordability of IoT systems, the
    power consumption of wireless devices, latency and throughput problems during
    data transfer, as well as the complexity of data analysis, and data privacy and
    security have been identified in the reviewed literature as of high importance,
    and academic research should direct their resources toward solving or reducing
    these issues. Technology developers need to ensure that the solutions create a
    real benefit for farmers and are available and applicable for both large and small
    producers. How IoT generated farm data will affect the business models of farmers
    requires further investigation as it is not fully addressed in the literature
    reviewed. The combination of intelligent power efficient systems with power harvesting
    technologies should guarantee longer battery-life of wireless devices. Computing
    data at the edge, i.e. on the devices, as well as lightweight protocols can reduce
    network latency and capacity/throughput problems. The emergence of Big Data is
    posing significant challenges for data analysis, as the complexity and heterogeneity
    of the huge data sets require the application of new analysis techniques beyond
    those traditionally used. Techniques such as lowering data dimensionality, cloud
    platforms and cloud computing, including machine learning algorithms, can help
    in this area and new innovative solutions are expected to be developed. Finally,
    technology producers have to guarantee privacy and security of the data handled
    throughout all the layers by employing different secure methods without compromising
    the user-friendliness of the solutions employed. Middleware platforms can help
    improving the privacy and security of IoT solutions, and techniques such as blockchain
    can assist with privacy and security problems of IoT platforms when dealing with
    Big Data. In the near future, interoperable and service-oriented FMIS that are
    integrated in the supply chain with intelligent analytic tools will take over
    some of the management and decision-making tasks of farmers and advisors, which
    will require training for farmers to adapt to this type of FMIS. Key decision
    support functions include farm financial analysis, business processes, or supply
    chain functions, which will gain importance with Big Data analytics. In addition,
    DSS for vehicle logistics will grow in importance as a way to optimise field operations
    using route planning and sensor-based site-specific applications. Finally, the
    introduction of autonomous vehicles and robotics in arable farming in the near
    future is expected to completely change arable farming operations and production
    praxes requiring fully adopted IoT capabilities. Acknowledgements This work was

    Get rights and content Abstract The projected increases in World population and
    need for food have recently motivated adoption of information technology solutions
    in crop fields within precision agriculture approaches. Internet Of Underground
    Things (IOUT), which consists of sensors and communication devices, partly or
    completely buried underground for real-time soil sensing and monitoring, emerge
    from this need. This new paradigm facilitates seamless integration of underground
    sensors, machinery, and irrigation systems with the complex social network of
    growers, agronomists, crop consultants, and advisors. In this paper, state-of-the-art
    communication architectures are reviewed, and underlying sensing technology and
    communication mechanisms for IOUT are presented. Moreover, recent advances in
    the theory and applications of wireless underground communication are also reported.
    Finally, major challenges in IOUT design and implementation are identified. Previous

    population will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food [124]. Yet
    today, up to 70% of all water withdrawals are due to food production. This demands
    novel technologies to produce more crop for drop. USDA Agricultural Resource Management
    Survey (ARMS) is the primary source of information on the financial condition,
    production practices, and resource use of America’s farm businesses and the economic
    well-being of America’s farm households. ARMS data show that precision agriculture
    has recently become a widespread practice nationwide. In Fig. 1, adoption rates
    of major precision agriculture approaches (bars) along with the total precision
    agriculture adoption rate (line) are shown for maize for each year of USDA ARMS
    publication (USDA ARMS 2015 version was under development at the time of this
    writing). It can be observed that adoption rate of precision agriculture for maize
    increased from 17.29% in 1997 to 72.47% in 2010 with similar trends observed for
    other crops such as soybean and peanuts. Aside from presenting a growing trend
    in the usage of precision agriculture in maize production, it is evident that
    as new technologies emerge, they are widely adopted by farmers. Download : Download

    technology adoption in maize production (USDA ARMS Data). Among the various precision
    agriculture techniques, crop yield monitoring is the most widely adopted technique
    (61.4%). In addition, guidance and auto-steering system adoption jumped from 5.34%
    in 2001 to 45.16% in nine years. Use of equipment and crop location information
    enables precise control with auto-steering systems which reduce production and
    maintenance costs and reduces repetitive field work for farmers. Despite the drastic
    increase in adoption rates of other techniques, Variable Rate Technology (VRT)
    adoption has been relatively steady, where adoption rate increased from 8.04%
    in 1998 to only 11.54% in 2005. Adaptive application of resources like fertilizers,
    pesticide, and water promises significant gains in crop production but requires
    accurate and timely information from the field. It can be observed that only after
    the adoption of recent crop moisture sensing technology, VRT adoption doubled
    to 22.44% in 2010. During the same period, crop moisture sensing adoption increased
    from 36.21% in 2005 to 51.68% in 2010. It is clear that the success and adoption
    of VRT depends on advancing soil monitoring approaches. Despite being the most
    recent precision agriculture technology, crop moisture sensing has become one
    of the most adopted practices. Yet techniques are still limited to manual data
    collection or limited field coverage. 2. A new paradigm: IOUT Most recently, the
    need for real-time in-situ information from agricultural fields have given rise
    to a new type of IoT: Internet Of Underground Things (IOUT). IOUT represents autonomous
    devices that collect any relevant information about the Earth and are interconnected
    with communication and networking solutions that facilitate sending the information
    out of fields to the growers and decision mechanisms. IOUT is envisioned to not
    only provide in-situ monitoring capabilities (e.g., soil moisture, salinity, and
    temperature), but when interconnected with existing field machinery (irrigation
    systems, harvesters, and seeders) enable complete field autonomy and pave the
    way for more efficient food production solutions. In IOUT, Communications can
    be carried out through the soil and plants from underground devices, and information
    acquired from the field can be sent to the cloud for real-time decision making.
    IOUT applications have unique requirements; i.e., information from soil, operation
    in remote crop fields, wireless communication through plants and soil, and exposure
    to elements. Existing over-the-air (OTA) wireless communication solutions face
    significant challenges because they were not designed for these circumstances.
    As such, IOUT also gives rise to a new type of wireless communications: wireless
    underground (UG) communications [68], [152], where radios are buried in soil and
    wireless communication is conducted partly or completely through the soil. Integration
    of UG communications with IOUT will help conserve water resources and improve
    crop yields [143], [145]. Moreover, advances in IOUT will benefit other applications
    including landslide monitoring, pipeline assessment, underground mining, and border
    patrol [67], [69], [71], [84], [94], [102], [106], [115], [132], [138], [142],
    [146], [150], [152], [159]. This paper presents IOUT for the design of precision
    agriculture solutions. We first discuss functionalities, architecture, and components
    of IOUT. In Section 4 and 5, we present sensing and communication technologies
    of IOUT. In Section 6, we list IOUT testbeds and existing solutions. We conclude
    by discussing challenges of IOUT. 3. IOUT architecture IOUT will consist of interconnected
    heterogeneous devices tailored to the crop and field operations. Common desirable
    functionalities of IOUT are: • In-situ sensing: On board soil moisture, temperature,
    salinity sensors are required for accurate localized knowledge of the soil. These
    sensors can be either integrated on the chip along-with other components of the
    architecture, or they can be used as separate sensors that can be connected to
    the main components. • Wireless communication in challenging environments: Communication
    components of IOUT devices are either deployed on the field or within the soil.
    For OTA communication, solutions should be tailored to the changing environment
    due to irrigation and crop growth. Over the air communication is used to store
    the data on a more secure and accessible service/device. In addition, any system
    on the field is exposed to natural elements and should be designed to sustain
    challenging conditions. Underground communication solutions, while mostly shielded
    from the environment, require the ability to communicate through soil and adjust
    its parameters to adapt to dynamic changes in soil. • Inter-connection of field
    machinery, sensors, radios, and cloud: It is desirable that IOUT architecture
    links a diverse multitude of devices on a crop field to the cloud for seamless
    integration. Accordingly, IOUT architecture will not only provide collected information
    but will also automate operations on the field based on this information. • Real-time
    Decision Making: Information about soil and crop conditions should be available
    to the managers and decision support systems for real-time decision making at
    each level. • Mobility: IOUT will have seamless support for both fixed and mobile
    devices with backing of short-term and long-term communications. Based on these
    main required functionalities, a representative IOUT architecture is illustrated
    in Fig. 2, with the following components. • Underground things (UTs): An UT consist
    of an embedded system with communication and sensing components, where a part
    of or the entire system resides underground. UTs are protected by weatherproof
    enclosures and, in underground settings, watertight containers. Buried UTs are
    protected from the farm equipment, wild rodents, and extreme weather conditions.
    Sensors typically include soil temperature and moisture sensors, but a wide range
    of other soil- or weather-related phenomena can be monitored which will be discussed
    in detail on Section 4. Existing communication schemes include Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    NFC, Wi-Fi, Sigfox, LoRa, LoRaWAN, satellite, cellular, and underground. A UT
    using Bluetooth [105] or underground wireless [86] can communicate over 100 meters,
    commercial products at ISM-band can cover three times larger distances, whereas
    longer-distance connectivity is possible through cellular or satellite. Considering
    the relatively large field sizes, nodes can be configured to form networks capable
    of transferring all the sensed information to a collector sink and self-heal in
    the event that nodes become unreachable (e.g., Irromesh [24]). Nodes are generally
    powered by a combination of batteries and, if on field, solar panels. Cost of
    UTs is expected to be relatively inexpensive as they are deployed by the multitude
    [96]. • Base stations are used as gateways to transfer the collected data to the
    cloud. They are installed in permanent structures such as weather stations or
    buildings. Base stations are more expensive as they are better safe-guarded and
    have higher processing powers and communication capabilities [96]. • Mobile sinks
    are installed in equipment that move around the field periodically or as required,
    such as tractors and irrigation systems [86]. Since irrigation machinery advance
    at a slow pace, the soil data is received ahead of time allowing instant adjustment
    on the water application rate. On the other hand, when weather conditions are
    favorable, turning on the irrigation equipment only for data retrieval purpose
    is expensive. An alternative is to use unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) such as
    quadrotors or ground robots to retrieve the measurements. • Cloud services are
    intended to use for permanent storage of the data collected, real-time processing
    of the field condition, crop related decision making, and integration with other
    databases (e.g., weather, soil). Download : Download high-res image (466KB) Download

    of such a diverse range of communication architectures makes it challenging to
    form a unified IOUT architecture with the ability to fulfill agricultural requirements
    seamlessly. This is further complicated due to the lack of standard protocols
    for sensing and communication tailored to the IOUT. In the following, we explain
    in detail the sensing (Section 4) and communication (Section 5) mechanisms with
    a focus on desired characteristics of IOUT for real-time sensing and effective
    communications. 4. Sensing The main functionality of IOUT is real-time sensing.
    Sensing has led to adoption of technology in the precision agriculture and it
    also enables improved efficiency of agricultural production and practices [127].
    An overview of sensing technologies is presented next. Soil moisture: Soil moisture
    (SM) sensors have been used for decades in crop fields to measure water content.
    Automated technologies have largely replaced the use of hand-held/manual soil
    moisture technologies because of difficulties associated with taking manual soil
    moisture readings in production fields in remote locations. In the last decade,
    wireless data harvesting technologies have been developed that provide managers
    and users real-time access to soil moisture data which has resulted in more effective
    water management decision-making. Important SM measurement methods are described
    below: • Gravimetric sampling is a direct and standard method of measuring SM.
    It is used to determine the volumetric water content of the soil. This method
    determines SM by a ratio of soil’s dry mass to the wet soil mass including the
    pore spaces. It requires manual sampling and oven drying of soil samples taken
    from the field [91]. • Resistive sensors [50] such as granular matrix sensors
    work on the principal of electrical conductivity of water and measuring resistance
    changes based on soil water content. This method requires calibration of sensors
    for accurate SM reading. • Capacitive sensors measure SM based on changes in capacitance
    of soil due to water content variations. Capacitive sensors, which are generally
    of higher accuracy than resistive sensors but cost more, are being used by commercial
    UTs. • Ground Penetrating Radars (GPR) [66], [98] are based on the absorption
    and reflection of electromagnetic waves. Impulse, frequency sweep, and frequency
    modulated technologies are used in SM sensing. This method is used to measure
    near-surface soil moisture (up to 10 cm). • Neutron scattering probes [87], [92]
    and gauges use radiation scattering techniques to measure SM by estimating changes
    in neutron flux density due to the water content of the soil are the most accurate
    soil moisture probes used in fields. They require specific licenses to be used.
    • Gamma ray attenuation [90], time-domain reflectometry (TDR) [128], and frequency-domain
    reflectometry (FDR) [139] are other popular SM measurement approaches. Common
    SM sensors used in fields are shown in Fig. 3. SM sensors are buried at depths
    of 5  cm to 75  cm in soil depending on the crop type and root depth. SM data
    obtained from these sensors is used to create soil moisture maps which help real-time
    decision making. SM sensors have been deployed in fields with increasing frequency.
    For example, the Nebraska Agricultural Water Management Network [99], [101], was
    established with only 20 growers in 2005 and currently serves over 1400 growers
    to enable the adoption of water and energy conservation practices using SM sensors.
    In addition to in-situ soil moisture sensors, other soil moisture data sources
    are Soil Climate Analysis Network [49], US Climate Reference Network [60], TAMU
    North American Soil Moisture Database [53], Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity [48],
    NASA North American Land Data Assimilation System [27], and NASA Soil Moisture
    Active Passive [46]. These databases contain soil moisture and temperature informations
    of vast geographical areas and augment the Web Soil Survey (WSS) [63], which collects
    and classifies the US soil information by region. Download : Download high-res

    Top row: Gravimetric [91], resistive (Watermark) [50], capacitance [17], Bottom
    Row: GPR [98], TDR [128], neutron probe [92]. Other soil physical properties:
    In addition to soil moisture sensing, other soil properties can be measured to
    populate the soil map such as the organic mater present in the soil, acidity (pH)
    [135], percentage of sand, clay and silt particles [137], and nutrients such as
    Mg, P, OM, Ca, base saturation Mg, base saturation K, base saturation Ca, CEC,
    K/Mg, and Ca/Mg ratios [104], [110], [113]. In-situ, real-time measurement of
    these properties still face challenges due to size, cost, and technology limitations.
    Yield monitoring: Yield monitoring provides spatial distribution of crop yield
    at the end of a growing season and is used make long-term decisions about agriculture
    operations [108], [118]. Yield monitors are usually installed on farm equipment
    and automatically collects yield data during harvesting. More specifically, mass
    flow sensors are installed on grain containers to record grain inflow along with
    location (e.g., Force Sensor by Ag Leader). The collected data is analyzed using
    geographic information system (GIS) tools such as ArchInfo, Mapinfo, and Environment
    System Research International tools. Electrical conductivity and topography surveys:
    The ability of soil to conduct current is measured through soil electrical conductivity
    (EC) [116]. Coupled with field topography (elevation and slope), EC data provides
    an insight into the crop yield. EC (through contact and no-contact methods) is
    used to determine the amount of nitrogen usage, water holding and cation-exchange
    capacity, drainage, and rooting depth. EC maps are used to classify the field
    into zones. Then, precision agriculture practices such as variable rate irrigation,
    variable rate seeding, nitrogen, yield, and drainage management are applied based
    on zoning. EC mapping can be done using apparent electrical conductivity (ECa)
    [88], visible-near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (VNIR) [75], and electromagnetic
    Induction (EMI) [141] approaches. An array of commercial tools are available,
    e.g., Veris 3100 [61], EC400 sensors combined with GPS systems [107] are used
    for EC mapping. Weather and environmental sensing: Weather and environmental sensors
    are used to sense soil and air temperature, direction and speed of winds, and
    other environmental effects such as rainfall, solar emissions and humidity. For
    example, John Deere has introduced sensors to assess these phenomena in their
    commercial Field Connect solution [25]. Availability of this information is useful
    for real-time and fully informed precision agriculture decisions. A mesoscale
    network (MesoNet), consists of nodes for weather and environment sensing, spanning
    over a large geographic area. MesoNet [34] is used to observe major changes in
    weather patterns, and when combined with IOUT sensing can be used to provide real-time
    weather information at the farm level. Soil macro-nutrients sensing: Macro-Nutrients
    such as nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorous are vital for the crop growth. The
    assessment of these nutrients helps to determine the fertilizer impact and future
    applications. Optical sensing is based on reflectance spectroscopy to measure
    the reflection and absorption by these macrosimulation [104], [110], [113]. To
    detect nitrate and sulfate concentration in natural water resources, a sensing
    method using planar electromagnetic sensors has been developed in [121]. This
    method is used to sense nitrate and sulfate levels by correlating the impedance
    of the sensor array with the concentration of these pollutants. It has been shown
    that sensor impedance decreases with increase in concentration of these chemicals
    [121]. Electrochemical, VIS-NIRS spectroscopy, and ATR spectroscopy are the major
    soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches. These soil macro-nutrients sensing approaches
    are limited to sense one desired ion because membrane used in these methods only
    responds to one ion [113]. To achieve concurrent multi-ion sensing, a major challenge
    is to form a detector array for soil macro-nutrients sensing [104]. Remote sensing:
    Remote sensing based approaches uses electromagnetic waves which interact with
    soil and plants in precision agriculture. These approaches work on the measurement
    of intensity of reflected components of the electromagnetic waves as these interact
    with soil and plants [120]. Spatial resolution of remote sensing techniques is
    a major issue; however, when combined with in-situ IOUT sensing approaches, they
    may result in fine resolution, which can be used to produce field maps for analysis
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Examples of these include soil moisture,
    yield [72], texture [140], pesticides applications [95], and nutrient field maps
    [2], [112], [120]. Remote sensing has also applications in satellite data fusion,
    crop structure and condition monitoring. Other precision agriculture technologies:
    A myriad of other technologies is playing vital role in the precision agriculture
    practices. Here we briefly mention these technologies as useful IOUT tools. These
    include precision planting, geolocation, GIS systems, soil sampling and field
    analysis map generation, drones, auto-steering and VRT. In precision planting
    [38], the seeding is done using a very fine predetermined inter plant distance,
    and robots with lasers are used for automatic weed zapping. Farm devices in the
    field are aligned automatically with robovator technology. With GPS, it has become
    possible to divide a farm into different zones based on the field conditions [160].
    Variable rate fertilizer application [2], [78], [95] is also important for crop
    yield improvement. Wireless communications with drones also constitutes a major
    component of the IOUT connectivity. GreenStar Lightbar [15] is a tool from Deere
    & Co that is used to determine the location and width in the row crops. TK-GPS
    [57] is another device used to perform real time soil mapping. The sensing technologies
    discussed in this section present many opportunities for advancing the state of
    precision agriculture through the IOUT. Availability of inexpensive sensors and
    their ability to communicate wireless enables their integrations to control systems
    in IOUT. Therefore, wireless communications, between heterogeneous equipment used
    in these sensor technology, has an important role in realization of the real-time
    decision making in IOUT. Moreover, adoption of sensor technology could be raised
    by a well-connected, reliable, and secure IOUT, and it will also help in development
    of improved sensing technologies in precision agriculture. Because, currently,
    the lack of availability of robust connectivity in the field is hindering rapid
    advancements in sensing technologies. Different approaches for wireless communications
    in IOUT are discussed in the next section. 5. Wireless connectivity Connectivity
    solutions for IOUT can be classified as in-field communications and cloud connectivity
    as discussed next. 5.1. In-field communications In-field communication solutions
    integrate UTs and other communication entities on the field. Most commercial solutions
    utilize OTA communications, whereas IOUT are expected to feature wireless underground
    communications. For short-range communication and networking, license-free standards
    such as Bluetooth, ZigBee, and DASH7 are used in ISM bands. More recently, regulatory
    restrictions are relaxed by the FCC through new rules that allow the use of TV
    white space frequencies in farms [14] (Order No. DA 16-307 Dated: Mar 24, 2016),
    where interference with other licensed devices is not expected. The major challenge
    for OTA communications is the lack of studies about the impacts of crops and farm
    environment on wireless propagation and associated tailored solutions to farms.
    In the following, we discuss in-field communications in detail. UG communications:
    UG communication solutions enable complete concealment of UTs, which decrease
    operation costs and impacts from external elements [86]. For a buried UT radio,
    two types of communication scenarios arise. Aboveground communications involve
    communication between UTs and aboveground devices. Underground communication is
    carried out between UTs. Furthermore, due to the soil-air interface, aboveground
    communication links are not symmetric and need to be analyzed in terms of underground-to-aboveground
    and aboveground-to-underground communication. In Fig. 4, the path loss of these
    links are shown as a result of field experiments [86]. It can be observed that
    practical underground link distances are still limited to 12  m to allow for practical
    multi-hop connectivity. Yet, communication ranges of up to 200  m is possible
    for aboveground communications. Download : Download high-res image (185KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Communication from soil. For UG communications,
    the communication medium is soil, which impacts communication success in six main
    ways: (1) Soil texture and bulk density: EM waves exhibit attenuation when incident
    in soil medium. These variations vary with texture and bulk density of soil. Soil
    is composed of pore spaces, clay, sand, and silt particles. Relative concentration
    of these particles result in 12 soil textural classes [91]. Water holding capacity
    of each soil type is different because of its pore size. For example, lower water
    holding capacity of sandy soil leads to lower attenuation and high root mean square
    delay spread, whereas higher water holding capacities of silt loam and silty clay
    loam soils result in low root mean square delay spread and higher attenuation
    [133], [134]. (2) Soil moisture: The effective permittivity of soil is a complex
    number. Thus, besides diffusion attenuation, EM waves also suffer absorption by
    soil water content and its variations. Soil dielectric spectra and its conductivity
    depends on the soil moisture. The relative dielectric constant range of dry soil
    is between 2 and 6 and its conductivity ranges from to   Si/m, where soils at
    near-saturation level have a relative dielectric constant in the range of 5–15
    and conductivity between to   Si/m [147]. Coherence bandwidth of the underground
    channel is limited to a few hundred KHz range [129], [130], [131], which limits
    data rates. Coherence bandwidth also varies with soil moisture, making design
    of advanced techniques challenging. (3) Distance and depth variations: Sensors
    in IOUT applications are usually buried in the top sub-meter layer. Thus, in addition
    to distance, channel quality depends on deployment depth because of the impacts
    of the soil-air interface, which causes refraction of EM waves. Nodes at higher
    burial depths experience higher attenuation [129]. (4) Antennas in soil: When
    an antenna is buried, its return loss characteristics change due to the high permittivity
    of soil [85], [151]. Moreover, with the variation in soil moisture and hence soil
    permittivity, the return loss of the antenna varies with time too. Changes in
    return loss results in variations in resonant frequency, which is shifted to the
    lower spectrum, and system bandwidth, creating additional challenges for UG communication.
    (5) Frequency variations: The pathloss caused by attenuation is frequency dependent
    because of dipole relaxation associated with water. Generally, lower frequency
    spectrum has lower attenuation, because at higher frequencies, water absorption
    plays a dominant role. In addition, when EM waves propagate in soil, their wavelength
    shortens due to higher permittivity of soil than the air. Therefore, channel capacity
    in soil is also a function of operation frequency [85]. (6) Lateral waves: For
    two UTs, wireless underground communication is conducted through three major paths:
    lateral, direct, and reflected (LDR) waves [86], [130], [133]. Direct and reflected
    waves reside completely in soil and therefore, suffer from the challenges above.
    On the other hand, lateral waves travel partly on the soil-air interface in air,
    experiencing the lowest attenuation. Lateral waves plays an important role in
    extending underground communication ranges. (7) Recent advances in wireless underground
    communications: Recent developments in wireless underground communications include
    the characterization of wireless UG channel and development of environment-aware,
    cross-layer communication solutions to achieve high data rate, long range communications
    with applications to precision agriculture. The impulse response of the wireless
    UG channel is captured and analyzed through extensive experiments [133]. With
    more than 1500 measurement in an underground greenhouse testbed, the effects of
    soil moisture and soil texture on wireless underground communication channel are
    analyzed. Through this analysis, the vital statistics of wireless UG channel impulse
    response (e.g., coherence bandwidth, root mean square delay spread, and power
    associated with multipath) are developed. The three main components of the UG
    channel, direct wave, reflected wave, and the lateral wave are validated. The
    coherence bandwidth of the UG channel has been shown to be less than 1.15  MHz
    which further decreases to 418  kHz for the distances greater than 12  m in soil
    [133]. Change in soil moisture also impacts the root mean square delay spread
    which requires moisture-based dynamic adaptation techniques in UG communications.
    The statistical model [134] is vital for tailored solutions for underground multi-carrier
    communication and soil moisture adaptive beamforming. Based on impulse response
    analysis, the multi-carrier modulation and wireless underground channel diversity
    reception schemes have been developed for the realization of high data rate communications
    [129]. The effects of soil type and moisture on the underground antenna, channel
    and system capacity are highlighted. Based on this analysis, multi-carrier modulation
    and wireless underground channel diversity reception schemes [131] have been developed.
    The optimum maximum ratio combining (MRC-LDR) achieves the maximum gain. In this
    approach, three times SNR enhancement is achieved as compared to the SNR of a
    single antenna matched filter UG receiver. However, the interference from the
    reflected components is still present. Adaptive combining (AC-LDR) uses adaptive
    switching and selection process to suppresses undesired interference. Based on
    the proximity of the LDR receiver, either the D-wave or L-Wave component is dominant
    at the receiver. AC-LDR exploits this by adaptively switching and selecting the
    strongest lateral, or the direct wave. The R-Wave is not considered because it
    is the weakest component and results in performance degradation. In [131], the
    performance analysis of different modulation schemes through simulations and experiments
    has been carried out. The BER under equalization and diversity reception has been
    reported. A 3 times increase in SNR and improvement in BER from to are shown in
    wireless underground communication channel. Since use of sensing technologies
    in precision agriculture depend on reliable UG communications, these is a demand
    for high date rate, ubiquitous, reliable communications. These low error rate
    communication techniques help to achieve that goal in precision agriculture. Moreover,
    based on UG antenna analysis, soil moisture adaptive beamforming (SMABF) using
    underground antenna arrays is also developed [130]. SMABF employs underground
    antenna arrays at the transmitter and omni-directional antenna at the receiver.
    The lateral wave is maximized if the energy from the UG antenna is radiated in
    an optimum angle. In SMABF, beam steering is done to exploit the lateral wave
    in the underground communication by sending the energy in the optimum angle which
    maximizes lateral wave and leads to higher directivity. SMABF has complex array
    structures and needs phase shifters. With these advancements in UG communications,
    it has become possible to make progress from data collection to real-time processing
    and decision making in precision agriculture. Magnetic induction (MI) and acoustic
    UG communications: Magnetic Induction (MI) based communications is another approach
    for UG communications. In magnetic induction [114], [143], the rate of decay of
    received signal strength (RSS) is the inverse cube factor. Therefore, long range,
    high data rates signaling can not be done using MI, which is vital for IOUT paradigm.
    Moreover, the perpendicularity of transmitter and receiver coils (antennas) is
    a prohibiting factor to establish communications in MI. Wavelengths in MI communications
    tend to be large. Therefore, IOUT architecture can not scale with MI based UG
    communications in IOUT. Hence, because of these limiting factors, and due to in-feasibility
    of MI communications to establish communications with aboveground devices, MI
    based communications is not a reliable option for IOUT. EM-based UG communications
    are more suitable. There are also some common characteristics in underwater communication
    [74] and UG communications. However, underwater communications can not utilize
    electromagnetic (EM) waves because of higher degradation of signals and water
    absorption. Therefore, other approaches (e.g., acoustic [74]) are used in underwater
    communications. Moreover, the acoustic approach is infeasible in IOUT UG communications
    because of vibration limitations. Underground to UAV communications: The unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAVs, also called drones) have recently emerged in the precision
    agriculture practices for sensing and communications of the filed conditions [123],
    [148], agricultural surveillance using imaging [97], [83], and decision support
    [144]. Before the use of UAVs in precision agriculture, the satellite imagery
    was obtained for the purpose of monitoring. Through the use of UAV imaging, a
    detailed soil moisture map of the field can be produced in timely and inexpensive
    manner. Moreover, the crop growth can also be monitored by using UAVs and accordingly
    vegetation index is generated. The seed planting and pesticide applications are
    other important applications of UAVs in precision agriculture. The UAVs, when
    integrated with the IOUT in the field, will require reliable communications with
    sensors and radio equipment for real-time decision making. There are many challenges
    from UG to UAV communications (e.g., restrictions on UAV communications payloads
    and antennas, limited flight times, low communication range from the UG to UAV
    link, and specific operator skills and licenses required for UAV operation). Technology
    and regulatory advances in these areas will lead to enhanced integration of UAVs
    in precision agriculture IOUT. Low power wide area networks (LPWAN): Since IOUT
    is designed for prolonged operation in the agricultural field, energy conservation
    plays important role in long term functionality and connectivity. Low Power Wide
    Area Networks (LPWAN) are designed not only to achieve energy conservation objective
    but also to attain long-range connectivity [122]. Due to this, LPWAN is suitable
    for IOUT communications where high data rate operations are not required and low
    latency of data transfer can be accepted for some applications. According to LPWAN
    Technical Workgroup, it has capacity to work over the time span of many years
    and is specifically designed for applications which need to transmit small packets
    intermittently. A brief overview of LPWAN technologies is given in the following:
    (1) LoRa: Approaches designed to conserve energy like Long Range Wide Area Network
    (LoRaWAN) favor one-hop star topology where end-devices transmit small packets
    of information (0.290–50  kbps) over long distances (up to 45  km in rural areas)
    [80]. This is more suitable for battery powered devices. Reliable communication
    over long distance is possible because of techniques like adaptive data rate,
    LoRa’s chord spread spectrum radio modulation scheme, and gateways that decode
    data received on multiple channels modulated with different spreading factors
    [111]. However, since LoRa uses unlicensed frequency, the channel utilization
    is limited to 30 seconds per day by regulations. For application that requires
    a QoS level, the download channel increase the probability of collisions [81].
    In precision agriculture, LoRa technology provides low-cost low-power communication
    solution for prolonged monitoring operations [29]. (2) Sigfox: Sigfox [44] is
    the first LPWAN technology and highly efficient in spectrum usage. It uses ultra
    narrow band (UNB) modulation. The communication range of Sigfox is up to 45  km
    and 12  km in rural and urban areas respectively. Sigfox supports data rates of
    up to 250  kbps, and also uses unlicensed spectrum (868  MHz and 902  MHz) for
    communications. Consequently, the amount of data that can be transferred daily
    is also limited by regulations [161]. Sigfox provides many opportunities in precision
    agriculture IOUT to support connectivity among field equipment and UT sensors
    [45]. (3) On-Ramp/Ingenu: On-Ramp developed the IEEE 802.15.4k [20] technical
    standard for LWPAN. It only specifies the physical and MAC layer, and upper layers
    are complimented by other standards which operates at the upper layers. It uses
    higher bandwidth (1 MHz) as compared to other LWPAN technologies. IEEE 802.15.4k
    uses 902–928  MHz unlicensed spectrum. Its communication range is up to 15  km.
    Hence, it more suitable for communications agricultural forms spanning over large
    geographical areas [35]. (4) NB-IoT: NB-IoT [154] is a new physical layer standard
    by 3GPP LTE (Release 13). It can coexist with LTE and GSM. NB-IoT also uses narrowband
    signal and is meant for low data rate applications. It only uses 180  KHz of its
    200  KHz bandwidth. NB-IoT operates in licensed spectrum and uses same band as
    of LTE. It supports standalone operation, broadband operation, and in-band operation.
    NB-IoT is also being used in many commercial agricultural solutions in Europe
    [32]. It also facilitates low-cost, long range, and prolonged battery life solutions
    in precision agriculture. (5) Extended coverage GSM IoT: EC-GSM-IoT [12] is another
    low power long range LWPAN standard based on software update to cellular eGPRS.
    It can also co-exist with other mobile networks and designed to support battery
    life of up to 10 years. It operates in 800  MHz to 900  MHz and 1800 to 1900  MHz
    GSM bands. Many features of EC-GSM-IoT (e.g., inexpensive equipment, long range
    and coverage) makes it suitable for IOUT communication in precision agriculture.
    NWave [33], Platanus [36], Weightless [64], and Ingenu [20] are other major notable
    LPWAN technologies, which can be used for IOUT communications depending on the
    deployment, application, energy requirement, and equipment. These are also being
    used in precision agriculture connected vineyards [11]. Wireless PAN/LAN: Wireless
    PAN/LAN is also important for communications between farm machinery and equipment,
    field workers and central base stations in the field. Use of Wireless LAN/PAN
    enables high data rate, low latency communication in IOUT, which are not supported
    by LPWAN. Wireless PAN/LAN include many technologies such as Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Thread, and Wi-Fi. In the following we present brief overview of these technologies:
    (1) Bluetooth: Bluetooth [5] is standardized by Special Interest Group (SIG).
    Communication can be done up to 100  m distances and it uses frequency hopping
    spread spectrum technique. Bluetooth Smart is the low energy version and can operate
    in broadcast and connected mode. Bluetooth uses 2.4  GHz ISM band and has bandwidth
    up to 25  MHz. It is also being used in development of a low energy moisture-
    and temperature sensor intended for use in an agricultural wireless sensor network
    system [76]. (2) ZigBee: ZigBee [65] operates on the top of 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and
    it consists of application and network layer protocols. It can operate in a star
    and mesh topology with bandwidth up to 1  MHz and communication range of up to
    10 to 30 meters. A smart agriculture system by using ZigBee technology has been
    developed in [117]. (3) Thread: Thread [56], self-healing mesh network protocol,
    functions on IEEE 802.15.4 MAC/PHY and is simple and secure battery friendly LAN
    protocol. It can supports up to 250 devices and provides security at network and
    application layers. (4) Wi-Fi: IEEE 802.11 [19] is high data rate communication
    standard with support for data rates higher than 1  Gbps. It has physical layer
    standards for different ISM bands (2.4  GHz, 5  GHz and 60  GHz) and used different
    channel bandwidth up to 160  MHz. A remote monitoring system using WiFi, where
    the wireless sensor nodes are based on WSN802G modules, has been developed in
    [119]. Cellular technology in IOUT: As more and more IOUT applications are being
    developed, the demand for cellular and broadband connectivity IOUT solutions is
    reaching at critical levels. Lack of broadband cellular communication in rural
    areas is a major challenge as it hinders instant access to big data being generated
    from the field. Currently, data has to be collected and transmitted manually from
    the deployed IOUT systems which is major bottleneck in adoption of precision agriculture
    practices in remote rural areas. One main factor for non-existent or slow cellular
    data communication speeds is the huge expenditure on commissioning of required
    infrastructure rural communities. There are also many system and cost related
    challenges in Machine-to-Machine (M2M) cellular communications [70] as main purpose
    of cellular design was human communications. However, a recent release of LTE
    cellular standard has the support for M2M communications and can be used for communication
    in production fields being served with LTE networks. However, IOUT devices are
    required to be compatible with the cellular standard and energy consumption challenges
    restricts their use in battery powered devices for prolonged duration. To overcome
    these challenges, low power devices can be connected through in-field communications
    and subsequently data can be collected and transmitted to the cloud by using externally
    powered gateways with cellular capabilities. Energy consumption in IOUT: In IOUT,
    energy consumption is a vital issue because of the low power requirement for sensors
    in order to operate for prolonged periods without battery replacement. Moreover,
    the channel quality in UG communications is impacted by physical parameters of
    the soil (e.g., soil moisture). In [84], a connectivity model of IOUT for different
    soil physical parameters has been developed by designing the cluster size distribution
    under sub-critical constraints. A novel aboveground communication coverage model
    for underground clusters has been developed. To maintain connectivity while reducing
    energy consumption the transmit power control and environment aware routing are
    proposed. It is shown that these approaches can maintain network connectivity
    under all soil moisture conditions while reducing energy consumption. Moreover,
    it has also been shown that use of relaying nodes based on soil wetness conditions
    can further decrease the energy consumption. 5.2. Cloud and big data in precision
    agriculture Due to limited processing power and energy considerations, data processing
    and decision making are not generally conducted locally. Depending on privacy
    considerations, field information can be stored in a private database, provided
    to the public databases, or shared with other users [157]. There are online marketplaces
    where big data sets and agricultural apps are used to analyze a region and make
    decisions to maximize crop yield [136]. Additionally, in-situ SM sensors can be
    linked to national soil moisture databases for complete, accurate, and comprehensive
    information of soil moisture [27], [46], [48], [49], [53], [60], [63]. With the
    support of cloud services, real-time visualization and decision support can be
    provided. Therefore, Cloud can be used as a hub of data storage and processing
    applications in precision agricultural. Moreover, Cloud allows the scalability
    of IOUT paradigm from the field level to bigger geographic areas by forming network
    of farms. On the other hand, in the absence of storage or processing constraints,
    base stations on the fields can pull meteorological data from a weather service
    or soil information from a national service, fuse this information with in-situ
    data from UTs, and control the farming equipment. To have a fully automated system,
    farming equipment should include a controller that can be accessed remotely. The
    integration of IOUT with creates new avenues to form robust stakeholders in precision
    agriculture such as growers, industry, and trading companies and would results
    in increased efficiency and sustainability of whole precision agriculture ecosystem.
    In addition to integration of farm equipment data to soil and weather databases,
    other examples include linking UAVs and robotics to precision agriculture paradigm.
    Irrespective of in-situ or cloud processing, the main challenge is the integration
    of heterogeneous systems. Moreover, reliable data transfer from field to cloud,
    and cloud to farm, will constitute an important functionality of the IOUT cloud
    architecture. This functionality will not only help connect fields over vast geographical
    areas to the cloud, but will also facilitate local farms to use this data for
    assessment and improvement of crop yield. Moreover, there is a need of development
    of standardized interfaces for seamless connectivity and collaboration between
    different components of the precision agriculture ecosystem. The IOUT paradigm
    enables sensing and communications of even minor changes in the field including
    change in physical properties of the soil and growth of plants. Major sources
    of big data in precision agriculture are ESA satellite images, NDVI from drones,
    user maps (yield, electrical conductivity, and others), and soil data. This process
    generates big data and it becomes very important to extract meaningful information
    from this huge amount of data. This is also crucial for real-time end user decision
    making and in evaluation of return on investment. Therefore, it is necessary to
    develop big data analytics in precision agriculture [156]. It is also essential
    to analyze the reduction in input cost in water resources, energy consumption
    and labor cost by adopting precision agriculture practices [73]. Other examples
    of the big data analytics in precision agriculture are factors affecting crop
    yield; and demarcation of field zones based on particular application such as
    productivity, soil moisture, nutrients, harvesting. Farmers, as the biggest stakeholder
    in the precision agriculture, need to use the technology to see the potential
    benefits with out being overloaded with the data. Therefore, the big data analytics
    to show increase in crop yield and improvement in overall production efficiencies,
    which can deliver tangible benefits, are vital for success of the whole precision
    agriculture ecosystem. 6. An overview of IOUT enabling technologies and testbeds
    In this section, we present an overview of enabling technologies which facilitate
    IOUT developments for system-wide and communication-specific challenges. 6.1.
    Academic IOUT systems IOUTs can be used to ascertain the amount of water and fertilizer
    to be applied using an irrigation control system. An IOUT testbed has been deployed
    on the South Central Agricultural Lab (SCAL) in Clay Center, Nebraska [86]. The
    testbed covers a 41 acres of research field where an advanced center pivot irrigation
    system was installed in 2005 to research long-term dynamics of variable rate irrigation
    and fertigation, crop water and nutrient uptake, water stress and yield relationships,
    develop crop production functions, and associated numerous topics under full and
    limited irrigation and rainfed settings [100]. In this testbed, a mobile sink
    is installed on one of the controller towers of the center pivot irrigation system
    [86]. The current configuration includes two antennas facing opposite directions
    allowing the reception of data from nodes at a distance of 150  m–200  m. A solar
    panel provides sustainable energy in the field. 10–16 buried UTs are deployed
    in the field. Each UT is capable of measuring soil temperature and soil moisture
    from four external sensors buried at depths of 1, 2, 3, and 4  ft. UTs are powered
    by lithium-ion batteries and protected by a watertight enclosure. The spatio-temporal
    real-time information from UT is fused at the mobile sink and sent to the cloud
    using 4G communications. The cloud communicates with the center pivot controller
    for automated irrigation control. This field testbed is fully functional system
    developed to investigate IOUT sensing and communications capabilities in an agriculture
    field using center pivot irrigation, sensors, aboveground and underground communication
    devices. An indoor testbed has been designed and developed inside the greenhouse
    which supports dynamic soil moisture control for wireless underground communication
    experiments [133]. The testbed is made of 100  in. long, 36  in. wide and 48  in.
    high wooden box with drainage system to hold 90 cubic feet of packed soil (Fig.
    5). Antennas are buried at different depths and distances for controlled wireless
    communication experiments. Download : Download high-res image (203KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The indoor testbed [133]. Moreover, a testbed
    based on magnetic induction (MI) underground communications has been developed
    in [143]. This testbed includes coils buried in the underground in lab settings.
    MI wave guide effects and 3-D coils are investigated using this testbed in different
    soil configurations. SoilBED [89], is another underground testbed developed for
    cross-well radar experiments in soil. It is used for investigation of EM wave
    propagation and for detection of presence of contaminated materials in soil. SoilBED
    can also be used for underground channel and antenna characterization, and empirical
    validations of underground communication channel models. Thoreau [161] is an IOUT
    testbed on an university campus that collects and curates time and geo-tagged
    data on an open platform on the cloud. It is based on Sigfox design and operates
    in the 900  MHz unlicensed bands with frequency hopped and narrow-band operation.
    It has very low data rates and soil properties including soil temperature, soil
    moisture, electric conductivity, and water potential are measured. Another precision
    agriculture testbed has been developed for real-time sensing in the field [79].
    It is used to sense related soil properties for real-time decision making. BioSense
    [4] Institute is an R&D institute for IT in biosystems. To achieve their vision
    on the future of agriculture and food production, BioSense works on the areas
    of machinery auto-steering and automation, EC probe & XRF scanner, electrical
    conductivity map, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) map, yield map,
    remote sensing, nano and micro-electronic sensors, big data, and Internet of things
    aimed to food production. BioSense Institute, supported by University of Novi
    Sad, Serbia, focuses on the design development of advanced ICT solutions in agriculture,
    food, ecology, environmental protection, and forestry. Research results of BioSense
    Institute are helping European countries and regions to improve agricultural and
    environmental standards. It is also working in nano and microelectronics, communications
    and signal processing, remote sensing and GIS, robotics and mechatronics, knowledge
    discovery, and BIO-related research fields such as agriculture, ecology, environmental
    sciences, and forestry. It consists of many researchers from various fields labs
    from Europe. Their solution for Big Data is AgroSense [3], an agricultural platform
    which store and present information to farmers, agri-companies, government, banks,
    and insurance companies aimed toward improving crop yield while reducing costs.
    Internet of Food and Farm (IoF2020) [22] is an European project that has 19 use
    cases in 5 agri-food production sectors: arables, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and
    meat. An example in arable is the combination of data from sensor networks for
    smart wheat management with crop models and other data sources (e.g., disease,
    crop stage detection, cultivar characterization from phenotyping, and others)
    to generate high spatial-temporal resolution and to develop new models. In fruits,
    a fresh table grapes chain project uses information from weather station and wired
    sensor (soil moisture, soil temperature, electrical conductivity, and leaf wetness)
    for disease forecasting and to control irrigation using flow meters and solenoid
    valves. Solar powered data loggers transmit the data using GPRS network. A case
    study in vegetable is the tracking of greenhouse tomato-crops chain by setting
    the optimum ambient conditions to reduce the usage of resources (e.g., pesticide
    application could be avoided completely) and increase energy efficiency. In dairy,
    15 grazing cows are tracked on the pasture and inside the dairy barn using three
    beacons. A case in meat is the tracking of pigs using RFID tags, which reduces
    boar taint, health problems, and improve productivity. Sensor are also used for
    climate monitoring, register weight gain, feeding and drinking patterns, and food
    and water consumption. A ZigBee based IOUT has been developed in [158] with application
    in precision agriculture. Related soil properties such as humidity and pH are
    sensed using this architecture. An IOUT for soil moisture sensing at multiple
    depths has been developed in [125]. It consists of wireless communications nodes,
    sensors, data transfer gateways, and web modules for real time sensing, communication,
    and visualization in the field. An IOUT testbed for snow and soil moisture monitoring
    has been developed in Sierra Nevada, California [103] . With 300 sensors spanning
    over an area of multiple kilometers, this IOUT sensing testbed is used to record
    measurements of soil water content, snow depth, matric potential, and other related
    parameters; and a detailed sensing, and communication performance analysis data
    is also reported. A summary of the existing academic architectures is provided

    products, OTA wireless communication is utilized, where the UT includes a variety
    of high-end sensors that measure properties like soil moisture, temperature, and
    electrical conductivity. Consequently, measurements generally represent a single
    point in the field. UT’s can interconnect to create a communication mesh, but
    in most cases, they are connected directly to a tower in the field with cellular
    or satellite communication capabilities. If the UT is not buried underground,
    redeployment of the equipment is needed after planting and before harvesting in
    each growing season to avoid damages to the equipment by the farming machinery.
    A classification of the commercial IOUT solutions, companies, and their products
    are presented in Fig. 6. Modularity in the design of IOUT devices is highly desirable
    as the requirements can change over time and are tailored for a specific application.
    For example, the transmission range influence the selection of a protocol and
    the transceiver that can meet the communication demands. Solutions could be customized
    for a specific application and ordered as a complete solution, so they will work
    out-of-the box. There are companies that specialize in agricultural solutions.
    In other cases, the architecture is required to be more specific and fast prototyping
    using OEM components is more appropriate. Once data is collected, end-users need
    networks to transmit the data, servers for storage and processing, and cloud-based
    applications to display the information. A summary of the commercial solutions
    is provided in Table 2. Major classes of the commercial solutions are highlighted
    in the following. • Agricultural solutions.John Deere’s Field Connect uses 3G
    connections to transmit information from eight sensor probes located a mile away
    (three if satellite communication is used) that measure soil moisture at various
    depth, temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, rain, and leaf wetness.
    MimosaTEK provides irrigation and fertigation solutions scaled to small, medium,
    and large farms [31]. TempuTech [55] provide wireless solutions to monitor temperature
    and humidity in grain elevators. Microsoft is developing FarmBeats which is an
    AI & IoT based platform for Agriculture [13]. These commercial agricultural solutions
    provide full support in precision agriculture including sensing, communications,
    and the cloud. • Out-of-the-box packages.Smartrek Technologies develops wireless
    nodes for different types of sensors and gateways that can be set up easily into
    a network mesh [47]. Nodes are protected by weatherproof enclosures which is a
    requirement for farm outdoor setting. Accessible ports allows the installation
    of third-party soil moisture sensors and weather detection. Libelium has developed
    a Plug & Sense Smart Agriculture solution [37] for temperature and humidity sensing,
    rainfall, wind speed and direction, atmospheric pressure, soil water content,
    and leaf wetness. Libelium provides platforms and end-user devices that encompass
    communications standards such as LoRaWAN, LoRa, Sigfox, sub GHz, ZigBee, DigiMesh,
    WiFi, RFID, NFC, Bluetooth/BLE, 3G, 4G, and GPRS. Sensor boards can be connected
    to their Waspmote platform to attach 120 different sensors. Libelium also hosts
    an IoT marketplace and provides cloud services to manage IoT devices and online
    programming. Cropx’s [8] IOUT consists of hardware and software components used
    to measure soil moisture, temperature, and EC for real time irrigation decision
    making. PrecisionHawk has developed an IOUT platform [39] using drones, which
    is used for sensing and field map generation. It supports visual imaging, thermal
    and multi-spectral imaging for field map generation in precision agriculture.
    These out-of-the-box packages are important component of the precision agriculture
    to support different types of applications. • OEM components.OEM components are
    commonly used in the manufacturing of nodes at a large scale. However, the prototyping
    or small scale production of very specific UT will also required the selection
    of OEM devices. ST [51] develops internal components for IoT devices like accelerometers,
    gyroscope, and MEMS microphones. Semtech Corporation is a supplier of high-performance
    semiconductors and advanced algorithms [41]. U-blox specialized in communication
    and positioning components for IoT devices [59]. Telit is an M2M solutions company
    with focus in IoT development [54]. Telit provides tailored hardware and software
    solutions in small size modules. Products can transmit data using cellular, Bluetooth/BLE,
    LoRa, Low Power Wide Area (LPWA), Positioning, SigFox, Sub GHz, Wi-Fi, and M-Bus
    wireless technology. Herelab provides proof of concept deployment and rapid prototyping
    service of IoT custom platforms [16]. For instance, in agriculture, sensor interfaces
    can be rapidly attached to a template, and the corresponding instructions can
    be adapted from the code library. Herelab also organizes labs and workshop to
    introduce new tools and promote the usage of IoT devices. These components serve
    as useful building blocks of IOUT sensing and communications paradigm. • Cloud-based
    services.Cloud service allows worldwide access to the information collected by
    IOUT devices without any previous web programming knowledge. Farmers and other
    professionals do not need to spend time to hire another party in order to configure
    a server to make use of the data collected; and can take decision right away.
    LORIoT provides cloud services on a geographical distributed low latency network
    of servers where users connect their LoRaWan gateways. Among the web services
    they offer are the management of devices, cloud storage of data, safeguard of
    encryption keys, and LoRaWan to IP/IPv6 translation [30]. MyDevices offers IoT
    developers services to promote their solutions. One attractive feature of MyDevices
    is that it offers Cayenne, a drag-and-drop IoT project builder. End-users can
    create an account and use Cayenne web and mobile applications to register their
    IoT devices and instantly display sensed data on a fully customizable dashboard
    [6]. Senet operates two public cloud-based networks, Managed Network Services
    for IoT (MNSi) and Low Power Wide Area Virtual Network (LVN), that provide secure,
    efficient, and scalable connectivity to low-powered devices [42]. A proprietary
    network operating system handles end-devices messages and LoRaWAN gateways, generation
    of keys for encryption, decryption of messages, and hosting the portal for device
    management, among other activities. Device Lynk offers an online dashboard for
    data visualization of data captured using IoT industrial devices [9]. IntelliFarms
    provides diverse agricultural solutions such as reporting weather conditions,
    providing market crop pricing, and monitoring storage conditions in silos and
    bins. It also host the IntelliFarms platform where customer can get access to
    all their solutions in a centralized fashion [21]. 365FarmNet platform [1] is
    an agricultural data management service that is currently offering free field
    mapping for precision agriculture. Research challenges in IOUT are presented in

    challenges Challenges in design and implementation of a precision agriculture
    based IOUT are highlighted in this section. 1. Due to large area of deployment
    in agricultural fields, low cost and low complexity IOUT devices are desirable
    with ability to sustain rough terrains in all type of soil moisture regimes. 2.
    Improving UTs with more complex functionalities will lead to higher energy consumption
    and faster battery depletion. Thus, improvements in energy efficient operation,
    sustainable energy sources, and energy harvesting are major challenges. 3. Due
    to availability of different types of SM sensors, their integration with communication
    equipment is a major challenge. A standard protocol is required for seamless integration
    of different types of sensors to the communication devices in IOUT. 4. Low-cost
    and multi-modal soil sensors that can sense soil physical properties in addition
    to moisture are required. While moisture provides valuable information for irrigation
    decisions, soil chemicals need to be sensed in-situ for variable rate fertigation
    applications. 5. Advanced security mechanisms are required to protect information
    transfer in the fields. Moreover, field-based privacy solutions are required such
    that information from multiple fields can be fused for more accurate decisions
    while preserving the privacy of growers. 6. Seasonal changes and crop growth cycles
    need to be considered as they temporarily alter the conditions in which the equipment
    typically works. Freezing temperature affects power consumption, but equipment
    can be set to deep sleep as monitoring might not be necessary. The beginning of
    the growing season or a crop rotation can introduce heavier equipment on the field
    and UTs need to be buried deep enough to avoid damages. 7. Due to dynamic changes
    in the communication medium in soil, UTs should be able to autonomously adjust
    their operation parameters such as operation frequency, modulation schemes, error
    coding schemes for adaptive operation. Due to the close interactions with soil,
    these solutions should be tailored to UG communications instead of adopting existing
    OTA solutions [86], [129], [130], [131], [133]. Impacts of soil physical properties,
    soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled. A detailed insight into these
    effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable IOUT architecture. 8. Impacts
    of soil physical properties, soil moisture on UG communication should be modeled.
    A detailed insight into these effects will help to realize a reliable, scalable
    IOUT architecture. 9. Specialized link-layer and network layers protocols are
    needed for UG communications for scalable, reliable, and robust data transfer
    in IOUT. 8. Conclusions We introduced the Internet of Underground Things (IOUT)
    for real-time decision making in agricultural fields. A complete architectures
    for precision agriculture based IOUT has been presented. It has been shown that
    the sensing and communications are the main component of the IOUT. A detailed
    overview of sensing and communication technologies including academic and commercial
    solutions is presented. In-field communications (UG, LPWAN, LAN, cellular) and
    cloud are discussed in detail. Challenges to the realization of IOUT are highlighted,
    and testbed designs for IOUT realization are presented. Recent advances in the
    theory and applications of wireless UG communication are also reported. Acknowledgments

    \ of Things (IoT)-based automation of agricultural events can change the agriculture\n\
    sector from being static and manual to dynamic and smart, leading to enhanced\
    \ production with\nreduced human efforts. Precision Agriculture (PA) along with\
    \ Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) are the\nmain drivers of automation in the agriculture\
    \ domain. PA uses speciﬁc sensors and software to ensure\nthat the crops receive\
    \ exactly what they need to optimize productivity and sustainability. PA includes\n\
    retrieving real data about the conditions of soil, crops and weather from the\
    \ sensors deployed in the\nﬁelds. High-resolution images of crops are obtained\
    \ from satellite or air-borne platforms (manned\nor unmanned), which are further\
    \ processed to extract information used to provide future decisions.\nIn this\
    \ paper, a review of near and remote sensor networks in the agriculture domain\
    \ is presented\nalong with several considerations and challenges. This survey\
    \ includes wireless communication\ntechnologies, sensors, and wireless nodes used\
    \ to assess the environmental behaviour, the platforms\nused to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops, the common vegetation indices used to analyse spectral\nimages\
    \ and applications of WSN in agriculture. As a proof of concept, we present a\
    \ case study\nshowing how WSN-based PA system can be implemented. We propose an\
    \ IoT-based smart solution\nfor crop health monitoring, which is comprised of\
    \ two modules. The ﬁrst module is a wireless sensor\nnetwork-based system to monitor\
    \ real-time crop health status. The second module uses a low altitude\nremote\
    \ sensing platform to obtain multi-spectral imagery, which is further processed\
    \ to classify\nhealthy and unhealthy crops. We also highlight the results obtained\
    \ using a case study and list the\nchallenges and future directions based on our\
    \ work.\nKeywords: smart agriculture; precision agriculture; vegetation index;\
    \ Internet of Things\n1. Introduction\nThe rapidly-growing human population has\
    \ increased food demands for human survival on\nthe Earth. Meeting the food requirements\
    \ with limited resources of the planet is a big challenge [1].\nSeveral state-of-the-art\
    \ technologies are being incorporated in the agriculture domain to enhance\nthe\
    \ productivity to cope with this challenge. Precision Agriculture (PA) is comprised\
    \ of near and\nremote sensing techniques using IoT sensors, which help to monitor\
    \ crop states at multiple growth\nlevels. PA involves the acquisition and processing\
    \ of a large amount of data related to crop health.\nMultiple parameters are involved\
    \ in plants health, including water level, temperature and others.\nPA enables\
    \ a farmer to know precisely what parameters are needed for healthy crop, where\
    \ these\nparameters are needed and in what amount at a particular instance of\
    \ time. This requires collecting\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796; doi:10.3390/s19173796\n\

    \ from different sources and different parts of the ﬁeld such as soil nutrients,\
    \ the\npresence of pests and weeds, chlorophyll content in plants and some weather\
    \ conditions. All collected\ninformation needs to be analysed to produce agronomic\
    \ recommendations. For instance, given the\ndevelopmental stage of plants, their\
    \ level of greenness (chlorophyll content) reveals the nutrients\nneeded. This\
    \ information is combined with the characteristics of the soil where the plant\
    \ is located\nalong with weather forecast. All collected information is further\
    \ used to determine how much of a\ncertain fertilizer should be applied to that\
    \ plant on the next day. The delivery of agronomic information\non the right time\
    \ to farmer and ensuring that he/she applies these recommendations are key to\n\
    enhancing the yields.\nThe foremost driver of PA is a WSN, which is a network\
    \ of multiple wireless nodes connected\ntogether to monitor the physical parameters\
    \ of environment. Each wireless node is comprised of a\nradio transceiver, a micro-controller,\
    \ sensor(s), an antenna, along with other circuitry that enables it\nto communicate\
    \ with some gateway to transmit information collected by the sensor(s) [2]. Sensors\n\
    measure the physical parameters and send the collected information to the controller,\
    \ which further\ntransmits this information to the cloud or a portable device.\
    \ The agriculture sector has multiple\nrequirements comprised of soil statistics,\
    \ crops’ nature, weather conditions, fertilizer types and water\nrequirements.\
    \ Crops have diverse requirements depending on different crops on the same land\
    \ and the\nsame plant on different lands with different weather conditions. Sensors\
    \ monitor the varying behaviour\nof these crop parameters. Due to rapid advancement\
    \ in WSN technologies, the size and the cost of\nsensors have reduced, which make\
    \ it feasible to implement them in many sectors of life including\nagriculture.\
    \ The most common sensors used in the agriculture domain that capture environmental\n\
    parameters related to crops [3] are listed in Table 1.\nIn general, a WSN consists\
    \ of one or more wireless nodes that are further connected with sensors.\nThese\
    \ nodes are tiny devices that are responsible for collecting data. Nodes are divided\
    \ into two types,\na source node that collects the data, and the other is sink\
    \ or gateway node, which receives data from the\nsource nodes. A sink node has\
    \ more computational power compared to a source node. However, there\nare energy,\
    \ memory, power, size, data rate and price constraints when choosing wireless\
    \ nodes. Table 2\nshows a comparison of wireless nodes along with their common\
    \ speciﬁcations [3]. Among all wireless\nnodes presented in Table 2, MICA2 is\
    \ considered to be more suitable as compared to others because of\nits large number\
    \ of expansion connectors, which makes it suitable to connect with several sensors.\n\
    Many applications using WSN have been proposed since the last decade to monitor\
    \ crops’ health\nremotely. In [4], a cyber-physical system was presented for monitoring\
    \ of a potato crop. Cyber physical\nsystems can be expressed as smart systems\
    \ that are comprised of software, hardware and physical\ncomponents, integrated\
    \ together to sense the varying states of the real world. The proposed system\n\
    consists of three layers: the ﬁrst layer is the physical layer, in which all sensory\
    \ data are collected;\nthe second layer is the network layer in which data are\
    \ transmitted to the cloud; the third layer is\nthe decision layer in which the\
    \ data are analysed and processed to make decisions according to the\nobservations.\n\
    There are several challenges in IoT-based systems due to exponential increasing\
    \ devices. As in\na typical IoT network, every node transmits data to the remote\
    \ cloud, which results in cloud\ncongestion, and the main challenges underlying\
    \ the IOT-based system are latency with minimum\npower requirements, better usage\
    \ of bandwidth and intermittent Internet connectivity. Fog computing\nand edge\
    \ computing are the state-of-the-art techniques to overcome these issues; which\
    \ reduce the\ncomputational burden of cloud. The main goal of fog computing is\
    \ to conserve energy and bandwidth,\nwhich helps to increase the quality of service\
    \ to the end users. In [5], an energy-efﬁcient architecture of\nthe Fog of Everything\
    \ was presented, which was comprised of six layers. The ﬁrst layer was an Internet\n\
    Of Everything (IOE) layer, where things (could be ﬁxed, mobile or nomadic) functioned\
    \ under multiple\nspatially-distributed clusters. The second was a wireless access\
    \ network that supported Thing to Fog\n(T2F) and Fog to Thing (F2T) communication\
    \ over the wireless channel. In the third layer, the connected\nfog nodes behaved\
    \ such as a virtualized cluster. There was an inter-fog backbone in the fourth\
    \ layer,\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n3 of 25\nwhich was responsible for connectivity\
    \ among fog nodes. The next layer was the virtualization layer,\nwhich provided\
    \ each connected thing with the ability to augment its limited resource set, exploiting\n\
    the computation capability at the virtual clone. In the last layer, there was\
    \ an overlay inter-clone\nvirtual network that empowered Peer to Peer (P2P) communication.\
    \ Then, a protocol stack for FOE\nwas presented, which was further tested by creating\
    \ a small prototype named as V-FOE and simulated\non the iFogsim toolkit. The\
    \ results provided strong evidence for the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework\
    \ and more energy efﬁciency with reduced failure rate and delay.\nTable 1. Wireless\

    The energy efﬁciency is the most serious consideration while developing any fog\
    \ architecture.\nIn [6], an energy-efﬁcient protocol for a fog-supported wireless\
    \ sensor network was presented, which\nmaximized the lifetime of the network by\
    \ uniformly distributing the energy among connected nodes.\nThe performance of\
    \ the proposed algorithm was compared with the existing state-of-the-art algorithms\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n4 of 25\nin MATLAB. The results showed that the proposed\
    \ algorithm was highly energy efﬁcient with a\nprolonged network lifetime.\nRegardless\
    \ of all the advancements in the IoT domain, the adoption of PA has been limited\
    \ to\nsome developed countries. Because of the lack of resources, remote sensing-based\
    \ techniques to\nmonitor crop health are not common in under-developed countries\
    \ such as Pakistan, which results in\na loss of yield. Pakistan is an agricultural\
    \ country due to is large arable land and climatic variations,\nwhich make it\
    \ suitable to cultivate multiple types of crops. Despite all these natural resources,\
    \ Pakistan\nis still unable to produce massive yields [7]. The main reason behind\
    \ the low production is traditional\nfarming practices, which are used for crop\
    \ health monitoring and yield estimation. These techniques\nare completely based\
    \ on farmer’s intuition and experience. Farmers visit the ﬁelds in order to monitor\n\
    the crop, which is very laborious and quite challenging in the case of large arable\
    \ land. In this case, the\narea under insect/pest attack is inaccurately measured,\
    \ which can result in over spraying of insecticide\nand pesticide, which adversely\
    \ affects the nutrition in crops.\nKeeping in mind all these issues, our motivation\
    \ is to provide the industry and research\ncommunities with a survey of technologies,\
    \ metrics and current practices concerning communication\ndevices, sensors and\
    \ platforms used to monitor and analyse multiple sources of data (spectral images,\n\
    IoT, etc.) used in environmental and agriculture applications. As the main contribution,\
    \ we generated\na technological taxonomy for PA, which was driven by an IoT-based\
    \ architecture to monitor the crops’\nhealth. The developed system had two modules\
    \ including wireless sensor network-based crop heath\nmonitoring in which multiple\
    \ sensors were used to get the real-time heath status of crop; the other\none\
    \ was NDVI-based analysis of spectra images captured by a drone to assess the\
    \ chlorophyll content,\nwhich was further used to monitor the health of the crop.\n\

    \ wireless\ncommunication technologies used in the agriculture domain; Section\

    \ protocols have been introduced in the last few decades due to the rapid\nincrease\
    \ in IoT devices and WSN technologies. Each protocol has its own speciﬁcations\
    \ depending on\nthe bandwidth, number of free channels, data rate, battery timing,\
    \ price and other factors [8]. The most\ncommonly-used protocols for wireless\
    \ communication in IoT-based applications in agriculture are:\nSensors 2019, 19,\
    \ 3796\n5 of 25\n2.1. Cellular\nCellular technology is most suitable for applications\
    \ that require an extraordinary data rate.\nIt can utilize GSM, 3G and 4G cellular\
    \ communication capabilities by providing reliable high-speed\nconnectivity to\
    \ the Internet, requiring higher power consumption.\nIt requires infrastructure\
    \ to\nbe deployed and operation cost and back up staff for it with a centralized\
    \ managed authority.\n4G cellular technology requires more battery power, but\
    \ cellular technology is a good option in\nunderground wireless sensor networks,\
    \ such as security systems in smart home projects and agriculture\napplications\
    \ [9]. A smart irrigation systems was presented in [10], in which several soil\
    \ moisture\nsensors were deployed in the ﬁeld in the ZigBee mesh network. The\
    \ reading captured from the ﬁelds\nwere transmitted over the cloud using the cellular\
    \ 4G LTE network.\n2.2. 6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN is an IP-based communication protocol,\
    \ which was the ﬁrst protocol used for IoT\ncommunication. 6LoWPAN is also low\
    \ cost because of the low bandwidth and low power consumption.\n6LoWPAN supports\
    \ multiple topologies such as star and mesh topologies. To handle interoperability\n\
    between IPv6 and IEEE 802.15.4, there is an adaptation layer between the network\
    \ layer and the\nMAC layer [8]. The applications for 6LoWPAN are monitoring the\
    \ health equipment, environment\nmonitoring and in security and home automation\
    \ systems. In [11], a 6LoWPAN-enabled wireless sensor\nnetwork was presented to\
    \ monitor the soil properties of crops. The 6LoWPAN system architecture\nfor precision\
    \ agriculture application was discussed in [12] where the performance evaluation\
    \ of this\nprotocol was discussed with several baud rates and power constraints.\n\
    2.3. ZigBee\nZigBee is a wireless communication protocol widely used in precision\
    \ agriculture to monitor\nenvironmental conditions related to crops’ health [13].\
    \ It is based on the wireless 802.15.4 standard.\nBasically, it was developed\
    \ for personal area networks by the ZigBee alliance [8]. It has a ﬂexible\nnetwork\
    \ structure, long battery life, supports mesh, star and tree topology with multi-hop\
    \ data\ntransmission, is easily installed and supports large nodes. It has a short\
    \ range with limited data speed\nand is less secure compared to Wi-Fi-based systems.\
    \ ZigBee is very common in smart agriculture\napplications such as smart green\
    \ houses and smart irrigation systems [14]. In [15], a smart irrigation\nsystem\
    \ was presented based on the ZigBee communication protocol. This system consisted\
    \ of two\nnodes, i.e., a sensor node and an actuator node. The sensor node was\
    \ comprised of soil moisture\nsensors, which monitored the water level in the\
    \ soil. The actuator module was responsible for taking\nactions according to the\
    \ water level of the soil. All communication was carried out by means of\nZigBee\
    \ protocol.\n2.4. BLE\nBLE is as famous as the Bluetooth smart technology, which\
    \ is a suitable protocol for IoT\napplications including agriculture [16]. It\
    \ is particularly designed for low bandwidth, low latency and\nshort range for\
    \ IoT applications. The main advantages of BLE over typical Bluetooth include\
    \ lower\nsetup time, lower power consumption and unlimited support for nodes in\
    \ a star topology. It has a\nvery limited range of 10 meters. However, the drawbacks\
    \ are that it can only provide communication\nbetween two devices, it presents\
    \ low security, and it can lose connection during communication. In [17],\na BLE-based\
    \ infrastructure was presented to collect the sensors’ data. The proposed system\
    \ utilized a\nsmart phone to collect the data of sensors using BLE, where sensors\
    \ were deployed in the plants, i.e.,\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature\
    \ sensor.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n6 of 25\n2.5. RFID\nRFID systems consist of\
    \ a reader and a transponder, which have a very small radio frequency,\ncalled\
    \ the RF tag. This tag is programmed electronically with distinctive information\
    \ that has a reading\ncharacteristic. RFID has two technologies for the tag system\
    \ the ﬁrst is the active reader tag system,\nand the other is the passive reader\
    \ tag. Active reader tag systems are more expensive, as they utilize\nmore battery\
    \ power and use high frequencies. However, passive reader tag systems are low\
    \ powered.\nSome IoT applications using RFID include smart shopping, healthcare,\
    \ national security and smart\nagriculture applications. An IoT-based smart irrigation\
    \ system based on RFID was presented in [18].\nThe system was comprised of soil\
    \ moisture and soil temperature sensors along with a water control\nsystem, so\
    \ it collected the reading of the sensors and sent these readings to the cloud\
    \ using RFID\ncommunication protocols, where the user controlled a water pump\
    \ based on the water level of the soil.\n2.6. Wi-Fi\nWi-Fi is the most common\
    \ communication protocol that enables devices to communicate over\na wireless\
    \ signal. Wi-Fi provides Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN) connectivity to millions\
    \ of\nlocations, i.e., homes, ofﬁces and public locations such as cafes, hotels\
    \ and airports with high speed.\nThe Wi-Fi protocol supports IEEE 802.11, 802.11a,\
    \ 802.11b, 802.11g and 802.11n. Wi-Fi is widely used\nin IoT-based applications\
    \ including agriculture systems, i.e., smart irrigation, crop health monitoring\n\
    and greenhouses. In [19], an infrastructure was presented to monitor environmental\
    \ parameters\ninside the greenhouse such as temperature, light intensity and soil\
    \ moisture level. This platform\nwas comprised of sensors that collected the data\
    \ related to the environmental variation and sent to\nthe cloud using Wi-Fi. Similarly,\
    \ another smart agriculture system based on Wi-Fi communication\nprotocols was\
    \ presented in [20]. This last one consisted of a Raspberry Pi connected with\
    \ multiple\nsensors, which collected the data. The collected data were further\
    \ transmitted to the cloud using Wi-Fi\ncommunication protocols.\n2.7. LoRaWAN\n\
    LoRaWAN operates on the LoRa network. LoRaWAN deﬁnes the system architecture and\n\
    communication protocol of the network, while the physical layer of LoRa enables\
    \ the link for\nlong-range communication. LoRaWAN manages the frequencies in communication,\
    \ data rate and\npower consumption for all devices. LoRaWAN is common in agricultural\
    \ applications because of\nits large coverage area and low power consumption [21].\
    \ In [14], a smart irrigation system based on\nLoRaWAN was presented. Table 3\
    \ shows the comparison of all mentioned wireless communication\nprotocols [8].\
    \ Among all wireless communication technologies, 6LoWPAN and ZigBee are considered\n\
    to be more suitable for PA application because both are based on mesh networking,\
    \ which makes them\nsuitable to cover large area.\nTable 3. Wireless communication\

    \ Image-Based Remote Sensing\nRemote sensing has been widely used in PA to monitor\
    \ crops’ health for the last two decades.\nRemote sensing is a phenomenon in which\
    \ physical conditions of the Earth are observed remotely by\ncalculating the emitted\
    \ and reﬂected radiation from some distance. There are special cameras that\n\
    are used to capture images for further analysis to ﬁnd the characteristics of\
    \ a speciﬁc area. Multiple\nplatforms are used to mount these cameras that capture\
    \ images of the objects.\n3.1. Spectral Image Platforms\nRemote sensing platform\
    \ considerations for spectral images are airborne-based, satellite-based\nand\
    \ Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV)-based [22]. Each platform has its own coverage\
    \ range, which\nis determined by three factors: (i) Ground Sampling Distance (GSD),\
    \ which is computed in terms of\nspatial resolution, (ii) data collection rate\
    \ or frequency and (iii) average distance between the object\nand sensor. Apart\
    \ from coverage range, several factors [23] affect the performance of platforms,\n\
    as mentioned in Table 4.\nTable 4. Key differences between spectral image platforms.\n\

    \ are considered to be the most stable platforms among\nall others. These platforms\
    \ consist of satellites, rockets and space shuttles. Space borne platforms are\n\
    categorized based on the orbits and timing. The advantages of satellite-based\
    \ remote sensing include\nhigh spatial resolution, which makes it promising to\
    \ extract extensive time-series data. The images\nobtained by satellite platforms\
    \ cover large area and are stable without noise, which is normally induced\ndue\
    \ to interference while image capturing. However, the main problem with satellite-based\
    \ platforms\nis their high cost in the case of high spatial resolution images.\
    \ The second problem is their strictly ﬁxed\ntime schedule, so data cannot be\
    \ collected at critical timings. The re-visitation times vary from twice\nin one\
    \ day to 16 days, depending on the orbit of the satellite. The other big problem\
    \ is that satellite\nplatforms are highly sensitive to weather conditions, so\
    \ if the weather is cloudy, the captured image will\nhave less detailed information.\
    \ Table 5 shows the main types of satellites with their speciﬁcations [22].\n\
    Among all satellite platforms presented in Table 5, some satellite data are freely\
    \ available,\nwhile others provide a commercial solution. The commercial solutions\
    \ such as Pleiades-1 provide\nimages with a high resolution and a revisit time\
    \ of one day. QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel are\nfrequently-used satellite\
    \ platforms used to obtain hyperspectral imagery. QuickBird was launched\nin 2001\
    \ by USA. The Panchromatic (PAN) and four Multi-Spectral (MS) imagery sensors\
    \ are used in\nQuickBird with a GSD of 0.7 × 0.7–2.6 × 2.6 m with a revisit time\
    \ 1–3.5 days. QuickBird provides a\nsmall revisit time, but it is a commercial\
    \ solution. In contrast to QuickBird, Landsat-8 and Sentinel\nprovide free solutions.\
    \ Landsat-8 was launched in 2013 by the USA. Landsat-8 provides a GSD of\n16 days\
    \ with PAN and 11-MS imagery sensors. Though revisit time of Landsat-8 is much\
    \ higher\ncompared to QuickBird, but it provides images with 11 different multi-spectral\
    \ bands.\nSentinel is another broadly-used satellite launched by the EU. It currently\
    \ has three missions,\ni.e., Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3. These missions\
    \ provide images with 21 MS bands with\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n8 of 25\nrevisit\
    \ times of 5–10 days depending on which Sentinel mission is used. However, Sentinel-2\
    \ is a\ncommonly-used platform in precision agriculture as it provides data freely\
    \ at a 10-m spatial resolution\nand covers a swath width of 290 km. By combining\
    \ Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B, the revisit time is\nfurther reduced to ﬁve days,\
    \ which helps in change detection. The complete details of all satellite\nplatforms\
    \ with their speciﬁcations are listed in Table 5, where other platforms such as\
    \ SAT, MODIS\nand WordView are also considered.\nTable 5. Satellite platforms\

    \ a vibrant alternative to satellite and airborne, which are quite ﬂexible and\
    \ cost\neffective. A typical UAV platform consists of a communication and navigation\
    \ system that incorporates\na set of sensors mounted on it. Among UAV platforms,\
    \ there are mainly ﬁxed-wing platforms. and\nmultirotor options are available.\
    \ The ﬂying time is based on the payload weight. In general, a longer\nﬂying time\
    \ is achieved by ﬁxed-wing systems, which demands lighter weight payloads. For\
    \ example,\nhigh-deﬁnition cameras weighing less than 300 grams as the payload\
    \ of a ﬁxed-wing UAV allow it to ﬂy\nfor around two hours using currently available\
    \ battery power [24]. On the contrary, battery-powered\nmultirotor UAV with higher\
    \ payload capacity have a reduced ﬂying time, i.e., around 15–25 min.\nTable 7\
    \ shows UAV platforms commonly used in the agriculture domain and concretely to\
    \ monitor\nthe health of crops remotely [22]. Among these platforms, DJI/Phantom-2\
    \ is a more suitable choice\nfor intermediate agricultural land because of its\
    \ low cost and ease of use. The other advantage of this\nplatform is that it provides\
    \ support for mounting multiple cameras, which helps to monitor the crop in\n\
    multiple electro-magnetic bands. The American Aerospace/RS-16 is also an option\
    \ because of its ﬂight\ntime and large are coverage, but due to its high cost,\
    \ this platform is not common.\nIn [25], the ESAFLY A2500_WH helicopter was used\
    \ to implement the platform of the UAV\nwith Tetra cam ADC Micro as the camera\
    \ to capture hyper-spectral images of two different types of\ncultivation, i.e.,\
    \ vineyard and tomato. The images captured by the UAV platform are very high in\n\
    resolution, so more information can be extracted as compared to satellite images.\
    \ To assess the health\nof a crop, three types of Vegetation Index (VI) maps have\
    \ been computed.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n10 of 25\nTable 7. UAV platforms for\

    Camera\n3.2. Vegetation Indices\nUsing multi-spectral images from the remote sensors\
    \ described above, a series of Vegetation\nIndices (VIs) can be computed. Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) obtained from remote sensing-based canopies\nare effective algorithms\
    \ for quantitative and qualitative evaluations of vigour, vegetation cover and\n\
    growth dynamics, among other applications [26]. Hitherto, no uniﬁed mathematical\
    \ expression exists\nthat deﬁnes all VIs due to the complexity of the several\
    \ light spectra combinations, instrumentation,\nresolutions and platforms used.\
    \ In particular, this section focuses on vegetation indices NDVI, GDVI\nand SAVI,\
    \ as they are widely used in PA.\n3.2.1. NDVI\nThe Normalized Difference Vegetation\
    \ Index (NDVI) is the most popular VI that is extensively\nused to ﬁnd the content\
    \ of green in PA applications [27,28]. It uses Red (R) and Near Infrared (NIR)\n\
    channels to compute the NDVI index. More NIR light is absorbed by healthy vegetation;\
    \ however,\nabsorption ratio is very small for red light. NDVI is computed by\
    \ Equation (1) and returns a value\nbetween −1 and 1 [29].\nNDVI = NIR − R\nNIR\
    \ + R\n(1)\nHigher NDVI value indicate healthy vegetation, while smaller values\
    \ of NDVI show that vegetation is\nvery small at that speciﬁc region. There is\
    \ another form of NDVI, i.e., the Green Normalized Vegetation\nIndex (GNDVI),\
    \ which uses the green channel instead of red. GNDVI is computed by Equation (2):\n\
    GNDVI = NIR − G\nNIR + G\n(2)\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n11 of 25\n3.2.2. Difference\
    \ Vegetation Index\nThe DVI was proposed to reduce the effect of soil reﬂectance,\
    \ which is not covered by NDVI [30].\nDVI is different between the reﬂectance\
    \ of the NIR band to the reﬂectance of the red band. DVI is also\ncomputed with\
    \ the green band, i.e., GDVI. Both DVI and GDVI are computed by Equations (3)\
    \ and (4):\nDVI = NIR − R\n(3)\nGDVI = NIR − G\n(4)\n3.2.3. SAVI\nNDVI and DVI\
    \ do not compensate the background effect of soil. Therefore, many vegetation\n\
    indices were introduced to compensate the effect of soil reﬂectance. The Soil\
    \ Adjusted Vegetation Index\n(SAVI), the Green Soil Adjusted vegetation Index\
    \ (GSAVI), the Optimized Soil Adjusted Vegetation\nIndex (OSAVI), the Green Optimized\
    \ Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (OGSAVI) and the Modiﬁed\nSoil Adjusted Vegetation\
    \ Index (MSAVI) [31–33] are common among them, which are computed by\nEquations\
    \ (5)–(9):\nSAVI =\n1.5(NIR − R)\n(NIR + R + 0.5)\n(5)\nGSAVI = 1.5(NIR − G)\n\
    NIR + G + 0.5\n(6)\nOSAVI =\n(NIR − G)\nNIR + R + 0.16\n(7)\nGOSAVI =\n(NIR −\
    \ G)\nNIR + G + 0.16\n(8)\nMSAVI = 0.5[2(NIR + 1) −\nq\n(2NIR + 1)2 − 8(NIR −\
    \ R)]\n(9)\n3.2.4. NR and NG:\nNormalized Red (NR) and Normalized Green (NG) are\
    \ two other famous vegetation indices being\nused in PA [33]. NR focuses on the\
    \ part of spectrum where radiation is absorbed by chlorophyll, while\nNG focuses\
    \ on the part of the spectrum where radiation is absorbed by other pigments, excluding\n\
    chlorophyll. NR and NG are computed by Equations (10) and (11):\nNR =\nR\nNIR\
    \ + R + G\n(10)\nNG =\nG\nNIR + R + G\n(11)\n4. Wireless Sensor Network Applications\
    \ in Agriculture\nMultiple applications of wireless sensor networks are being\
    \ utilized today in the agriculture sector.\nSome very common applications are\
    \ smart irrigation, smart fertilization, smart pest control and green\nhouse monitoring.\n\
    4.1. Smart Irrigation Systems\nSmart irrigation is an artiﬁcial irrigation application\
    \ that controls the quantity of water by making\na decision about where water\
    \ is needed. It is the most signiﬁcant constituent in agriculture, which has\n\
    a great impact on crops’ health, cost and productivity. One major aspect of smart\
    \ irrigation is to avoid\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n12 of 25\nthe wastage of water\
    \ since most countries in the world are facing water scarcity problems. A smart\n\
    irrigation system was presented in [34] in which a Raspberry Pi was used along\
    \ with two sensors:\na soil moisture sensor was used to assess the water level\
    \ in the soil, while a temperature and humidity\nsensor was used to monitor the\
    \ environmental condition. The Raspberry Pi was connected to these\nsensors and\
    \ the water supply network. A mobile application was developed for remote monitoring\n\
    and remote water ﬂow control enabling both manual and automatic water ﬂow control.\
    \ In automatic\nmode, water ﬂow was automatically turned ON/OFF based on the water\
    \ level of the soil without\nhuman intervention. In manual mode, the user was\
    \ able to monitor the soil moisture level. An alert\nwas generated when the water\
    \ level of soil was getting below a speciﬁc threshold, and the user turned\nit\
    \ ON/OFF using a mobile application.\nPower is a big concern in IoT-based platforms,\
    \ so many researchers have developed power-\nefﬁcient systems. A power-efﬁcient\
    \ water irrigation system was presented using solar power [35]\nin which the controller\
    \ was connected to the soil sensor and water supply valve. The water valve\nwas\
    \ turned ON/OFF based on the water level monitored by the moisture sensor. The\
    \ power was\nsupplied by the solar panel, so the system was independent of any\
    \ external power module. Another\nsensor-based IoT system for water irrigation\
    \ was presented in [36] in which the controller controlled\nthe opening and closing\
    \ of a solenoid valve based on the water level of the soil. In addition, a series\
    \ of\nweather alerts were sent to the user via a mobile application to update\
    \ the temperature and humidity of\nthe environment, which had a direct inﬂuence\
    \ on the water level of the soil. In [37], an energy-efﬁcient\nirrigation system\
    \ for cultivated crops was presented using a wireless sensor network in which\
    \ water\nwas effectively controlled based on environmental conditions. This system\
    \ estimated the quantity of\nwater needed for normal irrigation based on the humidity,\
    \ temperature and wind speed collected by\nsensors along with historical data.\n\
    In [38], an IoT-based irrigation system was presented using soil moisture sensors\
    \ controlled by\nATMEGA 328P on an Arduino UNO board along with a GPRS module.\
    \ The data collected from the\nsensors were sent to the cloud, i.e., Things Speak,\
    \ where graphs were generated to visualize the data\ntrends. A web portal was\
    \ also designed where the farmer was able to check the status of water, if it\n\
    was ON/OFF. Similarly, a real-time prototype for an irrigation system was presented\
    \ in [39] in which\nsoil moisture sensors and soil temperature sensors were used\
    \ to assess the water status of the soil.\nRFID was used to transmit data to the\
    \ cloud for further data analysis. Using ATMEGA 328, a water\nsprinkler system\
    \ for smart irrigation was presented in [40] using temperature, humidity and soil\n\
    moisture sensors. The water sprinkler was controlled based on the soil moisture\
    \ level to save water\nand reduce human effort. In [41], a cost-effective drip\
    \ irrigation system for a home was proposed in\nwhich a Raspberry Pi, Arduino,\
    \ electronic water control valve and relay were used. ZigBee protocols\nwere used\
    \ for communication. The user turned ON/OFF the water valve by sending commands\
    \ to the\nRaspberry Pi, which further processed the commands through the Arduino.\n\
    The sensors placement is a big issue that affects the accuracy of sensors. A detailed\
    \ discussion of\nsoil moisture positioning in the ﬁeld and their accuracy was\
    \ presented in [42]. For real-time irrigation\nsystems, complete software and\
    \ hardware requirements, problems and challenges and advantages\nwere discussed\
    \ in [43] where a big picture of the complete system was provided.\n4.2. Smart\
    \ Fertilization System\nFertilizer is an artiﬁcial or natural substance having\
    \ some chemical elements used to enhance\nthe growth and productivity of plants.\
    \ Manual spraying is a common technique used for fertilization.\nHowever, the\
    \ optimal way of fertilization requires sensing capabilities to ﬁnd the exact\
    \ place where\nfertilizer is needed, which chemical components are missing and\
    \ the amount of fertilizer needed.\nIt is important to provide fertilizers in\
    \ a very precise amount in order to improve productivity [44].\nMultiple fertilization\
    \ techniques have been presented by researchers since the last decade using WSN\n\
    and IoT.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n13 of 25\nAn automated fertilization system\
    \ was presented in [45] using real-time sensors to measure the\nsoil fertility.\
    \ The system consisted of three modules including input, output and decision support.\n\
    The decision support module measured the optimal amount of fertilizers needed\
    \ for the growth of the\nplants based on the real-time sensory data captured by\
    \ the sensors. A mechanical sensor named the\n“Pendulum Meter” was introduced\
    \ in [46], which was used for optimal fertilization. This sensor was\nmounted\
    \ on the tractor to measure the density of the crop, so the corresponding fertilizer\
    \ spreader\nwas controlled based on the readings of this sensor. The IEEE 802.11\
    \ Wi-Fi module was used for\ncommunication along with GPS. Real-time data of soil\
    \ were collected by several sensors, i.e., soil\nmoisture, temperature, conductivity,\
    \ NO2, CO2, etc. A Geographical Information System (GIS) server\nwas used to interpolate\
    \ sensory data.\n4.3. Smart Pest Control and Early Disease Detection System\n\
    Pest attacks are the root cause of low productivity in the agriculture sector.\
    \ These pests result in\nseveral serious diseases in plants that affect the plant’s\
    \ growth. However, disease prediction provides\nearly warning to the farmers,\
    \ which enables them to make appropriate decisions to control the disease\non\
    \ time. Pest control systems are comprised of electronic devices that enable humans\
    \ to identify traps\nin a speciﬁc range of these electronic devices [47]. These\
    \ electronic devices are sensors capable of\ncalculating the environmental parameters\
    \ for further analysis.\nMuch research has been done in the agriculture sector\
    \ for early disease detection and pest control\nsystems using more advanced and\
    \ sophisticated technologies [48,49]. Multiple imagery sensors have\nbeen used\
    \ by different researchers to collect imagery data, such as: RGB sensors, ﬂuorescence\
    \ imagery\nsensors, spectral sensors and thermal sensors [50]. The thermal sensors\
    \ are used to measure the water\nstatus in the plant by measuring the temperature,\
    \ since this parameter has a direct inﬂuence on the\nwater level in the plants.\
    \ RGB images have three colour channels, i.e., red, green and blue, which\ncan\
    \ be used to perceive the biometric effect in the plants. Multi- and hyper-spectral\
    \ sensors capture\nimages containing the spatial information of objects in multiple\
    \ wavebands. The spatial resolution is\ndependent on the distance between the\
    \ object and the sensor. That is why satellite images contain less\nspatial resolution\
    \ as compared to low altitude platforms such as drones. The ﬂuorescence sensors\
    \ are\nused to distinguish the photosynthetic activities in the plants. Various\
    \ image processing techniques\nare applied to these imagery data to identify the\
    \ diseases in plants.\nIn [50], an IoT-based plants disease and pest prediction\
    \ system was presented to minimize the\nexcessive use of fungicides and insecticides.\
    \ Weather condition monitoring sensors, i.e., temperature,\ndew, humidity and\
    \ wind speed, are used to monitor weather parameters to ﬁnd a correlation between\n\
    pest growth with weather. The sensors have been deployed in orchards, and data\
    \ collected from these\nsensors are sent to the cloud. The farmer is informed\
    \ about the alarming condition of the pest attack\non the crops.\nFrom a different\
    \ point of view, hyper-spectral images are used to analyse crops’ health and pest\n\
    attack using manned or unmanned vehicles on which spectral cameras are mounted.\
    \ The captured\nimages are analysed in depth using machine learning techniques\
    \ to identify the disease in the plants.\nAdvance Neural Networks (ANNs) are more\
    \ common for processing imagery data due to their ability\nto learn complex structures\
    \ and patterns. Using hyper-spectral images, a system was presented [51] to\n\
    identify disease or pest attack in crops. The proposed system for disease detection\
    \ used an ANN with\nmultiple layers.\nEarly disease detection in sugar beet plants\
    \ was presented in [52]. For early detection, four\nsupervised classiﬁcation algorithms\
    \ were applied on spectral images. Spectral images were then\ncollected for each\
    \ image, and multiple vegetation indices were calculated to be used in predictive\n\
    and perspective analysis. The vegetation indices used were NVDI, SR, SIPI, PSSRaand\
    \ PSSRb, ARI,\nREP, mCAIand RRE. These vegetation indices values were used as\
    \ features in the dataset. Support\nVector Machine (SVM), ANN, and decision tree\
    \ were used for classiﬁcation. A comparative analysis\nwas performed which, showed\
    \ that SVM outperformed other classiﬁers for disease detection with an\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 3796\n14 of 25\naccuracy of 97.12%. In [53], a data mining technique\
    \ was applied on the already collected dataset of\ntwo types of crops, i.e., wheat\
    \ and paddy (rice), in India. For dimension reduction, Sammon’s mapping\nwas used\
    \ for multi-dimension scaling, i.e., to reduce the dimension also for unsupervised\
    \ learning.\nFor high dimensional data, dimension reduction is required prior\
    \ to performing further data analysis\nfor better data visualization and accuracy,\
    \ since redundant dimensions reduce the effectiveness of\nany data analysis algorithms.\
    \ Principle Component Analysis (PCA) is a very often-used technique\nalong with\
    \ Sammon’s mapping. Data from multi-dimensions were reduced to two or three dimensions.\n\
    Then, the Self-Organized Maps (SOM) algorithm for clustering was used to ﬁnd correlations\
    \ between\nthe data. The accuracy comparison of SOM and Sammon’s mapping was presented,\
    \ which showed\nthat SOM performed better on a large dataset, while Sammon’s mapping\
    \ was suitable for small ones.\nSmart phones played important role in data acquisition,\
    \ which were further used to monitor the crops’\nhealth. In [54], the health of\
    \ wheat crop was monitored using near surface imagery captured by a smart\nphone.\
    \ The crop was classiﬁed as healthy or unhealthy based on the green level by computing\
    \ Gcc.\nMost of the applications in PA have been either IoT-based in which multiple\
    \ sensors are used to\nassess the health of the crop or remote sensing-based in\
    \ which crop health is assessed by performing\nsome computation on spectral images.\
    \ We can compare crop health monitoring application based\non some attributes\
    \ such as which sensors are used in particular applications, whether web or mobile\n\
    services are provided or not, etc. The comparative analysis of some existing crop\
    \ health monitoring\napplications is presented in Table 8 based on some attributes.\n\
    To precisely monitor the crop health, both IoT-based techniques and remote sensing\
    \ techniques\nshould be used together to provide more reliable and accurate information\
    \ about the crop. As a\nproof of concept, we present a case study in which a crop\
    \ health monitoring system based on IoT and\nremote sensing techniques is proposed.\
    \ We provide a complete end-to-end solution in the agriculture\ndomain by facilitating\
    \ the agricultural user with web and mobile services so that he/she could be\n\
    informed about the latest condition of the crop in a timely manner. In this way,\
    \ remedy actions could\nbe performed in time, which will result in enhanced production.\n\

    N\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n16 of 25\n5. A Case Study on UAV-Based and IoT-Based\
    \ Precision Agriculture\nWe developed a complete solution for crop health monitoring\
    \ based on IoT and remote sensing.\nIn the proposed system, crop health is monitored\
    \ using data collected from multiple IoT sensors,\nas well as NDVI mapping of\
    \ spectral images captured by a drone. The architecture of the proposed\nsystem\
    \ is shown in Figure 1, which was designed according to two main modules. The\
    \ ﬁrst module\nwas a wireless sensor network-based system in which multiple wireless\
    \ nodes were developed. Each\nwireless node was comprised of a soil moisture sensor\
    \ used to monitor the water level of the soil,\na soil temperature sensor used\
    \ to check the temperature of the soil and air temperature and humidity\nsensors.\
    \ These nodes were deployed across the ﬁeld in a star topology fashion where the\
    \ master node\ncollected readings from all slave nodes and transmitted the captured\
    \ reading to the back-end server for\nfurther processing. The master node acted\
    \ as a gateway node, which received data from all slave nodes\nusing NRF communication\
    \ module. After performing initial processing, the master node transmitted\nthe\
    \ data to the cloud using GSM communication technology. In the case of the unavailability\
    \ of the\nGSM network, this node stored the captured data and transmitted to the\
    \ cloud upon the availability\nof network.\nThe second module was used to monitor\
    \ crop health using multi-spectral imagery, which was\ncollected by a multi-spectral\
    \ camera mounted on a drone. The NDVI was computed using Equation (1)\nto classify\
    \ between healthy and unhealthy plants by measuring the chlorophyll content in\
    \ the crops,\nwhich was further used to localize the area under stress precisely.\n\
    All collected data were sent to the cloud where further analysis was performed.\
    \ The web portal\nwas designed to help the farmer monitor the crop proﬁle over\
    \ the whole life cycle. Currently, we are\nmonitoring soil moisture, soil temperature,\
    \ air moisture and air temperature readings in real time\nalong with NDVI mapping\
    \ of spectral imagery. Multiple web services were provided on the web\nportal\
    \ including historical/real data visualization using graphs, weather monitoring,\
    \ NDVI mapping\nand the correlation among measured parameters. Figure 2 shows\
    \ the snapshots of the web portal\nalong with different services.\nFigure 1. System\
    \ architecture.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n17 of 25\nFigure 2. User interface of\
    \ the web portal.\nFor portability and remote monitoring, a mobile application\
    \ was also developed to facilitate the\nfarmer/agronomist/landlord with all the\
    \ web services that are available on web portal. The alerts\nare generated when\
    \ an abnormal behaviour is observed in the crop, which help the farmer to take\n\
    remedy actions in a timely manner. The user interfaces of the mobile application\
    \ are shown in Figure 3.\nTherefore, the web portal along with mobile applications\
    \ provides a complete solution, which enables\nagricultural users monitor the\
    \ current status of the crop, as well as previous details.\nFigure 3. User interface\
    \ of the mobile application.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n18 of 25\n6. Results and\
    \ Discussion\n6.1. Analysis of the Data Collected by IoT Nodes\nThe developed\
    \ IoT nodes were deployed across the wheat ﬁelds of an area of 1.4375 hectare.\n\
    The selected area was located in Islamabad, Pakistan. The wheat ﬁelds are shown\
    \ in Figure 4 along\nwith the IoT node and sensors. We deployed the system across\
    \ the wheat ﬁeld in March 2019 when\nwheat was in the grain ﬁlling and grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 4. System deployed across the wheat ﬁelds.\nWe collected the\
    \ sensors’ readings such as air temperature, air humidity, soil temperature and\n\
    soil moisture. We compared the observed crop parameters with the ideal wheat temperature\
    \ proﬁle\nas shown in Figure 5. Extreme variation in the weather of Islamabad\
    \ was observed in that particular\ntime period, which can be seen by how the actual\
    \ temperature for wheat crop deviated from the ideal\ntemperature proﬁle of the\
    \ wheat crop.\nFigure 5. Deviation of observed temperature from the ideal temperature\
    \ proﬁle.\nAdditionally, we performed linear regression to ﬁnd the correlation\
    \ between observed parameters,\nwhich provided insight into how changes in one\
    \ parameter can effect the other parameter. The linear\nregression found a relation\
    \ between the two parameters by ﬁtting the equation of the line using the\nobserved\
    \ dataset [69]. Equation (12) represents an equation of the line where mrepresents\
    \ the slope of\nline, while c indicates the y-intercept. The variables m and c\
    \ were learned from the data.\ny = mx + c\n(12)\nFigure 6A shows the correlation\
    \ between the observed air temperature and air humidity, which showed\nthat both\
    \ were negatively correlated. The correlation between air temperature and soil\
    \ temperature is\nshown in Figure 6B, which shows that both were positively correlated.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 3796\n19 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\nFigure 6. (A) Correlation b/wair temperature\
    \ and air humidity. (B) Correlation b/w air temperature\nand soil temperature.\n\
    The rise in air temperature caused the air humidity to reduce, while it resulted\
    \ in an increase in\nsoil temperature and vice versa.\n6.2. Analysis of Multi-spectral\
    \ Images Captured by Drone\nTo collect multi-spectral imagery, we used the DJI-Phantom\
    \ Pro Advanced drone with the Sentera\nMulti-spectral-imaging sensor. The drone\
    \ had its own optical camera, while the multi-spectral camera\nwas mounted on\
    \ it to obtain spectral images. Multiple ﬂights of the drone were carried out\
    \ at the\nspeciﬁc growing stages of the crop, i.e., grain ripening and grain ﬁlling\
    \ stage. After collecting these\nimages, they were transferred to the cloud for\
    \ NDVI mapping. Figure 7A shows the optical image\nthat was captured on 16 May\
    \ 2019 when wheat was in the harvesting stage, while Figure 7B is its\nspectral\
    \ image, and Figure 7C is the NDVI mapping. Since wheat was at a mature stage,\
    \ its NDVI\nshould be very small, i.e., ideally there should be no green region\
    \ in the ﬁeld. However, in NDVI\nmapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal\
    \ behaviour of the crop. The green region was\ndue to naturally growing plants.\
    \ This information can be visualized on the web portal.\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure\
    \ 7. Wheat crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\nThe\
    \ same process was performed in a maize ﬁeld when maize was in the grain ripening\
    \ stage.\nFigure 8A shows the optical image that was captured on 24 July 2019\
    \ when maize was in the grain\nripening stage, while Figure 8B is its spectral\
    \ image, and Figure 8C is the NDVI mapping. The same\nbehaviour can be observed\
    \ with the maize crop, i.e., there should be a minimal green region in the\nﬁeld.\
    \ However, in NDVI mapping, a large green region indicated the abnormal behaviour\
    \ of the crop.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n20 of 25\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nFigure 8. Maize\
    \ crop. (A) Optical image; (B) spectral image; (C) NDVI mapping.\n7. Challenges\n\
    PA has been used since the last few decades to enhance crops’ yield with reduced\
    \ costs and\nhuman effort, although the adoption of these novel techniques by\
    \ farmers is still very limited owing to\nthe following reasons or challenges.\n\
    7.1. Hardware Cost\nPA relies mostly on hardware such as sensors, wireless nodes,\
    \ drones, spectral imaging sensors,\netc., which are used to assess multiple parameters\
    \ in real time. These sensors have multiple limitations\nincluding high development,\
    \ maintenance and deployment cost. Some systems in PA are cost effective\nand\
    \ are suitable for small arable land, i.e., smart irrigation systems that require\
    \ low-cost hardware\ncomponents and sensors. However, drone-based systems for\
    \ crops’ health monitoring are feasible for\nlarge arable land due to high installation\
    \ cost.\n7.2. Weather Variations\nEnvironmental variation is one of the major\
    \ challenges that affects the accuracy of data collected\nby sensors. Sensor nodes\
    \ deployed in the ﬁeld are sensitive to environmental variations, i.e., rain,\n\
    ﬂuctuation in temperature, wind speed, sun light, etc. Communication between wireless\
    \ nodes\nand the cloud can be interrupted due interference induced in wireless\
    \ communication channels by\natmospheric disturbance. The satellite, air borne\
    \ and drone platforms are also sensitive to weather\nvariations. Imagery acquired\
    \ by these platforms is affected by contamination of clouds and other\nnatural\
    \ aerosols. The development of advanced techniques for atmospheric correction,\
    \ cloud detection\nand noise interpolation is a current open challenge, which\
    \ requires hard efforts from the research\ncommunity.\n7.3. Data Management\n\
    The sensors in PA constantly generate data. To ensure the integrity of data, some\
    \ data security\nmeasures needs to be in place, which will in turn enhance the\
    \ cost of the system. The readings from\nthe sensors have to be accurate in order\
    \ to take appropriate actions precisely when and where required.\nAn intruder\
    \ can corrupt the readings, and false readings will adversely reduce the effectiveness\
    \ of\nthe system. PA systems generate immense amounts of data, which require enough\
    \ resources to\nperform data analysis. Real-time data collected from sensors deployed\
    \ across the ﬁelds after a few\nminutes and spectral imagery acquired from high-altitude\
    \ or low-altitude platforms produce the bulk\nof the data, which increase the\
    \ storage and processing requirements. New software platforms and\nfacilities\
    \ for scalable management of Big Data sources are demanded. In this regard, the\
    \ generation\nof software-as-a-service solutions is focused on merging data management\
    \ and IoT thorough cloud\ncomputing platforms.\nSensors 2019, 19, 3796\n21 of\
    \ 25\n7.4. Literacy Rate\nLiteracy is an important factor that inﬂuences the adoption\
    \ ratio in PA. In developing countries\nwhere the illiteracy rate is high, farmers\
    \ grow crops based on their experience. They do not utilize the\nstate-of-the-art\
    \ technologies in agriculture, which results in loss of production. Farmers need\
    \ to be\neducated in order to understand the technology or they have to trust\
    \ a third party for technical support.\nTherefore, in underdeveloped areas where\
    \ the literacy rate is not high, PA is not very common due to\nthe limitations\
    \ of resources and education.\n7.5. Connectivity\nNext-generation 5G networks\
    \ can be 100-times faster than 4G ones, making communication\nbetween devices\
    \ and servers much quicker. 5G can also carry much more data than other networks,\n\
    which makes it an ideal technology for transmitting information from remote sensors\
    \ and drones, key\ntools that are being tested in PA environments. The adoption\
    \ of new communication networks based\non 5G is a must in current applications\
    \ where secure and rapid data transfer enables real-time data\nmanagement and\
    \ support for decision making.\n7.6. Interoperability\nOne of the biggest problems\
    \ PA faces is the interoperability of equipment due to different digital\nstandards.\
    \ This lack of interoperability is not only obstructing the adoption of new IoT\
    \ technologies\nand slowing down their growth, but it also inhibits the gain of\
    \ production efﬁciency through smart\nagriculture applications. New methods and\
    \ protocols to integrate different machine communication\nstandards to unlock\
    \ the potential of efﬁcient machine-to-machine communication and data sharing\n\
    between machines and management information systems are required in the current\
    \ scenario of PA.\n8. Conclusion and Future Directions\nPrecision agriculture\
    \ is a modern practice used to enhance crops’ productivity using latest\ntechnologies,\
    \ i.e., WSN, IoT, cloud computing, Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning\n\
    (ML). Most of the research done so far indicates that PA-based practices have\
    \ a great inﬂuence on\nsustainability and productivity. The objective of PA is\
    \ to provide decision support systems based\non multiple parameters of crops,\
    \ i.e., soil nutrients, water level of the soil, wind speed, intensity of\nsunlight,\
    \ temperature, humidity, chlorophyll content, etc. However, several challenges\
    \ are involved\nin the development and deployment phase of these systems. This\
    \ article was aimed at providing a\nsurvey of modern technologies involving current\
    \ PA platforms, with the goal of supporting industry\nand research communities\
    \ on the development of modern applications for smart agriculture. A case\nstudy\
    \ was presented to prove the effectiveness of the PA in the agriculture domain.\n\
    Since the main objective of precision agriculture is to produce surplus yield\
    \ by optimizing the\nresources such as water, pesticides, fertilizers, etc., for\
    \ resource optimization, prescription maps play\nan important role, which enables\
    \ farmers to quantify resources required for healthy crops at any\nparticular\
    \ growth stage. Most of the research accomplished in the agriculture domain focuses\
    \ on the\nremote sensing platforms to collect imagery, which reﬂects only Vegetation\
    \ Indices (VIs) such as NDVI.\nThe prescription maps cannot be generated by only\
    \ using VIs; instead, multiple other factors need to\nbe considered such as soil\
    \ properties, soil moisture level, meteorological behaviour, etc.\nFunding: This\

    1Food safety is becoming more and more serious topic worldwide. To tackle the
    food safety issues from the technical aspect, people need a trusted food traceability
    system that can track and monitor the whole lifespan of food production, including
    the processes of food raw material cultivation/breeding, processing, transporting,
    warehousing, and selling etc. In this paper, we propose a trusted, self-organized,
    open and ecological food traceability system based on blockchain and Internet
    of Things (IoT) technologies, which involves all parties of a smart agriculture
    ecosystem, even if they may not trust each other. We use IoT devices to replace
    manual recording and verification as many as possible, which can reduce the human
    intervention to the system effectively. Furthermore, we plan to use the smart
    contract technology to help the law-executor to find problems and process them
    timely. References X. Gu, Y. Chai, Y. Liu, J. Shen, Y. Huang, and Y. Nan. 2017.

    Get rights and content Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) refers to a series
    of practices and tools necessary to correctly evaluate farming needs. The accuracy
    and effectiveness of PA solutions are highly dependent on accurate and timely
    analysis of the soil conditions. In this paper, a proof-of-concept towards an
    autonomous precision irrigation system is provided through the integration of
    a center pivot (CP) irrigation system with wireless underground sensor networks
    (WUSNs). This Wireless Underground Sensor-Aided Center Pivot (WUSA-CP) system
    will provide autonomous irrigation management capabilities by monitoring the soil
    conditions in real time using wireless underground sensors. To this end, field
    experiments with a hydraulic drive and continuous-move center pivot irrigation
    system are conducted. The results are used to evaluate empirical channel models
    for soil-air communications. The experiment results show that the concept of WUSA-CP
    is feasible. Through the design of an underground antenna, communication ranges
    can be improved by up to 400% compared to conventional antenna designs. The results
    also highlight that the wireless communication channel between soil and air is
    significantly affected by many spatio-temporal aspects, such as the location and
    burial depth of the sensors, soil texture and physical properties, soil moisture,
    and the vegetation canopy height. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
    work on the development of an autonomous precision irrigation system with WUSNs.

    1. Introduction With the growth of the world population, the corresponding increase
    in the demand for food encourages production agriculture into a new generation
    of practice called precision agriculture (PA). PA techniques focus on the existence
    of in-field variability of natural components, including chemical leaching, runoff,
    drainage, water content, nutrients, and soil components [6], [7]. The goal is
    to utilize new technologies, such as GPS, satellites, aerial remote sensing and
    sensors to assess the variations in a field more accurately. Accordingly, farming
    practices, including sowing, irrigation and fertilizer management, and pest control,
    can be scheduled autonomously according to the assessment of the field. The accuracy
    and effectiveness of this autonomous PA system depend on the timely evaluation
    of the field. Irrigation scheduling requires the knowledge of “when” and “how
    much” water to apply to optimize crop production. Effective irrigation management
    for irrigation systems requires that soil water status be accurately monitored
    over time in representative locations in the field. For optimum yield, soil water
    in the crop root-zone must be maintained between desirable upper and lower limits
    of plant available water. Proper irrigation management will help prevent economic
    losses (yield quantity and quality) caused by over or underirrigation; movement
    of nutrients, pesticides and other chemicals into the groundwater and other water
    bodies; and wasting water resources and energy consumption. Determination of soil
    water status for irrigation management using hand-feel method is practiced in
    the absence of accurate and low cost soil moisture sensors. The hand-feel method
    does not provide quantitative soil water status; rather it provides a qualitative
    indication of soil water status and is subject to the person’s ability to feel
    the soil. To improve irrigation management, quantitative knowledge of soil water
    status deep in the soil profile is necessary, but not possible with the hand-feel
    method. Any error in the hand-feel method will cause significant errors in determination
    of irrigation water requirement [8]. The objective of irrigation management is
    to establish a proper timing and amount of irrigation for greatest effectiveness.
    Proper irrigation management will minimize yield loss due to crop water stress,
    maximize yield response to other management practices, and optimize yield per
    unit of water applied. These factors contribute to farm profitability. Irrigation
    management that results in either excessive or inadequate water application can
    significantly reduce the potential for profitability. Proper irrigation management
    will help to reduce the potential for runoff and reduce soil erosion and pesticide
    movement into surface and ground water. Thus, irrigation systems coupled with
    proper in situ soil moisture monitoring for irrigation scheduling has significant
    advantage in terms of water saving as well as improving crop yields and yield
    quality over unmanaged systems where irrigation decisions are not based on quantitative
    soil moisture indicators [9]. Unfortunately, traditional soil measurement techniques
    may not be feasible in providing real-time data, and hence may not satisfy the
    requirements of PA. Most of the traditional soil moisture sensors need to be installed
    early in the growing season and need to be removed before harvest, adding additional
    time and labor requirements. To this end, Wireless Underground Sensor Networks
    (WUSNs) have recently been investigated for unattended soil monitoring [1], [4],
    [16], [17], [20], [23]. These networks consist of wirelessly-connected underground
    sensor nodes that communicate through soil. For the autonomous PA, WUSNs provide
    an adaptable and efficient cyber-physical system (CPS) that provides timely information
    of the soil condition with high granularity [15]. Compared with satellites and
    aerial remote sensing, WUSNs can provide more direct and precise information about
    some of the soil conditions. In addition, the operation cost of WUSNs is far less
    than these other techniques. Unlike wired sensor networks, which need to be deployed
    and removed frequently during the process of planting, WUSNs are deployed in the
    ground at a safe depth and do not interfere with agriculture machinery operations,
    such as tillage practices. In this paper, we present a proof-of-concept for a
    cyber-physical system application called Wireless Underground Sensor-Aided Center
    Pivot (WUSA-CP) irrigation. In this application, an irrigation solution called
    a center pivot system [13] is used as a physical mobile structure to communicate
    with buried underground sensors to receive soil moisture condition data. To this
    end, we investigate the unique challenges towards such an autonomous irrigation
    system. One major challenge is the unique channel properties between underground
    and aboveground wireless entities. Unlike conventional over the air communication,
    the properties of soil, especially the relative permittivity, significantly impact
    behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation. We first analyze the channel models
    of this hybrid WUSNs and then two antenna designs are evaluated in a corn field
    to verify the channel model and the concept of WUSA-CP. Meanwhile, the asymmetry
    of the communication over distance and the burstiness of the packet error rate
    are analyzed. The results are promising for implementing cyber-physical systems
    for the purpose of autonomous precision agriculture. The rest of this paper is
    organized as follows: In Section 2, center pivot system and irrigation methods
    are explained, in addition to the characteristics of WUSNs. Related studies are
    also discussed in Section 2. In Section 3, the channel models for the underground-to-aboveground
    link and the aboveground-to-underground link are described. In Section 4, the
    hardware, the program and the methodology used in the experiments are described.
    The setup of the experiments for the integration of CP system with WUSN is described
    in Section 5 and the empirical results are discussed in Section 6 with a numerical
    analysis of the channel model and communication quality. Finally, the paper is
    concluded in Section 7. 2. Background and related work In this section, we first
    provide a background on center pivot irrigation systems in Section 2.1 and then,
    WUSNs are described in Section 2.2. Finally, in Section 2.3, related work is discussed.
    2.1. Center-pivot systems In agriculture, efforts to reduce operating costs while
    maintaining and improving crop yields have been consistently made. One of the
    efforts to more uniformly apply irrigation water is sprinkler irrigation with
    a center pivot (CP) system [6], [13], which improves the efficiency of water use
    as well as of energy use. In Fig. 1, a CP is shown, which consists of several
    segment pipes (spans) supported by trusses and mounted on wheels with sprinklers
    (nozzles) placed along its length [3], [6], [13]. One end of the pipeline is connected
    to a pivot element at the center of the irrigating area that is called pivot point.
    The machine moves in a circular pattern. The water is fed through the pivot and
    sprinkled out as the machine moves. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1.
    Basic components of a center pivot (CP) system. CP irrigation systems have the
    advantage over other traditional or conventional gravity (furrow) or surface irrigation
    methods that the potential for deep percolation and surface run-off losses can
    be minimized or eliminated in a given field when the CP irrigation system is managed
    well. The CP systems requires much less (e.g., up to 40%) water application than
    the surface irrigation methods. Minimizing the water losses can increase the availability
    of water for crop transpiration and enhance the crop water productivity. Another
    significant advantage of the CP irrigation system is that the nutrients can be
    applied directly onto the crop canopy through the system (chemigation) [6]. Chemigating
    certain fertilizers, nutrients, herbicide, insecticide, and pesticide to the canopy
    directly can enhance the absorption by the crop leaves as compared with the ground
    (granular) application method. This would enhance the efficacy of the chemicals/nutrients,
    resulting in improved crop productivity. Due to the cost of CP, it is usually
    employed to irrigate large areas: from 3.5 to 65 ha [6], [13]. A CP for an area
    of 22 ha (220,000 m2) at the South Central Agricultural Laboratory (SCAL) at the
    University of Nebraska-Lincoln is used as a testbed for our experiments. There
    are two ways to control the amount of water applied to a field from a CP. One
    is to control the traveling speed of a CP. For the same flow rate, a higher traveling
    speed of the CP leads to a smaller amount of water applied to the field. The second
    method is to use electronically controlled nozzles to adjust the flow rate of
    the sprinklers. Because of the simplicity, high accuracy, and low cost (no need
    to change nozzles), the first option is often used. To further improve the efficiency
    of a CP, it is desirable to input real-time soil evaluation data into the system.
    Thus, water use can be adjusted according to the soil condition at a specific
    location. This is exactly what a cyber-physical system can provide to realize
    precision agriculture. Wireless underground sensors can also be utilized for failure
    detection. In current CP solutions, it takes a considerably long time to detect
    a malfunction in the machine that causes some nozzles to stop irrigating. Measurement
    of flow rate at the nozzle discharge point could also potentially provide information
    about whether a given nozzle is applying the designed flow rate of water. However,
    this would require installing very expensive and very sophisticated and extremely
    accurate and sensitive miniature flow meters at each nozzle discharge point, which
    would not be feasible in practical applications with the current available technologies.
    To this end, underground sensors can provide warnings and alerts if adequate soil
    moisture increase is not detected when a CP passes over a certain location within
    the field. These alerts can be provided to farmers immediately. Therefore, the
    damage caused by insufficient irrigation can be mitigated or avoided. To implement
    such WUSA-CP as an efficient PA solution, a communication infrastructure for the
    CP and the underground sensors needs to be implemented to provide real time soil
    condition information. To this end, in this study, wireless underground sensors
    are employed to provide the communication infrastructure. In the next section,
    this wireless underground communication technology is presented and its challenges
    are discussed. 2.2. Wireless underground sensor networks A WUSN is mainly formed
    by underground sensor nodes. However, the network still requires aboveground nodes
    for additional functionalities such as data retrieval, management, and relaying.
    Therefore, considering the locations of the sender and the receiver, three different
    communication links exist in WUSNs, as shown in Fig. 2: • Underground-to-underground
    (UG2UG) link: Both the sender and the receiver are buried underground and communicate
    through soil [16]. UG2UG links can be employed for multi-hop information delivery.
    • Underground-to-aboveground (UG2AG) link: The sender is buried in the soil profile
    and the receiver is located above the ground [17]. Monitoring data are transferred
    to aboveground relays or sinks through these links. • Aboveground-to-underground
    (AG2UG) link: An aboveground sender node sends messages to underground nodes [17].
    This link is used for management information delivery to the underground sensors.
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. An example of a precision agriculture
    cyber-physical system, WUSA-CP, based on Wireless Underground Sensor Networks
    (WUSNs). A WUSN can employ three kinds of communication: underground-to-underground
    (UG2UG), underground-to-aboveground (UG2AG), and Aboveground-to-underground (AG2UG).
    For the realization of WUSA-CP, only UG2AG and AG2UG links are considered in this
    work. Although sensors may be buried in different regions of the soil, typical
    WUSN applications will require that the buried sensors be deployed at two specific
    regions: the topsoil and the subsoil regions. The topsoil region refers to the
    top 30 cm of soil, or the root growth layer, whichever is shallower and the subsoil
    region refers to the region below the topsoil, i.e., usually the 30–100 cm region
    [16]. Accordingly, both cases of the deployment of underground nodes are illustrated
    in Fig. 2. Whenever possible, a shallower deployment (topsoil) is preferable due
    to the shorter length of the soil path and, thus, smaller signal attenuation.
    However, for the PA scenario, plowing and similar mechanical activities occur
    exactly at the topsoil region and higher burial depths in the root range of crops
    are required. In other words, PA applications are mainly related to subsoil WUSNs.
    Thus, in our experiments with corn crops, the 35 cm burial depth is defined as
    the best value to satisfy the application requirements. 2.3. Related work Wireless
    underground sensor networks are an important extension of the traditional WSNs.
    Their concept and challenges have been introduced in [1]. In [2], [5], [11], [27],
    we develop a theoretical channel model for the UG2UG link at the 300–900 MHz frequency
    range and empirical evaluations of UG2UG communications are reported in [16],
    where Mica2 motes [28] are used. The results in [16] confirm our previous theoretical
    findings. In [21], the connectivity issues between underground and aboveground
    nodes are investigated and [26], mobile aboveground nodes are employed to harvest
    data. Few WUSN experiments have been performed to date. In [18], the challenges
    in realizing WUSN experiments are discussed. Some of the aspects to be considered
    when developing a WUSN testbed, such as node qualification test, standard RF measurement
    and the interference among underground sensors, are provided. In [4], a WUSN based
    on customized sensor nodes (SoilNet) that operate at 2.4 GHz is developed for
    real-time soil water content monitoring. A 5–9 cm burial depth is considered and
    a theoretical model for the UG2AG link for this burial depth is developed. However,
    the shallow burial depth is not suitable for the applications in agriculture,
    considering the plowing practice in the field. In [24], an ultra wideband elliptical
    antenna [14] is proposed for underground communication, and the advantages of
    this scheme are highlighted. The same type of antenna is also used in our experiments.
    It is revealed that this elliptical antenna is not perfectly suitable for our
    application and a new design, a circular planar antenna achieves better performance.
    A UG2AG theoretical model is proposed in [25] and experimental results are provided.
    Communication ranges of 30 m and 150 m are reported for burial depths of 40 cm
    and 25 cm, respectively. The long communication range is a benefit of using a
    very high gain (+10 dB) antenna above the soil. However, only UG2AG communication
    links are considered in [25], without the investigation of the AG2UG links. In
    [17], empirical analysis of the UG2AG and AG2UG links is provided and the effects
    of antenna design, burial depth, and soil moisture are discussed. While the above
    results illustrate the feasibility of WUSN applications, a solution for autonomous
    irrigation applications has yet to be developed. In [19], our first step in integrating
    a WUSN with a center pivot irrigation system is presented. In this paper, we extend
    this work by providing a proof-of-concept for such a solution with subsoil deployment,
    i.e., burial depth deeper than 30 cm. The characteristics of both UG2AG and AG2UG
    links are analyzed. Furthermore, a circular antenna scheme is developed to extend
    the communication ranges to practical values of 50 m for the realization of WUSA-CP.
    3. Channel model for soil–air communication For the realization of WUSA-CP, reliable
    links between underground sensors and the CP should be provided. To this end,
    in this section, we present an empirical channel model for AG2UG links and UG2AG
    links. The model is then evaluated by field experiments in Section 6. In [5],
    a channel model for the underground-to-underground (UG2UG) communication is developed.
    However, for soil-air communication, this model cannot be directly used due to
    the impacts of soil-air interface and propagation through air. For both AG2UG
    and UG2AG links, the channel consists of two parts, the underground portion (soil
    medium) and the aboveground portion (air medium). The model is shown in Fig. 3.
    Given the horizontal distance, dh, the height of the AG antenna, ha, and the burial
    depth of the UG nodes, hu; the length of both portions can be calculated. Accordingly,
    the received signal strength at the receiver, Pr, is given as (1) where Pt is
    the transmit power, Gt and Gr are the antenna gains at the sender and the receiver,
    respectively. Lug(dug) and Lag(dag) are the loss at the underground and the aboveground
    portions, respectively, while L(R,→) is the refraction loss based on the propagation
    direction, →, i.e., ag2ug or ug2ag. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3.
    The channel model for the system. The underground and aboveground losses in (1)
    are given as [21], [27]: (2) (3) respectively, where η is the attenuation coefficient
    in air, f is the operation frequency, β is the phase shifting constant, and α
    is the attenuation constant. Both losses depend on the propagation paths, dug
    and dag logarithmically. The attenuation coefficient in air, η, is higher than
    2 due to the impacts of ground reflection. Meanwhile, in the underground path,
    the impacts of soil properties on attenuation are captured by the last two terms
    in (2), where α and β are given as (4) ∊ ∊ ∊ ∊ (5) ∊ ∊ ∊ ∊ in which ∊′ and ∊″
    are the real and imaginary parts of the effective soil permittivity. The higher
    permittivity of soil compared to that of air results in reflection and refraction
    of signals that are incident to the soil-air interface. More specifically, signals
    can penetrate through soil-air interface only if the incident angle is small.
    For UG2AG propagation, only the waves with small incident angle (θt in Fig. 3)
    will transmit to air. In other words, for the UG2AG channel, the waves propagate
    vertically in the soil and resemble a new source at the air–soil interface. For
    the AG2UG channel, the refracted angle is near to zero and the propagation in
    soil is also vertical. For both channels, the underground portion of communication
    distance can be approximated as dug ≃ hu, where hu is the burial depth and the
    aboveground portion is , where ha is the height of the AG node and dh is the horizontal
    distance between nodes. The refraction loss, L(R,→), in (1) for the AG2UG link
    can be found as [10]: (6) where θi is the incident angle, θt is the refracted
    angle and n is the refractive index of soil, which is given by (7) ∊ ∊ ∊ For the
    AG2UG link, we consider the maximum power path where the incident angle, θi →
    0. Hence, LR,ag2ug can be approximated as (8) For the UG2AG link, the signal propagates
    perpendicularly from a higher density medium to a lower density one. Hence we
    consider all energy is refracted and L(R,ug2ag) = 0. By using (2), (3), (4), (5),
    (6), (7), (8) in (1), the received signal strength can be found. By rearranging
    the terms in (1), it can be represented as: (9) where (10) (11) Note that in (9),
    κ depends on the soil properties through α (4), β (5), and n (7). On the other
    hand, the term c is a function of the deployment and radio parameters such as
    burial depth, transmit power, antenna, and operation frequency. The term c can
    be calculated pre-operation but due to the uncertainties in soil properties at
    a particular location and in attenuation in air, the parameters η and κ in (9)
    should be empirically determined. In Section 6, these parameters will be empirically
    determined and the experiment results will be compared with the model in (9).
    4. System architecture To provide a proof-of-concept for an autonomous irrigation
    system and explore the challenges associated within, experiments are carried out
    with 433 MHz Mica2 [28] sensor nodes in the South Central Agricultural Laboratory
    (SCAL), Clay Center, Nebraska. The analysis of the soil texture, particle density,
    and bulk density of the site where the center pivot is located, is shown in Table
    1 according to laboratory analysis [29]. Table 1. Soil parameters used in the
    experiments. Depth (cm) Texture Sand Silt Clay 0–20 Silt loam 17 55 28 20–60 Silt
    clay loam 16 46 38 Particle density Bulk density 2.66 g/cm3 1.3 g/cm3 The experiment
    setup is illustrated in Fig. 4, where an aboveground node (AG node) is installed
    on the arm of a center pivot irrigation system, which is located in a corn field.
    The height of the AG node is 2.5 m. Eight underground nodes are buried in the
    corn field in a circle at a burial depth of 35 cm. This depth is specified to
    be safe from agricultural machinery operations such as tilling. The center pivot
    is operated in both clock-wise and counter clock-wise directions and the communication
    between the AG and the UG nodes is established when the CP is within the communication
    range. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Testbed for the experiments:
    an aboveground (AG) node is installed on the center pivot and eight underground
    (UG) nodes are buried along its path. 4.1. Hardware architecture In addition to
    the attenuation caused by soil, electromagentic waves propagating through soil
    also results in a reduction in the wavelength [17], [24]. More specifically, the
    wavelength, λ, in the soil is related to the phase shifting constant, β in (5)
    as λ = 2π/β. The dependency of wavelength on soil properties calls for antenna
    designs that are tailored to the changes in λ. The effective soil permittivity,
    ∊, which defines the phase shifing, β, and attenuation, α, constants, is strongly
    impacted by factors such as soil moisture, soil type, salinity, and soil structure.
    This property is modeled by the Peplinski semi-empirical dielectric mixing model
    for the 0.3–1.3 GHz band [12]. The Mica2 nodes used in the experiments operate
    at 433 MHz. Based on this frequency and the minimum and maximum measured VWC values
    observed in the experiment site, the underground antenna needs to work at a wavelength
    between 30 cm and 69 cm, corresponding to a frequency range of 1–1.8 GHz in free
    space. In other words, to communicate with a radio that operates in the 433 MHz
    in air, an underground node should have an antenna that is matched to the 1–1.8
    GHz range. The dynamic range, within which an underground antenna needs to operate,
    calls for wideband antenna designs for the underground nodes. Since the large
    structure of the CP allows, high-gain antennas are used for the aboveground node.
    In the experiments, two antenna schemes are used: the first scheme includes a
    Full-Wave (FW) dipole antenna for the AG node and a Single Ended Elliptical Antenna
    (SEA) [14] for the UG nodes [17]. The dipole antenna has a gain of 3 dB. The second
    scheme includes a Yagi antenna for the AG node and a circular planar antenna for
    the UG nodes. The Yagi antenna has a higher directivity with the maximum gain
    of 10 dB. Both the SEA antenna and the circular planar antenna are customized
    according to the operation range in this application. 4.2. Software architecture
    For the experiments, a TinyOS application is developed to carry out several experiments
    without the need to reprogram the sensor nodes. A transmit power level of 10 dBm
    is used for all experiments. In each transaction, 100 packets are sent from the
    AG node to the UG node and from the UG node to the AG node, independently. The
    size of the test packet is 37 bytes and the interval between two packets is 100
    ms. The program structure is shown in Fig. 5. When a UG node receives a test packet
    from the AG node, it extracts the timestamp of the packet, which is stored in
    the flash memory along with the AG node ID and the calculated received signal
    strength (RSS). On the other hand, when an AG node receives a test packet from
    the UG node, it reads its own clock to get the timestamp. The timestamp, UG node
    ID, and the RSS are also stored in the flash memory. Thus, only the local time
    of the AG node is used in the experiments so that the nodes do not need to be
    synchronized. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. The program structure
    for the experiments. After an experiment, the experiment data are read out of
    the flash memory of each node. The timestamp of the packet is used to calculate
    the location of the AG node during the travel of the CP, given its speed. Henceforth,
    the relative distance of the communication between the AG node and the UG node
    is obtained. Since the speed of the CP is very slow (0.704 m/min), a transaction
    of the 100 packets is considered as sent from the same location. 5. Experimental
    setup To prevent the effects of significant differences related to the transceiver
    and antenna of each individual Mica2 node, qualification tests have been performed
    before each experiment [18]. Accordingly, through-the-air tests, which consists
    of 200 packets of 30 bytes, are performed to (1) determine compliant nodes and
    (2) confirm that the battery level of a node is above a safe limit. A node is
    labeled compliant with a given set of nodes if (1) its packet error rate (PER)
    varies within 10% of the average PER calculated for the set of nodes and (2) its
    RSS average varies, at maximum, ±1 dB from the average RSS for the set of nodes.
    The safe limit for the battery level has been determined as 2.5 V. Five different
    experiments were realized with different conditions of soil moisture and vegetation
    canopy, as listed below. • Static-Dry: An UG node and an AG node were located
    at the corn field without CP. The crops had been harvested, hence, the effects
    of the vegetation canopy can be neglected. The volumetric water content (VWC)
    [6] was found to be 16.6%. • Static-Wet: In this case, field was wet and no vegetation
    canopy was present. The volumetric water content (VWC) was found to be 22.7%.
    • CP-Crop-SEA-Vert: This experiment was conducted with CP and at a time when the
    corn crops reached their maximum height, 2.85 m. Therefore, the wireless communication
    was subject to the effects of the canopy. The SEA and FW antennas were adopted,
    and the SEA antenna was vertically placed. The volumetric water content was 22.7%.
    • CP-Crop-SEA-Hori: This experiment was also conducted under the influence of
    the corn crops. However, the SEA antenna on the UG node was placed horizontally.
    The volumetric water content was 32%. • CP-Circular-Yagi: This experiment was
    conducted after the harvest. The second antenna scheme with the circular planar
    antenna and the Yagi antenna was employed. The circular planar antennas are horizontally
    placed and the volumetric water content was 32%. The Static-Dry and Static-Wet
    were exploited to analyze the impact of the soil moisture. The other experiments
    were conducted with the center pivot setup as shown in Fig. 4. The travel speed
    of center pivot was set to its maximum (43o per hour) to analyze the worst-case
    scenario. At the circumference where the UG nodes were buried, this speed corresponds
    to 0.704 m/min. 6. Experiment results Apart from providing a proof-of-concept
    for autonomous agriculture applications, the experiments reveal important insights
    into the effects of the inter-node distance on the UG2AG and AG2UG channel performances.
    Next, we discuss the experiment results and evaluate the channel model in Section
    3 using the empirical data. In addition, the asymmetry in the channel, burstiness
    of packet errors, and the effects of the vegetation canopy and soil moisture on
    communication are discussed. 6.1. Communication range The communication window,
    which is the time that a UG node and the AG node communicate with each other is
    first analyzed. We present the results of the CP-Crop-SEA-Hori experiment in Fig.
    6. Other experiments have similar results. Since the speed of the center pivot
    system is 43o per hour, the total traveling time of one circle of the system is
    8.37 h. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the total communication time of all the nodes
    is 1.33 h, or 16% of the total traveling time. Also visible in the figure is the
    variation of the communication window among different nodes. The longest communication
    time is about 29 min whereas the shortest time is only 10 s. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Timeline for a complete travel of the center pivot for
    experiment CP-Crop-SEA-Hori (CW direction). The communication window of each node
    is shown in detail in Fig. 7, where the communication range is shown for each
    UG node in terms of horizontal distance and the time covered by the AG node while
    in motion. A negative distance represents the cases where AG node is approaching
    the UG node, whereas a positive value represents the cases where the AG node is
    moving away from the UG node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Communication
    between the AG node, installed on the center pivot, and the UG nodes (CP-Crop-SEA-Hori)
    (range in terms of horizontal distance). As shown in Fig. 7, the variation among
    the nodes is significant. The best case is Node 2 in the CW direction experiment,
    where the communication starts at 7.8 m before the AG node is above the UG node
    and ends at 12.8 m after the AG node passes the UG node. Thus, the total distance
    is 20.6 m. The worst case is node 6 in both experiments, where the total distance
    is 0.11 m. Thus, the communication window is only 0.5% of the best case. In the
    CCW direction experiment (Fig. 7a), the average communication distance for all
    the nodes is 8.75 m, with standard deviation δCCW = 5.73. Meanwhile, the average
    communication distance in the CW direction experiment (Fig. 7a) is 11.27 m, and
    the standard deviation δCW = 8.19. The relatively similar communication distances
    in both the CCW case and the CW case reveal that the communication quality is
    more related to the conditions at the specific location than the movement of the
    CP. The factors contributing to this variation include the irregularity of the
    soil surface. Ideally, the interface of two media (soil and air) is flat. However,
    because of the plowing and the roots of crops, the soil surface is irregular,
    which affects the dispersion of the electromagnetic waves. In a real application,
    even with a careful installation of the nodes, a change on the soil surface above
    an UG node can still occur as a result of the agricultural machinery activities.
    In the experiments, the UG nodes are buried so that the AG node is directly above
    a UG node when it is at the location of that UG node. This deployment results
    in some of the nodes (e.g. node 2) buried away from the crop canopy while other
    nodes are buried among the canopy (e.g. node 7). This irregularity is also visible
    in the results among different nodes since the crops have a negative impact on
    the propagation of the electromagnetic wave. This phenomenon is known as canopy
    effect and will be analyzed empirically in Section 6.5. The received signal strength
    (RSS) over the distance between the UG node and the AG node is shown in Fig. 8
    and Fig. 9. The results of the CP-Crop-SEA-Hori experiment are depicted in Fig.
    8a and b for the AG2UG link and the UG2AG link, respectively for the CW direction
    and in Fig. 8c and d for the CCW direction.1 Similarly, the results of the CP-Circular-Yagi
    experiment are shown in Fig. 9a and b. As discussed before, the results show variation
    among nodes. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Effects of the horizontal

    link. The circular planar and Yagi antenna pair extends the communication range
    by 364–400% compared to the SEA and FW antenna pair. The maximum achievable communication
    range with the circular planar and Yagi antenna pair is 65 m compared to the distance
    of 14 m with the SEA and FW antenna pair. For the worst case, it is 40 m versus
    8 m. This is due to the fact that (1) the planar antenna has a lower return loss
    (−10 dB) compared with the SEA antenna (−3 dB) when buried underground and (2)
    the Yagi antenna has a higher gain. It is also shown that the communication distance
    is not symmetric for the circular planar and Yagi antenna pair. This is mainly
    caused by the directivity of the Yagi antenna. For the SEA and FW pair, the asymmetry
    is analyzed in Section 6.3. Next, we evaluate the channel model presented in Section
    3 using the experiment results. 6.2. Numerical analysis of the channel model In
    this section, the model in (9) is evaluated using the experiment results. The
    empirical estimates of the attenuation in air, η∗, and the soil-dependent component,
    κ∗, in (9) are found using minimum mean square (MMSE) estimation.2 The soil dependent
    component is then compared to the model in (10). The constant c in (11) is found
    to be 13.57 dB for the CP-Crop-SEA-Hori experiment and 3.57 dB for the CP-Circular-Yagi
    experiment since the Yagi antenna gain is Gr = 10 dB. The results are shown in
    Table 2, Table 3 for both the UG2AG and AG2UG links. The comparison with the model
    is shown in Table 3. The soil-dependent component, κ, is also found based on the
    Peplinski model [12] and the soil parameters in Table 1. Table 2. Channel model

    be observed from the MSE columns in the Table 2 that the attenuation model in
    (1) captures the characteristics of both links with low error (max MSE is 5.94).
    However, there is considerable variation in model parameters between different
    locations. The variation of the attenuation coefficient, η, is mainly due to the
    plants in the field, which cause reflection and attenuation in air. The variation
    of κ is caused by different values of α,β and LR,→ in different locations. These
    values are determined by the effective soil permittivity, ∊, which depends on
    the soil characteristics such as volumetric water content (VWC), bulk density,
    and soil composition. The variations in the values illustrate that even in the
    same field, the characteristics of soil vary from location to location. It can
    also be observed in Table 3 that the model prediction of κ agrees well with the
    empirical results from the CP-Crop-SEA-Hori experiments. However, the accuracy
    of the model is limited for the CP-Circular-Yagi experiment. As the CP moves,
    the gain of the Yagi antenna, Gr, becomes a function of distance due to its high
    directivity. In addition, the model result is based on a soil measurement at a
    single point in the field and the spatial variance in soil properties leads to
    an error in model prediction. Overall, the channel model provides a sufficiently
    accurate estimate of the wireless communication but the results highlight the
    importance of semi-empirical models. This is mainly due to the high uncertainty
    caused by the soil properties and the agriculture field. 6.3. Asymmetry of the
    communication over distance In Section 3, it is shown that the RSS values not
    only vary among the nodes at different locations, but also change when the AG
    mote is at different sides of the UG nodes. Even when the horizontal distances
    to the UG node are the same, the RSS values are different depending on whether
    the AG node is approaching the UG node or departing the UG node. For the circular
    planar and Yagi antenna pair (Fig. 9a and b), this is mainly caused by the directivity
    of the Yagi antenna. However, for the SEA and FW antenna pair (Fig. 8a–d), the
    propagation patterns of the antennas are symmetric. Thus, RSS values are expected
    to be symmetric. To analyze this phenomenon of the SEA and FW antenna pair, another
    experiment with the CPS moving in the opposite direction is conducted, and the
    results are shown in Fig. 8c and d for both the UG2AG and AG2UG links, respectively.
    It is observed that the communication quality can be asymmetric in both UG2AG
    and AG2UG cases. For instance, in the CCW direction experiment (Fig. 8c and d),
    node 5 communicates with the AG node within only 3 m when the AG node approaches
    it. However, when the AG node departs node 5, communication is possible as far
    as 11 m. In addition, the RSS values can be different even when the absolute distances
    to the UG node are the same but the AG node is at different sides of the UG node.
    For node 2, in the CCW direction (Fig. 8c), when the distance is −5.65 m, the
    RSS value is −73.6 dBm while when the distance is 5.4 m, the RSS value is −78
    dBm. Meanwhile, in the CW direction (Fig. 8a), when the distance is −5.65 m, the
    RSS value is −78.9 dBm, and when the distance is 5.4 m, the RSS value is −72.7
    dBm. To find the reason for this asymmetry, we compare the results from the CW
    and CCW directions. The RSS values of the UG2AG links of node 2 and node 5 are
    depicted in Fig. 10. In each sub-figure, polynomial curve fitting is conducted
    to the sample data and the fitting curves are also shown in the figures. From
    the figures, it is shown that in the CCW direction experiment, for node 5, communication
    is better when the AG node is departing it. However, in the CW direction experiment,
    the communication is better when the AG node is approaching it. This observation
    leads to the conclusion that the asymmetry of the communication quality is mainly
    caused by the conditions of the environment rather than the movement of the AG
    node. Several factors cause this asymmetry such as the irregularity of the soil
    surface and the impact of the crops. In addition, non-perfect propagation patterns
    and the placement of the antenna also contribute to communication asymmetry over
    distance. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10. The communication asymmetry

    Node 2, UG2AG link, (b) Node 5, UG2AG link. 6.4. Burstiness of the packet error
    To fully understand the characteristics of communication quality, the burstiness
    of the packet error is analyzed in this section. During the experiments, when
    the AG node and the UG node establish a communication, 100 packets are sent from
    both sides and the interval between two consecutive packets is 100 ms. We analyze
    the number of consecutive lost packets during two successfully received packets
    as the metric for the burstiness of the packet error. The average burstiness of
    the packet error over distance is shown in Fig. 11 for the CP-Crop-SEA-Hori experiment.
    In the figure, each point indicates the average length of the consecutive packet
    errors. It is shown that the burstiness of the packet error is not related to
    the distance. Even though node 5 has a higher fluctuation in both the AG2UG and
    the UG2AG cases, the results do not have trend over distance. This observation
    agrees with our findings in [17] that the transitional region of the underground
    communication is very small compared with over-the-air communication. Thus, during
    the communication period, the packet error rate is quite stable. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 11. The average burstiness of packet error over distance
    (CW direction). The distribution of the burstiness of the packet error is shown
    in Fig. 12. The probability of high burst error decreases sharply as the number
    of consecutive lost packets increases. However, the curves have a long tail. For
    most cases, only one packet is lost between two successfully received packets.
    For the AG2UG link, more than 50% of the packet losses are single packet losses.
    For the UG2AG link, the burstiness is higher as only 33% of the packet losses
    are single packet losees. In both cases, 98.56% of the lost packets have a burst
    length of 10 or less, where as the maximum burst error size is as many as 94 packets.

    the percentage of the number of consecutive missed packets. In Fig. 12, it can
    also be observed that the performance in the AG2UG communication is slightly better
    than that in the UG2AG communication. As shown before, in the AG2UG communication,
    the case of one packet losing among all the lost packets is 17% more than the
    case in the UG2AG communication. Moreover, the average number of consecutive lost
    packets in AG2UG is 2.25, while in UG2AG it is 2.89. 6.5. Effects of canopy and
    soil moisture The growth of the crop causes an increase in the vegetation canopy
    and influences wireless communication [22]. In addition, soil moisture has an
    adverse effect on communication [1], [16]. In the following, we discuss the effects
    of these physical factors on communication based on the Static-Dry, Static-Wet,
    and CP-Crop-SEA-Vert experiments as explained in Section 4. The Static-Dry experiment
    is performed in dry soil without canopy whereas Static-Wet, and CP-Crop-SEA-Vert
    are performed in wet soil without and with the canopy, respectively. In Fig. 13,
    the resulting RSS and PER values for both AG2UG and UG2AG links are shown for
    a horizontal inter-node distance of 3 m. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    13. Effects of the vegetation canopy and the volumetric water content (VWC) for
    a horizontal inter-node distance of 3 m. In Fig. 13, these results are presented
    in terms of RSS and PER values for both AG2UG and UG2AG links. The average RSS,
    the RSS variance, and the PER values are shown for each experiment. For the horizontal
    inter-node distance of 3 m for the experiments, the PER values are very small
    (below 5%) and no meaningful comparison can be done using the PER values. However,
    the values of RSS show the expected attenuation differences for the 3 scenarios.
    As shown in Fig. 13, the Static-Dry experiment results in the smallest signal
    attenuation because the soil moisture is smaller (16.6%) and the vegetation canopy
    effects can be neglected. The Static-Wet experiment is an intermediate scenario,
    without the canopy effects, but with a higher soil moisture (22.7%). Finally,
    scenario CP-Crop-SEA-Vert is the worst case with 6 dB decrease of the RSS in both
    links. This is due to the fact that both canopy and soil moisture effects contribute
    to the signal attenuation. The attenuation caused by the vegetation canopy can
    be investigated by comparing the results from Static-Wet and CP-Crop-SEA-Vert
    in Fig. 13. For both AG2UG and UG2AG links, canopy results in a 3 dB increase
    in attenuation. This result agrees with previous studies [7], [22] and is important
    for the development of environmental-aware networking solutions. The attenuation
    caused by the variation in soil moisture can be investigated comparing the results
    from Experiments Static-Dry and Static-Wet in Fig. 13. The volumetric water content
    (VWC) of the soil varies from 16.6% (Static-Dry) to 22.7% (Static-Wet). Comparing
    the results from Experiments Static-Dry and Static-Wet, for both AG2UG and UG2AG
    links, the RSS difference is 3 dB. More specifically, the increase of 6.1% in
    the VWC causes an increase of 3 dB in the signal attenuation for the scenario
    of these experiments. Soil moisture is one of the most important parameters to
    be considered in wireless underground communication. Depending on the length of
    the soil path that the signal must traverse, the mentioned negative VWC effect
    can be very strong, as demonstrated in our previous experiments [16], [17]. The
    impact of these results on the WUSA-CP design is critical. 7. Conclusion In this
    work, we develop a novel system through the integration of center pivot systems
    with wireless underground sensor networks, i.e., WUSA-CP, for autonomous precision
    agriculture (PA). The system gathers soil information, such as soil moisture,
    from a WUSN in real time to automatically control the CP for precision irrigation.
    As a proof-of-concept, empirical experiments are realized in a real-life corn
    field and the lower layer communication characteristics are evaluated. A channel
    model for the system is also provided. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
    first work that provides insight into the integration of a PA irrigation system
    with WUSNs. Through empirical analysis, we show that an efficient autonomous PA
    solution is feasible using wireless underground sensor nodes. However, such a
    solution needs to consider the impacts of the soil properties on communication
    quality and design the antenna accordingly. Furthermore, in practice, factors
    such as soil moisture, soil irregularity have salient impacts on the wave propagation
    and communication performance. Even though through the careful design of antennas,
    the underground communication is practical, there are some other challenges needed
    to be addressed in the future. First, due to the dynamics in soil moisture, the
    channel quality varies over time. Thus, specific transmission schemes such as
    transmit power adjustment, probabilistic transmission are needed to maintain the
    connectivity of the network and also reduce the waste of energy consumption. Second,
    for the reliability of the communication, an energy efficient error control scheme
    that is suitable for WUSA-CP is needed to decrease packet error rate and improve
    the feasibility of the system. Last but not least, an intelligent duty cycle adjustment
    framework is needed to further improve energy efficiency of the system. The duty
    cycle of the underground nodes should adapt to the soil moisture variation and
    temperature variation of the environment. References [1] I.F. Akyildiz, E.P. Stuntebeck

    \ success in health care, smart city,\nindustrial production and so on. Protected\
    \ agriculture is one of the ﬁelds which has broad application\nprospects of IoT.\
    \ Protected agriculture is a mode of highly eﬃcient development of modern agriculture\n\
    that uses artiﬁcial techniques to change climatic factors such as temperature,\
    \ to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals and plants.\
    \ This review aims to gain insight into\nthe state-of-the-art of IoT applications\
    \ in protected agriculture and to identify the system structure\nand key technologies.\
    \ Therefore, we completed a systematic literature review of IoT research\nand\
    \ deployments in protected agriculture over the past 10 years and evaluated the\
    \ contributions\nmade by diﬀerent academicians and organizations. Selected references\
    \ were clustered into three\napplication domains corresponding to plant management,\
    \ animal farming and food/agricultural\nproduct supply traceability. Furthermore,\
    \ we discussed the challenges along with future research\nprospects, to help new\
    \ researchers of this domain understand the current research progress of IoT in\n\
    protected agriculture and to propose more novel and innovative ideas in the future.\n\
    Keywords: Internet of things; protected agriculture; integrated application; state-of-the-art\n\
    1. Introduction\nThe Internet of Things (IoT) was ﬁrst developed in 1999 by the\
    \ network radio frequency\nidentiﬁcation (RFID) system proposed by the Massachusetts\
    \ Institute of Technology (MIT) Auto-ID\nLabs [1]. With the application and development\
    \ of new information technologies, the connotation\nand extension of IoT have\
    \ undergone major changes [2]. IoT can be deﬁned as a huge internet-based\nnetwork\
    \ connecting physical and virtual “things” with standard and interoperable communication\n\
    protocols. To be speciﬁc, everything, such as a sensor and an actuator possessing\
    \ unique identity\nand attribute, exchange messages and communicate with each\
    \ other to realize intelligent positioning,\ntracking, identiﬁcation, perception,\
    \ monitoring and management via kinds of networks anytime and\nanywhere [3]. IoT\
    \ has penetrated pervasively most aspects of human life everywhere such as health\n\
    care, smart home, smart city, industrial control and so on. Agriculture is an\
    \ ideal candidate for the\ndeployment of IoT solutions because it occurs in wide\
    \ areas that need to be continuously monitored\nand controlled [4,5].\nThe concept\
    \ of protected agriculture is relative to open-ﬁeld agriculture. It uses artiﬁcial\
    \ techniques\nto change climatic factors such as natural light, temperature and\
    \ humidity to create environmental\nconditions suitable for the growth of animals\
    \ and plants, enabling them to grow around the clock.\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833;\
    \ doi:10.3390/s19081833\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    2 of 24\nThe environment of protected agriculture is completely or largely artiﬁcially\
    \ controlled andwhich has\nbroken the limits of climate and land conditions for\
    \ the growth of animals and plants to a certain extent.\nSo it is also called\
    \ controllable agriculture. Compared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture\n\
    has more potential to apply IoT technology, because it is less aﬀected by climatic\
    \ and geographical\nfactors. Some mature IoT solutions in other ﬁelds can be transferred\
    \ directly to protected agriculture [6].\nWith the development of agricultural\
    \ sensor, wireless communication, cloud computing,\nmachine learning and Big Data\
    \ technologies, IoT technology has emerged and is gradually being\npromoted and\
    \ applied in the protected agriculture ﬁeld [7–9]. It is playing an important\
    \ role in various\nareas of protected agriculture as it is capable of helping\
    \ farmers monitor soil condition, climate change\nand animal and plant health\
    \ [10]. When the environmental factor change beyond the set threshold,\nIoT will\
    \ automatically send a warning message to the administrator to remove the hidden\
    \ danger.\nIt can also control environmental factors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ carbon dioxide concentration\nand illumination according to the condition of\
    \ crop growth in real time [11,12]. In addition, cameras in\nthe IoT system are\
    \ able to capture crop diseases and insect pests in the greenhouse in real time,\n\
    helping farmers ﬁnd problems and take targeted preventive measures [13]. Through\
    \ GPS, RFID and\nother location-based sensors, goods such as vegetables can be\
    \ tracked and monitored visually during\ntransportation and storage. Supermarket\
    \ managers use smart phone or PC to monitor and predict\nproduct status and the\
    \ demand for getting product on shelves. At the user or consumer end, people can\n\
    query the variety, origin, processing and other farm product information by means\
    \ of the QR code,\nbarcode, etc. IoT for protected agriculture can help create\
    \ an informed, connected, developed and\nadaptable rural community. Low-cost embedded\
    \ devices can improve the interaction between humans\nand the physical world.\
    \ Cloud computing, edge computing, and Big Data can provide valuable analysis\n\
    and support for decisions. In summary, IoT will become an important tool in the\
    \ next few years to\nengage people in embedded agriculture which includes suppliers,\
    \ farmers, technicians, distributors,\nmerchants, consumers and government representatives\
    \ [14,15].\nOn the basis of the potential of IoT applications in protected agriculture\
    \ described in the previous\nparagraphs, this paper aims to identify the current\
    \ state of solutions in these ﬁelds. The IoT fundamental\nstructure in protected\
    \ agriculture is introduced in detail based on agricultural sensors, wireless\
    \ sensor\nnetworks, cloud computing, edge clouding and machine learning technologies.\
    \ The application of IoT\nin protected agriculture and how it makes contributions\
    \ is displayed. Furthermore, the open issues,\nchallenges, future opportunities\
    \ and development trends are discussed.\nIn this article, a comprehensive and\
    \ profound review of IoT in protected agriculture has been\nexecuted based on\
    \ a survey of real-world deployments and published papers over the past 10 years.\n\
    Firstly, a keyword-based search for conference papers and articles was performed\
    \ mainly from the\nscientiﬁc databases IEEE Xplore, Science Direct and ACM Digital\
    \ as well as from Google Scholar.\nFor search keywords, we used the following\
    \ query: “Internet of Things” and either “greenhouse”\nor “livestock” or “aquaculture“\
    \ or “agriculture“. Then, we ﬁltered out papers referring to IoT but\nnot applied\
    \ to the protected agricultural domain. Finally, we checked these papers selected\
    \ from the\nprevious step and picked out the ﬁnal papers according to the problem\
    \ they addressed, the solution\nproposed, impact achieved (if measurable), tools,\
    \ systems and algorithms used.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows.\
    \ Section 2 presents the structure of IoT in protected\nagriculture. The key technologies\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture are introduced in Section 3. The three\nimportant\
    \ applications in protected agriculture are summed up in Section 4. We further\
    \ discussed\nthe challenges to be faced and the problems that need to be solved\
    \ for IoT in protected agriculture as\nwell as a few future development directions\
    \ in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 outlines the conclusions of\nthis paper.\n\

    2.1. Simple Review of Previous IoT Structure\nAt present, there is no uniﬁed opinion\
    \ on the structure of IoT. The composition of IoT can be\ndivided into three parts:\
    \ object end, cloud end and network end. Smart items, smart devices and\nlocal\
    \ intelligent systems interact directly with the physical world to form the “object\
    \ end” of IoT\n(also known as “front end”). The cloud computing platform that\
    \ provides computing, storage and\nother resources performs fusion processing\
    \ and intelligent analysis of the sensing data from the object\nend and performs\
    \ execution control to constitute the “cloud end” (also referred to as “back end”)\
    \ of\nIoT. The communication infrastructure of the connection object end and the\
    \ cloud end constitutes the\n“network end” of IoT. According to the diﬀerent functions\
    \ implemented by physical entity services\nin the IoT, IoT architecture established\
    \ by the current service-oriented approach can be divided into\nthe following\
    \ two categories: cloud-centric IoT architecture and object-centric IoT architecture.\
    \ In the\ncloud-centric IoT application system, the physical entity service implements\
    \ basic physical information\ncollection, local information processing and transmission\
    \ of information to the cloud, but does not\nprovide a directly accessible service\
    \ interface. Mass storage, relational processing and knowledge\nmining of physical\
    \ information are all implemented in the cloud. One of their typical representatives\n\
    is uID IoT architecture, which is an IoT architecture developed by the uID center\
    \ of the nonproﬁt\nstandardization organization initiated by the university of\
    \ Tokyo, Japan. As shown in Figure 1,\nits architecture consisted of ucode tags\
    \ such as RFID, bar codes, RF and IR beacons, user terminals,\na ucode resolution\
    \ server and application information servers [16]. For software developers, the\
    \ main\nchallenge in building such systems is how to build a back-end cloud service\
    \ platform that supports\nmassive item information management and data processing.\
    \ The cloud platforms that have been\nestablished so far mainly include Xively\
    \ and Aneka [17].\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 25 \n \n2. The\

    \ \n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected Agriculture \nBased on the actual situation\
    \ of protected agriculture and the experience of other scholars, we \nproposed\
    \ a five-layer IoT architecture [22]. As shown in Figure 5, these layers are briefly\
    \ described \nbelow: \n(1). Perception layer: This layer consists of various sensors,\
    \ terminal devices, agricultural \nmachinery, wireless sensor network (WSN), RFID\
    \ tags andreaders, etc. The common sensors \nare environmental sensors, animal\
    \ and plant life information sensors and other sensors related \nto agriculture.\
    \ Through these sensors, information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed,\
    \ \nplant diseases, insect pests and animal vital signs can be obtained. The collected\
    \ information is \nsimply processed by the embedded device and uploaded to a higher\
    \ layer through the \nnetwork layer for further processing and analysis. \n(2).\
    \ Network layer: The network layer is the infrastructure of IoT, which includes\
    \ a converged \nnetwork formed by various communication networks and the internet.\
    \ The transmission \nmedium can be wired technology such as CAN bus and RS485\
    \ bus or wireless technology like \nZigbee, Bluetooth, LoRa and NB-IoT. The network\
    \ layer not only transmits various kinds of \nagricultural related information\
    \ collected by the perception layer to the higher layer, but also \nsends the\
    \ control commands of the application layer to the perception layer, so that the\
    \ related \ndevices of the sensing layer take corresponding actions.  \n(3). Middleware\
    \ layer: IoT can provide different types of services for different devices. The\
    \ technical \nspecifications (processor, power supply, communication module) and\
    \ system of each device \nare different and different devices cannot be connected\
    \ and communicated with each other, \nwhich leads to heterogeneity problems. The\
    \ middleware layer aggregates, filters and processes \nreceived data from IoT\
    \ devices, which greatly reduces the processing time and cost of the \nabove issues\
    \ and provides developers with a more versatile tool to build their applications.\
    \ It \nalso simplifies the steps of new service development and new device deployment\
    \ which \nFigure 4. IoT-A IoT framework [21].\n2.2. Structure of IoT in Protected\
    \ Agriculture\nBased on the actual situation of protected agriculture and the\
    \ experience of other scholars,\nwe proposed a ﬁve-layer IoT architecture [22].\n\
    As shown in Figure 5, these layers are brieﬂy\ndescribed below:\n(1).\nPerception\

    \ the development of IoT. In recent years, sensor \ntechnology has rapidly developed\
    \ with the emergence of new materials and methods [23]. The \nFigure 5. Structure\

    \ Crucial Technologies of IoT in Protected Agriculture\n3.1. Sensor Technology\n\
    Sensor plays an indispensable role in obtaining environment, plant and animal\
    \ information and it\nis also one of the technical bottlenecks in the development\
    \ of IoT. In recent years, sensor technology\nhas rapidly developed with the emergence\
    \ of new materials and methods [23]. The conventional\nenvironment sensors such\
    \ as temperature, humidity, light intensity, heat and gas sensors have been\n\
    relatively mature and widely deployed in protected agriculture. Nowaday, about\
    \ 6000 research and\nproduction organizations engage in sensor research from more\
    \ than 40 countries, including famous\nmanufacturers such as Honeywell, Foxboro,\
    \ ENDEVCO, Bell & Howell and Solartron companies.\nThere are three main types\
    \ of widely used and researched agricultural sensors: physical property type\n\
    sensors, biosensors and micro electro mechanical system sensors (MEMS). The physical\
    \ property type\nsensor realizes the signal conversion through the physical change\
    \ of the sensitivity of the material\nof the sensor itself, which is mainly temperature,\
    \ humidity and gas sensor. The biosensor [24] uses\nthe organism itself as a sensitive\
    \ component to transmit information according to the reaction of the\norganism\
    \ to the outside world and includes enzyme sensor [25], microbial sensor, adaptive\
    \ sensor [26],\netc., which is mainly used to detect pesticide residue, heavy\
    \ metal ion, antibiotic residue and toxic\ngas [27,28]. The MEMS sensor is the\
    \ embodiment of the new generation of research and development\ntechnology in\
    \ the ﬁeld of sensors with small size, low power consumption, low cost and reliability\
    \ [29].\nAlthough sensor technology has made great strides in both principles\
    \ and manufacturing\nprocesses, there are still some open issues. A typical example\
    \ among those open issue is the research\nand development of soil sensors and\
    \ vital sign information sensors of animal and plant, which is an\nurgent conundrum\
    \ to overcome in long time. The complex composition as well as diﬀerent physical\n\
    and chemical properties of soil turn the rapid and situ measurement of soil nitrogen\
    \ and other elements\ninto an international diﬃculty. Since the life process of\
    \ animals and plants is very complicated, in order\nto realize the accurate detection\
    \ of information about their life, it is necessary to make breakthroughs in\n\
    the physical mechanism and measurement model of the life process. Related research\
    \ has been carried\nout using physicochemical properties, spectroscopy, multispectral,\
    \ hyper-spectral, nuclear magnetic\nresonance as well as other detection methods\
    \ [30–33].\nAnother problem is the promotion and application of these sensors.\
    \ For one thing there is still\na lack of uniform technical standards in the collection,\
    \ transmission and the interface with the platform\nand human-computer interaction\
    \ interface; for another, the cost has limited the large scale application\nof\
    \ fresh sensors in intelligent agriculture. Currently, the cost of sensing equipment\
    \ for the collection and\ntransmission of animal and plant status is prohibitively\
    \ expensive for ordinary peasants. The number\nof nodes in a sensor network can\
    \ often reach tens of thousands. To make the sensor network practical,\nthe cost\
    \ of each node must be controlled within $1, but now the price is as high as $80\
    \ [34].\n3.2. Data Transmission Technology\nIn this section, the details of data\
    \ transmission technology are discussed, which is one of the vital\ntechnologies\
    \ for real-time dynamic acquisition of agricultural information. Diﬀerent from\
    \ industrial\napplication, agricultural information acquisition is not demanding\
    \ in timelines and a slight delay in\nthe transmission process has little eﬀect\
    \ on agricultural production.\nCompared with wired transmission technology such\
    \ as ﬁeldbus, wireless communication\ntechnology has advantages of low construction\
    \ and maintenance cost, low power consumption\nand excellent extensibility. Recently,\
    \ most researchers, organizations and manufacturers choose it\nto build up their\
    \ WSN in environment monitoring [35,36], automatic irrigation [37] and remote\n\
    control [38]. As shown in Table 1, the summary of popular wireless technologies\
    \ and basic parameters\nwas presented. Diﬀerent vendors and research institutes\
    \ have developed their own wireless devices\nbased on these wireless protocols,\
    \ which has somewhat increased the heterogeneity of IoT. In addition,\nwireless\
    \ signals of diﬀerent protocols located in the same band can cause mutual interference\
    \ such as\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n8 of 24\nZigBee, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth [39].\
    \ Wi-Fi has high communication speed but high power consumption,\nwhich is suitable\
    \ for sensor network deployment at ﬁxed points. Although Bluetooth has high security,\n\
    its communication distance is too short and power consumption is high, which is\
    \ suitable for short-time\nclose-range networking. ZigBee has the advantages of\
    \ low consumption, low cost and self-organization\nand each node can be used as\
    \ a relay station for transmitting data of adjacent nodes. So it easily expands\n\
    the coverage of the sensor network and is an ideal long-distance, large-range\
    \ sensor networking.\nTable 1. Summary of popular wireless technologies and basic\

    \ mW\nIn recent years, the Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) is one of IoT hotspots\
    \ and\nthought as a novel technology with great development potential, which is\
    \ attributed to its huge\nadvantages such as ultra-long distance communication\
    \ and it can be used as an important complement\nof the traditional wireless local\
    \ area network (WLAN) and mobile cellular mobile communication\ntechnologies (such\
    \ as GSM and GPRS). At this stage, LPWAN has many technical standards, which can\n\
    be classiﬁed into two categories. The ﬁrst is a proprietary patented technology\
    \ that works under\nan unlicensed spectrum, such as LoRa, Sigfox and RPMA. The\
    \ second is a cellular communication\ntechnology that works under a licensed spectrum,\
    \ such as EC-GSM, eMTC and NB-IoT. Due to the use\nof dedicated frequency bands\
    \ and uniﬁed deployment by operators, licensed spectrum technology\nhas carrier-class\
    \ security and low interference characteristics, which forms full network coverage\n\
    and operation [40,41]. The unlicensed spectrum uses the common spectrum without\
    \ paying high\nspectrum costs but requires special handling of co-channel interference.\
    \ There are many beneﬁts of IoT\ndeployments based on LPWAN in the agricultural\
    \ environment. Firstly, the maximum connection\ndistance of the LPWAN terminal\
    \ device to the base station varies from several kilometers to several tens\n\
    of kilometers, which saves the trouble of setting up and maintaining routing devices.\
    \ Compared with\nthe 2.4 GHz band, LPWAN adopts the sub-1GHz band to acquire less\
    \ attenuation and multipath\nfading caused by obstacles and dense surfaces like\
    \ concrete walls [42,43]. Moverover, the sensitivity\nof state of the art LPWAN\
    \ receivers reaches as low as –130 dBm due to modulation techniques such\nas narrowband\
    \ and spread spectrum. Secondly, ultra low power operation is another advantage\
    \ of\nLPWAN which is achieved by duty cycling mechanism, lightweight medium access\
    \ control protocols\nand oﬄoading complex tasks [44]. Thirdly, most LPWAN technologies\
    \ support a large number of\ndevice connections by diversity techniques, adaptive\
    \ channel selection and data rate technologies,\netc. [45]. Finally, the LPWAN\
    \ connects a large number of end devices, while keeping the cost of\nhardware\
    \ below ﬁve dollars [46]. LPWAN technologies target a diverse set of applications\
    \ with varying\nrequirements in protected agriculture and therefore it should\
    \ provide some sort of quality of service\n(QoS) over the same underlying LPWAN\
    \ technology. However, current LPWAN technologies provide\nno or limited QoS.\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 1833\n9 of 24\nMeanwhile, mobile cellular communication technology\
    \ has undergone four generations of\ntechnology updates and the ﬁfth-generation\
    \ mobile communication technology (5G) was announced in\n2016, which will make\
    \ large ﬁle transfer such as agricultural images and audio a reality and bring\
    \ new\nimpetus to the agricultural IoT. From the perspective of future research,\
    \ the research of wireless sensor\nnetworks focuses mainly on communication, energy\
    \ conservation, network control and its application\nin agricultural monitoring.\n\
    3.3. WSN\nThe WSN consists of a lot of sensor nodes that are usually powered by\
    \ battery and it is a multi-hop\nself-organizing network system formed by wireless\
    \ communication to collaboratively sense, collect and\nprocess various information\
    \ of the perceived object in the network coverage area [47,48]. It can be\ndivided\
    \ into terrestrial WSN and wireless underground sensor networks (WUSN). The agricultural\n\
    sensors are usually planted into soil and lower frequency wireless technologies\
    \ are more selected\ndue to low attenuation in WUSN. Besides, antenna size and\
    \ energy consumption in WUSN is higher\nthan terrestrial WSN [49]. With development\
    \ of LPWAN, IoT may not need a mesh-style WSN with\npower-based routing, where\
    \ one node forwards packets of other nodes.\n3.4. Cloud Computing\nCloud computing\
    \ grew out of distributed computing, parallel processing and grid computing.\n\
    It is an Internet-based computing system that provides hardware services, infrastructure\
    \ services,\nplatform services, software services and storage services to various\
    \ IoT applications. Its essence is\na system for dynamically deploying and allocating/redistributing\
    \ as well as dynamic monitoring\nof virtualized computing and storage resource\
    \ pools, thereby providing users with computing,\ndata storage and platform services\
    \ that meet QoS requirements [50,51]. It played a strong role in\npromoting the\
    \ development of agricultural IoT. Firstly, cloud computing can provide farmers\
    \ with cheap\ndata storage services for text, image, video and other agricultural\
    \ information, which greatly reduces\nthe storage costs of agricultural enterprises\
    \ [52]. Secondly, it is diﬃcult to make direct use of these raw\ndata for making\
    \ decisions based on the technical level of farmers. Agricultural experts can\
    \ only make\naccurate judgments and give suggestions based on quantitative analysis.\
    \ Only cloud computing can\nsupport intelligent large-scale computing systems\
    \ [53,54]. Thirdly, cloud computing could provide\na secure platform for the development\
    \ of various IoT applications such as crop monitoring [55].\n3.5. Edge Computing\n\
    Edge computing refers to a new computing model that performs calculations at the\
    \ edge of the\nnetwork [56]. In the edge computing, the downlink data of the edge\
    \ represents the cloud service,\nthe uplink data represents IoT service and the\
    \ edge of edge computing refers to any computing\nand network resources between\
    \ the data source and the cloud computing center path. Because the\ncomputing\
    \ task is partially migrated to the network edge device, edge hormone can improve\
    \ data\ntransmission performance, ensure real-time processing and reduce the computational\
    \ load of the cloud\ncomputing center. Moreover, edge computing better protects\
    \ data because processing occurs closer to\nthe source than in cloud computing\
    \ [57,58].\n3.6. Machine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) is a smart way for computers\
    \ to simulate people’s learning activities, acquire\nnew knowledge, continuously\
    \ improve performance and implement their own perfection. In recent\nyears, machine\
    \ learning has achieved great success in algorithm, theory and application [59]\
    \ and have\nbeen combined with other agricultural technologies to maximized crop\
    \ yield while minimizing the input\ncosts [60]. The main machine learning algorithms\
    \ are naïve bayes, discriminant analysis, K-nearest\nneighbor, support vector\
    \ machine (SVM) [61], K-means clusterin, fuzzy clustering, gaussian mixture\n\
    models, artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), deep learning [62], decision tree algorithm\
    \ and so on [63].\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n10 of 24\nML can discover the internal\
    \ connection between messy, modelless and complex agricultural\ndata, make accurate\
    \ predictions and provide a theoretical basis for agricultural decision-making.\n\
    Machinelearning technology is playing an important role in crop breeding, disease\
    \ identiﬁcation,\npest and disease prediction, intelligent irrigation planning\
    \ and agricultural expert systems [64–67].\nFor example, ML technology can analyze\
    \ past farmland data, including the performance of crops under\ndiﬀerent climatic\
    \ conditions and the inheritance of a particular phenotype. As well, ML technology\n\
    can explore the association rules and then build a probability model to predict\
    \ which genes are\nmost likely to participate in the expression of a certain good\
    \ trait of the plant, which can help the\nbreeding expert conduct a reasonable\
    \ breeding experiment [68–70]. Kyosuke et al. came up with\na method for detecting\
    \ the maturity of a single intact tomato-based ML, which consisted of three\n\
    steps: pixel-based segmentation, blob-based segmentation and individual fruit\
    \ detection. In the ﬁrst\ntwo steps, decision trees were generated based on features\
    \ such as color, shape, texture and size and\nimage segmentations were conducted\
    \ using the generated trees. Finally, the automatical detection of\nindividual\
    \ fruit in multiple tomatoes was achieved by X-means clustering method. The results\
    \ of the\ntomato detection image test showed that their method achieved a recall\
    \ of 0.80, while the precision\nwas 0.88 [71]. Rahnemoonfar et al. proposed deep\
    \ learning architecture for counting fruits based\non convolutional neural networks.\
    \ They used synthetic images to train the neural network to save\ntime-consuming\
    \ collect and annotate. The network was trained for three epochs on 24,000 synthetic\n\
    images using an Adam optimizer and 100 randomly chosen images were tested. The\
    \ experimental\nresults demonstrated that their method had higher average accuracy\
    \ as comparing with others [72].\n3.7. Big Data\nThe protected agriculture produces\
    \ billions of dynamic, complex and spatial data including soil\ndatabases, greenhouse\
    \ environment data, livestock vaccination records and government investment\n\
    data. Compared with relational data structures that are logically expressed using\
    \ two-dimensional\ntables, agricultural data is more unstructured and has a large\
    \ number of hypermedia elements\nsuch as expert experience, knowledge and agricultural\
    \ models in the form of text, charts, pictures,\nanimations and voice/video [73].\
    \ The “big” of these data can be reﬂected in four dimensions: volume,\nvelocity,\
    \ variety and veracity [74]. Big Data technology is able to ﬁnd out the internal\
    \ links of collected\ndata through information mining and other means, discover\
    \ new information and provide data support\nfor the next operation. The most commonly\
    \ used techniques to deal with Big Data technology are\nimage processing, modeling\
    \ and simulation, machine learning, statistical analysis and geographical\ninformation\
    \ systems (GIS) [75].\n4. IoT Applications in Protected Agriculture\n4.1. Plant\
    \ Management\nCompared with open-ﬁeld agriculture, protected agriculture provides\
    \ a relatively suitable and\ncontrollable environment for crop growth by greenhouse\
    \ technology, which to some extent is free\nfrom the constraints of the natural\
    \ environment and promoted the intensive and eﬃcient use of\nagricultural resources.\
    \ However, spatial and temporal variability of crops’ growth environmental\nparameters\
    \ in the protected agriculture are strong and aﬀect each other [76,77], which\
    \ made it diﬃcult\nto adapt to the growth of diﬀerent types of plants in diﬀerent\
    \ growth stages by traditional cultivation\nand environmental regulation. Therefore,\
    \ it needs higher accuracy in the aspect of monitoring and\ncontrol. Many works\
    \ have attempted to design and test types of monitoring and control systems to\n\
    adjust greenhouse environmental parameters such as air temperature and humidity,\
    \ light intensity\nand CO2 concentration based on IoT and their results have proven\
    \ it is technically and economically\nfeasible [78]. At the low level of IoT development,\
    \ the environmental data were simply processed and\nusually presented in sheet\
    \ and plot form [79,80]. Later, some studies collected huge amounts of data\n\
    to set up various models based on plant growth or greenhouse climate [81–83],\
    \ which contributed\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n11 of 24\nto predicting the crop\
    \ yield and environment parameter changes to help farmers better manage\ngreenhouse.\
    \ CAI et al. developed a low-cost smart greenhouse remote monitor system based\
    \ on IoT.\nThe system used STM32F103 single chip machine and sensors to collect\
    \ environmental information\nand transferred the data to cloud by LPWAN. Security\
    \ link was established with TLS, which reduced\nsystem costs while ensuring the\
    \ security of data transmission. At the same time, they adopted a time\nseries\
    \ database to store data so that tremendous storage space can be saved [84]. He\
    \ et al. have reported\na greenhouse temperature intelligent control system based\
    \ on NB-IoT. The relative error of greenhouse\nenvironmental information collection\
    \ was below 1%, the average control accuracy was 3.57% (±1.0 ◦C),\nthe transmission\
    \ distance was not limited and the automatic regulation of crop growth temperature\n\
    was realized [85].\nNowaday, with the development of cloud computing, ML, etc.,\
    \ IoT solution can easily achieve\nsmart data processing and analyzing at low\
    \ cost and in a convenient way [86,87]. At the same time,\ngreenhouse technology\
    \ has also undergone several generations of upgrades and has now evolved into\n\
    highly mechanized and automated plant factories. Deng et al. have implemented\
    \ a closed-loop control\nsystem in a salad-cultivating plant factory based on\
    \ the kinetic model. Both digital simulation and\nreal-time results demonstrated\
    \ the system can work stably under the internal variations and external\ndisturbances\
    \ [88]. Zamora-Izquierdo et al. developed a smart farming IoT platform based on\
    \ edge and\ncloud computing, which was designed for soilless culture greenhouses\
    \ at low cost. The platform was\ncomposed of local, edge and cloud parts: the\
    \ local part dealt with data gathering and automatic control\nthough Cyber-Physical\
    \ Systems, the edge part took main management tasks and could improve the\nstability\
    \ of this systems, the cloud part was in charge of data analytics. Compared with\
    \ a regular\nopen control, the platform saved more than 30% water [89]. Katsoulas\
    \ et al. have designed an\nonline irrigation system for hydroponic greenhouse\
    \ crops and their results indicated it increased\nwater and fertilizer use eﬃciency\
    \ by 100% [90]. Liao et al. implemented a IoT-based system in\nan orchid greenhouse\
    \ to monitor the environmental factors and the growth status of phalaenopsis.\n\
    They developed an image processing algorithm to estimate the leaf area of phalaenopsisthe\
    \ and\nidentiﬁed the relationship between growth of plant leaves and environmental\
    \ factors. The proposed\nsystem could provide quantitative information with high\
    \ spatiotemporal resolution for ﬂoral farmers\nand contribute to updating farming\
    \ strategies for phalaenopsis in the future [91].\nDiseases and insect pests bring\
    \ a great threat to the growth of crops as and traditional technology\nand chemical\
    \ prevention and control has a certain lag and negative impact [92,93]. The rise\
    \ of IoT\nhas brought more eﬃcient and smarter solutions to crop disease and pest\
    \ control. Many types of\nIoT sensors can collect information about location,\
    \ greenhouse environment status, crop growth and\npest situation anywhere in real-time,\
    \ which helps farmers keep track of crop pests and diseases.\nThen, all raw image\
    \ and data are sent to cloud centers and later processed and analyzed by various\n\
    models and algorithms based on diﬀerent diseases and pests [94,95]. Finally, these\
    \ cloud centers\ngenerally provide farmers with the following services: disease\
    \ or pest identiﬁcation, disaster prediction\nand warning and recommended governance\
    \ measures from expert systems. Tirelli et al. proposed\na pest insect trap automatic\
    \ monitoring system using ZigBee technology, which can estimate the\ninsect density\
    \ by collected data from diﬀerent sites and send a warning message to farmers\
    \ when it\nexceeded the set value [96]. Ahouandjinou et al. proposed a pest monitoring\
    \ system which detected\nthe presence of pests by the acquisition of ultrasound\
    \ and assisted others in building up protocols\nfor early exterminate of the pests\
    \ [97]. Foughali et al. presented a potato late blight prevention and\ndecision\
    \ support system using cloud IoT and helped the agriculturists take eﬀective action\
    \ to treat\nthis disease [98]. Both Semios and Spensa Company launched their own\
    \ integrated pest management\nsystem, which was able to count the number of pests\
    \ by images, as well as characterize and capture\nthe insects. At present, pest\
    \ and disease warning research mainly provides medium and long-term\nwarning based\
    \ on historical data, which can provide macro guidance for crop production but\
    \ low\ntimeliness. Therefore, future research should focus on online monitoring\
    \ as well as diagnosis and early\nwarning of agricultural diseases.\nSensors 2019,\
    \ 19, 1833\n12 of 24\n4.2. Animal Farming\nLivestock and aquatic product farming\
    \ is an important part of protected agriculture and an area\nwhere IoT applications\
    \ have achieved good results. To achieve good control eﬀects in animal breeding,\n\
    IoT should not only overcome harsh environmental factors, but also pay attention\
    \ to the eﬀects of animal\nbehaviors [99,100]. IoT have been applied in monitoring\
    \ and management of environment, animal,\nfeed and farming process [101,102].\
    \ The livestock monitoring items include information such as body\ntemperature,\
    \ weight, behavior, exercise volume, food intake, disease information and environmental\n\
    factors, which can help people understand animal’s own physiological and nutritional\
    \ status and\nadaptability to external environmental conditions. In aquaculture,\
    \ management projects focus on water\nquality such as dissolved oxygen content,\
    \ water temperature and pH value [103,104] because water\nquality greatly aﬀects\
    \ the growth of aquatic animals. With animal growth and nutrient optimization\n\
    model and intelligent IoT equipment, it is possible to realiaze automatic feeding\
    \ and optimal control of\nfeeding time and intake according to their growth cycle,\
    \ individual quality, feeding cycle and eating\nsituation [105,106]. The Osborne\
    \ Industrial Company has produced TEAM automated electronic sow\nfeeding (ESF)\
    \ stations including pregnancy stations and estrus detection stations. The ESF\
    \ stations\nidentify the sow through the RFID tags worn by each sow and deliver\
    \ the corresponding quantity\nand type of feed based on information such as parity,\
    \ lyrical condition and gestational age. The estrus\ndetection stations can detect\
    \ rutting sows in the sow population and their detection accuracy is 7%\nhigher\
    \ than the manual ones. Encinas et al. presented a distributed monitoring IoT\
    \ system for\nwater quality monitoring. Their model was able to help ﬁsheries\
    \ acquire water quality parameters\nsuch as pH and temperature data in real time\
    \ to optimize pond resources and prevent unwanted\nconditions [107]. Soto-Zarazu´a\
    \ et al. proposed an automated recirculation tilapia farming system\nbased on\
    \ the fuzzy algorithm. The results of this work showed that it saved water by\
    \ 97.42% and\nthe water quality environmental parameters were controlled within\
    \ the acceptable range of tilapia\nculture [108]. Many researches have focused\
    \ on analysis of animal behavior, health care and diagnosis\nand warning of diseases\
    \ based on IoT [109–111]. Yazdanbakhsh et al. proposed an intelligent livestock\n\
    surveillance system. They attempted many machine learning algorithms to process\
    \ raw data of\nhealthy and ill cows and ﬁnally obtained good results used a wavelet-domain\
    \ ensemble classiﬁer with\n80.8% sensitivity and 80% speciﬁcity [112]. Wens Group,\
    \ the largest livestock breeding enterprise\nin China, took the lead in carrying\
    \ out research on the animal husbandry based on IoT and built\nthe corresponding\
    \ system for monitoring livestock vital signs, behavior and breeding environment\n\
    information [113]. Liu et al. collected a variety of penaeus vannamei information\
    \ such as real-time data\non the culture environment, disease image data and expert\
    \ disease diagnosis and treatment and ﬁnally,\nconstructed a remote intelligent\
    \ diagnosis model based on IoT [114]. Liu et al. proposed a web-based\ncombined\
    \ nutritional model for precisely predicting the growth, feed amount and nitrogen\
    \ phosphorus\noutput of gibel carp [115]. The current online diagnostics and early\
    \ warning of animal diseases is at an\nearly stage due to the lack of corresponding\
    \ sensors and models. With upgrading of hardware and\nartiﬁcial intelligence algorithms,\
    \ future research should focus on the improvement of Big Data depth\nalgorithm\
    \ and the establishment of comprehensive models of animal behavior and disease.\n\
    A few studies have made in-depth research in monitoring animal odor and hazardous\
    \ gas\nproduced during the breeding process such as ammonia gas and sulfur dioxide\
    \ [116]. Pan developed\nan electronic nose network system for monitoring and real-time\
    \ analysis of odors from livestock\nfarms. They placed e-noses in and around the\
    \ farm to build up a wireless network to measure odor\ncompounds as well as environmental\
    \ parameters [117].\n4.3. Agri-food Supply Chain Traceability\nNowday, agricultural\
    \ products/food safety issues are receiving worldwide attention and their\nsafety\
    \ traceability is one solution accepted by all parties of Agri-food domains. Governments\
    \ in many\ncountries and regions have promulgated laws and regulations to promote\
    \ the establishment of food\ntraceability system and strengthen the supervision\
    \ of agricultural products/food safety. The Agri-food\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n\
    13 of 24\nsupply chain traceability IoT-based system can ensure food safety and\
    \ quality at each link of the\nproduction, from the cropland to the consumer (Figure\
    \ 6), which could help consumers establish\nconﬁdence in food safety and contribute\
    \ to sustainable development of the whole food industry [118].\n \n4.3. Agri-food\
    \ Supply Chain Traceability \nNowday, agricultural products/food safety issues\

    \ confidence in food safety and contribute to sustainable development of the whole\
    \ food \nindustry [118].  \n \nFigure 6. Schematic representation of the Agri-food\
    \ supply chain from the grower to consumer. \nIn past years, a lot of countries\
    \ have established the traceability platform for meat,milk, fish and \nagri-food\
    \ products based on IoT [119–121]. However, the fresh food cold chain logistics\
    \ traceability \nhas also drawn widespread attention [122,123]. RFID technology\
    \ still played an important role in \nAgri-food supply chain traceability due\
    \ to its small size and low cost [124]. As a novel technology, \nnear field communication\
    \ (NFC) has been progressively developed and used because of its safe and \nsimple\
    \ operation [125,126]. A common problem in the development of IoT is its asynchronous\
    \ \nheterogeneous data flow and distributed features. This requires the traceability\
    \ system to establish \nuniform and accurate identification naming rules to facilitate\
    \ quick and unique retrieval of \ninformation on a farm product [127]. As the\
    \ deployment of IoT infrastructure is completed, the \nsupply chain will move\
    \ towards virtualization which is no longer required physical contact. The \n\
    virtualization of an agri-food supply chain helps administrators better monitor,\
    \ control, plan and \noptimize food supply chain processes [128]. Wang et al.\
    \ proposed a food safety pre-warning system \nbased on association rules mining\
    \ and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning \nFigure 6. Schematic\

    \ contact. The virtualization of an\nagri-food supply chain helps administrators\
    \ better monitor, control, plan and optimize food supply\nchain processes [128].\
    \ Wang et al. proposed a food safety pre-warning system based on association\n\
    rules mining and IoT. It included four modules: information source, warning analysis,\
    \ reaction and\nemergency feedback. First, they accessed food critical information\
    \ through data processing and\nanalysis of food traceability data for safety assessment.\
    \ On this basis of this data, the system used the\nassociated data mining method\
    \ to discover the connection between them and then obtained the food\nsafety risk\
    \ analysis results. Subsequently, the system made a corresponding early warning\
    \ response\nbased on this result [129].\nRecently, the increasing incidents of\
    \ food falsiﬁcation have not only brought about great economic\nlosses, but also\
    \ undermined consumers’ conﬁdence in food safety. The blockchain technology with\n\
    decentralization, non-tamperability, development transparency and machine autonomy\
    \ features\nbrings new solutions to the above problems [130,131]. Tian et al.\
    \ reported a new decentralized\ntraceability system based on IoT and blockchain\
    \ technology, which can provid an open, transparent,\nneutral, safe and reliable\
    \ information platform for producers, governments, consumers and other\nstakeholders\
    \ [132]. Kaijun et al. combined the supply chain and blockchain technology to\
    \ propose\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n14 of 24\na double chain architecture agricultural\
    \ traceability system by studying the dual chain structure and\nits storage mode,\
    \ resource rent-seeking and matching mechanism and consensus algorithm [133].\n\
    Now, with the innovation and maturity of related technologies, it is not diﬃcult\
    \ for researchers to\ndevelop a complete set of traceability systems. The rise\
    \ of artiﬁcial intelligence technology enables\nexisting traceability systems\
    \ to provide automation, intelligence and human services to businesses\nand consumers.\
    \ Chen et al. adopted fuzzy cognitive maps and fuzzy rule method to come up with\n\
    an autonomous tracing system for backward design in food supply chain based on\
    \ IoT, which better\ntraced food product problems [134]. However, there are still\
    \ some problems in food safety traceability.\nIt is worth noting that the current\
    \ agricultural product safety traceability system only focuses on\na certain level\
    \ of supply chain or a certain type of goods. With the participation of multiple\
    \ projects\nor multiple sessions, we believe that the focus of future research\
    \ should be on more complex and\nsystematic supply chains.\n5. Disscussion\n5.1.\
    \ Hardware and Software Challenges\nWhen IoT technology is applying in protected\
    \ agriculture, it is inevitable to encounter challenges\nfrom all aspects. In\
    \ the perception layer, various devices must face the harsh and complex greenhouse\n\
    environment. Strong solar radiation, high temperatures, high humidity, strong\
    \ vibrations and other\nhazards can easily damage or destroy sensors or end devices.\
    \ Moreover, the daily activities of livestock\ncan interfere with the work of\
    \ the sensor or execution nodes, resulting in poor detection and control.\nIn\
    \ a general way, the information collection nodes rely on the battery with limited\
    \ power to maintain\nits work because the behavior of frequent battery replacement\
    \ consume a lot of energies and money.\nTherefore, it is an urgent need to make\
    \ great progress in developing low-power acquisition equipment,\nenergy-saving\
    \ sink node routing protocols and energy-balanced communication algorithms [135].\n\
    The devices places in various places generate incalculable data and the storage\
    \ of such data\nis also a huge challenge for some small servers.\nThose agricultural\
    \ IoT data have real-time,\ndynamic, granular and fragmented characteristics,\
    \ which brings great challenges to intermediate\ndesign, data large-scale screening,\
    \ screening, mining, processing and decision analysis techniques.\nMoreover, existing\
    \ databases cannot store unstructured data such as audio, video and images. As\
    \ a result,\nquite a lot real-time sensing data are not fully exploited. Besides,\
    \ some models and algorithms are not\nenough to to reﬂect objective reality, so\
    \ that they cannot eﬀectively guide agricultural production.\n5.2. Network Challenge\n\
    In protected agriculture, the sensor and device need to continuously operate under\
    \ the harsh\nand varied environment and their arrangement is sparse and irregular.\
    \ Compared with the wired\nnetwork with high wiring costs, the wireless network\
    \ has the advantages of low cost, good networking\nﬂexibility and high scalability\
    \ and therefore becomes the main application mode of the current\nmonitoring system.\
    \ Many actual deployments have displayed that common wireless communication\n\
    technologies are aﬀected by temperature, humidity andbuildings or other spatial\
    \ barriers [136–138].\nThe growth of animals and plants changes also result in\
    \ background noise [139] because of the\nmulti-path propagation eﬀects, which\
    \ lows reliability of data transmission. It is easy to isolate a node in\nthe\
    \ original communication network due to low node deployment density and the above\
    \ obstacles in\nprotected agriculture. If this node is responsible for communication\
    \ routing tasks of many devices and\nthis node is damaged and isolated from the\
    \ network, this will cause partial or even paralysis of most of\nthe network.\
    \ Most relevant theories and research needes on the eﬀects of the crop growth,\
    \ the thickness\nand material of wall, and the radio signal transmission loss\
    \ and electromagnetic wave transmission\nbetween soil and air interface, etc.\
    \ To determine the optimal position, height and network topology\nof sensor nodes\
    \ under diﬀerent environmental conditions. On the other hand, ad hoc intelligent\n\
    wireless network technology is needed to reduce or avoid paralysis of large-area\
    \ networks. The rise of\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n15 of 24\nLPWAN may solve e above\
    \ paralysis problems of WLAN due to its long communication distance,\nwhich obviates\
    \ the need for the dense and expensive deployments of relays and gateways altogether.\n\
    However, the cost of erecting LPWAN base stations is high.\nThe process of recording\
    \ various agricultural products’ status from the ﬁeld to the table\ngenerates\
    \ a large amount of data, which brings great challenges to wireless communication\
    \ with\na low transmission rate. At same times, it also brought network nodes\
    \ many problems in energy\ndistribution, data calculation, storage and communication.\
    \ Therefore, there is an urgent need to\ndevelop high-capacity data and real-time\
    \ broadband communication standards for technologies in\ncomplex agricultural\
    \ application environments.\n5.3. Security Challenge\nThe problems of security\
    \ and privacy are thought as crucial challenges in applications of protected\n\
    agriculture due to real-world examples of losses due to vulnerabilities, network\
    \ attacks or privacy issues.\nAs a multi-network heterogeneous converged network,\
    \ it not only has the same security problems as\nsensor networks, mobile communication\
    \ networks and the Interne, but also has its particular issues\nsuch as privacy\
    \ protection issues, authentication and access control issues for heterogeneous\
    \ networks,\nstorage and management of information issues, etc.\nIn the perception\
    \ layer, security threats are mainly against the WSN and RFID. In agricultural\n\
    applications, many of the sensor nodes are deployed in the long-term unsupervised\
    \ farmland\nenvironment and the wireless network itself is open, so the wireless\
    \ transmission is vulnerable to\nexternal interference and illegal users. Coupled\
    \ with the fact that these devices are respectively\nplaced elsewhere, a single\
    \ security measure is not enough [140]. The main threats to WSN include\neavesdropping\
    \ attack, node capture, replay attack and information wiretapping. So multiple\
    \ security\nmechanisms such as anonymity mechanism, data encryption and identity\
    \ authentication mechanisms\nare necessary [141,142].\nThe security threat of\
    \ RFID refers mainly to the attacks that are encountered when the RFID\nreader\
    \ and the tag communicate and such attacks usually lead to user privacy. In addition,\
    \ because the\nRFID tag is rewritable, the security and validity of the RFID tag\
    \ data will not be guaranteed.\nThere are lots of ways to enhance RFID tag security\
    \ such as modifying tag frequency, enciphered data.\nSensor nodes are diﬀerent\
    \ from RFID tag because they are active and relate to the dynamic properties of\n\
    things. Therefore, when applying encryption algorithms, key distribution policies,\
    \ intrusion detection\nmechanisms and security routing policies in speciﬁc devices,\
    \ we need to consider the limitations of\ntheir own hardware.\nSince networks\
    \ of diﬀerent architectures need to be connected to each other, there are even\n\
    greater challenges in terms of security authentication across network architectures.\
    \ The transport\nlayer will encounter the following security challenges: proxy\
    \ attacks, DoS (Denial-of-Service) attacks,\nmalicious code injection, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attacks, attacks across heterogeneous networks, etc.\nThe common measures dealt\
    \ with these network layer threats and attacks are: authorization,\nauthentication,\
    \ encryption, anti-virus protection, etc. IoT terminal devices in protected agriculture\n\
    have the characteristics of weak computing power and small storage space. Due\
    \ to limited resources,\nIoT encryption technology must be an easy to implement,\
    \ lightweight security technology that is\nsuitable for use in sensitive information\
    \ environments [143,144].\nWhen massive agricultural data is transmitted to the\
    \ application layer, in addition to the intelligent\nprocessing of data, data\
    \ security and privacy should also be considered. At this level, a large amount\n\
    of private data about users is collected, such as the consumption of agricultural\
    \ materials, the purchase\ninformation of fruits and vegetables and the location\
    \ of agricultural machinery. Therefore, the database\naccess control strategy\
    \ should be strengthened on the basis of intelligent data processing. When diﬀerent\n\
    users access the same data, they should limit their permissions and operations\
    \ according to their security\nlevel or identity, eﬀectively ensuring data security\
    \ and privacy. On the other hand, application layer\nservice providers should\
    \ accelerate the development and upgrade of authentication mechanisms\nSensors\
    \ 2019, 19, 1833\n16 of 24\nand encryption mechanisms for application scenarios\
    \ such as agricultural production, processing,\ntransportation and consumption.\n\
    5.4. Other Challenges\nThere are other challenges that need to be addressed, which\
    \ are related to the further application of\nIoT technology in protected agriculture.\
    \ Thousands of devices which have huge diﬀerences in processor,\nmemory, communication\
    \ protocol and programming language are deployed in protected agriculture,\nwhich\
    \ inevitably results in heterogeneity issues. Besides, most of devices in protected\
    \ agriculture are\nconnected to the cloud or others by the non-standard heterogeneous\
    \ interfaces [14,22]. This has led\nto problems of both device heterogeneity and\
    \ data heterogeneity. The device heterogeneity problem\naﬀects the scalability\
    \ of IoT in protected agriculture and the data heterogeneity problem hinders the\n\
    use of fusion information by models [145]. Although many research institutes,\
    \ hardware and software\nmanufacturers and related organizations have made a lot\
    \ of contributions to the standardization and\ndeployment of IoT in agriculture,\
    \ it still needs to establish a complete and clear structure, protocols and\n\
    standards to connect various heterogeneous devices and services [146,147].\nThe\
    \ cost has always been a barrier to the large-scale application of IoT to ordinary\
    \ farmers,\nespecially in developing countries like China and India. Despite a\
    \ large number of embedded devices\nand platforms have emerged and the cost of\
    \ hardware and software is rapidly decreasing, but here is\nanother situation\
    \ in high-quality and high-precision sensors and devices. Moreover, some funds\
    \ are\nneeded to train farmers to become proﬁcient in the use of IoT equipment.\
    \ In order to be able toplay\na better role in the future, the cost of sensing,\
    \ transmission, analysis and application components and\nequipment on the IoT\
    \ need to further reduce in order to lower the price and make it more aﬀordable\n\
    in the next decade [148]. Government departments should recognize the signiﬁcant\
    \ potential for the\ndevelopment of IoT in protected agriculture and increase\
    \ investment and support through policies and\nfunds to attract more capital and\
    \ achieve rapid development and application.\nIn addition, the usability of the\
    \ terminal device needs to be further improved, for example, the user\ninterface\
    \ needs to be friendlier andthe device needs to be more convenient in size and\
    \ easy to carry.\nIoT brings many beneﬁts to ecological environment and brings\
    \ some problems.. More and\nmore equipment is being placed in agriculture andso\
    \ the issues of environmental friendliness should\nreceive some attention in the\
    \ future. As the e-waste generated by IoT devices and the consumption of\nenergy\
    \ are gradually increasing, the sustainable development of the ecological environment\
    \ is also one\ncommon concern. Examples of interesting research topics include\
    \ the use of degradable materials and\nrenewable energy sources, the reduction\
    \ of equipment size and the use of energy-saving algorithms\nand new green ICT\
    \ technology [149,150].\nThe application of the Internet of Things in facility\
    \ agriculture needs to consider the socio-economic\nconsequences. On the one hand,\
    \ it increases the level of intelligence in agricultural monitoring,\ncontrol\
    \ and decision-making, thereby increasing the eﬃciency and quality of agricultural\
    \ production.\nAt the same time, it will also change the demand for the existing\
    \ agricultural workforce, causing some\npeople who are engaged in simple repetitive\
    \ tasks to lose their jobs, which will cause a series of\nsocial problems.\n5.5.\
    \ Future Prospects\nIoT technology is being applied to many ﬁelds of society,\
    \ economy and life at an unprecedented\nspeed, making human society step into\
    \ a new era of high intelligence. IoT technology is evolving\nand mature, and\
    \ many novel deployments and applications are constantly being built in protected\n\
    agriculture. Based on the above analysis and discussion of the key technologies\
    \ and applications of IoT\nin the protection of agriculture, we will present its\
    \ future development prospects and key research and\ndevelopment directions in\
    \ the following aspects. In the perception layer, the development of sensors\n\
    should focus on new sensitive materials, mechanisms, processes and methodologies\
    \ as well as low\npower consumption and low cost. Besides, we must accelerate\
    \ the development of sensors and rapid\nSensors 2019, 19, 1833\n17 of 24\ndetection\
    \ devices soil, animal and plant life. At the network layer, we should focus on\
    \ high-capacity data\nreal-time broadband communication standards and technologies\
    \ for complex agricultural application\nenvironments, high-reliability, adaptive,\
    \ low-power network deployment and management strategies\nand algorithms. With\
    \ wide coverage, high capacity, low power consumption and low cost, LPWAN is\n\
    ideal for some agricultural scenarios where text-based, video and voice service\
    \ support is not required\nand coverage, power consumption and cost are critical.\
    \ Future research and deployment should\nfocus on IoT solutions based on LPWAN.\
    \ In the application layer, governments and organizations\nshould develop uniﬁed\
    \ standards for the sensors and identiﬁcation interface devices, data transmission\n\
    communication protocols, multi-source data fusion analysis processing and application\
    \ services in\nprotected agriculture through international cooperation or negotiation.\
    \ Software developers should\ndevelop large open source databases and signal processing\
    \ algorithm libraries for diﬀerent areas\nof facility agriculture. For universities\
    \ and research institutes, cloud-based agricultural intelligent\ndecision-making\
    \ models, multi-source data-based information fusion algorithms, agricultural\
    \ Big Data\nmining technologies, distributed intelligent processing systems and\
    \ lightweight IoT authentication,\nencryption and authorization mechanisms will\
    \ be the key research directions for the future. With an\nincreased presence of\
    \ IoT technology in protected agriculture, its potential for the reﬁned management\n\
    of crop, livestock and aquatic animals will be recognized. Besides, as a technical\
    \ means to monitor\nthe production, processing, circulation and consumption of\
    \ agricultural products, IoTwill play an\nincreasingly important role in food\
    \ safety.\n6. Conclusions\nIn this survey, we present a comprehensive review of\
    \ the state-of-the-art in IoT deployment\nfor protected agriculture applications.\
    \ First, a simple review of previous IoT structure was given.\nSecondly, the basic\
    \ IoT architectures in protected agriculture were introduced. Next, discussions\
    \ of\nsensor, data communication, cloud computing, edge computing, ML and other\
    \ vital IoT technologies\nin protected agriculture are elaborated.\nThen, we highlight\
    \ various IoT applications and their\npotential to solve various farming problems\
    \ in protected agriculture. By classifying the research and\ndeployment literature\
    \ on IoT in protected agriculture, three important application ﬁelds were given:\n\
    plant management, animal farming and agri-food supply chain traceability. Finally,\
    \ a detailed analyses\nof IoT research challenges and future prospects were outlined.\n\
    The survey of the existing works directs us concluding remarks. The future prospects\
    \ of IoT in\nprotected agriculture are expectant, but the challenges mentioned\
    \ above must handle. In order to\ncope with its complex and changing agricultural\
    \ environment, the hardware devices must be fully\nupgraded to further enhance\
    \ their universality, reliability, expansibility, endurance and intelligence\n\
    level, while reducing costs and operative diﬃculty. Secondly, the local network\
    \ must be protected from\ninterference from other networks. In addition, the interoperability,\
    \ ﬁltering and semantic annotation of\ndata generated by the various devices of\
    \ IoT must be realized to a certain extent. Only in this way\ncan we optimize\
    \ the Big Data decision support model by using a large amount of heterogeneous\
    \ data.\nSecurity, anonymity and control over the access rights on the information\
    \ is vital for such a system to\nbe adopted. Finally, the impact of IoT on the\
    \ agroecological environment and social economy should\nbe considered in the application\
    \ of protected agriculture, to realize the sustainable development of\nagricultural\
    \ environment as quick as possible.\nAuthor Contributions: The collection, classiﬁcation\

    of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) in the agricultural field is
    currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation has large potentialities
    to provide benefits for both producers and consumers; on the other hand, pushing
    technological solutions into a rural context encounters several challenges. In
    this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research activities, in the
    form of both research projects and scientific literature, with the objective of
    showing the already achieved results, the current investigations, and the still
    open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus on the EU territory,
    identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing and upcoming solutions
    to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application of ICT to agriculture.
    Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support efficient production
    processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners, private and public companies
    to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging the use of innovative technologies
    to support farmers on the ground. According to the European Union (EU), the most
    relevant technologies and techniques to be fully exploited are the satellite imagery,
    the use of agricultural robots, a larger use of sensor nodes to collect data,
    and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and
    actuation. Those indications are contained into the declaration of cooperation
    on A smart and sustainable digital future for European agriculture and rural areas1
    signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries. According to the aforementioned declaration,
    the first obstacle towards a full implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack
    of connectivity, i.e., digital divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve
    such a situation in rural and low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must
    be still taken into account, as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory
    [3]. Rural areas remain challenging, not being covered by any Next Generation
    Access network: up to 53% at the end of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside,
    a plethora of initiatives can be identified towards the objective of the digitisation
    of agriculture. As an exemplary case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network
    promoted by the Agricultural European Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established
    in 2016, aims to close the gap between scientific knowledge and practitioners,
    in order to promote concrete solutions to be implemented. A solution can be defined
    as anything that makes the farming practice more controlled and accurate through
    ICT, reducing both the costs and the environmental impact, while also increasing
    the production. SF has the potential to also improve work safety, contributing
    to the sustainability of agriculture [1], but its socio-economic implications
    are debated [4]. In this innovative approach of farm management, a key component
    is the use of hardware and software technologies, like the deploying of sensor
    nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for imagery and positioning, data
    storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial and aerial drones. However,
    the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing agriculture, but in making
    the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and of high quality, while respecting
    farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle of the 80’s, but it has been practiced
    commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However, many farmers are still skeptical
    about the actual advantages it can offer. This can be explained by considering
    the profit and the direct benefits for the farm. In fact, it is not straightforward
    to identify those [6], for instance when considering Capital Expenditures (CAPEX)
    and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery, and data. Farmers generally
    tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits only large holdings, both
    in crop and livestock production. This is linked to the perception of high costs
    and complexity of the involved technologies. What is lacking from this image is
    the possibility that innovative technologies might not be only large-scale and
    thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus small and cheap [7]. Nowadays,
    SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological advancements for improving
    agricultural practices [8], further than business models for lowering adoption
    costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment, like Trringo in India,
    make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable costs for farmers,
    also providing support services. Such an initiative can be categorised as cooperative
    farming, potentially increasing the penetration of SF in low-income areas. Karnott,
    a French company, is pushing both web services and hardware solutions to transform
    legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott sells a control unit to be installed
    on agricultural machines, offering several services through a battery-powered
    device, collecting and exchanging real-time data, as well as geolocation. Then,
    collected data can be exploited through on-line services, like those provided
    by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available data can be accessed and
    fed to different management systems, thus offering a valuable repository for farms.
    Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite imagery joint with Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision Support System (DSS) for Precision
    Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain,
    UAVs, and adding support services on top of it. When considering fully autonomous
    solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds
    to harvest, with a hydroponic system able to strongly reduce the water consumption.
    At last, traceability is experiencing a revolution thanks to digital ledgers.
    Even if it cannot be considered immediately within the umbrella of SF, still the
    origin and the quality of agricultural products remains a central issue. Carrefour,
    a French multinational retailer, is betting on blockchain as a solution to provide
    trustable data to consumers and intermediate actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare
    Agritech in a farm trading platform as well, highlighting how innovative paradigms
    can be adapted to different use cases in the agricultural field. The aim of this
    work is to survey both research initiatives and scientific literature on the topic
    of SF, looking at recent technologies and techniques being used or being actively
    pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss still open challenges hampering such
    an objective. The rest of this work is structured as follows: Section 2 surveys
    research and innovation projects covering SF activities in the EU territory, then
    the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account the state of the art
    in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open challenges at today,
    considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally, Section 4 draws
    the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the art This section
    provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section 2.1, surveying relevant
    research projects recently funded by the EU in the field of SF; the aim is to
    highlight the increasing attention towards those activities, and then to identify
    the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of surveyed R&I projects.
    Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations as faced by the described
    research projects, and the technological solutions exploited in the latter ones.
    The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific works that
    propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an overview of
    surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2. Table 1. The
    most relevant EU-funded R&I projects towards increasing digitisation in the farming
    sector. The second part of the table is related to dissemination, engagement activities,
    and thematic networks. Marketplaces are here intended as virtual places where
    existing solutions can be publicly browsed. More details on each project are available

    the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read internally, and each keyword
    is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs to. 2.1. EU research projects
    In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking R&I activities laying the
    ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting data-empowered strategies;
    strategic interventions have been funded to support the uptake of digital technologies,
    to develop new digital solutions and to sustain the crucial assessment of the
    socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table 1, 30 recent EU projects closely
    related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects, spanning from 2015 to 2019,
    propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies in this field; the
    9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have the complementary
    objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture, for instance
    through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces to browse existing
    solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple techniques and
    technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones. 2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based
    systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects that are related to monitoring
    activities, like growth of plants, water availability, soil moisture maps, and
    so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with respect to those based
    on edge solutions, because the former is a more established option than the latter.
    The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management system for a sustainable
    and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply in Europe. The APMAV
    project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural management based on
    UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that provides farmers valuable,
    actionable and real-time recommendations for driving down costs and improving
    crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs as well, aiming at surveying
    a field from the air, then at performing a targeted intervention on the ground
    with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea is to provide a DSS requiring
    minimal user intervention to target PF applications. The SWAMP project develops
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches for smart water management
    in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize water more efficiently
    and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation. The AfriCultuReS project,
    beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits the data collected from
    different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services) to develop an integrated
    agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based on remote sensing, to
    support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive use of big data techniques
    related to the raw material production from agriculture, forestry, fishery and
    aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials in a sustainable
    way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and Earth Observation
    (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the just started Dragon
    project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers to ease PF adoption.
    Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed to offer agricultural
    knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging several techniques.
    The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques in the context of viticulture,
    supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis of large, diverse and multimodal
    data sources. It has been exploiting the use of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last
    but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of the most comprehensive projects from
    the point of view of SF digital technologies: in particular, this project accelerates
    the adoption of IoT, in order to secure sufficient, safe and healthy food and
    at strengthening competitiveness of farming and food chains in Europe. A large
    scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020 to develop and test specific
    technological solutions in the following sectors: arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables,
    and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use of unmanned vehicles is another trend
    of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and
    Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by taking advantage of the technological
    advancements in the fields of robotics, remote sensing and big data management,
    aims at designing an integrated system where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components
    (terrestrial and aerial robots) move within the orchards to collect data and perform
    common farming operations. The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to
    harvest sweet peppers in greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques
    to acquire both colour and distance information, and then storing collected peppers
    in an on-board container. Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI
    project to assist in weed reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour.
    Land robots also acquire detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists
    by providing information at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed
    and built a satellite-guided autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses.
    It exploits Galileo satellite services to navigate, achieving good positioning
    accuracy inside greenhouses. The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity
    increase via PF techniques. The proposed solution is a distributed platform for
    autonomous farming robots that allows the integration and real-time cooperation
    of agricultural systems to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality.
    This platform is integrated with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring
    and decision-making solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS
    project is centered on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions
    in agriculture systems, applying operational research to optimise farm production.
    2.1.3. Satellite-based activities Several projects are mainly based on improving
    the information derived from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims
    at delivering innovative algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus
    EO Syntethic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information.
    The AUDITOR project develops an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
    augmentation system for services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective
    PF services to farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application
    of water, fertilizer and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave
    data obtained from different satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key
    information about water availability for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project
    combines optical and radar measurements to develop three prototype services for
    near real-time operations: surface soil moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index
    (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE project provides soil moisture maps
    to decision makers in water management using GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites
    and UAVs. The project has developed a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated
    software platform. The APOLLO project brings PF closer to farmers through affordable
    information services, making extensive use of free and open EO data. The proposed
    services help farmers to make better decisions by monitoring the growth and health
    of crops, providing advice on when to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating
    the size of their harvest. The services are designed to be always available thanks
    to a web platform and a mobile application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other
    research projects are mainly focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers
    in a way compatible with their needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital
    divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative sets up a self-sustainable thematic network
    on SF technologies designed for the effective exchange of knowledge among research,
    industry, and the farming community, disseminating direct applicable research
    and commercial solutions, and capturing grassroots level needs and innovative
    ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy Decision For Farmers) focuses on the
    benefits provided by sensors in monitoring animals and environment, supporting
    informed decisions. The project hosts a large repository of ICT solutions freely
    browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project brings together 164 partners
    in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28 flagship innovation experiments
    for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable farming, livestock, vegetable,
    fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2 is to strengthen the research
    within the area of PF and to develop a common research agenda concerning ICT and
    robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives are: mapping and analysis
    of existing research and future needs; development of instruments and procedures
    for transnational funding activities; development of strategic research agenda
    and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations and networks.
    Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting up thematic networks
    with the objective of promote networking activities, data sharing and knowledge
    exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available ICT tools to promote
    their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to practitioners’ needs.
    The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect practitioners’ needs
    through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design ICT use cases to meet
    those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI) fashion. The Fairshare
    project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives, in order to build
    a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally, FarmingBySatellite
    is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and EO services. It launches
    a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using satellite technologies
    for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some considerations can be
    made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today, leveraging local
    and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up to satellites.
    Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned vehicles enable
    semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a major objective
    for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost all surveyed
    projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in fact, there
    is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives to human
    decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting automatic
    actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning techniques
    are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects we considered,
    such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise livestock
    production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents the evolution
    of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods, and techniques
    with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice in this sector.
    SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing [9], involving different
    hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused approaches have gained little
    traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very recent and exemplary subset
    of the scientific literature on such a topic, then schematised in Table 2. To
    further highlight what is currently trending in recent scientific literature,
    we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to the four thematic clusters
    we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted in its cluster according
    to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical application scenarios
    and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11]. Table 3. Relevant agricultural

    and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect data on the
    environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in the case of
    agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement data collected
    from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally, indoor and
    outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are used to collect
    heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such as the Normalized
    Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index, the LAI, and so on.
    Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources in this context [12],
    the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers a valuable perspective.
    At the beginning, three methodological approaches were considered: the first two
    ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop management, were contrasting
    because the former promoted soil mapping, while the latter promoted homogeneous
    actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual approach versus a clustered
    one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing, came later, consisting
    in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors. It can be considered
    the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to satellites, proximal
    soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing spectral analyses.
    To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data sources, increasing
    complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage of raw data and of
    subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13]. 2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles
    Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning are key concepts towards
    automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards a larger use of robots
    that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with minimal delay. Robots
    can perform very precise operations, and can operate in fleets, as proposed in
    Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems rely on GNSS techniques
    for precise positioning, and PF applications need large accuracy. Several commercial
    systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or more fixed Real-Time Kinematic
    (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing accuracy up to centimeters. Further
    than precise positioning, robots depend on machine-vision systems to navigate
    the environment [25]; according to the technology and the scenario under consideration,
    specific spectral signatures are of interest, as for instance hyperspectral imagery
    in both local and remote sensing. Commercial devices, to be used on board, already
    capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems
    are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have
    been revolutionising the practices in this sector. PF is taking large advantage
    of UAVs, with several commercial systems able to fly at different speeds and altitudes
    [24], ranging from fixed to rotary wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring
    scenarios, further than pesticide spraying, which is a key application for PF
    [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be used for such a purpose in the case of large
    fields, jointly with multispectral techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used
    for spraying pesticides and fertilizers where needed. Such a potential has been
    subject to increasing attention in the last years. For instance, UAVs can be used
    to assess if an area has been subject to plowing, and the plowing depths. The
    authors in Ref. [15] consider the use of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative
    to the use of satellites. In fact, according to the authors, even high-resolution
    satellites cannot classify the roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use
    of UAVs. A RGB camera has been used for data collection and a visual assessment,
    and collected georeferenced data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB
    and NIR are collected by means of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying
    plants and weeds. The proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG)
    [16] in the case of RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated
    and used because of the richer information it provides. By combining these results
    with geometric features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping
    plants. NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well:
    in fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can
    be discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest
    The authors declare no conflict of interest. Acknowledgment This work has received

    irrigation applications. • Neural network based intelligence is provided to the
    device for better assistance. • Remote monitoring enabled using MQTT and HTTP
    protocols. • Portable, light weight and user friendly. Abstract Agriculture contributes
    to a major share in the Indian economy and most of its people are dependent on
    it for their livelihood. This makes water an important resource that needs to
    be preserved using the latest available technologies. Apart from being fundamental
    in industry 4.0, IoT also extends its capability to smart farming. Work proposed
    here targets to develop a low cost intelligent system for smart irrigation. It
    uses IoT to make devices used in the system to talk and connect on their own,
    with capabilities like: admin mode for user interaction, one-time setup for irrigation
    schedule estimation, neural based decision making for intelligent support and
    remote data monitoring. A sample crop test-bed has been chosen to present results
    of the proposed system, that include irrigation schedule, neural net decision
    making and remote data viewing. Neural network provides required intelligence
    to the device that considers current sensor input and masks the irrigation schedule
    for efficient irrigation. The system uses MQTT and HTTP to keep the user informed
    about the current crop situation even from a distant location. The proposed system
    proves beneficial with its intelligence, low cost and portability, making it suitable
    for greenhouse, farms, etc. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords

    that India’s population will surpass 1.69 billion by 2050 Coale and Hoover (2015),
    and the current food availability is itself not sufficient to feed the people.
    Till date, traditional farming that is used in fields could be one of the reasons
    behind reduced crop production even though ample arable land is available. It
    thus becomes essential to merge the developing technologies with agriculture and
    perform intelligent farming. Digital India concept has led to tremendous growth
    in digital information storage, retrieval and communication and, one such concept
    Internet of Things (IoT) Xia et al. (2012) targets making human life more comfortable.
    It can be referred to as a system of inter-related computing devices, objects,
    things, animals, people, etc. that have the capability to share information over
    a network without human involvement. The idea of IoT has been blooming since decades,
    but it got recognized in 1999 Gama et al. (2012) only after it was mentioned by
    Kevin Ashton co-founder and executive director of the Auto-ID Center at MIT. His
    words in Ashton (2009) describe IoT as: “Today computers and, therefore, the Internet
    are almost wholly dependent on human beings for information. Nearly all of the
    roughly 50 petabytes (a petabyte is 1024 terabytes) of data available on the Internet
    were first captured and created by human beings by typing, pressing a record button,
    taking a digital picture or scanning a bar code”. This concept is the crux of
    smart technology and can be applied to gardens/farms for proper irrigation management.
    Smart farming is a well-established domain and there are numerous advantages of
    combining technology with farmers’ experience like: improved crop health Rumpf
    et al. (2010), better poultry farm animal health and tracking Floyd (2015), water
    management Gutierrez et al., 2014, Kaloxylos et al., 2013 food from farm to plate,
    etc. Numerous work has been done and is being carried out by various research
    groups in the smart agriculture domain, and details of a few works have been presented
    in this section. Water is one of the most important resources when it comes to
    farming. This has led to an extensive work related to efficient utilization of
    this limited resource. A large amount of water, approximately 100x more than personal
    use is consumed by food and agriculture and almost 70% of river and groundwater
    is utilized in irrigation making them the largest consumers of water resources
    Siebert et al. (2010). Currently, out of 3600 km3 of fresh water, nearly half
    is lost due to evaporation, transpiration FAO and Rome (2002) from the crops,
    etc. while the remaining half adds the groundwater level. Most of the water involved
    in agriculture is provided directly by rainfall, but the places with drought have
    only irrigation as an option for farming purpose. A typical irrigation system
    comprises of a layout: irrigation method, source: nearby water body, carriers:
    pipelines to the farm, actuators: on/off mechanism to control water, valves: water
    flow control. There are methods as mentioned by Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (FAO) Brouwer and Heibloem (1986) to compute irrigation
    requirements of crops. To achieve these needs of crops, there are various ways
    to irrigate them. These include drip, sprinkler, furrow, manual, etc. Out of these
    ways to irrigate, drip has the highest efficiency and a well designed one can
    even reach to 100% when it comes to water usage. Irrigation water management has
    to adapt to the increasing food requirements and “more crop per drop” Luquet et
    al. (2005) needs to be adopted. The main technologies to be used in the developing
    countries with abundant labor and scarce capital are drip and underground irrigation,
    which depend upon frequent small amounts of water directly to the root zone of
    the crops. Agriculture will always remain the most dominant user of water resources
    at the global level and is bound to boost particularly in arid and semi-arid regions.
    Thus substantial contribution of irrigation in agriculture is needed in future
    that will save people from famine and nutritional deaths. Wireless sensor network
    (WSN) for irrigation management has proved out to be helpful for water savings.
    WSN as the name suggests, is a connected network of sensor nodes that nodes directly
    interact with the environment and provide real time information that is helpful
    in identifying farm areas in need. It can be used as both a data collection device
    and a decision making tool for real time monitoring. Gutierrez et al. (2014) presents
    a WSN for plant water usage optimization. The system is powered by photovoltaic
    panels for long working duration. Similar work using solar power has been proposed
    by Miranda et al. in Miranda et al. (2005), and, authors in Dursun and Ozden (2011)
    have also presented a WSN for controlled irrigation and monitoring. In Vellidis
    et al. (2008) a low cost system for irrigation scheduling in cotton using real-time
    wireless sensors is proposed. Similar works using WSN but targeted to mango orchard
    and apple orchard have been presented in Nooriman et al., 2018, Meng et al., 2018
    respectively. A new place where WSN could be implemented is presented by authors
    in Lopez-Iturri et al. (2018) where a WSN combined with cloud for data storing
    and an app as an educational resource platform in school gardens, with the aim
    of enhancing technological skills in students. Greenhouse crop management using
    WSN has been presented by Jimenez et al. in Jiménez et al. (2012) and greenhouse
    control by Gonda et al. in Gonda and Cugnasca (2006). A WSN based potato monitoring
    and irrigation management using low power sensor nodes has been presented in Shinghal
    et al. (2017). This work estimates crop related and the environmental parameters
    using the nodes and model. The work is specific to potato whereas our work can
    be applied to variety of crops with single calibration by the user. Another work
    using WSN targets resource poor farmers for water control and is presented by
    Rashid et al. in Hussain et al. (2012). Dong et al. in Dong et al. (2013) target
    soil moisture monitoring using WSN and present an autonomous irrigation management
    system. Related works and surveys on WSN have been presented in Akyildiz et al.,
    2002, Baronti et al., 2007, Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Garcia-Sanchez et al.,
    2011, Yick et al., 2008. A dedicated survey for WSN in agriculture drafted in
    Kalaivani et al. (2011) provides an overview of zibgee based network application
    to farming where it utilizes the WSN to monitor the ambient, soil, plant health
    conditions, etc. Using precision agriculture (PA), a technique where the soil
    works better, not harder, has been used by authors in Srbinovska et al. (2015)
    for greenhouse based vegetation using WSN. Similar work that combined PA and IoT
    for decision and control has been proposed in Patokar and Gohokar (2018), where
    the data is collected and transferred for decision making using IoT. This work
    uses sensor data with pre-defined threshold for decision making, whereas, work
    in our paper considers neural and ET based methods and selects one of two based
    on past and current conditions. Thus it handles abrupt situations and relates
    complex inputs to the water needs. Another work presented in Chaudhary et al.
    (2011) automatically monitors and controls the greenhouse parameters using PA.
    Machine learning provide systems with the potential to automatically learn, program
    and get better without external stimuli and programming. It focuses to develop
    programs that can self learn. Decision support system that uses machine learning
    has been presented in Dutta et al. (2014) and a study for decision systems and
    its use in water management has been presented by Guariso et al. in Guariso et
    al. (1985). Ramesh and Samraj (2018) targets fruit farms of Namakkal area in Tamil
    Nadu and presents a fuzzy based system for irrigation optimization. The authors
    use thermal imaging, air statistics as inputs, multifactor dimension method for
    removing sensor data redundancy and uses low power devices to improve battery
    life. Another work that uses fuzzy based decision support system for irrigation
    management in vineyard is proposed by authors in Viani et al. (2017). Current
    irrigation systems make use of direct parameter thresholds, fuzzy logic to get
    the water requirement. The parameters that are tracked mostly include the ambient
    temperature, humidity, soil water content and they do not form a simple relationship
    with the crop water needs. This requires to get into complexities and make use
    of neural network (NN) to decide for irrigation. NN is a subset of machine learning
    that mimic the human brain and can process information similar to it. Alike the
    human brain, NN comprises of various connected elements called neurons that work
    to solve problems. This is also addressed in this paper, and also one of the targeted
    users is the Indian farmer, an economically feasible equipment would be beneficial.
    Current solutions are crop specific and more generic systems are needed. To achieve
    this, a novice user-device interaction is introduced here. It thus suggests that
    it is essential for technology to contribute in farming sector as well by making
    best use of current advancements and implementing them in traditional methods.
    People should be more aware and, adopt techniques to reduce the burden and provide
    easy access even from distant place. Thus, considering the current research in
    India in smart farming domain, this paper presents a crop monitoring and automatic
    irrigation system that performs: • Interacts with user and gets planted crop details.
    • Estimates beforehand the irrigation schedule for complete season. • Gets ambient
    and soil statistics. • Performs evapotranspiration and neural based irrigation
    decision. • Alerts irrigation unit to enable zone-wise watering. • Sends sensor
    data to MQTT broker to allow remote data monitoring. The remaining paper is organized
    as: the proposed system and subject scenario are presented in Section 2. The results
    of various system modules have been shown in Section 3. Finally the paper is concluded
    in Section 4 and references have been mentioned at the end. 2. Proposed system
    This work proposes a greenhouse/garden/farm monitoring and automatic irrigation
    system capable of tracking down the crop water needs, alerting the irrigation
    unit and user regarding it, providing real-time and history of farm data. It also
    achieves effective utilization of water with the help of an automatic irrigation
    system for plants by taking into consideration the plant and soil needs. Table
    1 provides the nomenclature used in this work. Water needs depend upon various
    factors and in this work, for , it has been defined by Eq. (1), where the function
    is modeled using neural network (NN). Allen et al. (1998) can be computed using
    Eq. 2 where, is defined as the property of plants used in predicting ; a combination
    of evaporation from soil surface and transpiration from the plant leaves, stems,
    flowers, etc. These parameters altogether define the water requirement of a crop
    which is achieved using this work without any human intervention. There are radiation,
    temperature, pan co-efficient based methods such as Penman-Monteith Bogawski and
    Bednorz (2014), Hargreaves, Blaney-Criddle, Linacre, Priestly-Taylor, Trajkovic,
    etc. mentioned in Pandey et al. (2016) for estimating , and this work makes use
    of the Blaney-Criddle method. (1) (2) Table 1. Nomenclature used in the work.

    data publish and decision making. • Decision transfer to IU to complete continuous

    time duration in which the user needs to input data for the crop that is to be
    planted and for which IN schedule is desired, and soil type. After admin time-out,
    a one time setup is done which loads the crop related data taken from user, which
    is then used to compute the evapotranspirations and the irrigation needs. In the

    Pole (USP) USP is the brain of the proposed system specially designed for intelligent
    decision making. Fig. 4 shows its prototype installation which costs 850 ( $13),
    that comprises of (a) crop, (b–c) sensors, (d) controller, that consists of ESP8266
    which does all the tasks. Algorithm 1 gives pseudocode for this module. For a
    realistic scenario where multiple plants need be grown, the targets are defined
    in the algorithm. The crop details fetched from the user are taken as the input
    to estimate the water requirement. The planting area is divided into zones based
    on type of plants and the area coverage where multiple USPs are placed. The area
    that receives average water is chosen to insert the sensor, as it can precisely
    sense requirement of nearby areas. Selecting area that receives less water could
    lead to overlogging whereas, area that gets more water might create water stress
    to the crop. Download : Download high-res image (702KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Module prototype installation (a) plant, (b) soil moisture sensor,
    (c) temperature and humidity sensor, (d) controller (USP). USP gives the environmental
    and soil water status using sensors that provide with { } and { } at intervals,
    and it uses them for computing the irrigation requirement. It controls the sensors
    and is responsible for the decision making and sending request to IU. The USP
    prototype is inserted at locations to get the real time physical data and analyze
    it. Initially, USP works in admin mode until time-out, where the user is required
    to provide data which gets saved on it for remaining all computations. It loads:
    and then computes . Using Allen et al. (1998), is computed which is used as reference
    for crop water requirement. Apart from this computation, the irrigation schedule
    is estimated which provides in advance the dates when irrigation needs to take
    place for the planted crop. These irrigation dates are saved in a file on USP.
    This file with the estimated schedule is then sent once to the server using FTP
    via internet. After one time setup is complete, data is fetched from sensors at
    intervals and the USP goes for decision making using the sensor data, for which
    a data window is set that is used to select mode from either : mode with previously
    estimated or : mode with computation. Mode selection is required in case random
    weather changes occur frequently so that switching could be done between the two
    available modes using the decision (mode) block. The normal mode initiates IN,
    based on the computed values in setup mode, whereas is selected when adverse conditions
    occur. Switching to needs a NN to predict and compute {0,1}. A 2-layer NN shown
    in Fig. 5(a) is trained using “nftool” of MATLAB and its functionality using weights
    and biases post training along with the inputs is implemented in decision (water)
    block of USP (seen in Fig. 3) to get the final decision (n = 4). This decision
    alongwith module id is sent to the IU which actuates for the required zone . Fig.
    5(b) shows the inputs, target output and the trained output to it. Here, output,
    physical data, crop stage and saved outputs from crop database are initially used
    for training purpose, whereas, the real-time data uses the trained network to
    generate required output. In the next step, USP connects to the MQTT broker running
    on the SIU via internet where it publishes the sensor data for further analysis
    and real-time remote monitoring. USP-MQTT communication can be seen from Fig.
    6, where USP initiates a connection with the broker and publishes data to topics.
    This data could be viewed remotely by subscribing to specific topics. The broker
    is created using an open source platform Mosquitto Light (2013) that implements
    the MQTT protocol. MQTT is chosen over HTTP due to its benefits like, lightweight
    and minimal message size thus less bandwidth requirement and high speed Velez

    unit based on the data received from USP through WiFi (client-server scenario).
    Algorithm 2 shows the working of IU that serves as an accesspoint where multiple
    USPs send their irrigation requests which consists of a (a) ESP8266 based controller
    which is programmed to accept, attend requests and send signal to, (b) relay that
    turns on/off the (c) motor as shown in Fig. 7(a). Initially during setup, ports
    are defined for different zones and are set as outputs to enable/disable irrigation.
    Also the IU is configured by providing it with a unique IP so that the USP clients
    can connect to it and send their requests. Doing this enables the unit to accept
    irrigation requests from USPs and water required zones. It then checks for available
    clients and if any request is received it parses the data to get the ON time duration
    and unique id so that correct zone can be irrigated. It writes data to the corresponding
    port and again gets back to scan for more requests and again turns the relay ON
    and/or OFF for respective zones. The IU is capable to serve multiple requests
    simultaneously, so it attends USP in every zone thus eliminating the need of any
    queue and waiting time. Download : Download high-res image (170KB) Download :

    and sending alert to the relay for motor control. It recognizes the client by
    its id and send the received motor input to the motor control module i.e. the
    relay and then gets back to wait for more requests. This functionality benefits
    when multiple and varied plants are cultivated in a single place where IU can
    answer to every zones’ requests. It further sends status feedback to USP thus
    achieving a continuous monitoring process. Items used in the farm i.e. motor pump,
    drip set and IU cost 12 ($800). Algorithm 2 Irrigation Unit  1: Require:  2: for

    Telemetry Transport (MQTT), a lightweight messaging protocol for power efficient
    devices and sensors based on a publish-subscribe mechanism is 74x faster and lighter
    than HTTP. There are three options when it comes to hosting an MQTT server, (i)
    locally installed server, (ii) cloud based/virtual server and (iii) shared server
    application. Mosquitto, HiveMQ, cloudmqtt, mosca, RabbitMQ, flespi are some MQTT
    brokers. It works on a publish-subscribe mechanism, where the sensors/device publish
    data to topics on the MQTT broker. End user, called as subscribers in this case
    can view the sensor data by subscribing to the respective topics. Here, the publishers
    and the subscribers are unaware of each other and they do not communicate directly
    with each other, instead they are connected to the broker. It is the topics on
    the broker to which data is published and is subscribed to. A generic publish-subscribe
    scenario taking place in MQTT communication is shown in Fig. 6. In this work,
    open source MQTT broker Mosquitto is used (created on SIU), to which the USP modules
    publish sensor data under specific topics, for instance/usp/ id / param and, the
    users subscribe to the same topic for viewing the data. As shown in Fig. 8, a
    python script runs continuously at the back-end of the broker, that takes the
    incoming data on the MQTT port, segregates and saves the zone-wise data. As seen
    from Eq. 3 the rate of change of the sensor values is very small ( ∊ is infinitesimally
    small value) and also the data sampling rate is 5 min, here, the Quality of Service
    (QoS) 0 is set at the broker. This data and the estimated IN schedule file are
    used by the HTTP server (running on the SIU) for display on user webpage. The
    Mosquitto broker, HTTP, FTP server and python script all run on the SIU. Any PC
    including a Raspberry Pi can be used as to obtain this functionality (minimum
    cost $39). Section 3 shows results for the system and its modules. (3) ∊ Download

    Broker implementation. 3. Results The proposed system is tested by creating a
    test bed of spinach seeds and continuous monitoring for the growing period. The
    results for every step of the system have been taken and mentioned in this section.
    3.1. Admin mode Each plant has different requirements based on its family kingdom
    so the IN needs differ. To make it suitable for all crops, admin mode is created
    where the user enters these details: { , soil type} used for growing it. Each
    USP is assigned a unique id using which it creates an access point and the user
    connects to it. The user then enters the data that is saved onto the device for
    further computations by the one-time setup module. Fig. 9 shows results obtained
    for the admin mode for test USP. The admin homepage Fig. 9(a) shows three tabs
    for network configuration-information and, for USP configuration in Fig. 9(b)–(d).
    Figs. 9(e) and (f) show the options for crop information selection wherein, the
    required crop, date and soil type are selected. These user selected values are
    saved and used during the one-time setup for irrigation schedule estimation. Download

    Admin mode. 3.2. One-time setup After admin mode time-out, USP enters a one-time
    setup in which the following parameters are obtained: • . • Stagewise and monthwise
    . • and . • M: . if else . • . The values computed in this mode for some sample
    crops are mentioned in Table 2. The crop IN needs are computed based on the date
    and soil of plantation and, accordingly the irrigation schedule is also computed
    which suggests best suitable dates for irrigating the crops. This data is stored
    onto the device until next changes are made by the user in admin mode and is used
    as reference for irrigation. The stagewise values, dates and other data for spinach
    is shown in Fig. 10. is also computed during the setup mode and is sent to the
    IU for irrigation purpose. It can be computed using Eq. 4, where the water flow
    depends upon the gross net irrigation depth (crop specific), irrigation interval
    between two consecutive schedules and and, net application rate is with respect
    to the motor chosen. (4) Table 2. IN schedule for sample crops. Crop Date of plantation

    the soil water availability can be controlled my means of irrigation, the ambient
    conditions are still uncontrollable, thus creating a complex relationship between
    them. This implies that the decision taken on the basis of these values do not
    completely reflect the needed one. To relate the required output with the sensor
    inputs, simple equations are not enough and so here NN is employed for getting
    precisely accurate output. A crop IN requirement database is used to train the
    NN shown in Fig. 5 where, and : input layer nodes, : the hidden layer nodes and
    : the drip output computed by the network. Bayesian regularization algorithm is
    used in training done by the network. Weights and biases obtained post-training
    are used to compute the output and outcome on selection of mode. The network training
    results can be seen from Fig. 11, where, the training and performance could be
    seen. Fig. 11(a) shows the performance during training, validation and testing
    of sensor dataset. It is measured in terms of the mean square error value (MSE),
    which is the mean squared difference between the target and obtained output. For
    validation, the best performance is observed at epoch 85 and its value is 0.0037699
    represented by encircled point in the figure. The x-axis in Figs. 11(a) and (b)
    mention 91 epochs which implies that the training stops after this point and the
    best performance is given from these epochs. Fig. 11(b) presents the training
    state values with respect to the number of training epoch. Here, gradient, Mu
    and validation failures are plotted and the plot titles represent the values obtained
    at the final epoch. Gradient is used to optimize the weights and biases by reducing
    the error using steepest descent method. Mu is the momentum update which is the
    training gain and the control parameter used by the algorithm to train the network.
    Its value affects the convergence and MATLAB considers 0.001 as default initial
    value. Training should be stopped if maximum Mu is reached as additional training
    would degrade learning. It is also seen that training results are obtained till
    91 epochs, it is because the training stops if the validation error fails to reduce
    for 6 iterations, and, it can be seen from the validation fail plot of Fig. 11(b).
    Further the error histogram for training, validation and testing is presented
    in Fig. 11(c) which shows that acceptable amount of error is achieved post training.
    Regression R measures correlation between outputs and targets. Its ideal value
    1 means the output portrays close relationship with target, while 0 is a random
    relationship. Regression values for this network training, validation and testing
    can be seen from Fig. 11(d). Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download

    monitoring Sensor data fetched using USP is: (i) sent to MQTT broker, (ii) used
    for mode M selection which then (iii) computes (iv) send request to IU, thus completing
    a continuous monitoring loop. The MQTT results for PC brokers are shown in Fig.
    12 where, Figs. 12(a)–(b) show Mosquitto broker results and (c) shows result for
    MQTT.fx, a MQTT dashboard for PC. Fig. 13 provides with dashboard view for an
    Android app running on Android Pie. The sensor data can be remotely seen by initiating
    a connection to the MQTT broker. Subscription to proper topic by the user gives
    data as seen in Fig. 13 where the temperature, humidity and soil moisture values
    can be noticed. Results shown are for “IoT MQTT dashboard” app available on Google
    play store for android users. It is available for download on “https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thn.iotmqttdashboard&hl=en”
    link TH (2016). The HTTP server running on the same machine allows users to login
    to their farms/gardens and, monitor the plant ambient situation, its moisture
    level, irrigation status and the irrigation schedule as well. Fig. 14 shows the
    user login page using which the user can view the day-wise data statistics of
    various crops he has planted. User can get day-wise data statistics for the whole
    growing period by entering the date and month as seen in Fig. 14. The plant-wise
    estimated IN schedule is also available on the plant homepage as seen from Fig.
    14(d). Fig. 15 shows the temperature, humidity and soil moisture data for selected
    date . Similar values can be seen for any date that falls in the plant growing
    period. Download : Download high-res image (652KB) Download : Download full-size

    current consumed by USP and Fig. 16 shows the consumption in mA. In the figure,
    the x-axis shows instances of samples where the current consumption is computed.
    The sampling rate used by the kit is 23, and values for 6000 samples have been
    shown in the figure. The current drawn by USP in different modes is mentioned
    on y-axis. When the device is started, it initially draws more current which thereafter
    reduces as it enters the admin mode. There is a further reduction and it is when
    the USP computes and the irrigation schedule. The current again increases as it
    enters the continuous monitoring mode as seen from the figure. Download : Download

    work can be seen from Fig. 17, where Fig. 17(a) shows the placement of USP and
    the growth can be seen in Fig. 17(b). Here, the USP needs to be configured first
    by the user as per the procedure given in Section 3.1. The IU setup then needs
    to be installed near the water source and pipes as per the required arrangement.
    After this has been done, the USP is to be inserted (selection of appropriate
    location has been mentioned in Section 2.1) and then USP and IU should be started.
    At the server end, script at the back end will fetch the incoming data and will
    direct it to the logfiles. Using this setup user can create his own automatic
    irrigation for his crops. Comparison of proposed system has been done with respect
    to percentage water savings over drip and traditional irrigation methods. A total
    of 12 drip emitters are used in the test bed made for the automatic irrigation
    system. Controlled water flow through the emitters is enforced for optimal usage,
    which provides 12.5% water savings with respect to normal drip method. Some estimated
    irrigation schedules were by-passed by NN due to proper conditions for the plant.
    A non-scheduled irrigation was performed by NN due to stress in soil. Thus NN
    has here ensured 20% of water savings from normal schedule. Finally overall water
    savings of 30% and 67% has been achieved using the system with respect to normal
    drip and traditional irrigation methods respectively. Download : Download high-res

    4. Conclusion This paper presents a farm monitoring and automatic irrigation system
    that has three modules: (i) unified sensor pole (USP), low cost and intelligent
    IoT based module, (ii) irrigation unit (IU), and (iii) sensor information unit
    (SIU). For user access, USP initially remains for some time in admin mode where
    it gets crop, plantation date and soil data, which it uses in one-time setup mode
    for evapotranspiration and irrigation schedule computation. Finally, it goes into
    a continuous monitoring mode where it senses the data, uses it for NN based decision
    making, sends the decision to IU and sensor data to SIU. The IU is responsible
    for parsing and writing incoming data from USP to correct port and turning ON/OFF
    water for the required zone. It keeps on checking for incoming clients and performs
    accordingly. SIU stores the sensor data by directing the incoming data stream
    on Mosquitto broker to log files, which is used by the HTTP server running on
    the same machine to allow remote sensor data monitoring. Detailed results for
    all the modules have been presented in the paper for a sample testbed. The cost
    of USP (brain of the system) is around $800–$1000 ( 12– 15). Overall water savings
    of 67% over traditional way is achieved using the system. Thus effective water
    utilization and visit-free monitoring provides smart solution in water scare areas
    and people far away from their farms. The necessity of preserving this natural
    resource justifies the usage of such automatic systems. Its easy access, cost
    effectivity and usability make it versatile and thus suitable for varied population
    and, potential like, adaptivity and portability make it fit for use in house vegetation,
    greenhouse, etc. Acknowledgements The work presented in this paper has been supported

    all metrics Abstract Presently, wireless sensor network (WSN) plays important
    role in engineering, science, agriculture and many other field like surveillance,
    military applications, smart cars etc. Precision agriculture (PA) is one of the
    field in which WSN is widely adopted. The aim of the adoption of WSNs in PA is
    to measure the different environmental parameters such as humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, PH value of soil etc., for enhancing the quantity and quality of
    crops. Further, the WSNs are also helped to reduce the consumptions of the natural
    resources used in farming. Hence, the aim of this review is to identify the various
    WSNs technologies adopted for precision agriculture and impact of these technologies
    to achieve smart agriculture. This review also focuses on the different environmental
    parameters like irrigation, monitoring, soil properties, temperature for achieving
    precision agriculture. Further, a detailed study is also carried out on different
    crops which are covered using WSNs technologies. This review also highlights on
    the different communication technologies and sensors available for PA. To analyze
    the impact of the WSNs in agriculture field, several research questions are designed
    and through this review, we are tried to find the solutions of these research
    questions. Similar content being viewed by others Wireless Sensor Network in Agriculture:

    Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are the networks
    which are composed of sensor nodes. These sensor nodes help in sensing, gathering
    and measuring the information from the surroundings where they are deployed and
    transmit the data to the users. A WSN has small or we can say no infrastructure
    and having number of sensor nodes in it from ten to thousands which works together
    to monitor a area where they are deployed.WSN are classified into two categories
    structured and unstructured. Structured WSN are those which are deploy in proper
    manner into a specific area and can be easily configured if there is any problem
    in a senor nodes whereas unstructured WSN are those in which sensors nodes are
    deploy in bulk without any proper architecture these type of WSN are mainly found
    in those area where it is difficult for humans to reach easily and obtain data
    from that area. In unstructured WSN, it is difficult to take care of sensor nodes
    if they stop working or issue of node failure occurs. Wireless sensor network
    are classified into five types to monitor the parameters of surface of earth,
    underground conditions, underwater conditions, multimedia and to monitor the area
    by the help of movement of sensors. These five types of sensors are defined as
    Terrestrial WSN-In this type of WSNs, huge number of nodes are deploy into a surface
    of land that can help to examine the conditions of land. Underground WSN- As the
    name depict underground WSN are networks of sensor nodes which are deployed in
    caves, mines or underground surface for monitoring the condition of soil, moisture
    and military boarder monitoring. Underwater WSN- In this WSNs, sensors are deployed
    in the region of oceans, rivers for underwater surveillance. Multi-media WSN-It
    is a network consists of sensors nodes that have ability to store, process and
    access multi-media data such as video data, audio files and pictures. Mobile WSN-
    In this network, sensor nodes have the ability to move from one place to other.
    The application of such networks is military surveillance, monitoring of area,
    tracking of target, monitoring under water [1]. In WSNs, sensors are integrated
    with a radio transceiver and a set of electronics components which helps in transmission
    of data from source to destination. Sensor nodes have capability to organize themselves
    to create ad hoc, multi-hop network which helps in creating communication link
    between nodes. User can give commands to sensors; as a response of these commands
    sensors can transmit data to the user for example a particular limit of temperature
    is assign to the sensor with the help of embedded language if temperature exceeds
    from that assigned value than sensor provides information to the user [2]. 1.1
    Wireless Sensor Network in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture is a crop
    management concept which allows farmers for managing spatial and temporal variability
    with in the agricultural field such as reduction of natural resources, irrigation
    management, production management, fertilizer management, intrusion attacks, and
    real time data monitoring [3]. The aim behind the adoption of sensors in precision
    agriculture is to enhance the overall production of crops. Sensors can help for
    measuring various parameters of agriculture land like humidity, soil moisture,
    climatic condition, intrusion detection, water level which facilitate that can
    lead to better production [4]. Further, sensor can collect the information regarding
    various parameters and process the collected information for better farming. The
    significant role of sensors in agricultural field is listed below (Fig. 1). Fig.

    Full size image 1.2.4 Citation Criteria For this review, the articles published
    in SCI listed journals are considered. To collect the good literature review,
    several search strings are designed which are mentioned in Sect. 2.3. But these
    search strings are not capable to distinguish articles published in SCI listed

    articles taken from the individual journal. Table 1 Illustartes the categorization
    of articles with journals Full size table 2 Literature Survey This section of
    paper describes the literature survey of various research articles related to
    precision agriculture using wireless sensor network. This section includes various
    techniques, sensors, algorithms and sensor motes used for collecting information
    from agricultural fields. The literature survey on the usability of sensor nodes
    in PA is divided into three categories. These categories are (1) Monitoring of
    Crops (2) Irrigation Management of Crops (3) Environmental parameters for Crops
    2.1 Monitoring This subsection describes the works reported on monitoring of the
    crops. Sanchez et al. [6] proposed an integrated wireless sensor network as a
    solution for precision agriculture. This model can help to assimilate crop data
    acquisition, transmission of data from the end user and video-supervision task.
    The main objective this model is to secure the crops from intruders and identification
    of same in the agriculture field. The detection and identification of intruders
    are done with help of video surveillance. High consumption of energy and end to
    end delay problems are remain unsolved. The different hardware prototypes have
    been implemented for crop monitoring devices. The detection intruder is measured
    using infrared motion sensors and identification is consummated with the help
    of camera sensors. Zhang et al. [7] proposed a method to monitor vigor of the
    plant with the help of WSNs. In this work, the vigor of the plant is non-violently
    monitored through embedded and image processing technology. If unusual behaviour
    of a plant is identified during monitoring process, then warning message is sent
    to end users. With the help of wireless sensor nodes deployed in the field’s wastage
    of resources which are needed for cultivation of plant are minimised. Proposed
    method based on data fusion of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation helps in providing
    the well-organized way for monitoring the strength of plant in many phases of
    agriculture. Zou et al. [8] proposed an algorithm named as OASNDFA for achieving
    intelligent agricultural monitoring with minimum sensor nodes deploy in the field.
    The selection of location of nodes is difficult in hilly areas due graphical and
    weather conditions. This algorithm helps to find the suitable location of nodes.
    This algorithm works in three phases. The first phase considers the different
    relevant factor. In second phase, a mathematical model is designed with the help
    of relevant factors. The third phase consists of key points with maximum features.
    These features are computed through mathematical model. To address the vulnerable
    dynamic topology problem for monitoring the crops, Jiang et al. [9] proposed an
    algorithm based on tree topology, called dynamic converge cast tree algorithm
    (DCTA). This algorithm is employed within the monitoring system of WSN. The aim
    of the proposed algorithm is to obtain better data attainment for monitoring of
    growth of plant. The DCTA algorithm having three stages i.e. (a) routing which
    is based on dynamic routing (b) adaptable time slot scheduling (c) compilation
    and examination of data. This algorithm provides high data transmission between
    nodes. For real time monitoring of the agriculture filed, Kim et al. [10] proposed
    an WSNs architecture based on beacon mode with autonomous. This architecture provides
    the solutions for the problems like fire, intrusion attack, and lack of availability
    of resources. The proposed architecture is worked on the TinyOS platform and further,
    multiple beacon scheduling in the MAC layer with bop slots is considered. The
    dynamic address allocations and path recovery process for unexpected link is addressed
    on the network layer. The results staed that the proposed architecture having
    reliable transmission ratio for a real-time processing service like fire and emergency
    agriculture monitoring systems under heavy traffic environments. Intrusion attacks
    are one of the major issues faced by farmers. Because, intruders destroy the agriculture
    fields and leads to decrease in productivity. To address the same, Bapat et al.
    [11] proposed a wireless sensor network to protect farms from animal attacks.
    Sensor nodes equipped with PIR sensors, sound sensors, light flashers and RF module
    are deployed in agriculture field. Sensor nodes that are located near to boundaries
    of field detect animal entry and send information to the central base station.
    From the central base station, the information is sent to end users. To monitor
    the variability of nitrogen gas and biomass foe sugarcane crop, Portz et al. [12]
    proposed active crop sensor model based on WSNs. The results revealed that the
    proposed model is capable to indicate demand of nitrogen and biomass in sugarcane
    fields. The nitrogen sensor helps to detect the variability of biomass and nitrogen
    and preventing action can be taken for supplying the biomass and nitrogen into
    sugarcane crop. Reiser et al. [13] proposed WSNs based system for autonomous navigation
    of agriculture field. The proposed system comprises of location of nodes deployed
    in agriculture field and data attainment. The proposed system has advantages over
    the narrow transmission range of nodes. This system is effectively detected the
    faulty nodes. Smiljkovikj et al. [14] proposed an intelligent cloud based system
    named as Smartwine which monitors the wine production process using grapes. It
    works on sensor network platform having centralized server system which allows
    more than one users to use system simultaneously. The Smartwine system helps in
    decrease the cost of energy, water, resources and pesticides use for wine production.
    To monitor the agricultural production process, Diaz et al. [15] proposed a methodology
    which have seven phases that are (1) Study the condition of environment. (2) Design
    of sensor network architecture. (3) Role and Importance. (4) Implementation. (5)
    Simulation (6) Deployment. (7) Maintenance. The designed methodology represents
    the importance of wireless sensor in agricultural field and provides strong foundation
    for building applications with high productivity gain. To monitor the crops in
    green house and orchard, Zhu et al. [16] developed a monitoring system based on
    WSNs. The capabilities of the proposed system are evaluated using three different
    scenarios such as greenhouse, open farmland and orchard. The proposed system gives
    better reliable communication between sensors nodes deployed in agriculture fields.
    Further, it is also seen that rate of packet loss is significantly decreased.
    To attaining less management cost and high productivity in cultivation of crops,
    Srbinovska et al. [17] proposed WSNs based architecture for vegetable greenhouse.
    The developed system analyzes the various environmental parameters like temperature,
    humidity and light, for optimal conditions of crops. It is revealed that the proposed
    system would be able to improve the productivity and quality of crop. A review
    on infrastructure of WSNs for precision agriculture is presented in [18]. Further,
    in this work, a hybrid WSN model based on terrestrial WSNs and underground sensor
    network for precision agriculture is proposed. The objective of the proposed model
    is to reduce the human efforts for collecting agricultural information. It is
    seen that the proposed model provides information regarding agriculture fields
    more efficiently and accurately than existing sensor networks. To address approximate
    inference problem in agriculture field, Abouzar et al. proposed RSSI (received
    signal strength indicator) based-distributed Bayesian localization algorithm for
    message passing [19]. The proposed algorithm avoids communication overhead and
    minimizes computational complexity. El-kader et al. [20] proposed a precision
    farming solution model for potato crop [20]. In the proposed model, soil testing
    of land is done through sensor nodes whether the land is suitable for cultivation
    or not. This model also provides the facilities of better irrigation and fertilization
    scheduling to reduce natural resources. Further, it is noticed that APTEEN protocol
    is adopted for better routing paths. To monitor the parameters of soil, Georgieva
    et al. [21] designed a WSNs based monitoring model. The proposed monitoring model
    computes the different parameters of soil like temperature, humidity, conductivity
    and amount of acid. The arduino platform is used to integrate the different components
    of the proposed monitoring model. For providing better and qualitative connectivity
    and coverage of sensors in agriculture field, Kaiwartya et al. [22] designed a
    system for multi-metric quality measurement for deployed sensor nodes. In this
    work, seven metrics are designed for the sensor deployment and the optimal connectivity
    between the sensor nodes is measured. Lam et al. [23] developed a wireless sensor
    module for rural monitoring and precision agriculture applications. In their work,
    specification like received signal strength indicator (RSSI), packet reception
    ratio (PRR) of wireless sensor module was tested as compared with commercial products.
    The designed modules have capability to give optimal solution for real-world applications.
    Further, it can provide better applications for precision agriculture like reduce
    energy consumption of nodes, prediction of pest or disease and improved quality
    of crops. For better coverage of agriculture field, An et al. [24] proposed an
    effective technique for sensor deployment based on field information coverage.
    In this work, two polynomial-time algorithms are presented. The work of the first
    algorithm is to find the location of deployed sensors. Whereas, second is to identify
    the locations of relay nodes with minimum number of relay nodes in between source
    to destination. It is seen that the good trade-off between sensor nodes is obtained.
    To fruit recognition and disease detection, Lee et al. [25] designed a sensing
    system integrated with yield mapping system, sensors for detecting disease, devris
    detectors, an N detector for precision agriculture using ground and aerial based
    platforms. The proposed sensing system can measure the soil phosphorus detection,
    detection of nutrient in soil and grain insect detection with the help of NIR
    and RAMAN spectroscopy. To monitor the frost in vineyard, Valente et al. [26]
    proposed a collaborative system based on WSNs and robot. The aerial robot can
    be worked as dynamic node and it can be responsible for communication between
    agriculture field and base station. Further, in this work, UAV and WSN are combined
    for surveying fragmented crop fields. Zhang et al. [27] designed a remote monitoring
    system based on WSNs for collecting agricultural information. This monitoring
    system is based on ZigBee and GPRS wireless communication technologies. The agriculture
    data is collected through CC2430. The ARM9 processors are adopted to design base
    station. The proposed system is more feasible than other existing systems in terms
    of feasibility and it also conserve water content in agriculture field efficiently.
    Li et al. [28] proposed a monitoring system based on WSNs for greenhouse. The
    proposed system includes cluster of sensor nodes, base station and data centre.
    The JN5139 micro-processor is used for designing wireless nodes and further, ZigBee
    protocol is used for communication purpose. The proposed monitoring system is
    a low-cost, expandable and reliable model with better processing capability. Park
    el al. [29] designed an environmental monitoring system to prevent dew condensation
    in greenhouse. The proposed environmental system integrates the Bahrenburg formula
    to compute the dew point of leaves. Further, the dew condensation is prevented
    on the surface of crops which to prevent diseases infection. To monitors the environmental
    parameters, Carrascosa et al. [30] proposed an open source based hardware model
    for precision agriculture. The proposed model contains two main components i.e.
    hardware and software. The hardware component of the model is responsible to record
    environmental parameters, whereas, software component connect the device with
    data server. The characteristics of open source hardware model are low acquisition
    cost and less complexity for customization. Table 2 summarizes the work reported
    on monitoring of different crops. Table 2 Depicts the work reported on crop monitoring
    Full size table 2.2 Irrigation Management This subsection presents the literature
    works on irrigation management for the crops. To optimize the water content in
    agriculture field, Gutierrez et al. [31] proposed an automated irrigation system
    based on WSNs. The proposed irrigation system comprises of distributed wireless
    network of soil-moisture and temperature sensors. It is seen that the proposed
    system is feasible, cost effective and also reduce the amount of water content
    needed to the crops. To address the drought and tolerance issues of crops, Levy
    et al. [32] developed a method for irrigation management and enhancement of tolerance
    for the crops. It is observed that lack of water, drought, heat and salinity can
    affect the production of the crop. With the help of proposed method, all these
    factors are analyzed and it is concluded that required amount of the water is
    supplied through the proposed system to the crops. Further, it is noticed that
    micro-irrigation and drip irrigation systems helps farmer to conserve water. To
    measure the soil variability, Hedle et al. [33] adopted spatio-temporal modelling
    with high spatial resolution electromagnetic and digital elevation method data
    layers for quantify the variability of soil. Wireless sensor network with high
    temporal resolution dataset is used to mould the vibrant nature of soil moisture.
    The proposed approach is more accurate than a multiple linear regression modelling
    because it helps in providing best implementation of a variable rate irrigation
    system. For efficient use of irrigation system, Hellin et al. [34] developed an
    irrigation architecture based on WSNs for agriculture field. The proposed architecture
    helps in describing the design, optimization and development of an application
    to reduce the wastage of water. Sensor nodes which were deploy in fields are of
    good use they helps in reaching the required moisture condition to maintain water
    electrical conductivity level of the irrigation system at desired value through
    which there is a efficient management of water resources in agriculture field.
    To optimize agricultural irrigation, Nolz et al. [35] developed an irrigation
    model for monitoring the status of water in soil. In this work, two types of sensors
    are applied for measuring the potential of water in soil. These sensors are deployed
    under thin layer of soil to evaluate the status of water. It is noticed that the
    proposed irrigation model reduce the necessity of water to the crops effectively.
    A decision support system is developed for effective irrigation management in
    [36]. The proposed system comprises of sensor nodes, actuation network and fuzzy
    logic. The proposed method can reduce the wastage of water using fuzzy logic and
    actuation network. Further, it is observed that productivity of crop can be increased
    using this decision support system. Kim et al. [37] proposed an efficient water
    management system based on WSNs. In this work, the conventional irrigation system
    is replaced through an electronically controllable system for better irrigation
    management in agricultural fields. The proposed water management system is continuously
    monitored using GPS. Zhao et al. [38] designed an irrigation system based on soil
    water content and temporal stability. Further, in this work, water content and
    temporal stability is compared using VRI and URI to identify the location for
    deploying soil water sensors. In this work, temporal stability of soil moisture
    is evaluated regularly. It is seen that proposed irrigation system changes the
    overall similarity of soil moisture spatial patterns. It is also noticed that
    consumption of water is significantly reduced. To investigate the efficiency of
    linear move installed irrigation system, Chavez et al. [39] proposed a method
    for remote irrigation monitoring and control system (RIMCS). The proposed RIMCS
    system contains the pulsing nozzles and solenoids. The proposed system is also
    capable to vary the water rate. It is claimed that the proposed systems can monitor
    the flow of water, pressure of water, location and agriculture field. To control
    the irrigation in agriculture field, Maurya et al. [40] proposed a novel approach
    based on sensor technology. The sensor nodes are continuously sense soil temperature,
    moisture and humidity in agricultural field and transmits this information to
    base station. Further, in this work, region-based static clustering approach is
    used to provide efficient coverage over entire agricultural field. The proposed
    clustering approach uses the fuzzy logic technique to select best cluster head.
    This energy-efficient protocol is also compared with existing protocol like EEHC,
    DEEC, DDEEC and RBHR. To precisely monitor environmental conditions Sawant et
    al. [41] proposed a system. The proposed system helps in addresses the issues
    like standardized way of data discovery, access and sharing of data across various
    distributed sensor networks through the adaptation of a framework based on OGC
    standards for sensor SWE. The proposed system is a cost-effective, standardized
    sensing system which includes functionalities like sensor plug-n-play, remote
    monitoring, tools for crop water req. Estimation and nutrient management. A WSNs
    based irrigation software system is presented in [42]. The proposed system is
    named as WISC. The designed system provides real time monitoring of fields and
    remotes access to in-field information through WSN for irrigation purpose. For
    the proper irrigation in agriculture field, Coates et al. [43] proposed an irrigation
    model based on WSNs with valve control. The proposed model can sense the agriculture
    field for irrigation as well as also control the flow of water. Hence, in this
    work, manual control of irrigation valves is replaced through automatic control.
    To automate the irrigation process, Nikolidakis et al. [44] proposed an algorithm
    with collaboration of integrated system. This algorithm consists of advanced routing
    scheme i.e., ECHERP and provides efficient utilization of energy required for
    sensor motes. Nagarajan et al. [45] designed a sensor mote for sprinkler irrigation
    automation system. In the proposed work, humidity, temperature and PH sensors
    are used to control the water content of the agriculture field. The ZigBee communication
    technology is used for data transformation. Further, the GPRS system is adopted
    for data analyses and storing purpose. The proposed system is capable to perform
    real time monitoring and control water supply. An adaptable decision support system
    is proposed by Goumopoulos et al. [46]. The proposed system integrates sensors
    for monitoring soil, crop and climate in agriculture field. Further, this system
    is implemented in autonomous closed loop zone specific irrigation. This system
    is more effective in terms of agronomic performance as compared to traditional
    agricultural practices. Kim et al. [47] proposed a novel water monitoring system
    for reducing depletion of water resources. It is reported that fine-grained consumption
    of water resources can help farmers to pinpoint waste, and improve efficiency.
    The proposed water monitoring system can conserve the natural resources and also
    to reduce the amount of water needed by a crop. Masseroni et al. [48] designed
    a system for soil water monitoring and irrigation management. The proposed system
    is implemented using Arduino based open-hardware device. This system continuously
    measures the water level in the soil, especially in the root area. Further, this
    information is used to decide the irrigation timings. The proposed system reduces
    the water consumption significantly. An IOT based smart irrigation idea is presented
    in [49]. This irrigation system comprises of environmental sensors, web services
    and IOT devices. The proposal has deployed sampling algorithm successfully which
    will provide constraints for the sensor network. A model driven control strategy
    for irrigation in agriculture field is presented [50]. The aim of the proposed
    strategy is to provide right amount of water at right place in an agriculture
    field. Further, a predictive algorithm is incorporated in the proposed strategy
    for measuring the moisture content in soil. Table 3 presents the work reported
    in literature on different irrigation management system for precision agriculture.
    Table 3 Illustrates the work reported on irrigation system for achieving precision
    agriculture Full size table 2.3 Environmental Parameters This subsection describes
    the recent study reported on various environmental parameters like humidity, temperature,
    soil condition etc., to achieve precision agriculture. Rossel et al. [51] developed
    a soil sensing technique based on characterization of soil and environmental conditions.
    The objective of this technique is to improve the production of the crop and further,
    to reduce the environmental effects on crop. This technique measures and monitors
    the soil physical and biochemical attributes for better productivity. To compute
    and plot the spatial variability of soil, Bernardi et al. [52] developed a decision
    tool based on soil properties, yield and liming. The aim of this tool is to compute
    the fertilizer need and economic return of an alfalfa pasture. The vesper software
    is adopted to measure the spatial variability of soil and site-specific liming
    and fertilizer needed. Further, the information of fertility of soil is computed
    using spring software. It is revealed that it is an effective tool for mapping
    and evaluating the spatial variability of soil. Kuang et al. [53] developed a
    NIR spectroscopy based calibration model to acquire soil spectra in diffuse reflectance
    mode. This model is adopted to examine the different spiking strategies and spiking
    ratios. The effectiveness of the proposed model is evaluated using 425 sample
    of soil. The results stated that the proposed model provides more correct and
    accurate information regarding soil OC, TN and MC. To measure the electrical conductivity
    of soil, Parrilla et al. [54] designed a system using electromagnetic induction
    (EMI) based apparent electrical conductivity technique for olive orchards. In
    this work, both wet and dry soil conditions are taken into consideration. Further,
    it is seen that to check the efficiency of proposed model, forty-eight soil samples
    are tested for soil texture and soil water content. It is stated that in both
    situation (wet and dry soil), proposed model gives the same information. The spatial
    variation of soil phosphorus(p), magnesium(mg), potassium(k) have been investigated
    using geostatistics, conventional statistics and a geographical information system
    in [55]. In this study, total five hundred thirty-seven soil samples are collected
    for this experiment. It is observed that this model provides useful information
    for agronomic and environmental management for crops. To design a low water cost
    WSNs, Bogena et al. [56] have tested the applicability of different water sensors
    like EC-5, EC-20 and TDR for measuring soil water content. The experiment is performed
    both in laboratory and field. It is seen that in laboratory, the performance of
    the water sensors are almost same. But, in field, there is significant difference
    between the performances of the different water sensors. Authors claimed that
    EC-5 water sensor gives better accurate results among all other sensors and it
    is best suitable sensor to design low water cost WSNs. To measure the climate
    change mitigation strategies for ecosystem and agriculture, Knadel et al. [57]
    presented a study on the self organic carbon parameter. In this study, two different
    agriculture fields are taken into consideration and mapped using Veris mobile
    sensor platform. Further, fuzzy clustering is applied to obtain different field
    of spectra. The objective of this study is to identify either a single sensor
    or fusion of sensors can provide best predictive accuracy for SOC parameters.
    It is seen that the fusion of sensors is obtained best predictive accuracy for
    SOC parameter. Further, it is observed that low cost robust calibration model
    can be developed on the basis of Vires mobile platform. A soil property monitoring
    system based on WSNs is presented in [58]. The proposed system is deployed in
    the wheat field to measure the soil properties. It is seen that proposed system
    provides more than 95% real time information of soil parameters. Ritsema et al.
    [59] developed a stand-alone wireless embed network system for continuous monitoring
    of water contents at different depths. Further, this system is associated with
    web application to display the real time results for end users. To monitor the
    soil moisture dynamics from top depth, Majone et al. [60] presented a multi hop
    WSNs based monitoring system for orchards. In this work, sensors are deployed
    on different depth level i.e. 10, 20, 30, 50 and 80 cm. The proposed system is
    based on independent sensors that can provide both real time and historic data.
    It is revealed that distribution of soil moisture can affect the production of
    orchards. To find the low cost sensor and better frequency range for measuring
    moisture content, electrical conductivity and temperature of soil, Kizito et al.
    [61] evaluated ECH2O sensors family in the range of 5–150 MHz frequencies. The
    results concluded that ECH2O-TE sensor gives the better results at 70 MHz. The
    relationship and precision between volumetric soil water content and volumetric
    soil water content sensed are determined through four commercial soil moisture
    sensor systems in [62]. It is revealed that only the IM and RB systems are identified
    the high corelation between volumetric soil water content and volumetric soil
    water content sensed. Brocca et al. [63] assessed the reliability of soil moisture
    estimations through ASCAT and AMSR-E sensors. In their work, fourteen different
    sites of four different countries is taken into consideration. It is stated that
    AMSR-E sensor provides the high correlation between the observed and modelled
    data using LPRM algorithm. A review on the soil properties using remote sensing
    technique is presented in [64]. To characterize the underground wireless network
    and the basic problems for better communication in agricultural field, Vuran et
    al. [65] derived advance channel models. The proposed model helps in analyzing
    bit error rate for two different networks. The results obtain from field measurements
    used in evaluating parameters of soil and the effects of variation in moisture
    of soil. To measure the temperature of agriculture field, Badia-melis et al. [66]
    evaluate the behaviour of various sensors under the three temperature ranges that
    are 5 °C, 23 °C and 35 °C. Three wireless sensor network devices with different
    sensors are compared with four RIFD tags to get the information of behaviour of
    various sensors. Two alternative methods were used to adjust experimental data.
    For monitoring and modelling temperature variations inside silage stacks, Green
    et al. [67] designed a wireless mote which is deployed at different location.
    The proposed system helps in detection of temperature variation during decomposition
    of silage. To obtain real time information about environmental parameters of greenhouse,
    Jahnavi et al. [68] developed a smart wireless system. The designed system helps
    in giving optimal use of resources and water required for cultivation of crops.
    Microcontroller in designed system helps in transmitting and receiving data from
    sensor nodes to gateway node. Users can get real time information of greenhouse
    through web application where data is transmitted through gateway node. To control
    the eexchange of water and energy of heat between the agricultural field and atmosphere,
    Jackson et al. [69] designed a temperature and moisture sensor. The developed
    sensors are composed of micro machined MEMS cantilever beams which are equipped
    with water sensitive sensors. The variation in resistance of the sensor due to
    moisture depends on the cantilever beam thickness. For measuring temperature of
    agricultural field, Martinez et al. [70] proposed a cost-effective system named
    as LITAS. The designed system evaluates infrared thermometry and thermal imaging
    which supervised water stress level of the plant. The LITAS system tested in the
    field of sugar beet and the measurements of LITAS were compared to canopy temperature(TC)
    which is obtain from thermal images. Pierce et al. [71] deployed a two WSNs for
    agricultural process, one wireless sensor network is designed for regional-scale
    applications, such as weather stations and the second network is designed for
    on-farm applications such as monitoring of temperature for protecting agricultural
    field from frost. To monitor physiological condition of plants, Mahan et al. [72]
    proposed a smart cop IRT. The designed system is cost effective which can be easily
    deployed in large areas and helps in providing wireless operations that are more
    appropriate in various research and applications. To monitor climatic conditions
    such as temperature, humidity and amount of soil moisture. In agricultural field
    Mendez et al. [73] designed a Wi-Fi based network which is capable to intelligently
    monitor the condition of agricultural field in a designed manner. Table 4 summarizes
    the work reported on enviromental parameters to achieve precision agricluture.

    agriculture Full size table 3 WSNs Technologies in Precision Agriculture 3.1 Communication
    Technologies In wireless sensor communication various technologies are used to
    transmit the data from agriculture field to central point. The specification of
    these technologies is described in Table 5. Whereas, the WSNs communication technologies
    used in PA is given in Table 6. Table 5 Available communication technologies with
    specification for precision agriculture Full size table Table 6 Communication
    technology reported for precision agriculture in literature Full size table 1.
    ZigBee—ZigBee is low-cost, low-rate, and less-power consumer device as compared
    with other wireless technologies that helps in secure and efficient transmission
    of data from source to destination. By applying a wireless sensor network based
    on ZigBee to an agriculture field data regarding to the conditions of field is
    properly transmitted to the user at high data transmission rate [74]. 2. Bluetooth—Bluetooth
    is a small range, low-power consuming device for wireless sensor network which
    helps in transmit data from one user to other in a range of 100 meters. It operates
    on the frequency band of 2.4 GHz [75]. 3. Wi-Fi—wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) is IEEE
    standard 802.11b for wireless local area network which is operated in frequency
    band of 2.4 GHz deploy in a distributed way to cover the range of hundred meters.
    Wi-Fi is the most successful technology of wireless sensor networks few years
    ago Wi-Fi was only available on laptops but now a day’s Wi-Fi is easily available
    in cell phones, cameras, TV etc. [76]. 4. GPRS—general packet radio service (GPRS)
    provides fast speed of data transmission to the users. It uses the frequency range
    of 2.4 GHz. GPRS provides faster and long distance connection for data transmission.
    Range of GPRS is spread up to kilometres according to the coverage area of GPRS
    [77]. 5. WiMAX—worldwide inter-operability for microwave access (WiMAX) is an
    IEEE 802.16e standard used for a long distance communication technology. With
    the integration of WiMAX technology, the capacity of network can be raised up
    to 70 mbps [78]. 3.2 Sensors Used in PA Sensors provide huge contribution in various
    applications. In agriculture, sensors plays vital role for measuring various parameters
    of agricultural field. Tables 7, 8 show the different sensors that are used for
    precision agriculture. These tables also provide the details of temperature range
    and other capabilities of the sensors. Further, Table 9 illustrates the different
    sensor reported in the literature to monitor and measure the different parameters
    for achieving precision agriculture. Table 10 shows the list of different crops
    which are tested for precision agriculture using WSNs technology. Table 7 Sensor
    used for measuring parameters of PA Full size table Table 8 Sensors used for measuring
    weather conditions Full size table Table 9 List of sensor reported for precision
    agriculture in literature work Full size table Table 10 List of crops reported
    for precision agriculture in literature work Full size table 4 Conclusion In this
    study, the adaptability of the WSN is explored in the field of precision agriculture.
    It is observed that there is the incremental growth to adopt the WSN in PA and
    having wide range of the applicability. It is reported that WSNs are widely used
    to monitor agricultural fields, optimize irrigation for the crops, measure temperature
    and soil properties. In this paper, seventy-eight articles are studied and arranged
    these articles into three different categories i.e. monitoring of the crops, irrigation
    management and environmental parameters management. Further, this review also
    discusses the different communication technologies of WSNs available for precision
    agriculture in literature. A list of different sensor used in PA is also given.
    The major contribution of this literature to scientific community is given below.
    RQ1) From literature, it is seen that number of techniques/tools are designed
    by various researchers for PA using WSNs. These tools are IMOTE2, Arduino, EZ430-RF2500,
    MDA300 sensor board, EZ43-RF2500, MDA300, Indriya, MICAZ, ZKOS, MSP430, PIC16F877,
    CVX toolbox, MOSEK, Veris mobile sensor platform, MDA320, MTS400. These tools
    integrate the different sensors on it and collect the information regarding various
    parameters of PA and this information is used for decision making. It is observed
    that Arduino platform is widely adopted as a platform to integrate different sensors
    due to low cost and ease to embed. It is also seen that some algorithms are also
    developed for effective monitoring and smart irrigation of crops. These algorithms
    include OASNDFA, DCTA, BOP, LAA, distributed localization algorithm, range based
    localization algorithms, polynomial-time algorithms for deployment of nodes, electromagnetic
    induction algorithm, MLR, PCR and PLSR methods. Some of new communication protocols
    are also reported in few research articles like APTEEN protocol, Fuzzy based energy
    efficient protocol, ECHERP. It is also revealed that the Tiny OS and Tiny OS 2.0
    are taken as operating system for sensors. RQ2) In precision agriculture, large
    numbers of sensors are adopted for collecting the real time information about
    the growth of crops as well as different environmental parameters like humidity,
    temperature, soil moisture etc. All these information is collected through randomly
    deployed sensor nodes. Further, this information is collected on a central point
    for processing purpose. The processed information is used in decision making and
    action is taken according the processed information. Table 9 shows the list of
    different sensors reported in literature. This table also illustrates the significance
    of each sensor and citation details of these sensors are also given. The working
    of few sensors is discussed as Sensor s8000 measures the PH parameter, HYDRA-PROBE
    II sensor measure conductivity, salinity, soil moisture, and temperature values.
    EC-10HS measure the moisture of soil, EC-5 sensor for measuring soil moisture,
    SHT-11 sensor for measuring temperature and humidity, N-sensor for measuring the
    requirement of nitrogen to the crop, VH400 is a soil-moisture sensor which measure
    the amount of moisture present in soil, DS1822 sensor is used to measure the temperature,
    SEN-13322 sensors measure the volumetric content of water in the soil. It is found
    that PA cannot achieve without the help of these sensors. Table 8 illustrates
    the list of sensors used for measuring weather conditions. It is seen that in
    PA, most of works is reported on measuring the soil parameters. RQ3) Large numbers
    of crops are taken into consideration in literature to validate the applicability
    of the WSNs in agriculture. The aim to adopt the WSNs in agriculture is to monitor
    the crops, irrigation management and measure the different environmental parameters
    which are responsible for the growth and improved quality of the crops. Table
    10 demonstrates the list of crops which are considered for experimentation. It
    is found that eighteen different crops are taken by researchers to investigate
    the role of WSNs in agriculture. These crops include broccoli crop, cotton plant,
    orange orchards, orchid greenhouses, vinyl greenhouse, sugarcane field, grape
    farms, pepper vegetable greenhouse, potato crop, citrus and blueberry crop, maize
    field, wheat, peach orchards and many more. Further, it is observed that WSNs
    is widely used to monitor the growth of crops in green houses. RQ4) From literature,
    it is seen that five communication technologies are adopted in WSNs for PA. These
    communication technologies are described in Table 5. These are Bluetooth, ZigBee,
    Wi-Fi, GPRS/GSM and WiMAX. Out of these five techniques, only four techniques
    are used. Presently, WiMAX communication technology is not adopted in PA till
    date due to high cost and large size. Table 6 shows the various communication
    technologies cited in different research articles. It is concluded that most of
    researchers works with the ZigBee communication technology due to high transmission
    range and low cost and cited in twenty-seven research articles. The second most
    valuable communication technology is GSM/GPRS and it is cited in sixteen research
    articles. Apart from these, several points can be highlighted from this study.
    Seventy-eight SCI listed research articles are included in this study from thirty-five
    different journals. In PA, lot of works are reported on measuring soil parameters
    including soil moisture, PH value, soil temperature etc., for improving quality
    of crops. For effective monitoring and irrigation management, some algorithms
    are also presented by various researchers in the field of PA. Tiny OS and Tiny
    OS 2.0 are adopted as operating system for sensor nodes due to low complexity.
    It is noted that Arduino platform is widely adopted to integrate the different
    component of WSNs in PA. In PA, some work is also reported on communication protocols.
    Some of new communication protocols are developed for effective communication
    between different components of WSNs. This review also lightens on the communication
    technologies adopted in WSNs for PA. It is found that till date only four communication
    technologies is used. It is seen that widely adopted communication technology
    is ZigBee. A lot of crops have been investigated by using WSNs for precision agriculture.
    It is observed that vineyard crop is examined multiple times. EC-5 senor is widely
    used for measuring the soil moisture. Some works are also presented on the deployment
    of sensor nodes in agriculture filed. In few research articles, automatic irrigation
    model is also proposed and these models also reduce the human effort. Few of articles
    are reported on intrusion detection in the agriculture field. Hence, there is
    a scope of work in this direction. Lack of work is reported on the usability of
    fertilizers in the agriculture field. Abbreviations APTEEN: Adaptive periodic

    Abstract: This paper discusses the emerging need for vertical farms by examining
    issues related to

    food security, urban population growth, farmland shortages, “food miles”, and
    associated greenhouse

    gas (GHG) emissions. Urban planners and agricultural leaders have argued that
    cities will need to

    produce food internally to respond to demand by increasing population and to avoid
    paralyzing

    congestion, harmful pollution, and unaffordable food prices. The paper examines
    urban agriculture

    as a solution to these problems by merging food production and consumption in
    one place, with the

    vertical farm being suitable for urban areas where available land is limited and
    expensive. Luckily,

    recent advances in greenhouse technologies such as hydroponics, aeroponics, and
    aquaponics

    have provided a promising future to the vertical farm concept. These high-tech
    systems represent

    a paradigm shift in farming and food production and offer suitable and efﬁcient
    methods for city

    farming by minimizing maintenance and maximizing yield. Upon reviewing these technologies
    and

    examining project prototypes, we ﬁnd that these efforts may plant the seeds for
    the realization of

    the vertical farm. The paper, however, closes by speculating about the consequences,
    advantages,

    and disadvantages of the vertical farm’s implementation. Economic feasibility,
    codes, regulations,

    and a lack of expertise remain major obstacles in the path to implementing the
    vertical farm.

    Keywords: advanced cultivation methods; innovative technologies; efﬁcient food
    production; urban

    population increase; sustainability

    1. Introduction

    1.1. Background

    This research stems from a larger research project that examined vertical density
    applications to

    the 21st Century City [1–3]. As cities try to cope with rapid population growth—adding
    2.5 billion

    dwellers by 2050—and grapple with destructive sprawl, politicians, planners and
    architects have

    become increasingly interested in the vertical city paradigm. Unfortunately, cities
    all over the world

    are grossly unprepared for embracing vertical density, because it may aggravate
    multidimensional

    sustainability challenges resulting in a “vertical sprawl” that could have worse
    consequences than

    “horizontal” sprawl. One key problem of future cities will be transporting large
    amount of food to

    serve dense population, and the vertical farm model offers a potential solution
    to this problem [1–5].

    1.2. Goals and Scope of the Study

    As urban population continues to grow and as arable land is diminishing rapidly
    across the

    globe, a fundamental change in food production is needed [4–7]. In particular,
    building-based

    urban agriculture is increasingly needed in dense urban environments and a review
    of current

    cultivation techniques and projects would likely to contribute positively to academic
    discussions [6–10].

    This is particularly important since vertical farming engages multiple disciplines
    of natural sciences,

    architecture, and engineering and affects both people and the environment [9–11].
    This paper attempts

    to answer the following questions:

    •

    What is a vertical farm?

    •

    What are the driving forces for building it?

    •

    What are the involved high-tech farming methods?

    •

    What are the salient project examples on vertical farming?

    •

    What are the implications for the vertical city?

    1.3. Methods

    Currently, we witness a growing body of research on vertical farming. Studies
    and updates on

    the topic come in multiple forms including academic papers, professional reports,
    news articles, blogs,

    and websites, as demonstrated in this paper references. This paper pieces together
    these materials in

    attempt to answer the above questions. It examines a wide-range of literatures
    related to agronomy,

    urban agriculture, vertical farming, and rooftop farming. It also reviews involved
    technologies, current

    cultivation techniques, business models, and analyzes research projects.

    This study evolved from anecdotal observations to systematic examination of involved

    technologies, actual and visionary projects of vertical farming. In the preliminary
    stage, surﬁng

    the Internet (website, blogs, movie clips) excited and fueled the research by
    informing about recent

    projects that utilize advanced technology. This sparked systematic examination
    of generic (secondary)

    and specialized (primary) literatures on vertical farming by using various online
    search engines and

    databases including Scopus, ProQuest, and Google Scholar. Researchers collected
    over 100 sources.

    These sources comprised 42% peer-reviewed academic journal articles, 28% books
    and book chapters,

    6% theses, 9% conference papers, and 15% websites. Most of the reviewed literature
    is relatively recent,

    dating 2010–2017. The reviewed projects come mainly from North America, Europe,
    and Asia.

    Overall, this study adopts a qualitative informative approach. The paper gathers
    complex

    technical information and makes them accessible to the non-specialists. Collectively,
    by reviewing,

    organizing, and collating information of various sources, the paper hopes to provide
    a better

    understanding of the theory and practice of vertical farming.

    1.4. What Is a Vertical Farm?

    Vertical farming seeks to ensure the sustainability of our cities proactively
    by addressing food

    security to the world’s ever-increasing urban population [4–8]. In principle,
    it is a simple concept;

    farm up rather than out [8–10]. The body of literature on the subject distinguishes
    between three

    types of vertical farming [9–11]. The ﬁrst type refers to the construction of
    tall structures with several

    levels of growing beds, often lined with artiﬁcial lights. This often modestly
    sized urban farm has

    been springing up around the world. Many cities have implemented this model in
    new and old

    buildings, including warehouses that owners repurposed for agricultural activities
    [8]. The second

    type of vertical farming takes place on the rooftops of old and new buildings,
    atop commercial and

    residential structures as well as on restaurants and grocery stores [9,10]. The
    third type of vertical farm

    is that of the visionary, multi-story building. In the past decade, we have seen
    an increasing number

    of serious visionary proposals of this type. However, none has been built. It
    is important, however,

    to note the connection between these three types, the success of modestly sized
    vertical farm projects

    and the maturation of their technologies will likely pave the way for the skyscraper
    farm [9].

    Environmentalists, urban farmers, architects, agronomists, and public health experts,
    among

    others, have been joining this mini revolution as they partner to work out a way
    to salvage a food-scarce,

    ultra-urbanized future. A wide number of technology experts have converged on
    the concept of vertical

    farming, advancing the ﬁelds of robotics, aeroponics, aquaponics, and hydroponics.
    Nonproﬁts

    organizations, aiming to promote environmentalism and local economic prosperity,
    have been backing

    the vertical farm concept. Similarly, for-proﬁt ventures that seek to meet the
    demand for local

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    3 of 36

    produce have supported this concept. Further, governments looking for ways to
    boost domestic

    food security have been funding these endeavors. Numerous countries including
    Korea, Japan, China,

    Germany, the United Arab Emirates, China, France, India, Sweden, Singapore, and
    the United States,

    have convened to discuss vertical farming. They have repeatedly endorsed the concept
    as integral to

    the long-term sustainability of their cities [9].

    The idea of vertical farming is not entirely new. Examples of it can be found
    dating back to the

    ancient era in the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, one of Philon’s Seven Wonders of
    the Ancient World,

    built around 600 BC. In 1915, Gilbert Ellis Bailey coined the term “vertical farming”
    and wrote a book

    titled “Vertical Farming”. He argued that farming hydroponically in a controlled
    vertical environment

    would provide economic and environmental beneﬁts. In the early 1930s, William
    Frederick Gericke

    pioneered hydroponics at the University of California at Berkley. In the 1980s,
    Åke Olsson, a Swedish

    ecological farmer, also proposed vertical farming as a means for producing vegetables
    in cities. He is

    known for having invented a spiral-shaped rail system for growing plants [4–9].
    Around the turn of

    the century, Dickson Despommier, an American ecologist, and professor of public
    health, passionately

    revived the concept of vertical farming. He described the vertical farm as “the
    mass cultivation of

    plant and animal life for commercial purposes in skyscrapers. Using advanced greenhouse
    technology

    such as hydroponics and aeroponics, the vertical farm could theoretically produce
    ﬁsh, poultry, fruit,

    and vegetables” [7] (p. 15). The vertical farm is considered to promote sustainable
    agricultural practices

    more than that by conventional farming, which refers to large scale, outdoor agriculture
    that embraces

    systems that engage heavy irrigation, intensive tillage and excessive use of fertilizers,
    pesticides,

    and herbicides [5] (p. 16).

    1.5. Why Vertical Farms?

    1.5.1. Food Security

    Food security has become an increasingly important issue. Demographers anticipate
    that urban

    population will dramatically increase in the coming decades. At the same time,
    land specialists (e.g.,

    agronomists, ecologists, and geologists) warn of rising shortages of farmland
    [4–6]. For these reasons,

    food demand could exponentially surpass supply, leading to global famine. The
    United Nation (UN)

    estimates that the world’s population will increase by 40%, exceeding 9 billion
    people by the year

    2050 [12]. The UN also projects that 80% of the world’s population will reside
    in cities by this time.

    Further, it predicts that by 2050 we will need 70% more food to meet the demands
    of 3 billion more

    inhabitants worldwide [12]. Food prices have already skyrocketed in the past decades,
    and farmers

    predict that prices will increase further as oil costs increase and water, energy,
    and agricultural resources

    diminish [7–10]. The sprawling fringes of suburban development continue to eat
    up more and more

    farmland. On the other hand, urban agriculture has been facing problems due to
    land scarcity and high

    costs. We desperately need transformative solutions to combat this immense global
    challenge [8–11].

    The logic of vertical farming is simple: produce more food on less land [10,11].
    The same

    rationale that we use to stack homes and ofﬁces in limited and expensive land,
    such as in Hong Kong

    or Manhattan, can apply to farming. Proponents of the vertical farm claim that
    it would create

    compact and self-sufﬁcient ecosystems that cover multiple functions, from food
    production to

    waste management. Vertical farming could enable food production in an efﬁcient
    and sustainable

    manner, save water and energy, enhance the economy, reduce pollution, provide
    new employment

    opportunities, restore ecosystems, and provide access to healthy food. In a controlled
    environment,

    crops will be less subject to the vagaries of climate, infestation, the nutrient
    cycle, crop rotation, polluted

    water runoff, pesticides, and dust [12]. As such, indoor farming could possibly
    offer a healthier

    environment to grow food [5,13]. Since indoor farming operates year-round and
    is independent of

    weather conditions, it could also provide greater yields and perpetual income
    [14]. Furthermore, indoor

    farming provides a low-impact system that can signiﬁcantly reduce travel costs,
    as well as reduce

    GHG emissions, by cutting down on travel distances between distant farms and local
    market [13,15].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    4 of 36

    Also, vertical farming could ignite local economies by providing much needed “green
    collar” jobs to

    urban areas [5,13].

    Importantly, vertical farms could help in addressing the problem of farmland shortages
    [4,5,7].

    According to the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, there was
    0.42 ha (1 ac) of

    arable land per person on earth in 1961. By 2002, because of population growth
    and urbanization,

    that number has dropped by nearly half, to 0.23 ha (0.5 ac) [5]. In 2011, the
    United Nations completed

    a global assessment of the planet’s land resources, determining that a quarter
    of all arable land is highly

    degraded. Further, since 1960, one million farmers in the United States have gave
    up farming [5–19].

    Today, the country suffers from “23 million food deserts, deﬁned by the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture

    (USDA) as urban neighborhoods and rural towns without ready access to fresh, healthy,
    and affordable

    food” [20] (p. 32). Dickson Despommier explains that current agricultural supply
    will soon become

    largely inadequate. That is, on average, every human being needs 1500 calories
    daily, and in order to

    meet such demand, we will need to add to existing agricultural land an area as
    big as Brazil by 2050 [7].

    1.5.2. Climate Change

    Climate change has contributed to the decrease of arable land. Through ﬂooding,
    hurricane,

    storms, and drought, valuable agricultural land has been decreased drastically,
    thereby damaging

    the world economy [7,11,12,18]. For example, due to an extended drought in 2011,
    the United States

    lost a grain crop assessed at $110 billion [11,19,20]. Scientists predict that
    climate change and the

    adverse weather conditions it brings will continue to happen at an increasing
    rate. These events

    will lead to the despoliation of large tracts of arable land, rendering them useless
    for farming. It is

    common for governments to subsidize traditional farming heavily through mechanisms
    such as

    crop insurance from natural causes [6,21,22]. Furthermore, traditional farming
    requires substantial

    quantities of fossil fuels to carry out agricultural activities (e.g., plowing,
    applying fertilizers, seeding,

    weeding, and harvesting), which amounts to over 20% of all gasoline and diesel
    fuel consumption in

    the United States. We need to understand that “food miles” refers to the distance
    crops travel to reach

    centralized urban populations. On average, food travels 1500 miles from the farm
    ﬁeld to the dinner

    table [8,15]. In special circumstances—cold weather, for example—food miles can
    rise drastically as

    stores, restaurants, and hospitals ﬂy produce in from overseas to meet demands.
    On a regular basis,

    over 90% of the food in major U.S. cities is shipped from outside. A 2008 study
    at Carnegie Mellon

    concluded that food delivery is responsible for 0.4 tons of carbon dioxide emissions
    per household

    per year [23,24]. This is especially important given the increasing distance between
    farms and cities

    from global urbanization. Sadly, the resulting greenhouse gas emissions from food
    transport and

    agricultural activities have contributed to climate change (Figure 1).

    1.5.3. Urban Density

    Vertical farming offers advantages over “horizontal” urban farming for the former
    frees land for

    incorporating more urban activities (i.e., housing more people, services, and
    amenities) [7]. Research

    has revealed that designating urban land to farming results in decreased population
    density, which

    leads to longer commutes. “If America replaced just 7.9% of its whopping one billion
    acres of

    crop and pastureland with urban farms, then metropolitan area densities would
    be cut in half” [4]

    (p. 71). Lower density living incurs higher energy use and generates more air
    and water pollution.

    The National Highway Travel Survey (NHTS) indicates, “If we decrease urban density
    by 50%,

    households will purchase an additional 100 gallons of gas per year. The increased
    gas consumption

    resulting from moving a relatively small percentage of farmland into cities would
    generate an extra

    1.77 tons of carbon dioxide per household per year” [23]. Despommier details space
    efﬁciency of

    vertical farms. He suggested that a 30-story building (about 100 m high) with
    a basal area of 2.02 ha

    (5 ac) would be able to produce a crop yield equivalent to 971.2 ha (2400 ac)
    of conventional horizontal

    farming. This means that the production of one high-rise farm would be equivalent
    to 480 conventional

    horizontal farms [24,25].

    the travel of basic ingredients of a strawberry yogurt can (Adapted from [8]).

    1.5.4. Health

    Conventional farming practices often stress proﬁt and commercial gain while paying
    inadequate

    attention to inﬂicted harm on the health of both human and the natural environment
    [7,8,10]. These

    practices repeatedly cause erosion, contaminate soil, and generate excessive water
    waste. Regarding

    human well-being, the World Health Organization has determined that over half
    of the world’s farms

    still use raw animal waste as fertilizer which may attract ﬂies, and may contain
    weed seeds or disease

    that can be transmitted to plants [1]. Consequently, people’s health is adversely
    affected when they

    consume such produce.

    Further, growing crops in a controlled indoor environment would provide the beneﬁt
    of reducing

    the excessive use of pesticide and herbicide, which create polluting agricultural
    runoff [25]. According

    to Renee Cho, “In a contained environment, pests, pathogens, and weeds have a
    much harder time

    inﬁltrating and destroying crops” [25]. When excess fertilizer washes into water
    bodies (e.g., rivers,

    streams, and oceans), a high concentration of nutrients is created (called eutrophication),
    which could

    disturb the ecological equilibrium. For example, eutrophication may accelerate
    the proliferation of

    algae. However, when it dies, microbes consume algae and suck all the oxygen in
    water, resulting in

    dead aquatic zones [8]. “As of 2008, there were 405 dead zones around the world”
    [25].

    Further, indoor vertical farming employs high-tech growing methods that use little
    water

    (about 1/10th of that used in traditional farming) by offering precision irrigation
    and efﬁcient

    scheduling [25,26]. This can have a signiﬁcant ameliorative effect since demands
    on water will

    increase as the urban population grows. Agricultural activities use more than
    two-thirds of the world’s

    fresh water, and farmers are losing the batter for crop water because urban areas
    are expanding and

    consuming more water. The water crisis is likely to become severer as climate
    change causes warmer

    temperatures and proliferates more droughts [25].

    1.5.5. The Ecosystem

    Traditional agriculture has been encroaching upon natural ecosystems for millennia.
    According

    to Dickson Despommier, “Farming has upset more ecological processes than anything
    else—it is the

    most destructive process on earth” [4] (p. 7). In the past half century or so,
    the Brazilian rainforest

    has been severely impacted by agricultural encroachment, with some 1,812,992 km2
    (700,000 mi2) of

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    6 of 36

    hardwood forest being cleared for farmland [4]. Despommier suggested that encroachment
    on these

    ancient ecosystems is furthering climate change. In this way, indoor vertical
    farming can reduce the

    agricultural impact on the world’s ecosystems by restoring biodiversity and reducing
    the negative

    inﬂuences of climate change. If cities employed vertical farms to produce merely
    10% of the ground

    area they consume, this might help to reduce CO2 emissions enough to develop better
    technological

    innovations for improving the condition of the biosphere long-term. By eliminating
    fertilizer runoff,

    coastal and river water could be restored, and ﬁsh stock of wild ﬁsh could increase.
    Wood, et al.

    summarize this point by stating “The best reason to consider converting most food
    production to

    vertical farming is the promise of restoring [the] services and functions [of
    ecosystems]” [26] (p. 110).

    1.5.6. Economics

    Proponents of the vertical farm also argue that it will supply competitive food
    prices [27].

    The rising expense of traditional farming is quickly narrowing the cost gap. For
    example, when

    vertical farms are located strategically in urban areas, it would be possible
    to sell produce directly to

    the consumer, reducing transportation costs by removing the intermediary, which
    can constitute up to

    60% of costs [27]. Vertical farms also utilize advanced technologies and intensive
    farming methods

    that can exponentially increase production. Researchers have been optimizing indoor
    farming by

    calibrating, tuning and adjusting a wide-range of variables including light intensity,
    light color, space

    temperature, crop and root, CO2 contents, soil, water, and air humidity [27–29].
    In addition, vertical

    farming provides an opportunity to support the local economy. Abandoned urban
    buildings can

    be converted into vertical farms to provide healthy food in neighborhoods where
    fresh produce is

    scarce. Additionally, the high-tech environment of indoor farming can make it
    fun to farm. Hence,

    a technology-savvy younger generation has been enticed by the practice, grooming
    a new breed of

    farmers. Further, vertical farming provides impetus in the development of innovative
    agricultural

    technologies. Finally, it could reconnect city dwellers with nature through the
    activity of farming [27].

    2. High-Tech Indoor Farming

    2.1. Farming Methods

    Researchers have advanced myriad methods of urban and vertical farming in the
    hopes of

    contributing to sustainable food production. Advanced farming methods could provide
    greater yields

    and use far less water than traditional farming [17,18]. The design, layout, and
    conﬁguration of these

    high-tech farms would provide optimal light exposure, along with precisely measured
    nutrients for

    each plant. Designed to grow in a controlled, closed-loop environment, these farms
    would eliminate the

    need for harmful herbicides and pesticides, maximizing nutrition, and food value
    in the process. Indoor

    farmers could also “engineer” the taste of produce to cater to people’s preferences
    [30]. Researches

    intend to develop, reﬁne, and adapt these systems so that they can be ultimately
    deployed anywhere

    in the world and provide maximum production and minimum environmental impacts.
    They represent

    a paradigm shift in farming and food production and scholars view them as suitable
    for city farming

    where land availability is limited [5]. These systems (mainly hydroponics, aeroponics,
    and aquaponics)

    and associated technologies are rapidly evolving, diversifying, and improving
    (Table 1). The paper

    explains these systems in a gradual manner, from simple to complex.

    A variant of hydroponics;

    it involves spraying

    or nutrient solutions.

    In addition to beneﬁts

    mentioned above, Aeroponics

    requires less water.

    Aquaponics

    It integrates aquaculture

    (ﬁsh farming) with

    hydroponics.

    Creates symbiotic

    relationships between the

    plants and the ﬁsh; it uses the

    nutrient-rich waste from ﬁsh

    tanks to “fertigate”

    hydroponics production beds;

    and hydroponic bed cleans

    water for ﬁsh habitat.

    2.1.1. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics is a method of growing food using mineral nutrient solutions in water
    without

    soil. Encyclopedia Britannica deﬁnes hydroponics as “the cultivation of plants
    in nutrient-enriched

    water, with or without the mechanical support of an inert medium such as sand
    or gravel” [27]

    (p. 8). The term is derived from the Greek words hydro and ponos, which translates
    to “water doing

    labor” or “water works”. The use of water as a medium for crop growing is not
    totally new, but the

    commercial introduction of hydroponics arose only recently [28]. The National
    Aeronautics and Space

    Administration (NASA) researchers have seen hydroponics as a suitable method for
    growing food in

    outer space. They have been successful in producing vegetables such as onions,
    lettuce, and radishes.

    Overall, researchers have advanced the hydroponic method by making it more productive,
    reliable,

    and water-efﬁcient.

    Currently, the use of hydroponics in industrial agriculture has become widespread,
    providing

    several advantages over traditional soil-based cultivation. One of the primary
    advantages of this

    method is that it could eliminate or at least reduce soil-related cultivation
    problems (i.e., the insects,

    fungus, and bacteria that grow in soil) [28–30].

    The hydroponic method is also relatively

    low-maintenance as well, insofar as weeding, tilling, kneeling and dirt removal
    are non-issues.

    The hydroponic method also provides a less labor-intensive way to manage larger
    areas of

    production [8,31,32]. Furthermore, it may offer a cleaner process given that no
    animal excreta are

    used. Furthermore, the hydroponic method provides an easier way to control nutrient
    levels and pH

    balance. According to Ebba Hedenblad and Marika Olsson, “In soil, many factors,
    such as temperature,

    oxygen level, moisture, and microorganisms, affect how soil-ﬁxed nutrients are
    made accessible to

    plants since the nutrients are being dissolved in water through erosion and mineralization.
    Therefore,

    the hydroponic method may result in more uniform [produce] and better yields,
    as the optimum

    combination of nutrients can be provided to all plants” [30] (p. 17).

    2.1.2. Cylindrical Hydroponic Growing Systems

    The Volksgarden or cylindrical Omega Garden hydroponic growing system is a rotating-system

    technology where plants are placed inside rotary wheels. When wheels spin, plants
    rotate around

    centralized induction lights. The wheels rotate once every 50 min using a low-horsepower
    motor (it is

    possible to run the wheels via wind turbines and solar panels). In advanced rotary
    systems, the “plants

    rotate constantly and slowly around the light source, and their roots pass through
    a nutrient solution

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    8 of 36

    when they reach the bottom of the orbit. Turning at a constant rate allows the
    plants to take advantage

    of orbitotropism (based on the impact of gravity on growth) to grow bigger, stronger
    and faster” [32]

    (pp. 28–29). The Volksgarden system also provides a compact arrangement for the
    plants’ roots in rock

    wool, thereby allowing the plants to grow more quickly than in traditional hydroponics
    [32].

    Importantly, the “Ferris wheels”, can multiply their capacity by adding “extreme
    verticality”,

    i.e., unit stacking. To appreciate the efﬁciency of the system experts have noted,
    “Each cylinder

    holds 80 plants, and six cylinders are stacked together about 20 feet high at
    each station” [32] (p. 28).

    This adds up to 480 units per station requiring only 3.4 m2 (36 ft2) of space.
    Green Spirit Farms plans

    to ﬁt 200 stations compactly in one of its vertical farms to grow 96,000 plants
    per year. For comparison,

    “conventional basil growers average 16,000 plants per acre (43,560 ft2), less
    than 20% of the production

    Green Spirit Farms could have in just 7200 ft2” [32] (p. 28). Furthermore, the
    Volksgarden system

    efﬁciently uses distilled water, requiring one-tenth the water used by traditional
    hydroponic systems.

    “Their distillation process allows multiple reuses of water. Rather than discarding
    the nutrient-dense

    liquid that remains after the produce has been harvested, it can be re-distilled
    and reused” [32] (p. 29).

    Furthermore, the Volksgarden system entails virtually no evaporation because the
    liquid reservoir

    for the growing system is closed. Additional water savings are provided by harnessing
    rainwater,

    collectively minimizing the demand on municipal water systems [32].

    2.1.3. Ultrasonic Foggers

    Scientists have designed ultrasonic fogger systems to minimize maintenance and
    maximize yield.

    They envision using them for myriad horticultural applications, including hydroponics,
    to provide

    multiple beneﬁts such as [33]:

    •

    Supplying upper roots with nutrient enriched fogs that penetrate deep into root
    tissues, keeping

    them moist, well-nourished, and free of decay [16].

    •

    Promoting the growth of minuscule root hairs, which exponentially increase the
    root’s ability to

    absorb water, nutrients, and exchange gases [32].

    •

    Reducing the use of water and nutrients by up to 50% [32].

    •

    Reducing the need for bulky and costly growing mediums [33].

    •

    Efﬁciently using space, as the units are compact and designed to be fed by a remotely
    located

    reservoir [33].

    •

    By integrating ultrasonic foggers, hydroponic systems come close to aeroponic
    systems [33].

    However, there are some concerns that the hydroponic method relies heavily on
    chemicals whereby

    all of the nutrients supplied to the crop are dissolved in water [29]. A hydroponic
    system is based on

    chemical formulations to supply concentrations of mineral elements [30]. Liquid
    hydroponic systems

    utilize ﬂoating rafts and the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), and they largely
    rely on non-circulating

    water culture—though, new recirculation systems can be applied in NFT techniques
    [30]. Further,

    some complain that the produce is tasteless because of all the added chemicals
    in the system and

    because the roots do not get adequate oxygen [30]. These shortcomings are partially
    addressed by the

    aeroponic method.

    2.1.4. Aeroponics

    Aeroponics is a technological leap forward from traditional hydroponics. An aeroponic
    system is

    deﬁned as an enclosed air and water/nutrient ecosystem that fosters rapid plant
    growth with little

    water and direct sun and without soil or media [34]. The major difference between
    hydroponics and

    aeroponic systems is that the former uses water as the growing medium while the
    latter has no growing

    medium. Aeroponics uses mist or nutrient solutions instead of water, so it does
    not require containers

    or trays to hold water. It is an effective and efﬁcient way of growing plants
    for it requires little water

    (requires 95 percent less water than traditional farming methods) and needs minimal
    space [34]. Plant

    boxes can be stacked up in almost any setting, even a basement or warehouse.

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    9 of 36

    The stacking arrangement of plant boxes is structured so that the top and bottom
    of the plants are

    suspended in the air, allowing the crown to grow upward and the roots downward
    freely. Plants are fed

    through a ﬁne mist of nutrient-rich, water-mix solution. Because the system is
    enclosed, the nutrient

    mix is fully recycled, leading to signiﬁcant water savings. This method, therefore,
    is particularly

    suitable in water-scarce regions. An additional advantage of the aeroponic method
    is that it is free of

    fertilizers or pesticides. Furthermore, research has revealed that this high-density
    planting method

    makes harvesting easier and provides higher yields. For example, one of the aeroponic
    experiments

    with tomato in Brooklyn, NY, resulted in quadrupling the crop over a year instead
    of the more common

    one or two crops [34].

    2.1.5. GrowCube

    Recent research and technological development take the aeroponics method to a
    higher level of

    productivity and efﬁciency. For example, GrowCube has proposed a new aeroponic
    prototype through

    the high-tech cube, which contains ﬁve light plastic plates that spin via a rotisserie-esque
    wheel and

    are lit by a strip of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) that provide the necessary
    light for photosynthesis [34].

    At the top of the cube, a device sprays a nutrient-rich mist. The cube and its
    devices are controlled and

    managed via computer and software, and sensors inside the cube communicate with
    the computer to

    optimize the microclimate. The cube is also pressurized and equipped with an ultraviolet
    germicidal

    lamp and a high-efﬁciency particulate absorption (HEPA) ﬁlter, as well as “bug-killing
    ﬁlters in the

    pipes where the nutrient mixes are pumped” [34].

    Consequently, the microclimate inside the cube is bug-free, making its produce
    free of pathogens.

    Remarkably, IT companies are developing special apps and food growing food recipes,
    increasingly

    available online. Consequently, the aeroponics system and the entire growing process
    can be optimized

    remotely [34]. “When it comes time to planting, simply stick your seeds in a growing
    medium . . .

    and download the iOS app. From there, you can select and download a ‘grow recipe’
    from the

    cloud . . . Users are also encouraged to tweak and fork the recipes as they see
    ﬁt, helping to improve

    the growing and to offer variations. So if you want crisper lettuce, you can select
    that as an option” [34].

    Furthermore, by conducting the work autonomously, the computer-controlled environment
    reduces

    human errors and minimizes the effort of growing food [35].

    With such a computerized system, almost anyone could become a sophisticated farmer.
    What

    is more, the computerized system will help to “engineer” taste and other characteristics
    producing

    crispy or spicy produce! GrowCube has managed to produce “herbs, ﬂowers and foodstuffs
    like

    wheatgrass, microgreens, pea-shoots and even 28 heads of lettuce”, and it plans
    to produce fruits

    such as grapes [34]. The prototype is costly and will likely beneﬁt from economies
    of scale when it is

    produced in masses. Consequently, GrowCube plans to expand the project by producing
    hundreds of

    these high-tech cubes [34].

    2.1.6. Solar Aquaculture

    Solar aquaculture involves growing high-quality ﬁsh protein in small, clean, translucent,

    and controllable ponds that are exposed to sunlight. Microscopic green algae (nonﬂowering
    plants

    lacking a true stem, roots, and leaves) live in the pond with the ﬁsh and grow
    by absorbing nutrients

    from the water. In addition, sunlight that strikes the pond helps the algae to
    grow and causes the

    water to become warmer. Fish and algae grow faster in warmer water. This method
    could be suitable

    for vertical farms, enabling higher rates of production in limited spaces. A solar
    pond that is 1.5 m

    high, 1.5 m in diameter (5 ft high, 5 ft diameter) and contains 2649 L (700 gal)
    of water can produce

    an annual growth of 18 kg (40 lb) of ﬁsh [35].

    In addition to supporting ﬁsh, solar ponds can serve indirectly as storage units
    for solar heat.

    Algae capture about ﬁve percent of the entered solar energy while water absorbs
    the rest (95%).

    The pond makes air cooler during the day, given that much of the incoming sunlight
    is stored as warm

    water rather than hot air. In contrast, the pond warms the air at night as it
    releases heat. As such,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    10 of 36

    heat from a solar pond can substitute for heating a greenhouse with gas, oil or
    wood or electricity,

    thereby saving on energy. However, the solar pond requires extensive maintenance
    because of the ﬁsh

    waste and some of the un-eaten food that transforms into waste. These problems
    are addressed by

    closed-loop systems and the aquaponics method.

    2.1.7. Aquaponics

    Aquaponics is a bio-system that integrates recirculated aquaculture (ﬁsh farming)
    with hydroponic

    vegetable, ﬂower, and herb production to create symbiotic relationships between
    the plants and the

    ﬁsh. It achieves this symbiosis through using the nutrient-rich waste from ﬁsh
    tanks to “fertigate”

    hydroponic production beds. In turn, the hydroponic beds also function as bio-ﬁlters
    that remove gases,

    acids, and chemicals, such as ammonia, nitrates, and phosphates, from the water.
    Simultaneously,

    the gravel beds provide habitats for nitrifying bacteria, which augment the nutrient
    cycling and

    ﬁlter water. Consequently, the freshly cleansed water can be recirculated into
    the ﬁsh tanks. In one

    experimental project, aquaponics consisting of wetland pools containing perch
    and tilapia, whose waste

    provided nutrients for greens, solved the principal problems of both hydroponics
    and aquaculture as

    mentioned above [36] (Figure 2).

    Figure 2. Basics of an aquaponic system (Adapted from [19]).

    Researchers envision that the aquaponics system has the potential to become a
    model of

    sustainable food production by achieving the 3Rs (reduce, reuse, and recycle).
    It offers bountiful

    beneﬁts, such as [36]:

    •

    Cleaning water for the ﬁsh habitat;

    •

    Providing organic liquid fertilizers that enable the healthy growth of plants;

    •

    Providing efﬁciency since the waste products of one biological system serves as
    nutrients for

    a second biological system;

    •

    Saving water since water is re-used through biological ﬁltration and recirculation.
    This feature is

    attractive particularly in regions that lack water;

    •

    Reducing, even eliminating, the need for chemicals and artiﬁcial fertilizers;

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    11 of 36

    •

    Resulting in a polyculture that increases biodiversity;

    •

    Supplying locally-grown healthy food since the only fertility input is ﬁsh feed
    and all of the

    nutrients go through a biological process;

    •

    Facilitating the creation of local jobs; and

    •

    Creating an appealing business that supplies two unique products—fresh vegetables
    and

    ﬁsh—from one working unit.

    Consequently, aquaponics is preferable to hydroponics. However, aquaponics systems
    continue

    to be at the experimental stage, having had limited commercialized success. This
    is because the

    technologies necessary to build aquaponics systems are relatively complex, requiring
    the mutual

    dependence of two different agricultural products. For this reason, aquaponics
    also requires intensive

    management [36].

    2.2. Lighting Technologies

    One of the important components of successful vertical farming is sound lighting.
    Available

    LED technologies provide only 28% efﬁciency, an efﬁciency rate that should be
    increased to about

    50–60%, at a minimum, to make indoor farming methods cost-effective [37]. Fortunately,
    experimental

    developments in LEDs have reached that mark [37,38]. Dutch lighting engineers
    at Philips have

    produced LEDs with 68% efﬁciency. Such an increase in lighting efﬁciency will
    dramatically cut costs.

    Also, a Dutch-based group called PlantLab has recently invented a lighting technology
    that could

    help to grow food on a small footprint. According to Michael Levenston, “This
    invention replaces

    sunlight with LEDs that produce the optimal wavelength of light for plant growth.
    Contrary to the

    sun, traditional assimilation lighting, and TL lighting LED only omits one color
    of light. No energy is

    wasted with light spectra that are not used . . . by the plant” [38]. As such,
    the new lighting technology

    provides the correct lighting colors plants need for photosynthesis—blue, red,
    and infrared light.

    Furthermore, new “induction” lighting technology simulates the color spectrum
    of sunlight to

    foster the growth of vegetables and fruits. “The light uses an electro-magnet
    to excite argon gas as

    its light source, instead of a ﬁlament. For this reason, [it] uses much less energy
    and can last up

    to 100,000 hours, twice as long as an LED light” [39]. It also generates more
    heat than LED light,

    but less than an incandescent bulb. Therefore, the lights create enough heat for
    growing plants without

    wasting energy to heat the entire building. Moreover, the light units are calibrated
    to create an “ideal”

    microenvironment by producing high-quality lighting that is similar to daylight.
    These units are also

    long lasting, with a life span of about one decade, and are sold at affordable
    prices.

    2.3. Farming Operation

    Researchers predict that farming operations will be fully automated in the near
    future.

    For example, monitoring systems will be widely implemented (in the form of sensors
    near each

    plant bed) to detect a plant’s need for water, nutrients and other requirements
    for optimal growth and

    development. Sensors can also warn farmers by signaling the presence of harmful
    bacteria, viruses or

    other microorganism that cause disease. Also, a gas chromatograph technology will
    be able to analyze

    ﬂavonoid levels accurately, providing the optimal time for harvesting. These speciﬁc
    technologies are

    not totally new. Their development has been on going and will likely proliferate
    in the near future [39].

    2.4. Farming from Afar

    One of the promising ideas under development is “farming from afar”. The cell
    phone, its software

    and apps, will ultimately handle much of the day-to-day tending of crops, and
    vertical farmers will

    be able to manage multiple farms remotely. New apps will allow farm managers to
    adjust “nutrient

    levels and soil pH balance from a smartphone or tablet, and sound alarms if, say,
    a water pump fails

    on a vertical-growing system . . . So if I’m over in London, where we''re looking
    for a future vertical

    farm site to serve restaurants, I’ll still be able to adjust the process in Michigan
    or Pennsylvania”,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    12 of 36

    as Paul Marks explained [40]. Farming from afar will drastically reduce operational
    costs by reducing

    labor and will provide considerable convenience, ﬂexibility, and efﬁciency in
    managing farms. Further,

    by engaging new information technology and working with new online applications,
    farming could

    become an exciting and fun activity.

    2.5. “Closed-Loop Agricultural” Ecosystems

    “Closed-loop agricultural” ecosystems intend to mimic natural ecosystems that
    treat waste as

    a resource. Similar to aquaponics, the waste of one part of the system becomes
    the nutrients for the

    other. The closed-loop system recycles and reuses nearly every element of the
    farming process—dirty

    water, sewage, and nutrients. Food waste can also be converted to compost. In
    a closed-loop system,

    everything remains in the system, leading to a zero-waste outcome. This results
    not only in drastic

    decreases in waste but also in the creation of energy and other byproducts such
    as bedding and

    potting soil.

    Anaerobic Digester

    An anaerobic digester is a biogas recovery system that converts food waste into
    biogas to produce

    power and heat [41]. The Plant, a vertical farm in Chicago, has employed an anaerobic
    digester that

    captures the methane from 27 tons of daily food waste to produce electricity and
    heat. Figure 3

    illustrates how The Plan has integrated an anaerobic digester in its employed
    close-loop system

    (also see Section 3.2 on The Plant). Similarly, Great Northern Hydroponics (GNH),
    in Quebec, Canada,

    has employed a cogeneration machine that reduces its heating costs and reliance
    on fossil fuels. GNH’s

    power production has increased such that it is capable of selling electricity
    back to the Ontario Power

    Authority, decreasing the province’s dependence on fossil fuels.

    Main features of the closed-loop system:

    •

    At the heart of the system is an anaerobic digester that turns organic materials
    into biogas, which

    is piped into turbine generator to make electricity for plant grow light.

    •

    The plants make oxygen to the Kombucha tea brewery, and Kombucha tea brewery makes
    CO2 to

    the plant.

    •

    Waste from the ﬁsh feeds the plants and the plants clean the water for the ﬁsh.

    •

    More ﬁsh waste goes to the digester along with plants’ waste, waste from outside
    sources and

    spent grain from the brewery.

    •

    Spent barley from the brewery feeds the ﬁsh.

    •

    Sludge from the digester that becomes algae duckweed also feeds the ﬁsh.

    •

    Along electricity, the turbine makes steam which is piped to the commercial kitchen,
    brewery,

    and the entire building for heating and cooling.

    •

    Therefore, the kitchen produces Kombucha tea, fresh vegetables, ﬁsh, beer, and
    food, all with

    no waste.

    2.6. Renewable Energy

    Some vertical farms have implemented, and others have proposed employing wind
    turbines and

    photovoltaic panels to supply power. Other systems, such as thermal systems that
    collect solar heat

    and warehouse refrigeration exhaust, are also under consideration.

    2.7. Integration within City Infrastructure

    Future proposals, for example by Plantagon, envision the integration of vertical
    farms with the

    city symbiotically. The proposal envisions that the vertical farm will collect
    organic waste, carbon

    dioxide, manure, CO2, and excess heat from plants and factories, and transform
    these into biogas for

    heating and cooling. In this way, the vertical farm not only could grow food but
    also help to develop

    sustainable solutions for better energy, heat, waste, and water use (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. The proposed vertical farm in the downtown of Linköping, south of the
    capital Stockholm in

    Sweden by Plantagon provides an industrial symbiotic system. Partnership will
    be established between

    Plantagon, local energy company and local biogas plant. The greenhouse gets district
    heating from the

    power plant that runs through a major road, it gets excess heat and carbon dioxide
    from the biogas

    plant, and the leftover from the greenhouse goes into the biogas digestor. (Adapted
    from [42]).

    2.8. Redeﬁning Vertical Farms

    The aforementioned technologies are redeﬁning the vertical farm as “a revolutionary
    approach

    to producing high quantities of nutritious and quality fresh food all year round,
    without relying on

    skilled labor, favorable weather, high soil fertility or high water usage” [24].
    These new systems add

    advantages to vertical farming, summarized in Table 2.

    Table 2. Advantages of high-tech vertical farming systems [42].

    1. Reliable harvests

    Controlled indoor environments are independent of outside weather conditions and
    would provide

    consistent and reliable growing cycles to meet delivery schedules and supply contracts.

    2. Minimum

    overheads

    Production overheads would decrease by 30%.

    Low energy usage

    The use of high efﬁciency LED lighting technology ensures minimum power use for
    maximum plant

    growth. Computer management of photosynthetic wavelengths, in harmony with phase
    of crop growth,

    further minimizes energy use while ensuring optimized crop yields.

    Low labor costs

    Fully automated growing systems with automatic SMS text messaging would require
    manual labor only

    for on-site planting, harvesting, and packaging.

    Low water usage

    Vertical farms would use around 10% of the water required for traditional open
    ﬁeld farming.

    Reduced washing

    and processing

    Vertical farms would employ strict bio-security procedures to eliminate pests
    and diseases.

    Reduced transport costs

    Positioning of facilities close to the point of sale would dramatically decrease
    travel times, reducing

    refrigeration, storage and transport costs in the process.

    3. Increased

    growing areas

    Vertical farms would supply nearly ten times more growing area than traditional
    farms.

    4. Maximum crop

    yield

    Irrespective of external conditions, vertical farms can provide more crop rotations
    per year than open

    ﬁeld agriculture and other farming practices. Crop cycles are also faster due
    to controlled temperature,

    humidity, light, etc.

    5. Wide range

    of crops

    The vertical farm would provide a wide range of crops.

    6. Fully integrated

    technology

    The vertical farm would be fully monitored, controlled, and automated.

    Optimum air quality

    The temperature, CO2, and humidity levels of the vertical farm would be optimized
    at all times.

    Optimum nutrient and

    mineral quality

    The vertical farm would use specially formulated, biologically active nutrients
    in all crop cycles,

    providing organic minerals and enzymes to ensure healthy plant growth.

    Optimum water quality

    All fresh water’s contaminants would be removed before entering the vertical farm.

    Optimum light quality

    High-intensity low-energy LED lighting would be speciﬁcally developed and used
    for maximum growth

    rates, high reliability, and cost-effective operations.

    3. Vertical Farm Project Examples

    Several cities have embarked on vertical farming projects. The following narrative
    provides a

    3.1. Modest-Scale Vertical Farms

    Companies interested in modest-scale vertical farming are proliferating around
    the world.

    For example, Nuvege in Kyoto, Japan, is a 2787 m2 (30,000 ft2) hydroponic facility
    with 5295 m2

    (57,000 ft2) of vertical grow-space that produces a variety of lettuces in a safe
    environment from the

    nearby Fukushima nuclear plant [25]. PlantLab in Den Bosch, Holland, is a three-story
    underground

    vertical farm that uses advanced LED technology that calibrates light composition
    and intensity to

    precise needs, entirely removing the wavelengths of sunlight that prevent plant
    growth [25]. The farm

    employs an automated system that monitors and controls numerous variables including
    humidity,

    CO2, light intensity, light color, air velocity, irrigation, nutritional value,
    and air temperature [25].

    The high-tech farm produces a yield three times the amount of the average greenhouse
    while reducing

    water use by 90%.

    3.1.1. Sky Greens

    One of the promising vertical farms is the Sky Greens of Singapore. As a small
    island, but with

    a population of over ﬁve million, Singapore faces potential issues of food security.
    With land at

    a premium, limited space for farming is available. Singapore produces only 7%
    of the food it consumes,

    and only 250 acres of the island are devoted to farming. The remaining need is
    supplied by food

    imports from all over the world. However, the transportation costs of food are
    becoming increasingly

    prohibitive. For these reasons, Singapore has been taking vertical farming seriously.
    Although

    Singapore is an extreme case, it represents a looming problem facing myriad cities
    worldwide [26].

    Sky Greens is Singapore’s ﬁrst commercial “tropical vegetable urban vertical farm
    . . . to achieve

    enhanced green, sustainable production of safe, fresh and delicious vegetables,
    using minimal land,

    water, and energy resources” [43]. The ﬁve-year-old farm is 3-stories tall (9
    m or 30 ft) and uses

    a method called “A-Go-Gro (AGG) Vertical Farming” that utilizes translucent green
    houses to grow

    tropical leafy vegetable year-round at signiﬁcantly higher yields than traditional
    farming methods.

    Sky Greens is capable of producing one ton of fresh veggies every other day. It
    supplies a variety of

    tropical vegetables including Chinese cabbage, Spinach, Lettuce, Xiao Bai Cai,
    Bayam, Kang Kong,

    Cai Xin, Gai Lan and Nai Bai. By providing high-quality produce at relatively
    affordable costs, the farm

    has thrived and intends to expand its production, providing a wider variety of
    vegetables.

    Structurally, the AGG system consists of tall aluminum A-frames that can be as
    high as 9 m

    (30 ft) tall with 38 tiers of growing troughs that contain various growing media—soil
    and hydroponics.

    The A-frame system takes up only 5.6 m2 (60 ft2), making it ten times more efﬁcient
    than conventional

    farming [43]. The troughs slowly rotate around the aluminum frame (about three
    rotations per

    day) to ensure that the plants obtain uniform sunlight. Such continuous exposure
    also reduces or

    even eliminates the need for artiﬁcial lighting in some areas of the building.
    Rotation is powered

    by a patented low carbon hydraulic system that contains trays of plants. The hydraulic
    system is

    an ancient technology empowered with a modern twist; it is a closed-loop that
    makes efﬁcient use of

    gravity and consumes little energy. Each 9-m (30 ft) tower uses only 60 W of energy
    and, therefore,

    the owner spends only about “$360/month ($3/tower) on electricity” to power the
    farm [43].

    In addition to providing commercial beneﬁts, Sky Greens is engaged in educational
    programs

    in the surrounding neighborhoods where students visit the farm, getting exposure
    and hands-on

    experience in transplanting, harvesting, and understanding the power of science
    and technology in

    creating green urban solutions. According to Sky Green’s website, the project
    provides numerous

    economic and environmental beneﬁts, summarized in Table 4. The project started
    as a prototype

    developed jointly with Agri-Food and the Veterinary Authority of Singapore (AVA)
    in 2010. Sky Greens

    together with AVA won the Minister for National Development’s Research & Development
    Award

    2011 (Merit Award) for Vertical Farming. Sky Greens promises to become a viable
    food supplying

    option [43,44].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    Table 4. The environmental and socioeconomic beneﬁts of the Sky Greens vertical
    farm project [43].

    Environmental Beneﬁts

    Environmentally

    friendly and high-tech

    Sky Greens observes, learns and works with nature to achieve sustainability for
    the good of the

    environment to grow safe, high-quality vegetables using green technologies.

    Low energy usage

    Outdoor green houses have abundant sunlight in the tropics. The A-Go-Gro system
    uses

    patented low carbon hydraulic green technology to power the rotation of the tower
    at very low

    energy costs, while still allowing the plants to receive abundant sunlight.

    Low water usage

    As the troughs of plants rotate, irrigation occurs using an innovative ﬂooding
    method, using

    very little water. Water is also recycled and reused.

    Good waste &

    water management

    Sustainable water management practices are utilized with all organic wastes being
    composted

    at the farm to ensure the use of safe, high-quality fertilizers.

    Green technologies

    Green technologies have been stringently implemented at the farm to achieve the
    three Rs

    (reduce, reuse and recycle).

    Socioeconomic Beneﬁts

    Increased productivity

    The production yield of Sky Greens Farm is 5 to 10 times greater per unit of area
    than traditional

    Singaporean farms that growing leafy vegetables in a conventional fashion.

    Tasty Vegetables

    Tropical leafy vegetables are grown in special soil-based media, which contribute
    to good

    tasting vegetables, suitable for stir-fry and soups. The vegetables are harvested
    every day and

    delivered almost immediately to retail outlets for consumers.

    Year-round production

    As the vertical farm structures are in protected-outdoor green houses, the vegetables
    are grown

    in a controlled environment, protected from pests, winds and ﬂoods.

    Consistent and

    reliable harvest

    A steady supply of fresh leafy vegetables is assured as growing takes place in
    a

    controlled environment.

    Easy to install and easy

    to maintain

    The modular A-frame rotary system allows quick installation and easy maintenance.

    Better ergonomics

    & automation

    The rotary system allows the troughs to be immediately adjusted for easy harvesting.

    Automation increases the productivity of workers per ton of vegetables grown.

    Space savings

    The footprint of the vertical system is small but can produce signiﬁcantly more
    per unit area

    than traditional farms. It can also be customized to suit different crop requirements
    and

    varying environments.

    In the United States, cities such as New York, Chicago, Milwaukee, and others
    are becoming

    pioneers of vertical farming by repurposing vacant urban warehouses, derelict
    buildings and high-rises

    to grow food. With so much vacant space available, the cost of property is often
    affordable to buy or

    rent. Within the buildings, vertical farmers build tall structures with several
    levels of growing beds,

    often lined with artiﬁcial lights, to grow crops and “microgreens”, i.e., salad
    vegetables such as arugula,

    Swiss chard, mustard, beetroot, and sunﬂowers. Indoor vertical farming is playing
    an important role

    in spurring economic development by repurposing vacant industrial buildings, supplying
    fresh and

    healthy food and providing jobs in distressed areas. Among the pioneering vertical
    farm projects

    to spread across the U.S. are those carried by companies such as Green Spirit
    Farms, FarmedHere,

    The Plant, and Green Girls.

    3.1.2. Green Spirit Farms

    Located in New Buffalo, Michigan, Green Spirit Farms (GSF) is a professional food
    company

    that has openly embraced vertical farming. The New Buffalo facility has grown
    out of a former

    plastic factory. The building contains about 3716 m2 (40,000 ft2) of space and
    sits on an 11-ha (27-ac)

    site. As standard practice, GSF will enter older vacant industrial or commercial
    buildings to supply

    produce nearby urban markets. It aims to provide local markets with high quality,
    fresh, pesticide-free,

    non-genetically modiﬁed organism (GMO) foods at affordable prices. The company
    chooses to grow

    products with a high local demand like lettuce, basil, spinach, kale, arugula,
    peppers, tomatoes, stevia,

    strawberries, and Brussel sprouts. It sells its produce locally to grocery stores
    and restaurants and to

    a host of small “Harvest Markets” which sells directly to consumers. GSF runs
    vertical organic farms

    in Atlanta, Philadelphia, Canada, and the United Kingdom [45]. The company has
    a strong belief in

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    17 of 36

    vertical farming. According to Green Spirit Farms’ Research and Development Manager
    Daniel Kluko,

    the future of farming is heading in one clear direction: the vertical. “If we
    want to feed hungry people

    this is how we need to farm . . . We cut out the risk of traditional farming,
    the labor, and most of the

    equipment costs . . . This is not a niche business, it’s not something novel,
    this is a necessity for the

    human race to continue to live” [46].

    GSF has advanced several technologies to grow vegetables. These include the Volksgarden
    Rotary

    Garden unit, referred to as a Rotary Vertical Growing Station (RVGS), and a multi-level
    tray system,

    referred to as a Vertical Growing Station (VGS). GSF has lately commercialized
    rotary and vertical

    farming systems using patented techniques to grow local vegetables, herbs, and
    some fruits, and has

    opened vertical farms in repurposed industrial buildings, including one in East
    Benton, Pennsylvania.

    The new facility constitutes a major expansion compared to GSF’s ﬁrst facility
    in New Buffalo, Michigan,

    containing 1715 vertical growing stations that will produce herbs, leafy vegetables,
    peppers and

    tomatoes, the equivalent of 81 ha (200 ac) of farmland harvested year-round. This
    is enabled by

    facility’s efﬁciency, which uses “98 percent less water, 96 percent less land,
    and 40 percent less energy”

    than would be required by traditional agriculture [46]. It is expected that the
    facility will create over

    100 jobs to support the local economy. GSF has invested about $27 million to establish
    the vertical

    farm and received ﬁnancial aid including a $300,000 Pennsylvania First Program
    grant, $303,000 in

    Job Creation Tax Credits, and a $45,450 Guaranteed Free Training grant to train
    new employees [47].

    The location has appealed to Green Spirit because of its proximity to large local
    markets, with most of

    its produce selling within approximately 75 miles of the farm [47]. In summary,
    the vertical farm project

    provides a useful example of adaptive reuse established through a strong public-private
    partnership.

    This has been made possible through the collaboration between GSF and several
    agencies including

    the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Lackawanna County, Benton Township, and the
    Greater Scranton

    Chamber of Commerce.

    3.1.3. FarmedHere

    FarmedHere is a company that was founded in 2011 and has recently expanded to
    three locations

    in Illinois: Englewood, a Chicago Southside neighborhood; Flanagan in downstate
    Illinois; and recently

    in Bedford Park, a Southwest Chicago suburb. As the company grows, it expects
    to supply 6% or

    more of the Chicago area’s demand for premium green and culinary herbs. The company
    also hires

    local youths through Windy City Harvest, a Chicago Botanic Garden-led urban agriculture-training

    program targeted to underserved youths. FarmedHere received the USDA (the U.S.
    Department of

    Agriculture) Organic Certiﬁcation at the end of 2012 [48]. The company’s product
    is spreading in

    several grocery stores including Whole Foods, Chicago-area Mariano’s Fresh Market,
    Green Grocer,

    and possibly soon at Trader Joe’s and Meijer. FarmedHere was able to receive ﬁnancial
    support from

    Good Food and Whole Foods, the farm’s largest customers. The company expects that
    it has a market

    niche given the recent generational demands for healthy and organic foods. These
    new businesses also

    expect to obtain subsidies from tax-increment ﬁnancing as well as property-tax
    breaks for reviving

    industrial properties [48].

    Bedford Park’s facility is about 8361 m2 (90,000 ft2), much larger than both the
    ﬁrst facility in

    Englewood (371 m2 (4000 ft2)) and the second facility in Flanagan (929 m2 (10,000
    ft2)). Bedford Park’s

    facility, about 24 km (15 mi) from downtown Chicago, is now hyped as the ﬁrst
    of its kind and the

    largest indoor vertical farm in America [48]. It was opened in 2013 and is expected
    to become a

    new model for growing produce efﬁciently in a high tech manner. The farm resides
    in a two-story,

    windowless warehouse, and is designed to occupy the full extent of the space.
    Currently, the farm

    consists of two structures with large growing beds lit by ﬂuorescent lighting.
    The ﬁrst structure

    contains the aquaponics system where water circulates between ﬁsh tanks, feeding
    plants that rest in

    cutouts on Styrofoam “ﬂoats” above. The second structure contains the aeroponics
    system, with water

    misters underneath that spray the exposed roots of the plants. Workers plant the
    seeds and grow

    seedlings on racks that then are transferred into the growing systems. After about
    a month, the crops

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    18 of 36

    are harvested and packaged manually in a cooling room at the facility, and then
    shipped the next

    morning to grocers in Chicago’s metropolitan area [49].

    By stacking aquaponics and aeroponics systems vertically, the facility contains
    13,935 m2

    (150,000 ft2) of growing space, or about 1.4 ha (3.5 ac). Planting in a controlled
    environment with

    ideal humidity and temperature ensures optimal growth. FarmedHere produces about
    136,078 kg

    (300,000 lb) of leafy greens and plans to grow to what will eventually amount
    to more than 453,592 kg

    (a million pounds) of chemical, herbicide and pesticide-free leafy greens yearly
    [49]. It also plans to

    expand by producing peppers, tomatoes, and other popular vegetables. Their aquaponics
    produces

    ﬁsh and organic herbs—basil and the like—while their aeroponics produces leafy
    greens like arugula

    and watercress. For space efﬁciency, plants are grown on six shelves that receive
    artiﬁcial ﬂuorescent

    lighting and that are attended by workers using scissor lifts. The aquaponics
    method ﬁlters the

    nitrogen-rich waste of the tilapia ﬁsh and uses it to feed plants, and the hormone-free
    tilapia are bred

    in four 3028-L (800-gal) tanks, where water is ultimately recycled to create a
    closed loop that reduces

    water use by 97%. Therefore, the system is efﬁcient in its use of water and space.

    These new facilities also provide “on-demand farming” meaning they are ﬂexible
    and responsive

    to market demands. For example, demand may suddenly increase for particular types
    of mixed greens

    or mini greens. “We could change the whole system ... and pretty much within the
    next 14 to 28 days,

    we [would] have a full grown plant, whatever the market requires” [50]. However,
    the prime obstacle

    these farms face remains the electricity needed to grow the plants and heat the
    space. Because of

    exorbitant energy bills, some indoor farms have been closed down. Dickson Despommier,
    in his book

    “The Vertical Farm: Feeding the World in the 21st Century”, stresses the fact
    that energy remains the

    primary hurdle [4]. Nevertheless, vertical farmers are trying to ﬁnd solutions
    by exploring solar, wind

    and methane gas as ways to generate electricity, or by supplementing artiﬁcial
    light with natural light

    through windows and skylights. Other farmers are experimenting with ﬂickering
    lights sufﬁcient to

    grow plants with little power.

    3.2. The Plant

    Located in the heart of Chicago’s derelict stockyards, the almost century old
    site of The Plant

    has a long history of food production as a former meatpacking facility and the
    former home of

    Peer Foods. The four-story, 8686 m2 (93,500 ft2) red brick warehouse is now set
    to become a major

    net zero vertical farm where the operation is fueled by food waste [51]. The zero-energy
    facility relies

    on an on-site Combined Heating and Power (CHP) system that contains a large anaerobic
    digester

    that converts food waste into biogas to power, heat and cool the building. The
    anaerobic digester

    captures the methane from 27 tons of food waste daily and 11,000 annually and
    burns it to produce

    electricity and heat. The Plant plans to turn the facility into a food business
    incubator, research lab and

    educational and training facility for vertical farming. The building’s transformation,
    which started in

    2010, was completed in 2016 [51].

    The Plant is currently producing greens, mushrooms, bread, and Kombucha tea. Eventually,

    the facility will combine a tilapia farm, beer brewery, Kombucha brewery, communal
    kitchen,

    an aquaponics system, and green energy production. “We’re working to show what
    truly sustainable

    food production and economic development looks like by farming inside an old meatpacking
    facility,

    incubating small craft food businesses, brewing beer and kombucha, and doing it
    all using only

    renewable energy that we make onsite. By connecting outputs of one business to
    the inputs of another,

    we are harnessing value from materials that most people would throw away” [51].
    The conversion of

    the space into a vertical farm and food business incubator was partly made possible
    by a $1.5 million

    grant from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity (DCEO)
    to support the

    development of a comprehensive renewable energy system [51].

    3.3. Green Girls

    Green Girls Produce, a professional food company, is Tennessee’s ﬁrst indoor vertical
    farm

    that supplies local restaurants with a year-round fresh produce in an effort to
    improve the health of

    Memphians and to ﬁght urban blight. The 60,000-ft2 facility is located in Memphis’
    Historic Downtown

    on the 4th ﬂoor of the Emerge Building. Restaurants have a desire for microgreens,
    which give meals

    an additional ﬂavoring and pizzazz [52]. “Chefs love them because they make a
    boring dish pop, they

    add intense ﬂavor, texture and vivid color . . . On top of that, they are nutritious
    with up to 40 times

    the nutrients and vitamins of their mature counterparts” [52]. However, restaurants
    often refrain

    from purchasing microgreens given their high costs. Restaurants typically pay
    about $100 a pound

    for microgreens. The vertical farm reduces the costs down to below $40 per pound.
    Green Girls

    estimates a revenue of about one million dollars a year. It supplies affordable
    microgreens and makes

    a proﬁt because of efﬁcient technologies provided by automated, re-circulating
    hydroponic systems

    that require only two employees to run. It is characterized by being clean, efﬁcient
    in its water use

    (Green Girls uses 90% less water than conventional farming) and green in its energy
    use, employing

    only LED lighting [52].

    3.4. Rooftop Farming

    Rooftop farming simply involves the growing of fruits and vegetable on a rooftop.
    With a dearth

    of suitable urban farming land, roofs are increasingly being seen as a plausible
    space for growing food

    and a proactive measure in building a sustainable future for cities. Indeed, an
    abundance of unused

    rooftop spaces prevails. For example, Honolulu’s buildings alone contain more
    than 1,579,351 m2

    (17,000,000 ft2) of rooftops. Consequently, in recent years, a great number of
    rooftop farms have sprung

    up and some green roofs have been transformed into rooftop farms [53–55].

    Overall, converting green roofs into rooftop gardens is a rising trend that aims
    to “scale up”

    urban agriculture. Similar to green roofs, rooftop farms are viewed as a necessity
    for combatting

    the heat-island effect, to mitigate stormwater runoff and to insulate buildings.
    In addition to these

    environmental beneﬁts, rooftop farming provides the beneﬁts of supplying the community
    with fresh

    produce and promoting modest-scale urban agriculture as well as providing tangible
    connections to

    food, See Table 5. Among the common vegetables grown on rooftops are kale, collard
    greens, carrots,

    radishes, peppers, beans, beets, cherry tomatoes, and various herbs [56]. Though,
    it should be noted

    that a slight distinction between a vertical garden and a vertical farm exists.
    While both grow plants

    vertically, the former not always produces fruits and vegetable, and the latter
    does that exclusively.

    Vertical farms usually occupy larger areas than that by vertical gardens. Nevertheless,
    the produce of

    both types (vertical gardens and vertical farms) is offered to local communities,
    stores, and restaurants.

    Rooftop farming is not a wholly original idea given that its history goes back
    to the ziggurats

    of ancient Mesopotamia and the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. To this day, however,
    continuing

    challenges in implementing rooftop farms persist. The structure must be strong
    enough to support the

    heavy weight of soil and greenhouse structures. Usually, the edges of rooftops
    are suitable to support

    moderate loads, but the central areas may need extra reinforcement [57].

    Furthermore, a rooftop requires building access, which imposes logistical issues,
    liability, weather

    conditions, and insurance risks. Zoning codes could also be obstacles to obtaining
    permits. For these

    reasons, urban farmers are struggling to create efﬁcient farming systems while
    making a proﬁt.

    Balancing costs and proﬁts indicates that not every green roof is well suited
    for farming. For example,

    in 2012 Local Garden, a rooftop farm that was opened in Vancouver, Canada, was
    recently closed due

    to economic reasons. Overall, rooftop farming is still a work in progress, but
    it has great potential as

    an urban farming system [58].

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    Table 5. Summary of the beneﬁts of rooftop farms [53].

    Environmental Beneﬁts

    Energy

    Conservation

    The use of green roofs compared to conventional rooﬁng surfaces signiﬁcantly affects
    the energy

    balance within a building. Studies have revealed that green roofs have the potential
    to reduce a

    building’s energy use by as much as 30%.

    Stormwater

    Management

    A green roof absorbs rainwater and helps to prevent sewer system back-ups and
    contaminated

    stormwater overﬂow. Green roofs can also help to prevent catastrophic environmental
    events,

    such as the Ala Wai Canal sewage spill disaster.

    Fossil Fuel

    Reduction

    A rooftop farm can grow hyper-local foods. Growing Low Food Mile organic produce
    substantially

    reduces the fossil fuel consumption associated with the traditional food transportation
    system.

    Global Warming

    Green roofs sequester carbon from the atmosphere, lower the levels of carbon dioxide
    in the air,

    eliminate the build-up of greenhouse gases, and keep city temperatures cooler
    by effectively

    reducing the “Urban Heat Island Effect”.

    Biodiversity

    By replacing inorganic, lifeless roofs with living and thriving green spaces,
    green roofs support

    increased biodiversity in urban environments—offering a habitat for a multitude
    of

    organisms—from birds to butterﬂies to countless other beneﬁcial insects.

    Environmental

    Stewardship

    Organic rooftop farming protects soil and water from toxic pesticides, herbicides,
    fungicides,

    and other dangerous chemicals typically used in conventional farming.

    Socioeconomic Beneﬁts

    Community

    A rooftop farm is a beacon of sustainable community building that creates tangible
    connections

    between farmers and consumers. Rooftop farms have the power to do this throughout
    the city,

    no matter how scarce or valuable the land.

    Local Food

    Economy

    Rooftop farms generate revenue for local farmers and businesses. In this way,
    rooftop agriculture

    can also be viewed as an emerging green technology that creates jobs and improves
    food

    self-sufﬁciency by providing organic and Hyper-Local produce.

    Nutrition and

    health

    As an example, the produce of FarmRoof™ is extraordinarily nutritious and healthy.
    Thanks to a

    special soil that has been infused with minerals, trace elements, omegas, proteins
    and

    microorganisms, all of their crops are packed with enzymes, antioxidants, nutrients,
    and minerals.

    Aesthetics and

    Beauty

    Supplanting inorganic, lifeless roofs with vibrant greenery, green roofs can beautify
    cityscapes and

    balance an otherwise bleak horizon of concrete and tar.

    3.4.1. Brooklyn Grange

    Several rooftop farms have recently sprung up in New York City, the largest of
    which is Brooklyn

    Grange rooftop farm—about one acre in size—and is claimed to be the world’s largest
    rooftop

    garden [59]. Placed on top of a six-story warehouse that was built in 1919, Brooklyn
    Garage grows

    a wide-range of “organic produce that includes 40 varieties of tomatoes, peppers,
    fennel, salad greens,

    kale, Swiss chard, beans and a variety of delicious root vegetables such as beets,
    carrots, and radishes,

    as well as herbs” [42]. Their produce is grown in 19 cm (7.5 in) deep beds with
    Rooﬂite soil [59,60].

    “Rooﬂite is a lightweight soil composed of organic matter compost and small porous
    stones which

    break down to add trace minerals that are needed for the produce to grow into
    a healthy and mature

    state” [60]. Brooklyn Grange is thriving and plans to expand its operation [61].

    3.4.2. Gotham Greens

    Gotham Greens is a 1394 m2 (15,000 ft2) facility atop a two-story building in
    Greenpoint, Brooklyn,

    New York. Constructed in 2011, it is claimed to be the ﬁrst rooftop hydroponic
    commercial farm that

    uses technologically sophisticated Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) in
    an urban setting

    in the United States. The facility enjoys unusual farming efﬁciencies given that
    it uses less square

    footage to grow 7–8 times more food than traditional farming, providing produce
    year-round that

    is pesticide free [62,63]. Gotham Greens offers the advantage of growing summer
    vegetables in the

    winter, enhancing New York City’s barren landscape at this time, and plans to
    produce 80–100 tons of

    pesticide-free, premium-quality lettuce, salad greens, and herbs yearly. Gotham
    Greens is not only

    aiming to provide quality produce but also to save on energy by employing advanced
    computer

    systems that control heating, cooling, irrigation and plant nutrition, while utilizing
    on-site solar

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    21 of 36

    photovoltaics.

    Energy use is reduced further by providing natural ventilation, double-glazing,

    and thermal insulation that is supplied by the rooftop farm and through high-efﬁciency
    pumps

    and fans. As such, the facility optimizes energy use and consumes less land and
    water than that of

    a conventional farm. These energy-saving measures are particularly suitable for
    New York City given

    its rapid increase in energy costs. Because of these energy saving innovations,
    Gotham Greens will

    likely be able to reduce its production costs signiﬁcantly [45,46]. Interestingly,
    Gotham Greens was

    the only fresh food supplier in New York during the Sandy Hurricane. This highlights
    the beneﬁts

    of protected agriculture in urban areas—particularly as we face climate change—while
    open-air

    agriculture can suffer from weather damages [64].

    3.5. Multi-Story Farms

    As mentioned earlier, there have been an increasing number of proposals for multi-story
    farms

    that remain ideas on the drawing board. This is due, in large part, to the fact
    that these ideas are not yet

    economically feasible. However, some companies have taken this endeavor seriously
    and are on the

    verge of implementing some of these visionary ideas. Among the pioneering companies
    is Plantagon.

    3.5.1. Plantagon

    Founded in 2008 in Stockholm and headed by Hans Hassle, Plantagon is a Swedish
    vertical

    agriculture company that has ﬂourished through the establishment of ofﬁces in
    cities around the

    world, including Shanghai, China, and Singapore. Plantagon collaborates with other
    companies such

    as SymbioCity and SWECO that are also devoted to ﬁnding new methods of vertical
    farming and

    in clean technologies (Figure 5). It has also established research ties with academic
    institutions such

    as Linköping University in Linköping, Sweden, Nanyang Technological University
    in Singapore,

    and Tongji University in Shanghai, China. The company participated in Shanghai’s
    World Expo 2010

    and won the Globe Sustainability Innovation Award that same year. It also won
    a Silver Stevie Award

    for being Europe’s “most innovative company” in 2012 [65].

    Figure 5. Map of global cleantech innovation ranking (on a scale from 1 to 5,
    with 5 being the highest

    score). (Adapted from [65]).

    3.5.2. Organizational Structure

    Plantagon has embraced an innovative organizational structure, which they call
    “companization”,

    that combines two legally bound units, a proﬁt-driven company called Plantagon
    International AB,

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    22 of 36

    and a non-proﬁt association called Plantagon Non-proﬁt Association [65]. This
    “companization”

    aims to unite proﬁt-driven comercial forces with nonproﬁt organizational values
    [66]. It is a blend

    between the top-down action oriented commercial organization and the bottom-up
    inclusive and

    democratic nonproﬁt association. The two units of the company are dependent upon
    one another,

    thereby making it difﬁcult for the company to act irresponsibly and unethically.
    Plantagon is also tied

    to overarching ethical frameworks provided by the “UN Global Compact” and the
    “Earth Charter” in

    their articles of association and statutes. Their board members, from both the
    proﬁt and nonproﬁt units,

    constantly co-review ﬁnancial and social performance, bringing “moral questions
    to the otherwise

    purely economic forum [65,66] (Figure 6).

    3.5.3. Technical Innovations

    The company is not only innovative in its organizational structure but also in
    its technology.

    The company has invented an automated growing food process through a helical structure
    that would

    be placed in the center of a building. This structure employs an efﬁcient robotic
    belt that moves each

    row of plants one by one rather altogether. At the ground level, workers place
    seeds in pots and then

    lifts elevate them to the top of the helix. Here, automatically they are placed
    on a belt that takes them

    steadily back down to the ground, controlling the amount of sunlight they receive
    depending on their

    age and size. By the time they reach the ground, the plants are ready to be harvested.
    To keep the

    crops in sunlight as much as possible, the trays move more quickly when in the
    shade. Eventually,

    LED-lights will be employed to complement solar exposure (Figure 7). Plantagon
    has also made

    advancements in hydroponics by introducing pumice soil as a growing medium instead
    of relying

    completely on water. Pumice, a volcanic rock that results from the cooling of
    lava in water, possesses

    a unique porosity that absorbs nutrients and then channels them to plants. This
    may overcome the

    common problem of tastelessness that hydroponically generated produce is notorious
    for, though both

    methods provide similar levels of nutrition [66].

    Figure 6.

    The concept of “companization” by Plantagon.

    The model is described as a hybrid

    system that combines two legally bound units: one of the units is a proﬁt-driven
    company called

    Plantagon International AB, and the other one is non-proﬁtable association called
    Plantagon Non-proﬁt

    Association [65]. The “companization” aims to combine proﬁt-driven commercial
    forces with non-proﬁt

    moral and ethically-oriented driving forces in one organization [65]. It is a
    blend between the top-down

    action oriented commercial organization and the bottom-up, inclusive and democratic
    nonproﬁt

    association. (Adapted from [65]).

    Figure 7. A proposed vertical farm by Plantagon. It comprises a helix structure
    placed in the center of

    a sphere-shape building and stretches vertically. The helix structure contains
    a robot belt that instead

    of moving thousands of plants over the whole belt, it moves each raw of plants
    one by one. Seeds are

    placed in pots on the belt at the ground ﬂoor level. Then, plants are elevated
    to the top by an elevator

    and placed on the moving belt which takes them back to the ground, and by the
    time they reach the

    ground ﬂoor, plants are ready to harvest. (Drawing by author).

    Plantagon offers three approaches to vertical farming: façade farming, multifunctional
    farming,

    and standalone farming [65].

    The Plantawall Façade System

    This approach proposes turning a building’s façade into a productive greenhouse.
    It speciﬁcally

    suggests placing a six-meter-deep (20 ft) greenhouse at the perimeter where solar
    exposure is greatest.

    Plants sit in trays that constantly move on parallel conveyor belts, obtaining
    maximum exposure to

    natural light in the process. The PlantaWall façade system is based on a ﬂexible
    modular structure that

    can be attached to the whole facade or part of an existing structure. In addition
    to structural ﬂexibility,

    the façade system provides the beneﬁt of soundprooﬁng, supporting a healthy work
    environment,

    and improving thermal insulation and shade. Furthermore, the system fosters a
    symbiotic relationship

    that creates a healthy environment for everyone by transferring CO2 from people
    to plants and O2 from

    plants to people. However, the façade system reduces the amount of natural light
    that can penetrate

    deeply into a space [65].

    Multi-Functional

    In addition to farming, the multifunctional vertical farm incorporates functions
    such as ofﬁce

    space, hotel, and retail space as well as residential and educational uses.

    Standalone

    The standalone vertical farm is dedicated exclusively to the industrial production
    of food.

    The company has produced two prototypes, a sphere for tropical climates and a
    half-moon shape for

    temperate climates. The later prototype, named “Plantscraper” is a building that
    has been proposed

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    24 of 36

    in downtown Linköping, south of the Swedish capital of Stockholm (Figure 8). The
    purpose of this

    structure has been to create a reference building that can be used as a model
    of vertical farming.

    The “Plantscraper” is a 12-story, mixed-used tower that houses an indoor farm
    along the southern

    façade (The PlantaWall), a farmers market at the ground ﬂoor and ofﬁce spaces
    for proposed urban

    farming research [65]. The renting of ofﬁce space will provide supplemental income
    to the building.

    It is estimated that the Plantscraper will produce between 300 and 500 metric
    tons of leafy greens,

    particularly pak choi, a year. Pak choi, also known as celery cabbage, is a Chinese
    vegetable that

    can be eaten raw or cooked [65]. This leafy green has been emphasized because
    Plantagon wants

    to use this building as a model for Asian cities. In addition, the building will
    collect and reuse

    all wastewater, with all pesticides, fertilizers, and soil pollution being automatically
    monitored

    and controlled. Interestingly, Plantagon plans to integrate the vertical farm
    with the city’s civic

    infrastructure, i.e., electricity, gas, water, and sewage [66].

    Figure 8. One of Plantagon’s prototype for the vertical farm. Seeds are planted
    in the ﬁrst ﬂoor, then

    carried to the top via elevators, and next moves down by the helix belt system.
    (Adapted from [65]).

    3.5.4. La Tour Vivante

    The French architecture ﬁrm Atelier SOA has proposed a 30-ﬂoor mixed-use vertical
    farm—Tour

    Vivante (Living Tower)—that houses farming, residences, ofﬁce spaces, restaurants,
    and retail.

    The concept evokes the sense of a self-contained vertical neighborhood that enjoys
    autonomy and

    reduces travel needs between the rural and the urban, by bringing together the
    activities of production

    and consumption into one space [67]. People who live and work in the tower can
    enjoy proximity

    to fresh, ripe, and preservative-free produce while the tower’s tenants provide
    a constant income

    that supports the farms. It is also possible that residents of the tower could
    be employed in the

    building to reduce travel times between home and work. Additionally, combining
    farming, housing,

    and ofﬁce spaces brings together the traditionally distant rural farming experience
    close to residents,

    reconnecting them with nature. The tower’s architects explain that “the separation
    between city and

    countryside, urban planning and natural areas, places of living, consumption,
    and production is

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    25 of 36

    increasingly problematic for sustainable land management . . . The concept of
    Tour Vivante aims to

    combine agricultural production, housing and activities in a single system” [67].

    The interweaving of these functions and activities aims to provide a symbiotic
    relationship

    between the inhabitants and the farming environment. For example, food waste from
    restaurants

    and residents will be collected and processed to be used as a liquid fertilizer
    to fruits and vegetables.

    Similarly, the oxygen produced by plants will be channeled to tenants, while the
    carbon dioxide

    produced by the tenants will be transferred to plants. Rainwater from the roof
    and the façades will

    be collected, ﬁltered, and used in the farm, and the waste generated by the farm
    and other functions

    (housing, ofﬁces) will be collected and used to generate power for the tower [67].

    Blackwater produced by the tower will be recycled and puriﬁed to feed and fertilize
    the plants.

    The Tour Vivante also embraces renewable energy by employing two large wind turbines,
    as well as

    photovoltaic panels, placed on the southern façade of the building and its roof.
    The tower will also be

    constructed from recycled and recyclable materials. A thermal concrete shaft at
    the core of the building

    will help to control solar gain and humidity in the building while facilitating
    natural ventilation

    through the “chimney effect” and the application of a double skin façade. Overall,
    the tower explores

    possibilities of blending architecture with agriculture, merging food production
    and consumption into

    one place [67].

    3.5.5. Harvest Green Tower

    The city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, expects to face rapid urban growth
    in the

    coming decades that would result in substantial demands on food. Romses Architects
    has recently

    proposed a multifunctional vertical farm in Vancouver in support of the City’s
    2030 Challenge of

    reducing carbon emissions. The project, named “Harvest Green Tower”, provides
    space for a mix of

    uses including residences, ofﬁces, entertainment, retail, restaurants, and vertical
    farming that will

    produce vegetables, herbs, fruits, ﬁsh, egg-laying chickens, goat cheese, and
    sheep dairy. The project

    also connects well with the city’s public mass-transit system. The main sections
    of the tower are

    described as follows [68].

    •

    Underground. A parking lot and shared car co-op

    •

    Street level. A grocery store, farmer’s market, restaurants, and a transit hub

    •

    Lower ﬂoors. A livestock grazing plain, bird habitat, goat cheese, and sheep dairy
    facility

    •

    Middle ﬂoors. A space for producing fruits, vegetables, and ﬁsh

    •

    Upper ﬂoors. Residential units

    •

    Tower’s top. A large rainwater cistern

    The tower will harness renewable energy by installing rooftop mounted wind turbines
    on the

    roof, photovoltaic glazing on the façade, a geothermal station underground, and
    bio-energy from the

    compost of plants and animals. All of these combined factors provide the possibility
    of selling surplus

    power back to the grid. Rainwater will be collected in a cistern atop the tower
    and used to irrigate

    plants through the downward pull of gravity. The project was a winning entry in
    Vancouver’s 2030

    Challenge given that it addressed climate change through the promotion of high-density
    mixed-use

    developments in the urban core, thereby curtailing sprawl [68].

    3.5.6. Skyfarm

    Designed by architect Gordon Graff, the Skyfarm is a 59-ﬂoor vertical farm proposed
    for

    downtown Toronto, Canada. This tower embraces the hydroponic method for growing
    food, using

    an area totaling about 743,224 m2 (8,000,000 ft2). It is predicted that the Skyfarm
    will produce

    the equivalent of a thousand-acre rural farm, feeding about 35,000–50,000 people
    per year [69].

    The building will be equipped with its biogas plant that contains an anaerobic
    digester to produce

    methane from its waste, which is then burned to generate electricity. The system
    can also reclaim the

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    26 of 36

    waste and sewage by diverting it to the Skyfarm’s anaerobic digester to produce
    the methane necessary

    to generate electricity. Furthermore, the liquid slurry extracted by the anaerobic
    digesters could be

    used by rural farms as fertilizer [69].

    3.5.7. Pyramid Farm

    Architecture professors Eric Ellingsen and Dickson Despommier have proposed a
    self-sustaining

    30-story “Pyramid Farm” to produce a wide variety of fruits and vegetables as
    well as ﬁsh and poultry

    farm that will feed about 50,000 people annually. The project embraces a closed-loop
    agricultural

    ecosystem where nearly every element of the farming process—including water and
    nutrients—is

    recycled and re-used, minimizing waste drastically. The farm will include a heating
    and pressurization

    system that splits sewage into water and carbon, fueling machinery and electrifying
    lighting. Overall,

    the proposed farm will be efﬁcient, as it will utilize only 10% of the water used
    in traditional farming

    techniques and only 5% of the space of a traditional farm. Finally, the visual
    quality of the pyramid is

    appealing and would ﬁt well into an urban area [70].

    3.5.8. Vertical Farm in Philippine

    A recent visionary project proposed a vertical aeroponics farm that offers high
    yields of rice in the

    Philippines; a country that faces food insecurity and lacks farmland. Rice is
    a particularly valuable

    food not only in the Philippines but also across the globe, given that half of
    the world’s population

    relies on rice as a major food source. Jin Ho Kim has proposed using aeroponics
    technology that uses

    minimal water to grow rice compactly on a terraced vertical farm to be constructed
    by an array of

    bamboo parallelograms. The project will create local jobs, supply local food,
    and lead to signiﬁcant

    savings in transportation, storage, refrigeration, and packaging, eventually incorporating
    spaces for

    social gatherings and children [70,71].

    4. Discussion: Opportunities and Challenges

    Vertical farming represents a proactive thinking approach that aims to ensure
    the sustainability

    of cities by addressing the issue of food security. The urban population already
    faces food shortages,

    and food prices are skyrocketing due to increases in oil prices, shortages of
    water and the diminishment

    of other agricultural resources. The current practices of supplying food to urban
    areas suffer from

    environmental and economic problems, such as the inefﬁcient practice of transporting
    food great

    distances. As an answer to these problems, the vertical farm will grow food efﬁciently
    and sustainably

    by saving energy, water, and fossil fuels, reducing toxins and restoring ecosystems,
    as well as

    providing new opportunities for employment. We have seen the rapid growth of modest-scale

    vertical farming, and these projects have provided excellent examples of adaptive
    reuse of vacant

    industrials spaces [72–76].

    Therefore, the vertical farm may offer opportunities in the three pillars of sustainability:

    environment, society, and economy (Table 6). It can offer a sustainable food-production
    model

    that supplies crop year-round with no interruption due to climate change, season,
    or adverse natural

    events (e.g., hurricane, drought, and ﬂood). It has also the potential to provide
    greater yield per space

    unit—the ratio is 1:4–1:6, depending on the type of crop [77,78]. Further, the
    high-tech cultivation

    methods of the vertical farm reduce demand on potable water. They are often efﬁcient
    in irrigating

    plants, by targeting plant roots and reducing evaporation [79]. They may also
    recycle wastewater (grey,

    even black water) and harness rainwater. When ﬁsh farms are integrated, ﬁsh removes
    waste (esp. ﬁsh

    ﬁlet). The vertical farm can also produce energy by burning methane from compost.
    For example,

    the Plant Vertical Farm in Chicago and the Republic of South Korea VF factory
    convert waste to

    energy [80,81].

    When compared to traditional farming, the vertical farm may reduce the need for
    fossil fuel

    required for tractors, plows, or shipping. Traditional farming uses lots of fossil
    fuel; for example,

    conventional farming in North America consumes 20% of fossil fuel due to plowing,
    seeding,

    harvesting, fertilizing and so on [82,83]. The vertical farm can also reduce food
    travel distance

    (food-miles) by promoting “local for local” life style, i.e., distances between
    food production and

    consumption are minimized [84–86]. As mentioned earlier, in conventional farming,
    food travels on

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    28 of 36

    average 1500 miles. Further, the vertical farm eliminates the need of packing
    agricultural crops for

    long-distance transportation [6,87,88].

    Indoor farming is immune to weather change, which affects traditional farming
    by changing

    temperature, water supply, and photo intensity. These factors often reduce produce
    yield; for example,

    droughts destroy crops every year worldwide [88,89]. As such, the vertical farm
    will be important

    for food security especially as climate change threatens our cities. As mentioned
    earlier, Gotham

    Greens was the only fresh food supplier in New York during the Sandy Hurricane.
    Additional beneﬁt

    of the vertical farm is providing an ideal growth environment for each plant that
    improves crop

    yield [62,73]. Advances in technologies, for example, the LED lighting, promises
    to increase yields as

    LED emits programmed wavelength of light for optimal photosynthesis of different
    types of crops.

    Luckily, the prices of these technologies are dropping [74]. The vertical farm
    provides an environment

    almost free of invasive pest species [90]. It also reduces, and possibly eliminates
    the use of mineral

    fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides, and nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P),
    which have been causing

    environmental degradation by polluting surface water and groundwater [91–93].

    The vertical farm can assist in cooling the environment, sequestering CO2, reducing
    the Urban

    Heat Island (UHI) effect, and combating climate change [94,95]. As such, it can
    help in reducing energy

    needed to cool indoor spaces in summer time and reduce carbon dioxide emission
    [96–98]. Further,

    the vertical farm can help in absorbing noise since vegetation reduces sound reﬂection.
    Vegetation and

    soil can function together as sound insulator [97,99]. When rooftop farming or
    green roofs are also

    applied, noise could be lowered further by absorbing higher frequency noise produced
    by auto trafﬁc,

    machineries, and airplanes [99].

    The vertical farm may also provide socio-economic beneﬁts by offering employment

    opportunities [100]. Building a vertical farm requires a multi-disciplinary team
    of architects, engineers,

    scientists, farmers, horticulturists, environmentalists, marketers, and economists.

    For example,

    industrial, mechanical and electrical engineers will be needed to design water
    recycling systems,

    lighting systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, seed
    and plant growth

    monitoring and harvesting systems. Computer experts will be needed to build databases
    and software

    applications. As such, the vertical farm offers new exciting careers in biochemistry,
    biotechnology,

    construction, maintenance, marketing, engineering, and research and development
    opportunities for

    improving the involved technologies [100–102]. Further, robotics and software
    engineers could also be

    needed. Moreover, a vertical farm may include grocery stores and engage distribution
    centers, which

    provide additional work opportunities [68,103].

    Further, vertical farming is likely to create new social networks and communities
    that forge new

    friendship in the workspace and beyond, among producers, farmers, and consumers
    [93]. In addition,

    vertical farmers may enjoy selling their produce directly to customers and develop
    friendships [104].

    Vertical farms could have an important educational role in informing about plants
    and produce by

    bringing farming activities closer to city dwellers. For example, Gotham Greens
    in New York frequently

    invites visitors and students to their vertical farm and holds educational sessions
    [105].

    Our health is directly impacted by the “freshness” and wholesomeness of food we
    consume and

    the vertical farm intends to supply quality, local organic food [58,89]. It could
    help consequently to

    reduce or stop the transmission of harmful infectious diseases for currently much
    produced food by

    conventional agriculture is polluted and carry bacterial diseases that endanger
    the lives of millions of

    inhabitants. That is, since the vertical farm product is not soil-based, it is
    likely to be not affected by

    polluted soil or irrigation water. Further, vertical farm’s crops are rich in
    nutrients [106,107]. Moreover,

    being close to nature helps to reduce stress and has positive inﬂuence on mental
    health.

    Notwithstanding the promising future and large potential beneﬁts, challenges and
    barriers in the

    path to the vertical farm implementation should be noted. Research has highlighted
    social resistance,

    where masses of people do not accept the alteration of traditional farming for
    it is the natural way to

    grow food [77,89,94,99]. Importantly, the core argument against vertical farming
    is that growing food

    indoors requires more energy, effort, and resources than traditional farming [86,98,100].
    That is, “It is

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    29 of 36

    much more expensive, of course, to build a vertical greenhouse than to build a
    normal greenhouse” [72].

    Despommier acknowledges that the costs of implementing vertical farms are high,
    particularly the

    start-up costs, and he calls on the government to provide the seed money to fund
    these projects.

    Apparently, to raise the required investment capital is a challenge. In short,
    in order for the vertical

    farm to be sustainable, it must be proﬁtable.

    Further, central cities are ideal locations for vertical farms for enjoying proximity
    to dense

    population and major retail outlets [69]. However, the issue of affordability
    is salient in central cities

    where land and space are expensive. For example, central areas in major cities
    in Hong Kong, Australia

    (e.g., Melbourne, Sydney), United Kingdom (e.g., London) have very expensive real
    estate, which

    presents an economic difﬁculty at the commercial scale [107]. However, some major
    cities such as

    New York and Chicago have sizable stocks of vacant older properties that could
    be repurposed into

    vertical farming. This has happened in projects such as The Pant in Chicago, IL
    and AeroFarms in

    Newark, NJ [49,72].

    Overall, residential, retail, ofﬁce, and commercial uses of high-rises continue
    to be more proﬁtable

    than that by agricultural activities [95]. It seems that increasing the productivity
    of the vertical farm

    is the prime factor to make it prevail in the future. “If the yield per hectare
    for indoor farming

    is much higher than rural outdoor farming, perhaps as much as up to 50 times,
    this factor will

    eventually outweigh the initial cost of land acquisition . . . and assuming 50-fold
    improved productivity,

    the break-even point may well be an estimated 6–7 years” [106] (p. 295). Such
    production will likely

    to offset the startup costs including expensive land or rent. Another drawback
    of the vertical farm is

    inability to produce all types of crops. In fact, current vertical farms produce
    limited crops such as

    lettuce, tomatoes, strawberries, and to less extent, grape, and soy products.
    Also, produced quantities

    are too small. Martin’s research indicates an imbalance between vertical farms’
    production and their

    catchment areas, where many of population reside in these areas are underserve.
    They found that in

    the near future, urban food will continue to come from distant rural areas [98,107].

    Further, due to economic reasons, most vertical farms produce and then distribute
    leafy greens to

    restaurants, and local residents remain not the prime client. In the same manner,
    low-value agricultural

    commodities such as wheat continue to be economically unviable. Therefore, the
    current product of

    vertical farms is limited in scope and quantities. Overall, production volumes
    of vertical farms are

    small, particularly when compared to “limitless” acres of traditional farming.
    Further, scaling up

    vertical farming could be costly and complex [86,108,109].

    Another limitation is that current renewable energy sources, such as photovoltaics
    and wind

    turbine, produce little energy that would make it difﬁcult not to rely on the
    city grid. It is only the

    plants at the building’s perimeter and on the top level that could beneﬁt from
    solar radiation [34,109].

    In this regard, it is important to employ rotatable stacked arrays of plants inside
    each ﬂoor of a high-rise

    enclosure so that plants receive maximum natural light [93].

    Consequently, until now, no multi-story vertical farm tower has been built, and
    despite copious

    attempts to make this a reality, the concept of the vertical farm tower remains
    on the drawing board.

    Despommier hints at a solution by stating that “High-rise food-producing buildings
    will succeed only

    if they function by mimicking ecological process, namely by safely and efficiently
    re-cycling everything

    organic, and recycling water from human waste disposal plants, turning it back
    into drinking water” [4]

    (p. 121).

    5. Conclusions

    A plethora of research and pioneering projects has demonstrated the potential
    of vertical farming

    at the pilot scale, prototypes and at the production level. The vertical farm
    has the potential to play

    a critical role in the sustainability of food in urban areas. This is most important
    as we project

    into the future when urban population will increase signiﬁcantly. Vertical farming
    has various

    advantages over rural farming, observed within the three pillars of sustainability:
    environmental,

    social, and economic. New high-tech cultivation methods, including hydroponics,
    aeropnics and

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    30 of 36

    aquaponics, largely challenge the need for soil-based farming for a range of crops.
    Advancements

    in greenhouse and supporting technologies such as multi-racking mechanized systems,
    recycling

    systems, LED lighting, solar power, wind power, storage batteries, drones as well
    as computing

    power, software applications, databases and The Internet of Things are likely
    to coalesce into efﬁcient

    production systems in the near future. Increasingly, there is a need for interdisciplinary
    research and

    collaboration that promote collective thinking among the various disciplines involved
    in creating

    vertical farms [110–114].

    Perhaps, in the distant future, there is the prospect of developing fully automated
    vertical farms.

    And hypothetically, if vertical farms were integrated in the city, they will be
    able to supply food for

    the entire population. However, there is still a need for more developments that
    scale up projects so

    that the economic and commercial feasibility and return on investment (ROI) are
    offered at best rates.

    As such, there is a need for research that accurately assesses the ROI of various
    types and sizes of

    vertical farms. There is a need to investigate the full life-cycle analysis (LCA)
    and the number of years

    to reach parity with a traditional farm [109,115,116].

    The success of the vertical farm will depend not only on innovation in technologies
    but also on

    local conditions including demand on certain produce by population, availability
    of labors, and farming

    conditions. An effective organizational structure and sound leadership are also
    important factors.

    Creativity, stewardship, and inventiveness are critical ingredients for companies
    that venture into new

    businesses such as vertical farming. In a globalized world, competition is stiff,
    but the ﬁrst to succeed

    may gain a competitive edge [99,108,115]. As such, robust and resilient business
    models are needed

    in a world characterized by increasing complexity, nonlinearity, and “glocal”
    exchanges of goods.

    According to Copenhagen Institute for Futures Studies, Instituttet for Fremtidsforskning
    “Tomorrow’s

    innovative leader isn’t necessarily the person in front with innovative ideas,
    but the one who discovers

    the front-runners and harvests their ideas to cultivate and nourish the innovative
    environment in his

    organization” [74]. Nevertheless, interest in vertical farming will increase as
    climate change prevails

    further and available arable land per capita declines [117].

    One more serious obstacle remains; the increasing populations of developing countries.
    Do these

    countries possess the required technologies and technical expertise to implement
    the vertical farm?

    These countries are largely poor. Can we make the products of the vertical farm
    affordable to the

    poor? Furthermore, many of these poor populations live in slums, in food deserts,
    away from modern

    life. How can we make the produce of vertical farms accessible to slum populations?
    Ultimately,

    the effectiveness of vertical farming will depend on various local factors, including
    the demand and

    supply of food, urban populations and their density, technological development,
    culture and eating

    habits, water and energy supply, as well as weather conditions.

    6. Future Research

    Vertical farming is growing rapidly, and this research barely scratches the surface
    of long and

    complex endeavor. The examined projects offer catalysts to further developments.
    Future studies

    may examine other projects including, but not limited to, Green Sense Farms (Portage,
    Indiana and

    Shenzhen, China), AeroFarms (Newark, NJ, USA), Metropolis Farms (Philadelphia,
    PA, USA), Plenty

    (San Francisco, CA, USA) VerticalHarvest (Jackson, WY, USA), Lufa Farms (Montreal,
    QC, Canada),

    VertiCropTM (Vancouver, BC, Canada), and a new un-named project in Suwon, South
    Korea. Also,

    future research may examine specialized technologies and methods for various indoor
    farming systems.

    For example, hydroponic systems offer multiple methods, including Nutrient Film
    Technique (NFT),

    Wick System, Water Culture, Ebb and Flow (Flood and Drain), Drip Feed System and
    Aeroponic

    Systems. Further, there is a need for conducting quantitative research that gives
    accurate assessments

    of the beneﬁts and shortcomings of various types of vertical farms. Importantly,
    future research should

    examine the issue of affordability of advanced equipment of vertical farming to
    developing countries.

    Researchers should invent, advance, and further develop local farming techniques
    to make vertical

    farm projects feasible in these countries. For example, they may invent recycling
    methods that reduce

    Buildings 2018, 8, 24

    31 of 36

    reliance on water, design local systems by capturing rainwater, and may capitalize
    on local solar power

    for providing natural light and energy.

    \ Greenhouse cultivation has evolved from simple covered rows of open-fields crops\
    \ to highly sophisticated controlled \nenvironment agriculture (CEA) facilities\
    \ that projected the image of plant factories for urban agriculture.  The advances\
    \ and \nimprovements in CEA have promoted the scientific solutions for the efficient\
    \ production of plants in populated cities and \nmulti-story buildings.  Successful\
    \ deployment of CEA for urban agriculture requires many components and subsystems,\
    \ as \nwell as the understanding of the external influencing factors that should\
    \ be systematically considered and integrated.  This \nreview is an attempt to\
    \ highlight some of the most recent advances in greenhouse technology and CEA\
    \ in order to raise the \nawareness for technology transfer and adaptation, which\
    \ is necessary for a successful transition to urban agriculture.  This \nstudy\
    \ reviewed several aspects of a high-tech CEA system including improvements in\
    \ the frame and covering materials, \nenvironment perception and data sharing,\
    \ and advanced microclimate control and energy optimization models.  This research\
    \ \nhighlighted urban agriculture and its derivatives, including vertical farming,\
    \ rooftop greenhouses and plant factories which are \nthe extensions of CEA and\
    \ have emerged as a response to the growing population, environmental degradation,\
    \ and urbanization \nthat are threatening food security.  Finally, several opportunities\
    \ and challenges have been identified in implementing the \nintegrated CEA and\
    \ vertical farming for urban agriculture. \nKeywords: smart agriculture, greenhouse\

    \ \ntransition driven by the advances in precision technology, data \nprocessing\
    \ and smart farming.  Protected cultivations have \nchanged from simple covered\
    \ greenhouse structures to high-tech \nplant factories that optimize the productivity\
    \ of the plants and \nhuman labour.  A modern greenhouse operates as a system,\
    \ \ntherefore, it is also referred to as controlled environment agriculture \n\
    (CEA), controlled environment plant production system (CEPPS), \nor Phytomation\
    \ systems[1].  These structures use natural or \nartificial light within which\
    \ optimum growth conditions is intended \nto achieve for producing horticultural\
    \ crops, or for plant research \nprograms.  They also offer greater predictability,\
    \ reduce the cost \nof production and increase crop yields.  A comprehensive history\
    \ \nof greenhouses in the past three decades can be found in the works \nof [2-6].\
    \  Examples of earlier works in automation and computer \ncontrol of greenhouse\
    \ environment are showed in [7-9].  Previous \nstudies on greenhouse engineering\
    \ during the 1990s have been \nreviewed by Hanan[10] and Critten and Bailey[11].\
    \ \nThe United Nations has predicted that by 2050, more than \ntwo-thirds of the\
    \ nine billion world population will live in the cities.  \nSecuring the supply\
    \ chain of fresh fruits and vegetables in this new \nscenario will be an overwhelming\
    \ challenge.  If properly designed, \n2   January, 2018                      \

    \                Vol. 11 No.1 \nmanaged, and operated, CEA by means of agri-cubes\
    \ and plant \nfactories can significantly contribute to this context for the \n\
    year-round production of fresh vegetables in urban areas.  For \nsuch a system\
    \ to operate successfully and achieve its production \nobjectives, attention needs\
    \ to be paid to the technical aspects of \nautomation (A), culture (C), environment\
    \ (E) and system (SYS).  \nTing et al.[1] defined ACESYS terms as follow: Automation\
    \ is the \nprocessing of information and execution of tasks for operation of \n\
    CEA through computerized instrumentations and various control \nalgorithms that\
    \ might include decision support programs and \nartificial intelligence.  The\
    \ cultural and environmental factors \ncomprise \ncultivation \ntechniques, \n\
    plants \ncharacteristics, \nmicroclimate requirements and growth responses.  It\
    \ also contains \nmorphological and physiological conditions such as “multiplication,\
    \ \nrooting, transplanting, pruning, water and nutrient delivery, \npesticide\
    \ application, harvesting, post-harvest processing, etc”.  \nTing et al.[1] stated\
    \ that “Systems analysis and integration is a \nmethodology that starts with the\
    \ definition of a system and its goals, \nand leads to the conclusion regarding\
    \ the system’s workability, \nproductivity, reliability, and other performance\
    \ indicators.” \nResearch trends in this field are toward innovative methods for\
    \ \nshifting from conventional greenhouses to smart controlled \nenvironments\
    \ that benefit from natural resources for eliminating \ndeleterious external conditions.\
    \  The ultimate objective in this \nregard would be achieving high yield and high-quality\
    \ fruits at \nminimum possible cost. \nInnovations in the low-cost and low-power\
    \ consumption \nsensors and instrumentations, communication devices, data \nprocessing\
    \ and mobile applications, along with the technological \nadvances in the design\
    \ structures, simulation models, and \nhorticultural engineering have provided\
    \ the state-of-the-art \nfacilities that are shifting the traditional CEA to plant\
    \ factories for \nurban farming.  This paper begins with a summary of several\
    \ \nreviewed literature in Section 2 on the advances in greenhouse \ncovering\
    \ materials, artificial light, and the efficiency of the \nmicroclimate controller\
    \ for a viable CEA system.  This part aimed \nto investigate the effects of the\
    \ existing and new covering materials \non the resulting microclimate (including\
    \ influencing factors and \ntheir interactions with cultural practices), plants\
    \ growth, and yield.  \nModeling of CEA, as well as object-oriented automation-culture-\
    \ \nenvironment system analysis that is presented in the works of Ting \net al.[1]\
    \ provide a systematic approach for a better understanding of \nthese influencing\
    \ factors.  These findings and their implications in \na modern CAE such as plant\
    \ factories and agri-cubes are further \ndiscussed in Section 5.  After that,\
    \ environmental monitoring and \nperception by means of wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSN) and \ninternet of things-based (IoT-based) platforms have been \ndemonstrated\
    \ and reviewed as an essential part of an automation \nsystem.  In our opinion,\
    \ the three biggest challenges for the \ndevelopment of an efficient and viable\
    \ CEA system are the creation \nof automation levels for energy management, reduction\
    \ of \nenvironmental impact, and maximizing use of natural resources.  \nA comprehensive\
    \ review of the advances in environmental control \nmethods, energy optimization\
    \ models, prediction tools, and \ndecision support systems are provided in Section\
    \ 4.  Specifically, \nthe applications of different high-level algorithms for\
    \ the most \nefficient microclimate control solutions are highlighted in Section\
    \ \n4.1.  These control methods and automation phases have been \nreviewed to\
    \ illustrate how each part can facilitate achieving the \noverall objectives of\
    \ a CEA.  A summary of some of the research \nworks in the past decade on energy\
    \ analysis, artificial intelligence, \nand simulation models with applications\
    \ in different aspects of \ngreenhouse production are presented in Sections 4.2\
    \ and 4.3.  A \nsubstantial amount of research has been done on individual aspects\
    \ \nof automation, culture, and environment, as well as their \ncombination, however\
    \ improvements of CEA also require decision \nsupport systems (DSS) and assessment\
    \ tools for long-term risk \nmanagement by accurately determining the interactions\
    \ between \nclimate parameters and growth responses prior to the actual \ncultivation[12].\
    \  To identify technological pathways for energy \nefficient CEA, a survey was\
    \ performed in Section 4.4 to highlight \nsome of the improved solutions based\
    \ on decision support systems \nfor energy management strategies in the commercial\
    \ greenhouses.  \nIn Section 5, the research covered urban agriculture and the\
    \ \ndevelopment of plant factories and vertical farming which is \ngrowing rapidly\
    \ in the East and Southeast Asia, most noticeably in \nJapan, South Korea, Taiwan\
    \ Province of China, and Malaysia, and \nreviewed several conceptual designs such\
    \ as the rooftop \ngreenhouses to highlight how various research and educational\
    \ \ninstitutes, real estate developers, and construction companies are \ninvolved\
    \ in the emerged opportunities.   \n2  Considerations for viability \nSeveral\
    \ factors to be considered in designing of a viable \ngreenhouse system for producing\
    \ year-round crops and \nvegetables are the structure frame, landscape, topography,\
    \ soil, \nclimate conditions, microclimate control system, light condition, \n\
    intercepted solar radiation, windbreaks, the availability of \nelectricity, roadways,\
    \ and labor force.  Other conditions that \nshould also be taken into account\
    \ for an efficient large-scale \ncommercial greenhouse production[13,14] are the\
    \ environment, \neconomic and social factors.  For example, a modern greenhouse\
    \ \nstructure might be constructed within a commercial building or \nnear commercial\
    \ or residential lands.  Some of the most popular \ngreenhouse structures and\
    \ CEA are presented in Figure 1. There \nare numerous experimental and analytical\
    \ research works that \naddress how environmental parameters inside a greenhouse\
    \ is \naffected by the structural design and shape, volume size, \ndimensions,\
    \ plants density, covering films, structure material, \nwind speed, geographical\
    \ orientation, and most importantly the \nmicroclimate control system.  For example,\
    \ in regions where \nsolar radiation or ambient air temperatures are high, several\
    \ \ndesign factors for optimum air exchange such as the ratio of the \narea of\
    \ the vent openings to the ground area covered by the \ngreenhouse, the ratio\
    \ of the greenhouse volume to the floor area, \nand the vertical distance between\
    \ the air inlets and air outlets can \nsignificantly improve the ventilation performance.\
    \  Optimization \nof vent configuration by evaluating greenhouse and plant canopy\
    \ \nventilation rates under wind-induced ventilation has been studied \nby Kacira\
    \ et al.[15].  This section provides a summary of the \nresearch works that have\
    \ addressed improvements in covering \nmaterials, and microclimate control systems.\
    \  To avoid \noverlapping of the contexts and maintain a consistent flow of the\
    \ \ntopics, we have covered the advances in structure design (i.e., \nrooftop\
    \ greenhouses) as a separate subsection under urban \nagriculture. \nJanuary,\

    \ \n \n2.1  Covering materials \nConsiderations for greenhouses covering materials\
    \ involve \nsupporting foundation, shape and framing materials, geographical \n\
    direction for optimal light entrance, the load of equipment, factors \nfor static\
    \ and dynamic loads (i.e., hanging plants, structure weight, \nand wind speed),\
    \ dimension ratio, and volume.  Greenhouses \nstructures and covering can take\
    \ different forms which can be used \nto surround the whole or a section of the\
    \ cultivation area and space.  \nThe most dominant transparent materials in use\
    \ are 2-3 mm glass \npanels, net-screen film, and  0.1 mm and 0.2 mm Polyethylene\
    \ \n(PE) plastic films, and ultraviolet (UV) stabilized PE-films.  \nBaudoin et\
    \ al.[16] recommended that in order to obtain a reasonable \nheat rise of less\
    \ than 4°C in a glass-clad greenhouse, the airflow \nrate should be 0.04-0.05\
    \ m3/s of floor area (1 m2).  Selection of \ncovering material for a greenhouse\
    \ depends on its application, the \ntype of crop to be cultivated, and the climate\
    \ condition of the \nregion.  It can vary from simple covers such as one layer\
    \ plastic[17,18], \ndouble-wall plastic[19,20], and glass[21,22], to fiberglass[23,24],\
    \ \ndouble-wall plastic, acrylic sheet[25], polyethylene film[26-29], \npolyvinyl\
    \ \nchloride \n(PVC)[30], \ncopolymers[31], \nPolycarbonate \npanels[32], and\
    \ selective transmission medium[33,34] for different \nspectral frequencies. \
    \ Some of these materials are designed to trap \nenergy inside the greenhouse\
    \ and heats both plants zone and its \nsurroundings.  Detailed properties of these\
    \ covering, as well as the \nquality assessments of their mechanical properties,\
    \ have been \naddressed in detail by a study on the effects of cover diffusive\
    \ \nproperties on the components of greenhouse solar radiation[34]. \nCondensation,\
    \ radiation transmittance and diffusing properties \nof different types of transmitting\
    \ covering materials in greenhouses \nhave been discussed by Pollet et al.[35].\
    \  Glazing materials allow \nshorter-wavelength radiation (i.e. visible light)\
    \ to pass through, but \nlong wavelength radiation such as infrared (heat) is\
    \ trapped inside \nthe greenhouse.  A comparison between different greenhouse\
    \ \ncovering materials, including polyethylene film, photo-selective red \ncolor\
    \ film, and insect-proof net for tomato cultivation during \nsummer is available\
    \ in the works of Arcidiacono et al.[36] and \nHemming et al.[37] Jarquín-Enríquez\
    \ et al.[38] studied the effects of \ndouble layer plastic and flat glass cover\
    \ on the lycopene \naccumulation and color index during tomato fruit ripening.\
    \  They \nconcluded that lycopene biosynthesis in tomato fruits was increased\
    \ \nby the amount of light after the beginning of ripening growth stage.  \nStudying\
    \ the effect of greenhouse covering materials on the inside \nair temperature\
    \ under tropical climate condition showed that while \noutside temperature was\
    \ between 28°C-33°C, the temperature \ninside \na \npolyethylene \nfilm \ncovered\
    \ \ngreenhouse \nwithout \nenvironment control reached 68°C-70°C, leading to air\
    \ vapor \npressure deficit (VPD) of 4 kPa[39].  Al-Mahdouri et al.[40] \nevaluated\
    \ optical properties and thermal performances of different \ngreenhouse covering\
    \ materials.  The combinations of external \nclimate conditions and type of greenhouse\
    \ for the most appropriate \napplication have been studied by Kempkes et al.[41]\
    \ A computer \napplication to measure geometric characterization and dimensions\
    \ \nof insect-proof screens was designed by Álvarez et al.[42].  \nPolythene-clad\
    \ greenhouses do not become as hot because of the \ntransparency of the plastic\
    \ to long-wave radiation that is \ntransmitted back out of the greenhouse.  Therefore,\
    \ for a \npolythene-film covered greenhouse, the ventilation rate can be \nreduced\
    \ to 0.03-0.04 m3/s of floor area (1 m2)[43].  With \ngreenhouse shading, the\
    \ amount of solar radiation and light \nintensity reaching the plants is restricted,\
    \ creating a closed \ndifference between air temperature inside and outside the\
    \ \ngreenhouse.  Shading also decreases leaf surface temperature \nsignificantly.\
    \  According to Glenn et al.[44], while a 20% to 80% \nlight reduction can be\
    \ expected depending on the shading materials, \nthe sufficient light reduction\
    \ for most greenhouse applications is \nbetween 30% and 50%.  Hassanien and Li[45]\
    \ investigated the \nmicroclimate parameters and growth responses of lettuce plants\
    \ \ninside a greenhouse that was shaded with semi-transparent \nmono-crystalline\
    \ silicon double glazing photovoltaic panels \n(STPV).  The STPV panels of their\
    \ study accounted for 20% of \nthe greenhouse roof area, and showed that the combination\
    \ of \nSTPV and polyethylene cover decreased the solar radiation by 35% \nto 40%\
    \ compared to the use of polyethylene cover.  They also \nshowed that the STPV\
    \ shading decreased the air temperature by \n4   January, 2018               \

    \ effect on the relative \nhumidity, fresh weight, leaf area and the chlorophyll\
    \ contents under \nnatural ventilation. \nProtected cultivation of Solanaceous\
    \ crops such as tomatoes \nand peppers by means of Screen-houses operating on\
    \ natural \nventilation is now a commonly practiced in tropical lowlands for \n\
    reducing insect migration, the risk of damage by high rainfall, \nextreme solar\
    \ radiation, and high wind speeds.  In addition, by \nusing insect-proof net covered\
    \ greenhouse, the inside and outside \ntemperature may remain similar, while temperature\
    \ has been \nobserved to be rising with the photo-selective film during summer.\
    \  \nStudies showed that net-screen greenhouses have gained more \npopularity\
    \ in tropical regions due to the potential of climate \nparameters that have optimality\
    \ degrees close to the plants desired \nlevels.  Shamshiri[46] observed that under\
    \ an insect-proof \nnet-screen covered greenhouse operating on natural ventilation,\
    \ the \ninside and outside air temperature remained close to each other, \nwhile\
    \ the air temperature was found to increase inside two \nphoto-selective film\
    \ covered greenhouses (polycarbonate panel and \na polyethylene covered) operating\
    \ on evaporative cooling[39].  \nShading nets ease the natural ventilation process\
    \ and can protect \nplants from excessive sunlight, wind, and heavy rains.  Lorenzo\
    \ et \nal.[47] reported that movable shade under intense sunlight in Spain \n\
    caused 10% increase in the marketable yield of greenhouse tomato.  \nOther reports\
    \ indicated that external and internal shading nets \nreduced horizontal and vertical\
    \ gradients in air temperature \ncompared with those without shading nets[48].\
    \  Results of a study \non the effect of roof height of a large screen-house on\
    \ the \nventilation rate using one-dimensional computational model and \npreliminary\
    \ measurements showed that increasing roof height by 2 \nm increases both temperature\
    \ and humidity levels in the canopy \nlayer[49].  Microclimate, air velocity,\
    \ ventilation efficiency, and \nlight transmittance are mainly influenced by the\
    \ properties of the \nnet-screen mesh and the greenhouse shape.  While these structures\
    \ \nenhance natural ventilation in hot and humid climate conditions, \nthey still\
    \ require strong shelters for protecting plants from extreme \nsolar radiation,\
    \ rain, and strong winds.  The screen-house itself is \nan important pest protection\
    \ device, provided it is equipped with \nfine mesh screens in all openings, and\
    \ a double-door system. \n2.2  Light control and artificial lights \nThe main\
    \ approaches for controlling light level and the \nintercepted radiance in CEA\
    \ are through planted density, shading \nscreens, and artificial lights.  Light\
    \ condition and air temperature \nare the two most important environmental factors\
    \ for plants growth.  \nIn fact, discussions about optimal air temperature without\
    \ including \nlight condition and plant evapotranspiration does not generate any\
    \ \nuseful data for maximizing yield and producing high-quality \nvegetable. \
    \ Light and air temperature are intrinsically related and \nit is a well-known\
    \ fact that one cannot be optimized without \nconsidering the other.  For example,\
    \ tomato quality, including \nyield, productivity and lycopene value is not only\
    \ affected by the \nmicroclimate parameters and cultural experience, but with\
    \ the \nPhotosynthetic Photon Flux Density (PPFD).  In fact, it is the \noptimal\
    \ combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and light \nthat will result\
    \ in maximum yield (assuming that other factors such \nas CO2, soil pH, and nutrient\
    \ are not limiting).  A schematic \ndiagram is presented in Figure 2 to illustrate\
    \ the effects of light \nspectral, intensity and photoperiod on plant growth,\

    modern greenhouses and CEAs are incandescent/halogen lamps, \ndischarge lamps\
    \ (such as fluorescent light tubes, Metal Halide, \nand high-pressure sodium lamps),\
    \ and the Light-emitting diodes \n(LEDs).  Among these, LEDs have gained significant\
    \ popularity \nin the research and development communities due to their \nadvantages\
    \ such as cost efficiency, compact design, durability, \nlight quality, and low\
    \ thermal energy generation.  Research on \nLEDs as a substitute for plant growth\
    \ began in 1980s; however it \nwas only after mid-2000s that they became economically\
    \ feasible \nfor large scale commercial production.  These devices reduce \nthe\
    \ costs of electricity by using plant from effectual \nJanuary, 2018         \

    \ located close to the \nplants, allows the structure of various layers of plant\
    \ production \nto stack vertically in CEA, while decreasing the costs of cooling\
    \ \ncompared with other artificial light sources.  Nowadays the \nfunctional costs\
    \ of LEDs are a high-priority study and advance \nsubject for upcoming greenhouse-based\
    \ plant factories.  In the \ncase of tomatoes, shading affects biosynthesis and\
    \ carotene level \nof lycopene.  According to the study of Cockshull et al.[50],\
    \ plant \nfactory yield will be reduced by 20% by utilizing a cover with \n23%\
    \ shade.  Yields also will be enriched with color shaded in \nplant factories\
    \ in hot weathers.  Yet, color shades can be \ndisadvantageous in areas with limited\
    \ sunlight hours in cloudy \nand cold climates.  In fact, choosing suitable planting\
    \ density \ncan increase crop water output and improve light capture.  On \nthe\
    \ other hand, the planting density has an effect on the harvest of \ntomato in\
    \ greenhouse growing system and evapotranspiration \n(ET)[51].  According to the\
    \ reports of several studies, factors \nsuch as numbers of flowering, fruits location\
    \ in per plant and \nsingle fruit weight were all lesser with more density of\
    \ planting, \ntherefore, resulting in lesser harvests[52-54].  In another study,\
    \ Ilić \net al.[55] showed that in the tomato factory, by using red shade \nnetting\
    \ techniques the lycopene content highly increased, \nhowever, these fruits had\
    \ minor carotene content.  Maximum \nproduction of tomato by percentages of covering\
    \ are described \nunder 40% by El-Aidy and El-Afry[56] and 35% by El-Gizawy et\
    \ \nal.[57] Moreover, El-Gizawy et al.[57] claimed that by increasing \ncovering\
    \ intensity, the production of tomato will increase up to \n51%.  The soil surface\
    \ will lose its moisture in plants faster by \nabsorbing the more radiant energy,\
    \ but, the high density of \ntomato plants caused less radiation at the soil surface[52].\
    \ \n2.3  Efficiency of microclimate controller \nAn efficient greenhouse requires\
    \ environment control for air \nquality, disease reduction, pest control, and\
    \ nutrient and water \nuptake.  The inputs and outs of a greenhouse system are\
    \ shown \nschematically in Figure 3.  The quality of air is governed by \nfactors\
    \ such as air and root-zone temperature, humidity, carbon \ndioxide, air movement,\
    \ dust, odors and disease agents.  Other \nvariables in the greenhouse environment\
    \ that affect plant’s life are \nlight condition, soil feeding solution pH and\
    \ electrical conductivity.  \nThese parameters and the problems associated with\
    \ each have been \nextensively discussed by several textbooks, see for example\
    \ \nHochmuth and Hochmuth[58], Cherie[59] and Jones[60].  Plant \ngrowth responses\
    \ to other influencing factors and climate changes \nsuch as carbon dioxide and\
    \ wind speed have been discussed in the \ntextbook of Morison and Morecroft[61].\
    \  In general, microclimate \nparameters in a CEA are manipulated by passive and\
    \ active \nventilation, \nevaporative \ncooling \ntechniques, \nshadings, \nand\
    \ \nrefrigeration dehumidification.  Several methods based on the \nFans Assessment\
    \ Numeration System (FANS) for evaluation of the \nventilation performance and\
    \ suggestions for the energy efficiency \nof greenhouse fans are presented in\
    \ [62].  It should be noted that \nthe high operating costs of air-conditioners\
    \ make them impractical \nfor commercial application. \n \nFigure 3  Inputs and\
    \ outputs of controlled environment agriculture \n \nThe efficiency of active\
    \ systems, i.e., fan and pad evaporative \ncooling, has been widely studied and\
    \ modeled for modular \ngreenhouses that use mechanical ventilation[63,64], but\
    \ research \nworks on their use alongside natural ventilation in greenhouses in\
    \ \nsemiarid climates are narrow[65].  Reports showed that when \nventilation\
    \ fan belts were adjusted to the proper tension, the fan \nspeed and airflow rate\
    \ were respectively 13.1% and 30.1% higher \nthan those of original belts[62].\
    \  The same study also reports that \nthe daily average energy consumption for\
    \ the ventilation fan with \nthe original loose belts was 20.4% higher than that\
    \ with the \nadjusted belts when the pad was not working, and 24.2% higher \n\
    with pad working.  There are theoretical and experimental studies \nwhich compare\
    \ the effects of fogging and fixed shading systems on \nthe Mediterranean greenhouse\
    \ climate[66]; however, the assessment \nof mobile shading is not well documented.\
    \  In order to determine \nthe size of fans and pads for evaporative cooling,\
    \ the volume of the \ngreenhouse needs to be calculated.  An air exchange (m3/min)\
    \ of 1 \nto 1.5 times of the greenhouse volume is recommended every \nminute[16].\
    \  The number of fans should be selected based on the air \nexchange and by taking\
    \ into account that their placement should \nnot be spaced more than 7.6 m apart.\
    \  According to Duan et al.[67], \na properly operated typical swamp cooler has\
    \ the potential to cool \nair within 3°C to 4°C of the wet-bulb temperature. \
    \ These units \ncost less than air-conditioner and consume 60% to 80% less \n\
    electricity; however, they are only practical for small greenhouses \nin hot dry\
    \ regions.  Another form of evaporative cooling is \nmisting which reduces plant\
    \ moisture loss and leaf transpiration by \nreducing its temperature due to evaporative\
    \ cooling.  Misting is \n6   January, 2018                         Int J Agric\

    \  Vol. 11 No.1 \ncategorized into low-pressure and high-pressure (also known\
    \ as \nfog-cooling).  In fog-cooling systems, high-pressure water is \npassed\
    \ through nozzles with orifice sizes usually less than 10 μm.  \nA fan then blows\
    \ the extremely small droplets of water into \ngreenhouse air and reduces temperature\
    \ through an evaporative \nprocess.  These systems are usually used in greenhouse\
    \ cooling \nfor seed germination and propagation.  A major drawback of this \n\
    method is that it creates high humidity climate inside canopies \nwhich facilitates\
    \ the development of bacterial diseases, such as \nalgae and botrytis.  Several\
    \ recommendations for obtaining \nbetter cooling results with misting are available\
    \ in the work of \nSchnelle and Dole[68].  Low and high-pressure fogging systems\
    \ \nin a naturally ventilated greenhouse have been studied and \ncompared by Li\
    \ and Willits[69], suggesting that compared to the \nlow-pressure fogging system,\
    \ the average evaporation efficiency \nfor the high-pressure system was at least\
    \ 64% greater.  \nMoreover, the cooling efficiency of the high-pressure system\
    \ was \nat least 28% greater than for the low-pressure system.  \nDetermination\
    \ of cooling efficiencies for misting and fogging \nsystems is available in the\
    \ work of Abdel-Ghany and Kozai[70].  \nThe efficiency of an evaporative cooling\
    \ system is calculated by \nout\ncool\nout\nwb\nT\nT\nη\nT\nT\n\n\n\n as given\
    \ in the ASABE standards[71].  Here, Tout \nis the outdoor air temperature, °C;\
    \ Tcool is the temperature of air \nexiting the cooling pad, °C, and Twb is the\
    \ wet-bulb temperature \nof the outside air, °C. \nMeasurement and data analysis\
    \ for greenhouse evaporative \ncooling are discussed in the work of Kittas et\
    \ al.[72] A decrease in \nair temperature by 4°C to 5°C inside a greenhouse with\
    \ \npad-and-fan evaporative cooling is reported by Jain and Tiwari[73].  \nPerformance\
    \ of a two-stage pad cooling system in broiler houses \nwas analyzed by Petek\
    \ et al.[74] showing that the resulting air \ntemperature and relative humidity\
    \ were significantly lower than \nthose of the traditional system.  A thermal\
    \ model for prediction of \nmicroclimate factors inside a greenhouse with mechanical\
    \ \nventilation and the evaporative cooling system was introduced by \nWillits[75].\
    \  Their results suggested that in the presence of \nevaporative cooling, increasing\
    \ canopy size is more influential in \nreducing air temperature.  They also concluded\
    \ that without \nevaporative cooling pads, the ratio of energy used for transpiration\
    \ \nto incoming solar energy (known as the evapotranspiration \ncoefficient) is\
    \ predicted to range from 1-75 for an outdoor air \ntemperature of 36.8°C and\
    \ a humidity ratios of 3.3 g/kg, to 0.8°C \nfor an outdoor humidity ratio of 29.9\
    \ g/kg at the same air \ntemperature.  In another study, Max et al.[76] investigated\
    \ the \neffects of greenhouse cooling methods, including mechanical \nventilation\
    \ and evaporative cooling, on yield and quality of tomato \nin tropical climates.\
    \  It was found that the proportion of \nmarketable yield was significantly higher\
    \ in a net-screen covered \ngreenhouse with mechanical ventilation, and the quantity\
    \ of \nundersized and blossom-end rot affected fruits was reduced in \npolyethylene\
    \ film covered greenhouse with the evaporative cooling \nmethod.  The researchers\
    \ then concluded that in regions with high \nrelative humidity, evaporative cooling\
    \ without customized \nadjustments for dehumidification will not improve closed-field\
    \ \nproduction of tomato. \nPassive cooling methods, including natural ventilation\
    \ and \nshading, are widely practiced in greenhouses, especially those in \ntropical\
    \ regions, by means of non-adjustable, manually adjustable, \nor automatically\
    \ controlled.  Natural ventilation is caused by the \nstack effect, wind ventilation,\
    \ or both.  Ventilation for air \ntemperature control is efficient only when outside\
    \ air temperature \nof the greenhouse is less than inside.  Some of the factors\
    \ to be \ntaken into account for designing of a proper naturally ventilated \n\
    greenhouse are the location of the structure, insulation, ceiling \nslope and\
    \ ventilation openings.  Various references have \nconcluded that using natural\
    \ ventilation, it is more difficult to \nuniformly distribute fresh air in wider\
    \ greenhouse structures[77,78].  \nA comprehensive review of ventilation systems\
    \ is available in the \nworks of Ganguly and Ghosh[79].  The air inlet and outlet\
    \ size for \nnatural ventilation are determined based on stack effect theory as\
    \ \nexpressed by the Equation (1).   The steady-state heat balance for \ndetermination\
    \ of maximum ventilation rate requires heat gains to \nbe equal to heat losses\
    \ and is given by Equation (2).  This \nequation is used to determine: (i) the\
    \ required ventilation rate to \nmaintain a given inside temperature for a given\
    \ heater capacity; (ii) \nthe minimum outside temperature (balance temperature)\
    \ to \nmaintain the desired inside temperature without using supplemental \nheat\
    \ (qh=0) at a given ventilation rate; and (iii) the size of heater \nrequired\
    \ to maintain the desired inside temperature for a given \nventilation rate and\

    \  Wireless sensor networks \nResearch and development in greenhouses in the early\
    \ 2000s \nbegan to adopt wireless communication technology for monitoring, \n\
    sending early warning messages, and remote control using \nsimplified rules. \
    \ One of the earliest reports of WSN application in \ngreenhouse environment monitoring\
    \ can be found in the work of \nSerôdio \net \nal.[92] \n \nThe \ncompact \nsize,\
    \ \nreliability, \nand \ncost-effectiveness of WSN modules, as well as flexibility\
    \ for \ndeveloping custom applications besides easy installation, have \nmade\
    \ this technology gain attention and popularity for monitoring \nand control in\
    \ open-field[93,94] and in closed-field environment \nagriculture. \n \nSource:\
    \ www.AdaptiveAgroTech.com. \nFigure 4  General components and instrumentations\
    \ in a typical greenhouse environmental monitoring \n \nAn interesting application\
    \ of WSN in greenhouse includes CO2 \nmanagement[95] and multipoint measurements\
    \ of microclimate for \nmonitoring spatial gradients and three-dimensional changes\
    \ in \nparameters during the cultivation process[96].  For example, Ji et \nal.[97]\
    \ developed a WSN for precision control of CO2 fertilizer with \nan improved method\
    \ for prediction of tomato photosynthetic rate.  \nA computerized horticulture\
    \ data management system that is \naddressed in [92] was developed by implementing\
    \ WSN, controller \narea \nnetwork \n(CAN), \nand \nseveral \ninternet \nand \n\
    email \ncommunication tools, and was able to support distributed data \nmonitoring\
    \ and control inside the greenhouse environment.  \nMorais et al.[93] reported\
    \ the architecture of a WSN platform called \nMPWiNodeZ, a mesh-type array of\
    \ acquisition devices that was \ndesigned based on ZigBee multi-powered wireless\
    \ acquisition \ndevice for the purpose of remote sensing applications in precision\
    \ \nhorticulture.  A remarkable advantage of this platform is the \npower management\
    \ capability that allows the system to \ncontinuously operate in large coverage\
    \ areas where connection \nstability and power sources are a concern.  A simple\
    \ deterministic \nWSN based on IEEE 802.15.4 and XMesh protocol for online \n\
    monitoring and control of air temperature and relative humidity \nwith several\
    \ sensors nodes that were placed inside the greenhouse \nin a uniform gridded\
    \ topology is presented in the work of Pahuja et \nal.[98]  The authors used a\
    \ network health analyzer and found that \nwhile the data reliability was 100%,\
    \ their network mean packet \nreliability was between 75%-100% due to the packet\
    \ losses.  This \nfailure can be related to the canopy coverage and sensors occluded\
    \ \nby the dense plantation which reduces the signal strength of the \nnodes.\
    \  This network was integrated into a multiple inputs and \nmultiple outputs fuzzy\
    \ logic based controller and an RS-485 \nactuator network to manipulate the greenhouse\
    \ vapor pressure \ndeficit.  Prima et al.[91] developed and evaluated a simple\
    \ and \nflexible remote environmental monitoring and control based on a \ncloud\
    \ platform.  They implemented a local-global management \nstrategy supporting\
    \ synchronization of online and offline system \nconfiguration, actuation, and\
    \ offline management to respond to the \nunstable network connection in the rural\
    \ area.  They tested the \nfunctionality of their system during a 10-day data\
    \ collection period \nfor automated monitoring of soil moisture content and fertigation\
    \ \ncontrol in tomato cultivation.  Their results showed that under \nunstable\
    \ network, the system only had 0.78% error, and provided \n99.2% in-range soil\
    \ moisture content measurement, which shows \nthe potential for long-term microclimate\
    \ monitoring application in \ngreenhouses.   \nAn important consideration in designing\
    \ of an efficient WSN \nfor the greenhouse is the number of nodes, their location,\
    \ distances \nbetween nodes, antenna and the operating frequency based on the\
    \ \ngreenhouse microclimate condition.  Studies showed that radio \nwave propagation\
    \ is strongly affected by the high greenhouse \nenvironment[99].  Several other\
    \ connectivity issues with WSN in \nthe greenhouse have been addressed in [100]\
    \ using connection \nmatrix to estimate the network connectivity in the disconnected\
    \ \nspots.  For this purpose, Chen et al.[100] established a remote \nmonitoring\
    \ \nsystem \nin \nan \nexperimental \ngreenhouse using \nZigBee-based WSN which\
    \ could monitor air temperature, humidity \nand light intensity as well as the\

    \ a smart \ntype-2 fuzzy logic based control system to manage the greenhouse \n\
    microclimate with attention to the effectiveness, the energy use and \nthe production\
    \ costs.  They integrated an observer and smart \nautomation system into the control\
    \ process by using a wireless data \nmonitoring platform enabling a distance data\
    \ measurement.  Their \nmethod also provided a real-time data access and building\
    \ database \nthat can be used for future enhancement of the system accuracy and\
    \ \ndecisions making.  The efficiency of their proposed monitoring \nand control\
    \ system was validated through a comparative study by \nevaluating the energy\
    \ saving (22%), and the water use (33%). \n3.2  IoT-based monitoring \nThe traditional\
    \ data monitoring techniques in greenhouse \nfrequently suffer from lack of sharing\
    \ and availability, great \nlabor-intensity, low spatiotemporal resolution, a\
    \ lack of data \ncentralization, and organizational management in observing the\
    \ \nenvironmental aspects of a greenhouse.  The IoT offers an \nexcellent opportunity\
    \ not only in greenhouse environment \nmonitoring but as a method for non-destructive\
    \ quantification of \nphysiological factors of the cultivated plants to be shared\
    \ within a \nnetwork of other greenhouse producers.  The potential \ngreenhouse\

    \  General components of a greenhouse environmental monitoring based in wireless\
    \ sensor network and IoT concept \n \nThe main element in the IoT is the network,\
    \ which has made \npossible a breakthrough in data communication and sharing for\
    \ \ngreenhouse monitoring and control.  It contains several physical \nitems,\
    \ software, and sensors that are linked with wires or wirelessly \nthrough standard\
    \ communication protocols[103].  Both academic \nand industry sections have shown\
    \ interest in greenhouse \napplications of IoT[104].  In fact, IoT has been used\
    \ in many areas \nof researchers, such as: smart city[105], agriculture[106,107]\
    \ and \nhealthcare[108-110], and is changing the traditional farming \nobservation\
    \ approaches by quickly providing quantitative data with \neffective spatiotemporal\
    \ resolution.  For example, long-term past \ninformation collected by IoT applications\
    \ can be an offer to a local \ngreenhouse community to conduct combined pest and\
    \ disease \nmanagement agendas in order to stop spreading of the associated \n\
    damages.  These data can also improve cultural practices and \ndecision making\
    \ plans[107].  An application of this technology can \nbe found in the work of\
    \ Liao et al.[111] who developed an IoT \nmonitoring system to simultaneously\
    \ screen the growth condition \nof Phalaenopsis and the environmental features\
    \ of an orchid plant \nfactory.  For example, Peng et al.[112] showed that by\
    \ using a \nspectroscopic and spectrometer investigation can correctly provide\
    \ \nthe total of orchid chlorophyll.   \nMoreover, Lin and Hsu[113] applied a\
    \ chlorophyll fluorometer \nin their study.  The monitored the photosynthetic\
    \ status of \nPhalaenopsis under diverse lighting situations.  Although the \n\
    physiological analysis is often occupied manually, these \nexamination approaches\
    \ need tools with perfect accuracy to \nnondestructively \ndegree \nphysiological\
    \ \nfactors \nof \norchids.  \nFurthermore, because of the cost, farmers will\
    \ not use highly \nprecise tools to measure physiological factors of orchids.\
    \  With \nscalability and flexibility of IoT, growers can have an excellent \n\
    opportunity to meet such observing demands[109]. \n4  Environmental control and\

    \   9 \ntechniques for greenhouse environment can be found in the works \nof Caponetto\
    \ et al.[114], Pan et al.[115], Lin[116], Castañeda-Miranda et \nal.[117] and\
    \ Xu et al.[118] Recent advances in computer simulation \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ have worked their way into greenhouse \nenvironment modeling and predictions.\
    \  Identifications and \nmodellings of different parameters in greenhouses have\
    \ been topics \nof numerous research works that aimed at improving production\
    \ \nefficiency (i.e., higher yield and quality, maximum return) by \nevaluating\
    \ and adjusting microclimate parameters and modeling of \nmicrometeorology[119,120].\
    \  The level of approaches vary from \nsimple models and timer-based feedback\
    \ controls[121,122] to more \nadvanced solutions, such as model-free control strategy[123],\
    \ \nnonlinear control methods[124], adaptive control and adaptive \nmanagement\
    \ framework[120,125], robust[126], optimal control[127-132], \nenergy balance\
    \ models[133], and model-based predictive control[134].  \nAn important drawback\
    \ in utilizing advanced control methods in a \nCEA is the difficulty in developing\
    \ the dynamic model to simulate \nthe behavior of the variables.  Ultimately,\
    \ the goal of any of these \ncontrol systems is to minimize the input cost per\
    \ unit of production \nand to increase the return by achieving high yield and\
    \ quality. \nThe success of greenhouse systems analysis relies on the \neffective\
    \ use of information.  To meet these requirements, various \ncontrol strategies\
    \ based on complex algorithms of artificial \nintelligence have been discussed\
    \ in the literature.  For example, \nfuzzy systems have achieved significant results\
    \ in the area of \nprecision irrigation[135] and microclimate control.  Several\
    \ \ntechniques and approaches have been presented, including \ninverting \nfuzzy\
    \ \nmodel[136], \nreconfigurable \nadaptive \nfuzzy \nfault-hiding \ncontrol[137],\
    \ \nTakagiSugeno \nfuzzy \nmodeling[138], \nconventional fuzzy logic control for\
    \ smart greenhouses[102], and \ndecentralized decoupling fuzzy logic controller[139].\
    \  These \nsolutions have shown a more effective set-point tracking compared \n\
    with \nthe \nconventional \nPID \ncontrollers. \n \nFor \nexample, \nEl-Madbouly\
    \ et al.[137] designed an active fault-tolerant control \nsystem to fix of the\
    \ device or sensor errors in weather system of a \ngreenhouse.  This control scheme\
    \ involves a self-tuned fuzzy \nproportional-integral \n(PI) \ncontrol \nscheme,\
    \ \na \nstrong \nfault-hiding-based reconfigurable controller that can fix the\
    \ faulty \neffects, and a reliable and sensitive observer-based fault detection\
    \ \nand diagnosis (FDD) system for diverse kinds of errors in the \npresence of\
    \ scheme disorderliness.  A set of practical actuators \nand sensors were applied\
    \ in this method to renovate the closed-loop \nconsistency and also to confirm\
    \ correct tracking of resource inputs.  \nAzaza et al.[102] introduced a smart\
    \ fuzzy logic based control \nscheme and upgraded by a special measure to the\
    \ humidity \nrelationship and temperature.  Also, the scheme control was \nimproved\
    \ with wireless information observing platform for \ninformation routing and logging\
    \ which prepares actual time of \ninformation entree. \n4.2  Energy analysis and\
    \ optimization models \nEnergy management strategies for optimizing greenhouse\
    \ \ncost[104] require a comprehensive research and knowledge and \nunderstanding\
    \ of climate condition, greenhouse systems, and \nplants’ requirements.  Some\
    \ of these research involves practicing \ninnovative concepts of energy conservation\
    \ and clean-energy using \nmathematical models[141,142], determining energy load\
    \ using \nbuilding energy simulation models[143], computational fluid \ndynamics\
    \ method[119,144,145], or providing optimal growth condition \nwith \nminimum\
    \ \nenvironmental \nimpacts[120,146,147]. \n \nOther \nresearchers have proposed\
    \ optimization methods for maximizing \nthe returns.  See for example the works[148]\
    \ in which a dynamic \nmodel of a greenhouse tomato and the optimal control problem\
    \ for \nthe seasonal benefit of the grower has been presented.  A \nformulation\
    \ of the optimal control problem for minimizing energy \ninput to the greenhouse\
    \ with a dynamic energy balance was \npresented by van Beveren et al.[149] and\
    \ later expanded in [150] to \ninclude humidity balance.  Incrocci et al.[151]\
    \ proposed that \noptimal CO2 concentration in the greenhouse can be based on\
    \ an \neconomic evaluation.  To maintain a given CO2 concentration \nwithin the\
    \ greenhouse, the supply must balance the assimilated CO2 \nflux to the outside\
    \ air due to ventilation.  Linker et al.[152] \noptimized greenhouse operation\
    \ and in particular CO2 control, \nusing a neural network.  Most of these approaches\
    \ have used crop \nmodels and prices of the harvested product.  van Beveren et\
    \ al.[153] \nexpanded this process further by including a dynamic CO2 balance.\
    \  \nThey reported a method to minimize the total energy that is \nrequired to\
    \ heat and cool a greenhouse.  Their research provides a \nmodel to define bounds\
    \ for temperature, humidity, CO2 \nconcentration, the maximum amount of CO2 available,\
    \ and the \neffect of different bounds on optimal energy input.  The addition\
    \ \nof the dynamic CO2 balance provides a truly integrated approach \nthat takes\
    \ all major aspects of greenhouse climate control into \naccount.  This is important,\
    \ given the trade-off between natural \nventilation and the injection of industrial\
    \ CO2, which occurs in a \ngreenhouse with active cooling.  Nadal et al.[154]\
    \ presented an \nenergy and environmental assessment for a roof-top greenhouse\
    \ \nand showed that their greenhouse achieved an annual saving in CO2 \nemissions\
    \ of 113.8 kg/m2 per year, relative to an equivalent \noil-heated greenhouse.\
    \  Vadiee and Martin[155] developed a \ntheoretical model using TRNSYS to carry\
    \ out greenhouse energy \nanalysis.  From the economic feasibility assessment,\
    \ their results \nshowed that the concept has the potential of becoming cost \n\
    effective.  A literature survey on greenhouse energy analysis[156] \nhas concluded\
    \ that evapotranspiration has a significant impact on \nthe micro-climate[156,157].\
    \  This is true since the amount of \nmoisture that is added to the greenhouse\
    \ environment due to \nevapotranspiration helps moderate the vapor pressure deficit.\
    \ \nCurrent advances in CEA systems tend towards sustainability \nand utilizing\
    \ renewable energy by studying wind power, solar \nthermal applications[142] and\
    \ solar energy conservation[141] to \nreduce fuel consumption[158].  For example,\
    \ in tropical and \nsubtropical conditions, the strategy in microclimate control\
    \ is to \nimprove resource efficiency by benefiting from the potentials of \n\
    natural ventilation and shading[120].  In fact, studies of different \ncontrol\
    \ strategies indicated that smart management of natural \nventilation for manipulating\
    \ the environment under specific \nexterior conditions is an effective approach\
    \ to improve productivity \nand increase benefits[124].  A smart tropical greenhouse\
    \ that \noperates on solar panels and benefits from an adaptive design and \n\
    covering materials (i.e., mesh screens) will maximize the use of \nnatural and\
    \ mechanical ventilation[144, 159-162] and will be less \ndependent \non \nhigher-cost\
    \ \ncooling \nmethods \nsuch \nas \nevaporative[67,163-167] and high pressure\
    \ fogging systems[168].  \nNevertheless, the use of anti-insect screens decreases\
    \ the natural \nventilation capacity and aggravates thermal conditions.  It is\
    \ \ntherefore unrealistic to completely eliminate other means of cooling, \n10\

    \  A comprehensive \nreview of advances in greenhouse microclimate control and\
    \ \nautomation system for tropical regions is available in [169]. \n4.3  Environment\
    \ prediction and yield estimation models \nGreenhouse growers use prediction tools\
    \ for the weather \nforecast, photosynthesis predictions for plant growth progress[170],\
    \ \npredicting disease[171], simulation of yield[172], and production \nplanning\
    \ and cost-benefit analysis.  Some of the earlier examples \nof climate models\
    \ to predict the temperature and humidity inside a \ngreenhouse can be found in\
    \ the works of [7, 173-176].  A thermal \nmodel for prediction of microclimate\
    \ factors inside a greenhouse \nwith mechanical ventilation and an evaporative\
    \ cooling system was \nintroduced by Willits[75].  More recent mathematical models\
    \ for \npredicting greenhouse microclimate from external data have been \naddressed\
    \ in [121, 177-180].  An innovative air temperature \nprediction model based on\
    \ least squares and support vector \nmachine with optimized parameters using an\
    \ improved particle \nswarm optimization (IPSO) technique is presented in [181].\
    \  The \nauthors compared and validated the performance of their model \nwith\
    \ conventional modeling techniques by predicting the air \ntemperature in a solar\
    \ greenhouse.  Another example is KASPRO, \nan advanced dynamic model for microclimate\
    \ prediction in \ngreenhouses[176,182].  This model consists of sub-functions\
    \ based \non mass and energy balance of the greenhouse environment.  A \ndetailed\
    \ description of this model is presented in the work of \nRigakis et al.[78] This\
    \ model was used by Graamans et al.[183] to \ndescribe crop transpiration and\
    \ energy balance in plant factories by \ndetermining vapor flux and the relation\
    \ between latent and sensible \nheat exchange for production of lettuce. \nSustainable\
    \ development of modern greenhouse production \nsystems also requires yield estimation\
    \ models and knowledge- \nbased information software for adaptive management of\
    \ resources.  \nSince it is impossible to actually plant and experiment with every\
    \ \nsingle greenhouse design and climate scenario, mathematical \nmodels for simulation\
    \ of yields and growth responses are \nessential for achieving high yield at low\
    \ cost.  These models can \nalso contribute to the optimization and management\
    \ of \ngreenhouse energy under adverse climate conditions.  An early \nexample\
    \ includes the work of Gary et al.[184] in which an \neducational software called\
    \ SIMULSERRE for simulating \ngreenhouse plant system was developed.  Some of\
    \ the \nwell-known simulation models for tomato plants include \nTOMSIM[185],\
    \ TOMPOUSSE[186,187] and TOMGRO[188,189].  A \ncommon weakness with these models\
    \ is that their parameters are \nspecific for the climate condition and greenhouse\
    \ design that they \nwere derived from.  In addition, because of the complexity\
    \ of \nthe interactions between the greenhouse elements and the crop \nitself,\
    \ it is often impossible to correctly predict microclimate \neffects on the final\
    \ yield with the same model parameters.  One \nof the most widely accepted yield\
    \ simulation models is the \nTOMGRO[189] in which the author claimed that “it\
    \ is possible to \nuse the same reduced model with parameters estimated at one\
    \ \nlocation to simulate leaf area and above-ground weight of tomato \ngrowing\
    \ in greenhouse conditions in other locations”.  The first \nversion of TOMGRO[188]\
    \ and the third version[190], respectively \nhad 69 and 574 state variables for\
    \ simulation of tomato growth on \nthe basis of three inputs that are measured\
    \ inside greenhouse \nenvironment: \nthe \nphotosynthetically \nactive \nradiation,\
    \ \nmmol/(m2·s), air temperature, °C and CO2 concentration, ppm.  \nA simplified\
    \ version of TOMGRO[189] was developed with the \nobjective of providing a practical\
    \ application and only has five \nsteady-state variables: (i) node number for\
    \ the main stem, (ii) leaf \narea index, (iii) total plant dry weight (WT), (iv)\
    \ total fruit dry \nweight (WF), and (v) mature fruit dry weight (WM).  Jones\
    \ et \nal.[189] provided simulation results for three tomato varieties \nincluding\
    \ DeRuiters, Beefsteak, and Bigboy respectively for three \nexperiment locations\
    \ at Gainesville (Florida), Avignon (France) \nand Lake City (Florida).  Some\
    \ of the studies related to \nevaluation and adaptation of TOMGRO model to specific\
    \ climate \nconditions and cultural practices can be found in the works of \n\
    [172, 191, 192].  It should be noted that the simplified \nTOMGRO model only takes\
    \ into account the effect of air \ntemperature and light condition, and other\
    \ important variables \nsuch as CO2 concentration were not included in this version.\
    \  In \naddition, Jones et al.[189] did not take the work any farther than \n\
    making the model calculations in an Excel spreadsheet, hence the \nmodel could\
    \ not be used directly with other models to control \ngreenhouse environments.\
    \  To fill this gap, Shamshiri et al.[193] \nevaluated and verified the performance\
    \ of the reduced state \nvariable version of TOMGRO model of Jones et al.[189]\
    \ using \nboundary data that were expected to result in zero yield output.  \n\
    The hypothesis was to test whether the model parameters are \nrobust enough to\
    \ translate an adverse greenhouse environment \n(with air temperature so high\
    \ to prevent any crop growth \ndevelopment) to realistic biomass and yield.  For\
    \ this purpose, \nShamshiri et al.[193] converted the model from spreadsheets\
    \ \nformat to Matlab Simulink (The MathWorks Inc, Natick, MA, \nUSA), provided\
    \ a user interface to access the TOMGRO inputs \nand outputs, and replaced the\
    \ lengthy calculation procedures of \nMicrosoft Excel with one-click step operation\
    \ in Matlab.  This \nSimulink model of Shamshiri et al.[193] provided a flexible\
    \ \nplatform for individuals unfamiliar with computer programming \nlanguages\
    \ and crop modeling to have an easy access to the \nTOMGRO model functionality.\
    \  It was shown that the designed \nSimulink model can be used reliably as a replacement\
    \ for the \nspreadsheet version of TOMGRO model.  Additional research \nworks\
    \ with experimental and simulated based studies for \ninvestigating the effects\
    \ of structure design, covering materials \nand \ncontrol \nsystems \non \ngreenhouse\
    \ \nmicroclimate, \ncrop \ntranspiration, and expected yields are available in\
    \ the works of \n[51, 55, 76, 120, 193, 194]. \n4.4  Decision support systems\
    \ \nThe management of production in a greenhouse requires \ndecision making on\
    \ several tasks and time scales.  These \ndecisions are mainly related to management\
    \ of the crop growth \nconditions[195], the culture period and practice such as\
    \ seedling \nproduction[196], event-based irrigation[197] and the control and\
    \ \nmanagement \nof \nenvironment \nbased \ngrowth \nmodels[198].  \nResearch\
    \ and development in decision support system (DSS) for \ngreenhouse application\
    \ began during the 1990s, primarily for \nrecommending microclimate reference\
    \ values and set-points, and \nfor pest and disease management.  Early studies\
    \ included the \nworks of Fisher et al.[199], Clarke et al.[195] and Sun et al.[200].\
    \  A \nDSS was built by Tchamitchian et al.[201] based on the \nJanuary, 2018\

    \ of 5%-20%.  \nA similar application is presented in [202] for decision making\
    \ \nabout the climate control regime that can quantify the energy \ncosts based\
    \ on different control strategies.  More recent studies \ncan be found in the\
    \ works of Cañadas et al.[203] and Aiello et al.[204] \nAn interactive decision\
    \ support system (DSS) developed by \nShort et al.[205] based on the HYTODMOD\
    \ growth response \nmodel of El-Attal[206] is available to describe the optimality\
    \ \ndegrees of air temperature and relative humidity at five growth \nstages and\
    \ under three light conditions (night, sun and cloud).  \nThese functions were\
    \ tested and validated by four independent \nexpert growers and were results of\
    \ experiments with tomato \ncultivar “Carusso” in an A-Shade greenhouse located\
    \ at the Ohio \nAgriculture Research and Development Center with a floor area\
    \ \nof 7.3 m2.  In order to build a model for defining the optimality \ndegrees\
    \ of VPD at different light conditions and growth stages of \ntomato, Shamshiri\
    \ et al.[207] integrated the growth response model \nof El-Attal[206] and developed\
    \ the OptVPD model (Figure 6) with \na series of membership function that take\
    \ VPD (kPa) as input, and \ngenerate a real number between 0 and 1 as output.\
    \  The effects \nof air temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) on the \noptimality\
    \ degree of VPD based on this model are shown in \nFigure 6.  The knowledge behind\
    \ these functions and the \noptimal and failure microclimate values were condensed\
    \ from \nextensive peer-reviewed \nscientific published \nresearch on \ngreenhouse\
    \ cultivation of tomato and physiology, with the goal of \nsimultaneously achieving\
    \ high yield and high-quality fruit.  \nShamshiri et al.[120] extended and implemented\
    \ TOMGRO model \nin SIMULINK and interfaced it with the HYTODMOD and \nOptVPD\
    \ for microclimate evaluation and yield estimation (Figure \n7).  The interfaced\
    \ HYTODMOD, OptVPD, and TOMGRO \nmodels can be used as a DSS tool for evaluation\
    \ purpose by \nexploring \noptimality \ndegrees \nof \nthe \nmicroclimate \nand\
    \ \nmacroclimate parameters as well as yield estimation depending \non the growth\
    \ stage of the plant and different light condition.  It \nallows growers to manually\
    \ change the values of the growing \nparameters as well as the growth stages and\
    \ receive a feedback by \nmeans of a number between 0 and 1 representing how close\
    \ that \nparameter is to high yield and high quality.  An application of \nthis\
    \ DSS has been presented for dynamic assessment[208], \nmeasuring optimality degrees[46],\
    \ and comparative evaluation of \nmicroclimate parameters[193] in greenhouses\
    \ with different \ncovering materials.  Microclimate evaluation with VPD \ninfluences\
    \ the energy costs involved in greenhouse cultivation \nand must be taken into\
    \ account in humidity and temperature \ncontrol algorithms.  A more in-depth analysis\
    \ and practical \nexamples of this DSS is presented by Shamshiri et al.[120] via\
    \ an \nadaptive management framework.  This framework provides a \nflexible platform\
    \ for altering each participating variables in the \ngreenhouse.  It simulates\
    \ growth and environment responses in \ndifferent light condition, growth stages,\
    \ growing season and \nlocation.  The result is a cost-benefit analysis that shows\
    \ at what \nlevel each combination of variables is close to the optimal \nrequirements.\

    \ (UA) \nThe fast growth of global population is changing the food \nproduction\
    \ systems to keep up with the growing demands.  \nAgricultural innovation and\
    \ research in the past three decades, \ncombined with the advances in information\
    \ technology have \nintroduced promising cultivation techniques that are valuable\
    \ for \nsustainability and economic viability of CEA.  Ellis[209] described \n\
    that throughout the history, agriculture has always been associated \nwith urban\
    \ centers, much more than it is imagined today.  While \ntraditional and modern\
    \ agriculture have been separated in the upper \nlayers, they are still attached\
    \ to each other in the roots.  Today, \nfood, as well as animal livestock, is\
    \ surrounding us everywhere, \nand the question about the origin of this supply\
    \ is not a concern \nanymore.  By the late 2000s, major cities reached the point\
    \ that \nmost people did not even need to associate food with natural \nresources[210].\
    \ \nThe concepts in UA and the associated facilities have \nreceived significant\
    \ attention and popularity in the last 8 years, \nand are growing to meet the\
    \ needs of the ever-developing urban \nlife.  A variety of systems may fall under\
    \ UA concept in \ndifferent scale and possession (Figure 8), ranging from a personal\
    \ \nor local community gardens for social and self-sufficiency \npurposes, to\
    \ complicated systems which involve indoor food \nproduction with the help of\
    \ artificial light or inside factories that \nare capable of controlling the climate\
    \ to produce sensitive plants.  \nSince UA is mostly practiced indoors, it is\
    \ also referred as \nvertical farming (VF)[211], integrated farming inside buildings[212],\
    \ \nand Z-farming (which stands for ZeroAcreageFarming)[213].  \nThis type of\
    \ food production is entering all cities in the world and \nhas attracted public\
    \ interest.  There are new consumers’ needs \nfor fresh food of good quality with\
    \ no damage to nature.  \nSeveral reports indicated that more projects are involved\
    \ in \nbringing farming products into cities[214,215].  “UA is an industry \n\
    that makes, processes and markets food and fuel, mostly in \nreaction to the daily\
    \ need for consumers in a town, city, or \nmetropolitan areas, on land and on\
    \ water spread in the urban and \nsemi-urban area, by employing many methods of\
    \ production, \nusing and recycling natural resources and city wastes to produce\
    \ a \nvariety of products and livestock”[216-219].  In fact, UA is a \nfarming\
    \ movement in the cities for circulation of food and \nnon-food plants and tree\
    \ products.  Some of the suggested \nsolutions for a closed-field production system\
    \ in UA are the plant \nfactories, vertical farming (VA), and rooftop greenhouses.\

    \ of VF is not new.  Kaplan[220] explained that VF \nhas been unknown for a long\
    \ time, and was then brought to \nattention in the recent years through the advances\
    \ in technology.  \nLife magazine has published one of the very first sketches\
    \ of a tall \nconstruction that promotes agricultural products for people daily\
    \ \nfood requests as early as 1909.  In 1915, the American geologist \nGilbert\
    \ Ellis Bailey used the concept of the tall multi-story \nbuildings for indoor\
    \ cultivation.  He created the term “Vertical \nFarming” in his book with the\
    \ same title as “Vertical Farming”[221].  \nDesigners and landscape architects\
    \ have frequently looked into the \nconcept, particularly at the end of the 20th\
    \ century.  During the \n1970s until the early 1980s, the Malaysian-born architect,\
    \ Ken \nYeang improved and advanced the ideas of Bailey into an \narchitectural\
    \ project[222,223].  It is called Bioclimatic Skyscraper \n(Menara Mesiniaga)\
    \ that was built in 1992.  In 1993, Nancy Jack \nTodd and John Todd envisioned\
    \ the idea of VF in their book \nentitled “From Eco-Cities to Living Machines”.\
    \  The most recent \nand greatest challenging form of this idea however appeared\
    \ in \n1999 by Dickson Despommier’s, an Emeritus Professor of \nMicrobiology at\
    \ the Columbia University, speculating that a \n30-floor farm on one city block\
    \ could provide food for 50 000 \npeople with vegetables, fruit, eggs and meat,\
    \ explaining that \nhydroponic crops could be grown on upper floors; and the lower\
    \ \nfloors would be suited for chickens and fish that eat plants waste.  \nIn\
    \ the concept of VF, heat and lighting would be provided by \ngeothermal, tidal,\
    \ solar, or other recyclable sources of energy.  \nNitrogen along with other nutrients\
    \ would be sieved from animal \nwaste and maybe from the urban sewage system.\
    \  It should be \nnoted that until 2010, there was no report of evidence for VF\
    \ \nconstruction before it began emerging in USA, Singapore, Japan, \nand Korea.\
    \  In theory, VF is the technique that includes \nlarge-scale food production\
    \ in skyscrapers that makes rapid growth \nand planned production possible through\
    \ managing nutrient \nsolution of crop and the growth context according to hydroponics\
    \ \nmethods.  With the help of cutting-edge greenhouse approaches, \nthese buildings\
    \ can be used as a precision farming system that \npaves the way for the acquisition\
    \ of a safe crop growth through \ncontrolling and supervising of the microenvironment\
    \ using sensors, \ninterfacing gadgets and instrumentation[210,213,224-227]. \n\
    In the recent years, the majority of scientific publications in \nUA have focused\
    \ on different aspects of the VF concept.  For \nexample, Sivamani et al.[228]\
    \ studied the viability of smart \ntechnology used in agriculture as an opportunity\
    \ to be used for \nVF[228,229].  Research findings have shown that VF is a promising\
    \ \ntechnique for providing food for cities in a sustainable way.  \nHowever,\
    \ it is also a function of the location and design[229].  It is \nmentioned that\
    \ VF is a way of feeding and at the same time a \nmovement in the society to reduce\
    \ greenhouse gas emission[219,230].  \nA common debate about VF is the compromising\
    \ between the \nbuilding structure and the returns.  Some estimates that an \n\
    abandoned building can be adapted to the needs of VA, while other \nbelieves that\
    \ only buildings with new design will satisfy that need.  \nA study by Kalantari\
    \ et al.[231] presented several effective VF \nprojects in different countries\
    \ by estimating their feasibility and \nviability in various geographical areas.\
    \  The data was shaped \nbased on the technology of different VF in different\
    \ climate areas.  \nIt was shown by Kalantari et al.[231] that every VF has its\
    \ own \ntechnologies and techniques according to the different geographical \n\
    locations.  Table 1 presents the details of some of effective VF \nprojects in\
    \ different countries and shows the different areas by their \ntype of building\
    \ and typologies.  An interesting example includes \nthe conceptual design of\
    \ the Urban Sky-farm for downtown of \nSeoul is shown in Figure 9 with different\
    \ sections of the structure \nillustrated by labels.  This design was the winner\
    \ of the 2013 \ngreen dot design competition.  The key concept of a vertical farm\
    \ \nis to yield as much crop as possible under optimal circumstances, \neven in\
    \ the center of cities.  Thus, the VF shown in Figure 9 \nincludes many floors\
    \ with a variety of crops on each.  Different \ncrops need different environmental\
    \ conditions.  Therefore, tracing \na crop and its location is of a great significance[228].\
    \ \nVertical farms can be diverse from city to city and their \nstructures also\
    \ vary around the world[210].  The other two \nconceptual designs for vertical\
    \ farms are shown in Figure 10. The \nfirst design (Figure 10a) was designed by\
    \ ODESIGN group for \nAustralia. The other type of VF called urban farming units\
    \ (UFU) \nis shown in Figure 10b, a farm within shipping containers that can \n\
    produce organic fish, fruits, and vegetables in the street. The entire \nprototypes\
    \ are rooted in circular agriculture techniques. The main \ngoals of UFU are to\
    \ find a way to grow food under polluted and \nlimited ground[232]. Figure 10b\
    \ shows a conceptual design of an \nAquaponics farm with fish tanks that can be\
    \ placed inside or close \nto the plant in different levels of the farm.  In this\
    \ system, the \nplants clean and purify the water for the fish, and in return,\
    \ fish \nfeed the plants with their waste as a source of nutrients.  The \nFreight\
    \ Farms in Table 1 is also an example of a vertical farm in a \nshipping container.\
    \ \nAnother solution for UA is the rooftop greenhouse (RTG) and \nbuilding integrated\
    \ rooftop greenhouse (i-RTG) concept.  It is \ndefined as a greenhouse constructed\
    \ on top of a building, usually \nmatched with soilless culture systems[233].\

    \ effect on climate change decrease), local \nadvantages (such as naturalization\

    \ production benefits \n(including the accessibility of high quality food).  These\
    \ structures \ncan optimize the energy, water, and CO2 flows only when the RTG\

    \  Some experimental research indicated that \ni-RTG has failed to provide proper\
    \ light transmission[236], resulting \nin low radiation use efficiency (RUE),\
    \ however this issue is not \nconcerning RTG structure.  In comparison to traditional\
    \ greenhouses \nin the region, which are generally unheated, a primary advantage\
    \ of \ni-RTG is their better and more uniform temperature regime, owing \nto the\
    \ thermal links to the building.  This is an obvious benefit for \nenergy saving\

    \ are usually used for commercial production of \nleafy greens, but their potential\
    \ remains uncertain.  A general \nstructure design of a plant factory and corresponding\
    \ components \nsections are shown in Figure 11.  In order to achieve economic\
    \ \nviability, the increased resource productivity and/or the value of \nadditional\
    \ services in these structures would have to outweigh the \ndisadvantage of the\
    \ absence of solar energy.  Plant factories have \nbeen primarily used in Asia\
    \ to refer to a commercial plant production \nfactory similar in operations to\
    \ an ordinary industrial firm.  Some \nof the technological instrumentations and\
    \ equipment supporting \nthese factories for deriving the plants to their maximum\
    \ potentials \nare precision sensors, nutrition solution, process controllers,\
    \ \nautomated instruments, computer systems, and environmental \nsupervision along\
    \ with implementation of DSS and task \nmanagement software.  Moreover, a number\
    \ of plant factories also \nbenefits from robotic systems for sorting, transferring,\
    \ and handling \nof the plants, as well as quality control, and post-harvesting.\
    \  Because \nof the relatively higher economic investment that is required for\
    \ \nplant factories, they are managed with resource efficiency and \nproduction\
    \ predictability to attain market-valuable crops. \nIn the Japanese context, there\
    \ existed 165 plant factories which \nare using artificially lighting combined\
    \ with natural solar lights[237].  \nAdditional sub-system might be required in\
    \ plant factories for air \nexchange to eliminate the temperature increase due\
    \ to the artificial \nlight.  Plant factories which have full artificial light\
    \ sources \nusually utilize opaque building materials.  This would offer a \n\
    chance to have the walls and roofs well resistant which makes \ncontrolling the\
    \ internal temperature easier and helps conserve the \nenergy.  Furthermore, often\
    \ the skin facade of the building is \ncovered by a self-cleaning and transparent\
    \ material such as \nEthylene Tetra Fluoro Ethylene (ETFE).  In addition, a material\
    \ \nwhich is highly clear and a high thermal rate are required to \nincrease the\
    \ intensity of sunlight that enters the building.  ETFE is \nlight enough as it\
    \ enjoys only 1% weight of an equal-sized piece of \nglass.  However, it lets\
    \ in 95% of light.  There exists a different \nintensity of pressure between the\
    \ ETFE layers.  Such a pressure \nhelps to close and open the screens so as to\
    \ change the passage of \nsunlight[209].  ETFE which is a standardized construction\
    \ material \nhas been used on an extensive surface of ethereal domes in the \n\
    Eden Project in the south of England[14,238]. \nStudies showed that quantitative\
    \ blue light was able to improve \nphotosynthetic performance or growth through\
    \ motivating \nmorphological as well as physiological responses.  Miyagi et \n\
    al.[239] showed that synergistic effects of monochromic LED \ntogether with high\
    \ CO2 and nutrients can enhance lettuce growth in \na plant factory.  Shimokawa\
    \ et al.[240] concluded that red and blue \nirradiation used at the same time\
    \ improve plant growth more than \nmonochromatic \nand \nfluorescent \nlight \n\
    irradiation. \n \nThese \nresearchers also observed that alternatively use of\
    \ red and blue light \naccelerated plant growth dramatically, with the fresh weight\
    \ of a \nrandomly measured plant that was found to be two times as much \nas the\
    \ usual LED production methods.  The bacterial biofertilizers \nused in plant\
    \ factories may positively affect plant growth in several \n16   January, 2018\

    \ \nFigure 11  General structure design of a plant factory \n \n5.3  Opportunities\
    \ and challenges \nVertical farming entails producing plants in a soil-less culture\
    \ \nwith nutrient solution and deals with problems concerning the use \nof soils,\
    \ including the need for herbicides, pesticides, and \nfertilizers and then it\
    \ supplies healthy organic food which is free \nfrom \nchemicals[213]. \n \nAnother\
    \ \nprivilege \nis \nto \nremove \ntransportation costs and CO2 production which\
    \ accompany the \ncarry-over of foods far away to somewhere near the consumer.\
    \  \nMoreover, products can be provided all-year-round corresponding \nto people’s\
    \ demand.  Furthermore, plant-production conditions \ncan be improved to increase\
    \ the yield by adjusting temperature, \nhumidity, and lighting conditions precisely.\
    \  Indoor agriculture \nin a controlled setting also needs much less water than\
    \ outdoor \nfarming as it involves recycling the graywater and lowering the \n\
    evaporation.  Together with the regulation of temperature and \nhumidity, it can\
    \ also decrease or omit the effects of seasonality.  \nFreshwater is increased\
    \ through the evaporation of black and \ngraywater in order to preserve water\
    \ resources.  Moreover, \nrecycled water obtained from rain can be innovatively\
    \ reused.  \nRecycling and dehumidifying strategies can be used for the city’s\
    \ \nwater supplies.  Similarly, aeroponic and hydroponic systems \ncan help raise\
    \ the efficiency of water consumption to 97% in \ncomparison to traditional agriculture[242].\
    \  Moreover, a constant \nflow of air is produced through air conditioning that\
    \ can be \nenhanced with carbon dioxide (CO2) so as to contribute to plant \n\
    growth even more.  Both environmental parameters and nutrient \nuptake may be\
    \ kept at certain levels that improve the speed of \nplant growth.  It was mentioned\
    \ that plants will have a better \nevapotranspiration and yield with the modification\
    \ of bandwidth \nof LED lighting.   \nUA, VF, RTG and plant factories provide\
    \ a unique opportunity \nfor reducing fossil fuels by utilizing solar panels,\
    \ roof-top wind \nturbines, or storage batteries[242,243] as shown schematically\
    \ in \nFigure 12.  The economic benefits of vertical farms include the \nreduction\
    \ of the cost of energy, lowering of food price, and an \neconomic opportunity\
    \ to secure land and return investments to the \ninvestor through protecting floods,\
    \ droughts, or damage caused by \nthe sun.  New job opportunities can be created\
    \ by VF in \nengineering, \nbiochemistry, \nbiotechnology, \nconstruction, \n\
    maintenance and research, with the chances to improve the \ntechnology.  Moreover,\
    \ the social benefits of VF are diverse and \ninvolve the psychological, and spiritual\
    \ health of the community, \nsuch as education, leisure, and more social communication\
    \ and \nhealthier food habits[213,242,244]. \n \nFigure 12  Conceptual design\
    \ for adaptation of renewable energy \nfor commercial development of sustainable\
    \ CEA and plant \nfactories \n \nSeveral researchers have claimed that, in a VF\
    \ system, the \nplants on the upper sections of the structure will only benefit\
    \ from \nsolar radiation, and that the energy supplied by the photovoltaics \n\
    solar panel may be restricted, or not justified cost wise[225].  \nHowever, solar\
    \ panels are now more efficient in generating energy, \nJanuary, 2018        \
    \   Shamshiri R R, et al.  Advances in greenhouse automation and controlled environment\
    \ agriculture                Vol. 11 No.1   17 \nand the introduction of new affordable\
    \ and energy efficient LED \nlighting is an accepted substitute to compensate\
    \ the lack of natural \nlight.  We mentioned earlier that the LED sources are\
    \ capable of \nincreasing the yield in greenhouse context significantly because\
    \ of \nmatching spectral features with plant type and physiology[229,242].  \n\
    In addition, extra sun exposure is also possible through stacked \nlevels of plants\
    \ that can be rotated within one high-rise closed-space. \nThe extra cost of VF\
    \ start-ups can be resolved if the supporting \nstructures are not built on the\
    \ expensive central business districts, \nhowever there are still several challenges\
    \ with VF.  Indeed, the \nprimary costs of establishing, equipping and implementing\
    \ a VF \nare certainly high and are mostly accounted for energy \nconsumption.\
    \  The number and variety of crops grown is not as \nmany as in rural farming.\
    \  The quantity and loads of the crops are \nalso not as much as in the open-field\
    \ cultivation.  There are other \nchallenges too such as the need for disruption\
    \ management to the \nrural sector, to raise investment capital, and to train\
    \ workforce.  \nThese costs will be lowered through the time, particularly those\
    \ \nconcerning energy provision.  Abel[210] also mentioned that \nalthough establishing\
    \ VF is very costly at the beginning, but when \nit is well-established and fully\
    \ operated, the price of food will be \nlowered.  According to Despommier[14],\
    \ there are many \nappropriate locations for VF projects in every city and if\
    \ these \nlocations are used efficiently, they are able to return and circulate\
    \ \nlarge sums of money to the city[245].  It is concluded by Voss[246] \nthat\
    \ assessing all conditions on every level is essential, in order to \nthoroughly\
    \ consider all possibilities and then to decide on the \nestablishment of a VF.\
    \  Furthermore, VF as a concept is a \npromising move along the right path for\
    \ the fans of the \nrevolutionary resource-based economy movement.  Economic \n\
    analysis, along with the exploration of the impact of VF on \npost-industrial\
    \ cities can be topics of future studies. \n6  Conclusions \nUrbanization and\
    \ living in multi-story buildings request a \nredefinition of agricultural awareness\
    \ for securing food supply.  \nThe economic viability of traditional greenhouses\
    \ in this new \nscenario is likely to fade in the coming decades.  A trend in\
    \ the \npast 15 years of published literature showed that researchers and \ngreenhouse\
    \ growers have become more interested in shifting \ntowards smart controlled environment\
    \ agriculture.  The research \nconcentration has shifted from instrumentation\
    \ control and \nhardware-software interfacing to other scopes, such as simulating\
    \ \nthe interactions between microclimate parameters and plant growth.  \nResearchers\
    \ in this field are developing complex mathematical \nmodels to minimize energy\
    \ inputs, or are interested in finding \ninnovative solutions for replacing the\
    \ fossil energy consuming \ngreenhouses with energy neutral CEA systems that operate\
    \ on solar \nand wind power.  The main aspect that requires improvements in \n\
    this field is the task planning algorithms.  Path planning is well \nknown, but\
    \ to provide the CEA with an adaptive design and control \nstrategy that forms\
    \ the right shape and perform the right task at the \nright time, while increasing\
    \ profits and remaining competitive in \nthe market is still a challenge.  This\
    \ research presented an \noverview \nof \nmodern \ngreenhouses, \ncontrolled \n\
    environment \nagriculture and their derivatives, and highlighted some of the \n\
    advances in environmental monitoring, control, and optimization.  \nWhile biological\
    \ sensors, like those that measures plant stress are \nthe key to such high-level\
    \ of automation, this technology is either \nvery expensive for local growers\
    \ to afford, or even not available.  \nIn addition, it is not clearly well known\
    \ the cost of increased \nautomation relative to increase in profitability.  Therefore,\
    \ another \narea helping sustainability is knowledge based and decision making\
    \ \nsupport systems, i.e., model based computer applications that \naddress the\
    \ cost benefit for a proposed automation technology.  \nThis paper highlighted\
    \ some the most recent technological \nadvances for closed-field agriculture by\
    \ reviewing the applications \nof plant factories and rooftop greenhouses.  Some\
    \ of the \nconceptual designs in this context were introduces along with \nseveral\
    \ existing commercial examples to show the trends in \ndeveloping sustainable\
    \ farming system in the center of dense cities.  \nBased on the review literature,\
    \ this study concludes that a more \naccurate economic analysis and justifications\
    \ of the high startup \ncosts involved with vertical farming and plant factories\
    \ are required \nbefore large-scale commercial development.  The computer \nsimulation\
    \ models and adaptive analysis software are already \navailable for greenhouses\
    \ and CEA systems can be extended and \nmodified for this purpose.  The cost of\
    \ increased automation level \nrelative to increases in profitability is a key\
    \ consideration, and \nshould form part of future study to justify the implementation\
    \ of a \ngreater level of automation. \n \n[References] \n[1] \nTing K C, Lin\

    Abstract: The 21st century has seen rapid changes in technology, industry, and\
    \ social patterns. Most\nindustries have moved towards automation, and human intervention\
    \ has decreased, which has led\nto a revolution in industries, named the fourth\
    \ industrial revolution (Industry 4.0). Industry 4.0 or\nthe fourth industrial\
    \ revolution (IR 4.0) relies heavily on the Internet of Things (IoT) and wireless\n\
    sensor networks (WSN). IoT and WSN are used in various control systems, including\
    \ environmental\nmonitoring, home automation, and chemical/biological attack detection.\
    \ IoT devices and applications\nare used to process extracted data from WSN devices\
    \ and transmit them to remote locations. This\nsystematic literature review offers\
    \ a wide range of information on Industry 4.0, ﬁnds research gaps,\nand recommends\
    \ future directions. Seven research questions are addressed in this article: (i)\
    \ What\nare the contributions of WSN in IR 4.0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the major types of network intruders\nin WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the prominent network security attacks in WSN and IoT?\n(vi) What\
    \ are the signiﬁcant issues in IoT and WSN frameworks? and (vii) What are the\
    \ limitations\nand research gaps in the existing work? This study mainly focuses\
    \ on research solutions and new\ntechniques to automate Industry 4.0. In this\
    \ research, we analyzed over 130 articles from 2014\nuntil 2021. This paper covers\
    \ several aspects of Industry 4.0, from the designing phase to security\nneeds,\
    \ from the deployment stage to the classiﬁcation of the network, the difﬁculties,\
    \ challenges, and\nfuture directions.\nKeywords: Internet of Things (IoT); industrial\
    \ revolution 4.0 (IR 4.0); computer networks; network\nsecurity; wireless sensor\
    \ networks (WSN); systematic literature review (SLR); state-of-the-art\n1. Introduction\n\
    Smart technologies play a crucial role in sustainable economic growth. They transform\n\
    houses, ofﬁces, factories, and even cities into autonomic, self-controlled systems\
    \ without\nhuman intervention [1]. This modern automation trend and ever-increasing\
    \ use of cutting-\nedge technologies are boosting the world’s economy [2]. The\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT)\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22062087\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n2 of 36\nand Wireless\
    \ Sensor Networks (WSN) both play vital roles in this modernization [3]. IoT\n\
    is a branch of engineering primarily concerned with offering thousands of miniature,\n\
    physical connected objects, which may collaborate to achieve a shared goal. IoT\
    \ has gained\nmuch importance due to the abundant usage of these tiny networked\
    \ devices. These\nare smart, yet basic things that can sense and communicate wirelessly\
    \ [4]. WSN is a\ncollection of sensor and routing nodes, as shown in Figure 1,\
    \ which may be put together\nin the environment to predict physical conditions,\
    \ such as wind, temperature, and many\nothers. These networks collect and process\
    \ data from tiny nodes and then transfer it to\nthe operators. Figure 2 illustrates\
    \ that sensor networks are used in a variety of control\nsystems, including environmental\
    \ monitoring, home automation, chemical and biological\nassault detection, smart\
    \ grid deployment [5], surveillance, and many more. WSN also plays\na signiﬁcant\
    \ role in aquaculture and the oil industry, including data collection, offshore\n\
    exploration, disaster prevention, tactical surveillance, and pollution monitoring\
    \ [6–8].\nFigure 1. Architecture of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nFigure 2.\
    \ Application of wireless sensor network (WSN).\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n3 of\
    \ 36\nWSN are often deployed in remote areas where human intervention is not possible\n\
    for post-deployment maintenance. Therefore, efforts are being made to enhance\
    \ their\nefﬁciency and durability [9]. There are many barriers to WSN deployment,\
    \ such as power\nconsumption–long-distance deployment. Due to automation trends\
    \ and applications devel-\noped, these barriers are no longer barriers for large-scale\
    \ remote deployment. In general,\nWSN follows a star topology to decrease the\
    \ network failure probability by connecting all\nsystems to a central node. While\
    \ ad-hoc networks follow mesh topology where each node\nis human-driven [10].\n\
    In physical production systems, grid and energy-saving applications minimize the\n\
    energy resources and noise pollution. In the last few decades, transportation\
    \ has improved\na lot with the usage of smart IoT devices, such as signals and\
    \ high-resolution cameras\non roads, which has led to an increase in trafﬁc ﬂow.\
    \ RFID readers are deployed at toll\nbooths that automatically deduct toll amounts\
    \ after reading RFID tags on vehicles. In the\ntransportation sector, smart vehicles\
    \ reduce the travelling time and also fuel consumption\nwith low cost of mobility\
    \ and reduced human efforts [11], atmospheric monitoring reduces\npollution, and\
    \ surveillance applications reduce crime. Nowadays, WSN also plays a role in\n\
    precision agriculture. On the other hand, WSN applications facilitate our day\
    \ to day lives,\nmaking them more comfortable, such as healthcare applications\
    \ that improve our health\nand longevity.\nBesides WSN, IoT has also played an\
    \ important role in human life. IoT and the digital\nage play essential roles\
    \ in overcoming social and physical barriers and providing ease\nand mobility\
    \ to people, resulting in improved and equal opportunities, and access to\ninformation\
    \ [12,13]. IoT also has many application areas such as agribusiness, climate,\n\
    clinical care, education, transportation, and ﬁnance, as shown in Figure 2.\n\
    In regard to information and communication technology, researchers are attracted\
    \ to\nIoT [14]. By adopting this essential technology, companies have become smarter,\
    \ more\ncompetitive, automated, and sustainable in the global supply chain. In\
    \ today’s competitive\nmarketplace, supply chains are struggling as they compete\
    \ with each other. Therefore,\nIoT devices are an effective way to authenticate,\
    \ monitor, and track products using GPS\nand many technologies [15,16]. Industry\
    \ 4.0 stands for the fourth industrial revolution\nin the digital age, it is associated\
    \ with virtualizing real-world scenarios of production\nand processing without\
    \ human intervention. This virtual world is linked to IoT devices,\nallowing the\
    \ creation of cyber–physical systems to communicate and cooperate [17,18].\nThis\
    \ fully connected manufacturing system—operating without human intervention by\n\
    generating, transferring, receiving, and processing necessary data to conduct\
    \ all required\ntasks for producing all kinds of goods—is one of Industry 4.0’s\
    \ key “constructs”. The con-\ncept of Industry 4.0 is based on the combination\
    \ of three main elements: people, things,\nand business [19]. A complete cyber–physical\
    \ production system created by the integration\nof IoT devices, things and objects\
    \ (IoT), sensor nodes (WSN), and people, is shown in\nFigure 3. CPS is a typical\
    \ example of Industry 4.0. IoT is the connection of smart devices,\nobjects, or\
    \ machines to the internet and with each other. In WSN systems, there is no direct\n\
    connection of these devices to the Internet. These systems can send their data\
    \ to the Internet\nby connecting several sensor nodes to a central routing node.\
    \ While CPS systems involve\nthe integration of IoT devices, computation, networking,\
    \ and physical process, IoT is an\nessential component of CPS. CPS systems are\
    \ key elements in the implementation of IR\n4.0 [20]. Industry 4.0 is the network-enabled\
    \ entity that automates the whole process of\nmanufacturing, connecting business\
    \ and processes. Market demands and the advance-\nments in new technologies are\
    \ transforming manufacturing ﬁrms’ business operations\ninto smart factories and\
    \ warehouses. Due to this automation, IoT devices are producing a\nmassive amount\
    \ of data daily, known as big data [21,22]. Statistics show that, at the end of\n\
    2021, there were more than 10 billion active IoT devices globally [23]. By 2030,\
    \ the number\nof active IoT devices is expected to exceed 10 billion to 25.4 billion.\
    \ By 2025, the data created\nby IoT devices will reach 73.1 ZB (zeta bytes) [24].\
    \ In 2020, the IoT industry was predicted\nto generate more than USD 450 billion,\
    \ including hardware, software, systems integration,\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n\
    4 of 36\nand data services. By the end of 2021, it reached USD 520 billion. The\
    \ global amount\nexpected to be spent on the IoT in 2022 is USD 1 trillion. The\
    \ IoT industry is predicted to\ngrow to more than USD 2 trillion by 2027 [25,26].\
    \ The increasing number of devices and the\nusage by humans shows the importance\
    \ of IoT devices; moreover, the industry is growing\nand gaining revenue.\nFigure\
    \ 3. CPS system–integration of IoT, wireless devices, and people in Industry 4.0.\n\
    In this paper, we conduct a detailed systematic literature review on the applications\n\
    and contributions of IoT and WSN in Industry 4.0. We had a large corpus of data\
    \ to\nanalyze papers using systematic approaches. Among the selected articles,\
    \ we obtained\n22 articles describing the detailed review of existing security\
    \ techniques, applications used,\nadvantages/disadvantages, and limitations of\
    \ IoT and WSN. Most of them reviewed the\narticles in terms of application of\
    \ IoT and attacks only. The paper mainly focuses on research\nchallenges, issues,\
    \ limitations, and the future direction of IoT and WSN frameworks in\nIndustry\
    \ 4.0.\n1.1. Motivation\nThe primary motivation for performing SLR is the ever-increasing\
    \ trend of automation\nin Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 is made up of both WSN technology\
    \ and IoT to digitize work.\nOver time, we see how digitization and technology\
    \ are replacing people in the workplace,\nand dramatically changing the global\
    \ workforce. Technology has brought ease to human\nlife and the efﬁciency of things\
    \ by making them eco-friendly, more agile, and productive.\nFrom smart cities\
    \ to smart industries, a drastic change has happened due to the intelligent\n\
    usage of IoT and WSN and IR 4.0. For example, a smart factory integrates virtual\
    \ and\nphysical systems and calibrating instruments to record their readings immediately.\
    \ In short,\nthe integration of IoT and WSN with Industry 4.0 has reduced labour\
    \ needs, freed humans\nfrom low-level skilled work, and improved the quantity\
    \ and quality of work. Therefore, To\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n5 of 36\nachieve\
    \ better analysis results, we systematically analyzed almost all research data\
    \ related\nto IoT and WSN domains in Industry 4.0.\n1.2. Contribution\nFrom smart\
    \ factories to individual lives, IoT and WSN play signiﬁcant roles. There are\n\
    many advantages, but security problems have arisen as these devices generate considerable\n\
    amounts of data daily. These papers amalgamated both sides: IoT and WSN contributions\n\
    and their security risks. This paper focuses more on the contributions of IoT\
    \ and WSN in\nIndustry 4.0 and presents an in-depth review and analysis of IoT\
    \ and WSN. The paper’s\nmain contribution involves formulating research questions\
    \ from ﬁltered data and building\na strong work foundation using SLR methods.\
    \ We discuss various applications and security\nattacks in IR 4.0. Furthermore,\
    \ new ﬁndings of the paper pertain to the key challenges and\nopen issues of WSN\
    \ integrated with IoT in Industry 4.0, to optimize different criteria.\n1.3. Paper\

    \ the state-of-the-art research studies on IoT and WSN.\nWith the fourth industrial\
    \ revolution, it is observed that communication, computation,\nand storage costs\
    \ have remarkably decreased, which make integration of IoT and WSN\npossible and\
    \ cost-effective globally. We studied many review articles and original research.\n\
    Existing review articles lack, in many aspects, research challenges, issues, limitations,\n\
    and future directions of IoT and WSN, but the systematic literature review (SLR)\
    \ given\nin this work is precise enough to deal with the aspects of IoT and WSN\
    \ area. Related\nwork of review papers is provided next. Moreover, Table 2 is\

    ✓\nThe authors in [1] discussed the very novel technology “WiFi”. They discussed\n\
    how this technology helps IoT devices–used in various applications, such as smart\
    \ cities,\nhealthcare systems, and smart houses—communicate effectively. Landaluce\
    \ et al. [4]\ndiscussed RFID and WSN technology in detail. They discussed how\
    \ RFIDs are used to\ntrace devices while WSN gathers information about them from\
    \ interconnected devices. The\nauthors also discussed the obstacles and challenges,\
    \ such as energy consumption, fault-\ntolerant, communication interference, and\
    \ cost feasibility, along with detailed surveys. They\nprovided the advantages\
    \ and limitations of wearable sensor devices. Energy consumption\nis increasing\
    \ each day. Therefore, Dailipi [4] explored how IoT evolution has managed the\n\
    electricity consumption process and provided many beneﬁts to grid stations, consumers,\n\
    and suppliers. They also discussed the security issues and challenges after introducing\
    \ IoT\ndevices in smart grids.\nIn [6], the authors discussed how WSN advancement\
    \ had played a signiﬁcant role in\nUASN. They traced the location of sensor nodes\
    \ deployed underwater in the ocean using\nlocalization algorithms. They reviewed\
    \ many applications of UASN, their advantages\nand their disadvantages. They also\
    \ discussed the challenges they faced during deployment\nand presented future\
    \ directions in the acoustic area. In [10], researchers discussed the\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n8 of 36\napplications and advantages of WSN being deployed everywhere\
    \ due to their ﬂexible and\ndynamic nature. They discussed each application of\
    \ WSN in urban areas and their solutions.\nThey analyzed how WSN deployment in\
    \ urban areas demanded much more care and\nattention due to harsh weather and\
    \ perverse channel conditions.\nWSN is applicable in many domains, such as industrial\
    \ automation, and the require-\nment elicitation of the industrial process is\
    \ different from general WSN requirement gather-\nings. In [17], the authors presented\
    \ some standard protocols that were used to measure the\nrequirements of industrial\
    \ applications. They also provide solutions to WSN protocols by\ndiscussing MAC,\
    \ routing, and transport in detail. They also discussed the security issues\n\
    in detail and identiﬁed the unsolved challenges encountered during designing standard\n\
    protocols. In [19], the authors conducted SLR, which is mainly focused on scope\
    \ deﬁnition,\nconcept, literature review, analysis, synthesis, and future research\
    \ directions. Their selected\nstudy has contributed to eight thematic perspectives:\
    \ intelligence factories, CPS, data\nhandling, IT infrastructure, digital transformation,\
    \ HCI, IoT, and cloud [18].\nDue to the rapid evolution in IoT and WSN, technology\
    \ is becoming more vulnerable\nto security threats [42–44]. Therefore authors\
    \ in [27] presented threat models for the security\nof WSN and IoT devices communication.\
    \ In [28], the authors discussed IoT applications,\nadvantages, challenges, and\
    \ security issues from both technological and social perspectives.\nResearchers\
    \ have provided detailed architectures of IoT and WSN and discussions of\nIDS\
    \ system protocols. They also discussed the security challenges and attacks on\
    \ IoT\nand WSN communication devices. Moreover, in [29], the authors conducted\
    \ extensive\nresearch related to smart homes, applications, and IoT. They collected\
    \ 229 articles, analyzed\nthem thoroughly, and divided them into four categories.\
    \ They discussed smart home IoT\napplications in the ﬁrst category. The second\
    \ category concerned with IoT applications\nin smart home technology. In the third\
    \ category, they developed a framework to operate\nfurther. In the fourth category,\
    \ they developed smart IoT home applications.\nIoT has dramatically changed human\
    \ life, especially regarding communication devices\nintegrating technologies.\
    \ Traditional industry is changing in the digital industry, and WSN\nand wireless\
    \ sensor and actuator networks (WSANs) are the core parts of Industry 4.0.\nIn\
    \ the article [30], the authors discussed the industrial wireless sensor network\
    \ (IWSN)\nand industrial wireless sensor and actuator network (IWSAN) in detail.\
    \ They discussed\nIWSAN requirements, applications, challenges, solutions, and\
    \ future directions in detail.\nIWSN/IWSAN are compelling technologies due to\
    \ their promising beneﬁts, such as low-\ncost deployment, less complexity, and\
    \ mobility support.\nIn [31], the authors discussed how IoT plays a vital role\
    \ in bringing the physical\nworld close to the digital world. They discussed technologies,\
    \ various challenges, future\ndirections, and various Internet of Things (IoT)\
    \ applications.\nIn [32], Sharma et al. have described the sensor nodes according\
    \ to coverage point of\nview. They analyzed the full coverage issues by considering\
    \ node type, deployment type,\ncommunication and sensing range, and positioning-based\
    \ independent algorithms. They\nalso discussed the research challenges of WSN.\n\
    Andrey et al. [33] described a detailed survey on IDS systems and presented the\n\
    methods proposed for IoT. Using a cross-platform distributed approach, they analyzed\n\
    the IDS system, their platform differences, and current research trends in IDS.\
    \ In [34], the\nauthors analyzed and discussed the solutions to identify and detect\
    \ sinkhole attacks in the\nWSN domain. They discussed the advantages and limitations\
    \ of the proposed solution as\nwell. In [35], the authors presented a detailed\
    \ review on security attacks of WSN and IoT\nalong with their preventive measures,\
    \ mitigations, and detection mechanisms. They stated\nthat the integration of\
    \ IoT and WSN has raised new challenges and open security issues.\nAlthough technology\
    \ has increased, it has become prone to external attacks.\nIn [36], the authors\
    \ presented a review on the security of mobile networks. They\ndiscussed the integration\
    \ of WSN with IoT via the Internet and how the inter-connected\ndevices have guarded\
    \ networks against external attacks, keeping the router in a secure and\nprotected\
    \ environment. They discussed the attacks and their detection mechanisms over\
    \ the\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n9 of 36\nInternet. Similarly, the authors in [37]\
    \ have discussed the wormhole attack and its solution\nin IoT and WSN domains.\
    \ They stated that the detection algorithm performed much\nbetter for IoT (70%)\
    \ than WSN (20%). In [45], the authors discussed side-channel attacks\nin smartphones.\
    \ Similarly, the authors in [38] discussed the security threats, challenges,\n\
    and solutions in the IoT domain. While in [39], the authors analyzed existing\
    \ protocols for\nsecure communication between IoT devices. They also discussed\
    \ open issues and challenges\nraised during the communication of IoT devices and\
    \ future directions in IoT. The authors\nin [40] presented a detailed review regarding\
    \ deployment schemes, classiﬁcation, working,\nand comparative analyses of sensor\
    \ nodes. This growing technology trend has converged\nthe “world sense” from traditional\
    \ systems to CPS—this transition is called Industry 4.0.\nThe authors in [41]\
    \ conducted a bibliometric review of 12 different approaches of critical\naspects\
    \ of Industry 4.0.\nFrom the above-detailed literature review, we noticed that\
    \ authors and researchers\nhave worked on IoT and WSN, but the integration of\
    \ both IoT & WSN with Industry 4.0 is\nbenign. They discussed their applications,\
    \ security attacks, advantages, and limitations at\neach level.\nThe proposed\
    \ paper is more oriented towards the applications and contributions of\nIoT and\
    \ WSN in Industry 4.0, along with the security attacks, their challenges, and\
    \ open\nissues in each domain. This paper also provides the limitations and future\
    \ directions for\nIoT and WSN in Industry 4.0.\n3. Research Methodology\nThe SLR\
    \ followed in this work is based on the template of IEEE SLR; all research\nsteps\
    \ and guidelines were followed using the same template. The research process and\n\
    results were manually evaluated by comparing different research methods and techniques\n\
    presented by different authors based on efﬁciency, security, limitations, and\
    \ performance.\nFirst, we formulated our research questions based on the reviewed\
    \ articles and then\nsearched for these keywords in various databases. Using avoidance\
    \ and consideration\ncriteria, only relevant papers were considered. Then, we\
    \ evaluated the quality of the papers,\nand then extracted the relevant features.\n\
    3.1. Planning Review\nThe planning of the review was based on the research questions\
    \ and their objectives.\nAnalyzes of IoT and WSN were conducted to show their\
    \ importance in daily life. The use of\nsmart and appropriate devices has been\
    \ studied in this ﬁeld but still needs critical analysis.\nTherefore, it is important\
    \ to make a systematic review article in this realm, especially\nrelated to IoT\
    \ and WSN, to show future directions. Therefore, we established the search\ntechnique,\
    \ search strings, inclusion/exclusion criteria, and quality assessment criteria\
    \ for\nthe papers collected from different repositories. Figure 4 shows the step\
    \ of our proposed\nreview planning process.\nFigure 4. Planning process of systematic\
    \ literature review (SLR).\n3.2. Research Goals\nThe main objective of this study\
    \ is to ﬁnd out the major contributions, solved problems,\nand challenges of IoT\
    \ and WSN in Industry 4.0. In addition, the research gap and limitations\nof current\
    \ work in these areas helped us ﬁnd room for improvement; we also explored\nfuture\
    \ directions and possible outcomes in this area. We designed questionnaires on\
    \ these\ndomains to ﬁnd high quality research papers. Some of them are listed\
    \ in Table 3. In addition,\nwe answer the research questions in Table 3 and in\
    \ Section 4 .\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n10 of 36\nTable 3. Research questions.\n\

    \ of Primary Studies\nIt was a challenge to search the speciﬁc and limited computer\
    \ science/engineering\ndatabases to get a “complete picture” of the research questions.\
    \ After formulating the\nresearch questions, we collected research papers from\
    \ various repositories, such as IEEE\nXplore, ACM, Wiley Online Search, Elsevier,\
    \ etc. The papers from electronic databases\nwith the areas of IoT, WSN, and Industry\
    \ 4.0 were efﬁciently evaluated. Figure 5 shows the\nnames of the repositories\
    \ where the research articles were collected from 2014 to June 2021.\nFigure 5.\
    \ Repositories versus number of studies Used.\n3.4. Selection/Search Criteria\n\
    This SLR combines three domains: IoT, WSN, and Industrial Revolution 4.0, so the\
    \ search\nstrings were related to each domain and its applications in Industry\
    \ 4.0. Table 4 shows the\nsubject search strings used to search for relevant articles.\
    \ The search strings were divided into\nfive groups to search for relevant articles\
    \ from reputable journals and conferences.\nTable 4. Search strings.\nSr. No.\n\

    \ research articles were found on the mentioned domains, IoT, WSN and IR 4.0.\n\
    To extract the most relevant and concise data from these articles, the following\
    \ criteria were\nchosen, as shown in Table 5. The publicly available papers written\
    \ in English and related\nto the search strings and research objectives in IoT,\
    \ WSN, and IR 4.0 published between\n2014 and 2021 were considered for further\
    \ SLR tracking.\nTable 5. Inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nInclusion Criteria\n\

    \ the downloaded articles were based on the initial screening\nprocesses, which\
    \ were based on inclusion criteria. The articles were screened using the\ninitial\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC). The main objective of using the QAC was to\n\
    ensure that the primary studies selected were appropriate to address the concerns\
    \ of\nprevious studies. Nearly 300 articles were found on the above topics. After\
    \ applying\na duplication ﬁlter, 40 articles were discarded, leaving 260 articles\
    \ that were reviewed\nbased on the above exclusion criteria. In the next step,\
    \ 60 articles were excluded based\non the inclusion/exclusion criteria. A quality\
    \ analysis was performed for the remaining\n200 articles. After the quality analysis,\
    \ only 120 articles were reviewed. Figure 6 shows\nthe year-by-year distribution\
    \ of articles reviewed that were used for the SLR study. There\nis no doubt that\
    \ the eliminated articles contained valuable material, but they were not\nstudied\
    \ because they did not meet the screening criteria. The number of articles was\n\
    initially limited to 120, after which they were stored in the citation manager\
    \ software for\ninformation synthesis.\nThe selected papers were evaluated against\
    \ the quality assessment criteria (QAC)\nlisted in Table 6. Table 6 shows the\
    \ quality assessment criteria (QAC) used to screen the\narticles for response\
    \ grading. Studies selected for screening are described in Table 7. Studies\n\
    with a score greater than or equal to 80 were selected according to the grading\

    \ intruders in WSN and IoT, WSN coverage, issues in\nIoT and WSN framework, and\
    \ limitations of existing reviews are explained in this section.\nThe challenges\
    \ section summarizes all the problems encountered in WSN and IoT usage.\nSensors\
    \ 2022, 22, 2087\n18 of 36\n4.1. RQ1: Contributions of WSN in IR 4.0\nThe use\
    \ of WSN has attracted a lot of attention in industry. Because of their prevalence\n\
    and use in industry, WSN have given rise to IWSN and IWSAN, respectively. These\
    \ net-\nworks enable autonomous work without human intervention. The in-network\
    \ transmission\ncharacteristics are fundamental properties of WSN. Sensor nodes\
    \ do not transmit raw\ndata, but integrate it to save communication costs. Due\
    \ to their unique properties and\nwide range of applications, they are used in\
    \ many systems, such as military, surveillance,\nhome automation, smart cities,\
    \ smart buildings, and healthcare monitoring [27]. WSN- and\nIoT-based devices\
    \ are used to create reliable, realistic, efﬁcient, ﬂexible, and economical\n\
    smart cities and buildings in heterogeneous environments [48].\nFigure 8. Taxonomy\
    \ of existing studies.\nThe categories discussed in this paper and the contribution\
    \ of WSN in IR 4.0 are\nlisted in the form of a taxonomy presented in Figure 8.\
    \ WSN is also used in health care\nmanagement systems to monitor medically ill\
    \ patients, periodically check their various\nmeasurements such as blood glucose\
    \ levels and pulse, and wirelessly transmit this in-\nformation to a central repository\
    \ for further diagnosis [49]. WSN is also used to assist\nelderly and disabled\
    \ people. Disabled people are informed of relevant information about\nreal-time\
    \ activities using smart devices, such as wristwatches [28,50]. In recent decades,\n\
    WSN have been applied in many ﬁelds, including transportation, agriculture [51],\
    \ automa-\ntion, manufacturing process control, and supply chain management. In\
    \ addition, WSN\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n19 of 36\ncan be easily deployed, have\
    \ low construction cost, no expenditure on wiring, and lower\ncomplexity [52,53].\n\
    WSN can be used in various manufacturing applications, such as industrial control,\n\
    process automation, rescue, and defense. WSN is also used to control and automate\n\
    industrial processes known as actuators. They can operate independently of a physi-\n\
    cal environment deﬁned by predeﬁned dimensions [54]. WSN is used to collect, track,\n\
    and record data in smart factories. Data acquisition is usually done by product\
    \ informa-\ntion in smart factories. After data collection, processing is done\
    \ by intelligent machines\nand manufacturing systems. Nowadays, these factories\
    \ are self-sufﬁcient, cost-effective,\nand automated by integrating wireless communications\
    \ with existing private networks\nand reducing labor [30].\nIn software, WSN takes\
    \ maximum advantage of wireless technologies used to build\nindustrial network\
    \ infrastructure [55]. On the other side, Industry 4.0 is integrating big data\n\
    analytics and cloud services [56], 3D printing, computer security, autonomous\
    \ robotics, the\nInternet of Things (IoT), 5G, Augmented Reality (AR), and modeling\
    \ [57,58].\n4.2. RQ2: Contributions of IoT in IR 4.0\nAn integrated digital system\
    \ would introduce a new intelligent and economical man-\nufacturing process using\
    \ cutting-edge technology for a variety of existing items and pro-\ncesses [59].\
    \ The data collected from production process warehouses and consumer in-\nformation\
    \ can be critically analyzed to make a decision in real time under Industry 4.0.\n\
    The real-time decision-making capability of each small and medium organization\
    \ enables\nthem to efﬁciently accept new technologies [60,61]. Industrial IoT\
    \ delivers solutions and\nservices that provide insights into an organization’s\
    \ ability to monitor and control its oper-\nations and assets. IIoT software and\
    \ tools provide important solutions for better process,\nlayout scheduling, organization,\
    \ and administration.\nIn addition, IIoT enables real-time and decision-making\
    \ features among numerous\nnetworked devices that can communicate and interact\
    \ with each other [62]. Because of\nthe rapid communication and data transfer,\
    \ attackers can attack data and cause harm to\nan organization, resulting in cyber\
    \ attacks. Cyber attacks have become a major challenge\nfor the industrial Internet\
    \ of Things (IIoT). Therefore, integrating IoT with Industry 4.0\nplays a critical\
    \ role in securing IoT devices from attacks. Unique security objectives and\n\
    challenges of IIoT have been introduced to overcome industrial-level issues. IIoT\
    \ challenges\nand objectives relate to IoT being used by consumers and its capabilities\
    \ leading to longer\nlife of IoT devices and sensor nodes. In [63], the authors\
    \ analyzed security challenges\nand attacks at three levels of the network (perception,\
    \ network, and application). They\nconsidered cryptographic challenges, authentication,\
    \ network monitoring, and access\ncontrol mechanisms. The IIoT also addresses\
    \ local network connectivity and protection\nfrom attackers inside. Cyber attacks\
    \ have become a serious challenge for the IIoT. Hackers\nattack infrastructure/devices\
    \ through intrusion and hiding, resulting in poor performance.\nA bidirectional\
    \ long and short term memory network with a multi-feature layer has been\ndeveloped\
    \ to avoid temporal attacks. Machine learning-based networks that learn temporal\n\
    attacks from historical data and make associations with test data can effectively\
    \ identify\nand detect different attacks within different intervals [64].\nDL-IIoT\
    \ has enormous potential to improve data processing and contribute to IR 4.0.\n\
    Similarly, machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, are widely\
    \ used for\nmalware detection and security threat protection [65]. Deep learning\
    \ algorithms are also\nused for intelligent analysis and processing. Deep learning\
    \ [46]algorithms such as CNN,\nauto-encoders, and recurrent neural networks have\
    \ applications such as intelligent assem-\nbly and manufacturing, network monitoring,\
    \ and accident prevention. The application\nof deep learning algorithms in IIoT\
    \ has also enabled various smart applications such as\nmanufacturing, active attack\
    \ detection and prevention systems, smart meters, and smart\nagriculture [66].\
    \ DL-IIoT relies heavily on data collection, which affects the privacy of the\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 2087\n20 of 36\norganization’s data. Therefore, differentiated\
    \ privacy is used to protect user privacy, reduce\nprivacy risk, and achieve high\
    \ performance in IIoT.\nOn the other hand, IoT and IIoT must provide “differentiated\
    \ privacy” for individuals\nand industrial data [67–69]. The contribution of IoT\
    \ in Industry 4.0 has improved the\naverage availability and sustainability of\
    \ the enterprise by knowing market trends and\ndecreasing unanticipated downturns\
    \ [70]. The taxonomy of existing studies and the\ncontribution of IoT in IR 4.0\
    \ is shown in Figure 8.\n4.3. RQ3: Type of WSN Coverage Area for IR 4.0\nWSN coverage\
    \ is an important factor in sensor quality. Sensing and connectivity\nare key\
    \ features of WSN. The former indicate how well a particular sensor behaves and\n\
    monitors a particular area of interest in which it is deployed. Connectivity shows\
    \ how\nwell different nodes communicate with each other. The types of wireless\
    \ sensor network\ncoverage are as follows.\n4.3.1. Area Coverage\nSensors usually\
    \ perform well in area coverage and monitors the ﬁeld of interest (FoI).\nThis\
    \ is also called “blanket coverage” because each node communicates with others.\
    \ Each\nsensor is placed so that the coverage of the other WSN sensors covers\
    \ each other [32].\n4.3.2. Barrier Coverage\nBarrier coverage of the sensor network\
    \ comes into play when some intruders try to\nbreach the security layer of the\
    \ network. Sensors are easy to handle and deploy; therefore,\ntheir wireless nature\
    \ makes them vulnerable to malicious security attacks [71]. The sensor\nnodes\
    \ are primarily distributed throughout the network and are deployed in chains\
    \ to\ndetect interruptions.\n4.3.3. Point Coverage\nPoint coverage aims to ﬁnd\
    \ a target within range using nearby nodes. It is also known\nas target coverage.\
    \ It is characterized by consuming less energy in a given zone than in the\nentire\
    \ region of the FoI. Only a few targets are covered by individual nodes, while\
    \ other\ntargets can be detected under other sensor scopes. The primary goal is\
    \ to select a speciﬁc\ntarget within the FoI to reduce energy consumption [71].\n\
    4.4. RQ4: Classiﬁcation of Network Intruders\nThere are two main types of intruders:\
    \ internal and external. Internal intruders are\npeople inside the organization;\
    \ they can be either a customer or a legitimate user, such\nas an employee of\
    \ the organization’s network. External intruders are people outside the\norganization,\
    \ whether external or internal. Each intruder can be involved in numerous\nillegal\
    \ activities, working alone, as a group, or with agencies. These entities are\
    \ described\nin detail below.\n4.4.1. Solo Entities\nSolo entities are those that\
    \ work alone with minimal safety. They are usually experts\nin their domains by\
    \ employing a single piece of code as equipment, such as viruses,\nworms, and\
    \ sniffers to misuse frameworks. They usually gain access to the organization’s\n\
    framework through hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually\
    \ little,\nand attacks are slightly less critical. Moreover, large and complex\
    \ systems that may contain\nﬂaws are more vulnerable to attacks. Monetary institutions\
    \ are also more exposed to attacks\nas they exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.2. Organized Groups\nSolo entities are those who work alone with minimal security.\
    \ They are usually experts\nin their ﬁeld, using a single piece of code as equipment,\
    \ such as viruses, worms, and sniffers\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n21 of 36\nto abuse\
    \ frameworks. They generally gain access to the organization’s framework through\n\
    hardware damage and web loopholes. Their targets are usually small, and attacks\
    \ are\nsomewhat less critical. In addition, large and complex systems that may\
    \ contain ﬂaws are\nmore vulnerable to attack. Monetary institutions are also\
    \ more exposed to attacks because\nthey exchange sensitive information [72].\n\
    4.4.3. Intelligence Agencies\nIntelligent agencies from other countries are involved\
    \ in this type of attack. These\nagencies constantly seek to test the military\
    \ architecture of other nations, including contem-\nporary monitoring and covert\
    \ political and military activities. To do so, they require many\nresources, from\
    \ software to hardware, research, development, personnel, and ﬁnances.\nBecause\
    \ they have all these resources at their disposal, some agencies now pose a serious\n\
    threat to economic and military espionage. Such organizations pose the greatest\
    \ threat to\nnetworks and must be closely monitored to protect the nation’s important\
    \ assets [73].\n4.5. RQ5: Network Security Attack in IoT and WSN Layers\nThreats\
    \ become more attractive and dangerous as technology increases. Although new\n\
    security mechanisms are being developed, intruders can easily ﬁnd other ways to\
    \ attack\nsystems. Table 8 explains the network security attacks in the IoT and\
    \ WSN domains.\nThe attacks are categorized according to the open system interconnection\
    \ (OSI) layered\npoint of view [74].\nTable 8. Network Security Attacks on IoT\
    \ and WSN Layers.\nSr. No.\nLayer Name\nAttacks\n1\nPhysical layer\nInterception,\
    \ radio interference, jamming, tempering, Sybil attack.\n2\nData link layer\n\
    Replay attack, Spooﬁng, altering routing attack, Sybil Attack, collision, trafﬁc\
    \ analysis,\nand monitoring, exhaustion.\n3\nNetwork layer\nBlack hole attack,\
    \ wormhole attack, sinkhole attack, grey hole attack, selective forward-\ning\
    \ attack, hello ﬂood attack, misdirection attack, internet smurf attack, spooﬁng\
    \ attack.\n4\nTransport layer\nDe-synchronization, transport layer ﬂooding attack.\n\
    5\nApplication layer\nSpooﬁng, alter routing attack, false data ejection, path-based\
    \ DoS.\n4.5.1. Denial of Service Attacks (DOS)\nA Denial-of-service (DoS) attack\
    \ is a malicious attack in which attackers make the\nvictim’s system unresponsive\
    \ and difﬁcult to reach for the legitimate user by making many\nrequests to the\
    \ expected URL than the server can handle [75,76]. DoS attacks typically occur\n\
    when authenticated clients have not been granted access to the information or\
    \ service [77].\nA distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack is a type of DoS\
    \ attack that uses multiple users\nor infected systems to attack a victim’s system\
    \ or to attack a website so that it becomes\nunresponsive. This attack also prevents\
    \ the website from functioning properly and disrupts\nregular trafﬁc. In WSN,\
    \ a DDoS attack changes the routing protocol information DSR,\nresulting in a\
    \ huge amount of unauthorized trafﬁc and making the network/website\nunavailable.\
    \ On the other hand, a low-rate denial-of-service (LDoS) attack is another type\n\
    of DoS that penetrates the WSN’s routing protocol, thus compromising the security\
    \ and\ntrust mechanisms. An LDoS attack is difﬁcult to detect due to its non-stationary\
    \ nature and\nlow signal strength52. In this attack, illegitimate trafﬁc affects\
    \ the operational capability of\na network. It causes severe outages and monetary\
    \ losses.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n22 of 36\n4.5.2. Replay Attacks\nWhen an attacker\
    \ replays a ﬂood of messages between the sender and the receiver,\nupdating the\
    \ line table (DT) to steal information, it is called a replay attack [33]. It\
    \ is a\nnetwork layer attack in which a third party intercepts the data during\
    \ transmission. The\nattacker retransmits this data by either modifying or delaying\
    \ it, spooﬁng the sender’s IP\naddress to the attacker’s IP address, and impersonating\
    \ the legitimate sender.\n4.5.3. Trojan Worms, Viruses, and Malware\nAn attacker\
    \ can use malicious software to manipulate data, steal information, or\neven launch\
    \ a denial-of-service attack on a device. A worm, such as a Trojan horse, can\n\
    infect one’s computer when one downloads a ﬁle or receives an update. The worm\
    \ then\nmultiplies and attacks other machines on the network. Unlike a virus,\
    \ many Trojan horses\nusually reside on one’s own computer. A virus can infect\
    \ the host’s ﬁle when sent via\nemail and then spread to other users [78]. Malware\
    \ is malicious content that can interfere\nwith a computer’s operation and slow\
    \ its performance. When data from IoT devices is\ncompromised, malware can infest\
    \ the cloud or data centers. These attacks breach the\nprimary security mechanisms\
    \ of any OS/server, such as a ﬁrewall and window defender.\n4.5.4. Black Hole\
    \ Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack known as a packet drop attack. In this\
    \ attack, a node\nsends an RREQ packet to all its neighbors in the network, and\
    \ the router is supposed to\nforward the packet instead of discarding it. The\
    \ nature of this attack is similar to a DDoS\nattack. Attackers are used to attack\
    \ routers by sending many false requests to prevent\nlegitimate routers from forwarding\
    \ packets. This is also called a ﬁrst-come, ﬁrst-served\nattack because the attacker\
    \ can also use a malicious router or reprogram it to block packets\ninstead of\
    \ sending correct information [78]. These attacks reduce the average throughput.\n\
    When combined with a sinkhole attack, this attack affects performance and stops\
    \ all trafﬁc\naround the black hole. When combined with the sinkhole attack, this\
    \ attack severely\ndegrades trafﬁc and modiﬁes or discards content during transmission.\n\
    4.5.5. Sink Hole Attacks\nThis is a network layer attack where attackers attract\
    \ all network trafﬁc from nearby\nnodes to a compromised node and appear as attractive\
    \ and trusted nodes. This attack\nis also used to initiate other attacks such\
    \ as spooﬁng attacks, DoS, and modiﬁcation of\nrouting information in WSN [34].\
    \ When combined with selective routing and worm attacks,\nsinkhole attacks become\
    \ even more dangerous. A sinkhole attack is initiated in two ways,\neither by\
    \ hacking a node within the network or by a malicious node impersonating itself\n\
    as the shortest path to the base station [35,36]. A sinkhole attack impacts the\
    \ routing\nconﬁguration/protocols of the forwarding node. Due to this behavior,\
    \ it is considered as an\nerror or malicious node by the neighboring nodes, which\
    \ affects the network performance.\nThis leads to mis-routing and incorrect displays\
    \ of the routing protocol.\n4.5.6. Wormhole Attacks\nA wormhole attack is a network\
    \ layer attack in which an invader attacks the WSN\nthrough two or more compromised\
    \ nodes. The invaders forward the data from one\nmalicious node to another node\
    \ at the end of the network through the tunnel. The wormhole\nappears to other\
    \ nodes as a ﬁctitious neighbor. Wormhole nodes usually transmit data\ndirectly\
    \ from one node to the destination without including other nodes in the path.\
    \ Due\nto this nature, other nodes in WSN easily trust those closest to other\
    \ nodes, which causes\nmany routing problems. Moreover, they can build better\
    \ communication channels for\nlong-range communication [37]. Wormhole attacks\
    \ affect the performance of many network\nservices, such as time synchronization,\
    \ localization, and data fusion.\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n23 of 36\n4.5.7. Selective\
    \ Forwarding (Gray Hole)\nA selective forwarding attack (SFA) is a special type\
    \ of black hole attack in which\nthe compromised node drops some selective packets\
    \ instead of all packets. Invaders drop\npackets containing critical information,\
    \ such as military information, without noticing them\nor allowing others that\
    \ may contain non-critical information to pass. This can lead to worse\neffects\
    \ and a decrease in network efﬁciency [34–37]. Selective forwarding attacks impact\n\
    network performance and consume limited energy resources.\n4.6. RQ6: Issues in\
    \ WSN and IoT Frameworks\nIn this section, we mention various WSN and IoT frameworks\
    \ that highlight the\nimportance of WSN and IoT in different aspects of life.\
    \ Although many advances have\nbeen made in IoT, there are still many problems,\
    \ as shown in Figure 9, that need to be\nreduced and solved efﬁciently to avoid\
    \ any damage [79,80].\nFigure 9. Issues in WSN and IoT Framework.\n4.6.1. Security\n\
    Security is essential for any organization to protect its environment, systems,\
    \ devices\nand applications from outside attacks. Data and communication technologies\
    \ are increasing\nevery day. Therefore, data and information security are necessary\
    \ tasks [81]. In addition to\ndata, its transmission over the network should also\
    \ be protected. Although technology has\nevolved and security mechanisms have\
    \ improved, attackers have still found many ways to\nbreach the security level\
    \ [38,39]. With the increasing number of IoT devices, new security\nissues have\
    \ emerged. For real-time applications, the most important thing is to keep the\n\
    WSN secure. The network and its associated router or hub should enforce an access\
    \ control\nmechanism to prevent unauthorized users. Each node connected to another\
    \ node is security\nrelevant, whether it is a restricted device or a smart device.\
    \ Acceptance, conﬁrmation,\ncategorization, trust, and information security are\
    \ the most important security requirements\nto be considered in IoT networks and\
    \ WSN. It is challenging to provide security measures\nfor ﬂexible detection devices.\
    \ Therefore, protecting information from dictatorial forces or\nillegal access\
    \ is called security [82,83].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n24 of 36\n4.6.2. Data Conﬁdentiality\
    \ and Privacy\nData conﬁdentiality is a signiﬁcant issue in IoT and network security.\
    \ In IoT frame-\nworks, the client gains access to the information and system\
    \ management in an unintended\nenvironment due to issues such as the use of sensor\
    \ nodes. Attackers can physically capture\nthem and extract data using an energy\
    \ analysis attack [84]. Refurbished devices made from\nthese captured devices\
    \ can launch new attacks and violate security. Therefore, the IoT\ndevice should\
    \ verify whether or not the user or device has been granted permission to\naccess\
    \ the system. The practice of controlling access to data by granting or denying\
    \ permis-\nsion based on a set of laws. Many devices/clients must be authenticated\
    \ by management\nto access the system. Data conﬁdentiality and access are the\
    \ main issues in the Internet\nof Things (IoT). Researchers are trying to ﬁgure\
    \ out how to handle the personalities of\ncustomers, items/articles, and devices\
    \ in a secure manner. Due to the ubiquitous nature\nof IoT and WSN systems, privacy\
    \ and conﬁdentiality are major concerns in IoT devices\nand frameworks. Some issues,\
    \ such as snifﬁng and spooﬁng, unauthorized access, data\nchanging, forging, and\
    \ unapproved alteration of IoT and WSN nodes, pose signiﬁcant\nuncertainties in\
    \ IoT. An attacker can use various IoT devices and applications to capture\nsensitive\
    \ and personal data that is visible to outsiders.\n4.6.3. Data Acquisition and\
    \ Transmission\nThe primary goal of IoT is to collect data and transmit it to\
    \ where it is needed in a\nnetwork. Sensors are the devices used to collect data\
    \ from the environment to transmit it to\nthe base station. After the raw data\
    \ is collected, it is sent to the Sink Hub for processing. Data\ncollection and\
    \ transmission are other problems in IoT and WSN because data is exposed\nand\
    \ modiﬁed during transmission. Data acquisition is an energy-consuming process,\
    \ so\nextra care must be taken during gathering and transmission. Intruders can\
    \ steal the data\nduring transmission if it is not encrypted or transmitted over\
    \ a secure channel. The intruder\ncan take over a node and reprogram it with a\
    \ malicious code, damaging the entire network.\nTherefore, security is required\
    \ for this process. Sometimes intruders attack the databases of\norganizations\
    \ to violate the conﬁdentiality of the data [85]. Also, the intruder may destroy\n\
    the node or collect important or unusual information that could be used against\
    \ the system.\nFor this reason, researchers present many security mechanisms.\
    \ They protect end-to-end\ncommunication links using one-time-pad (OTP) encryption\
    \ method and also identify the\nvulnerabilities in the DBMS application using\
    \ SEPTIC method.\n4.6.4. Resource Limitations\nIf necessary resources in WSN and\
    \ IoT are abandoned or not handled efﬁciently, it may\naffect the performance\
    \ of the network. The network consists of many nodes and sensors that\nrequire\
    \ energy to operate well [86]. Various MAC layer protocols have been developed\
    \ to\nreduce the energy consumption of sensors or nodes. These energy-efﬁcient\
    \ algorithms work\nprimarily by regulating the synchronization of network trafﬁc\
    \ over time and the time period\nduring which a node becomes active in a network\
    \ [87,88]. In contrast, the communication\nmedium is another basic requirement,\
    \ since nodes rely on the Internet for data transmission.\nThere is a constant\
    \ need for energy, otherwise the network will fail. The nodes have limited\nresources\
    \ because battery capacity, correspondence capacity, and computing power are low.\n\
    Again, security is the main problem, because the security measurement expenses\
    \ require\nmore resources to maintain the speed of the network, which is not affordable.\
    \ As a result of\nlow regulated security, attacks can subvert software execution\
    \ and protocols used in the\nnetwork [89,90].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n25 of 36\n\
    4.6.5. Quality of Service\nQuality of Service (QoS) manages networks and resources\
    \ to strengthen IoT connec-\ntivity. QoS manages delay, jitter, reliability, and\
    \ bandwidth by classifying network trafﬁc.\nIt plays an important role in optimizing\
    \ systems. Quality of Service means that energy\nefﬁciency, reliability, bit error\
    \ rate, and latency should be good enough to capture data\nover a network. Therefore,\
    \ it is classiﬁed in two ways: program-speciﬁc and network-\nspeciﬁc. The QoS\
    \ perspective of the network refers to the effective management of network\nresources\
    \ and transmission performance, while the perspective of the program refers to\n\
    mobility, time synchronization, and sampling parameters. Similarly, many algorithms\
    \ have\nbeen developed to distribute heavy trafﬁc evenly, and the energy consumption\
    \ load in a\nnetwork uses a cluster-head approach to achieve high performance\
    \ and efﬁciency [91].\n4.6.6. Tampering\nSensors can be placed either indoors\
    \ or outdoors. Indoor sensors can be easily man-\naged and protected, while outdoor\
    \ sensors are more vulnerable to attackers due to remote\nlocations with poor\
    \ security, harsh climates, etc 78. The probability that these sensors will\n\
    be physically attacked is much higher; therefore, physical protection cannot be\
    \ guaranteed.\nA DoS attack manipulates the network by breaking the connection\
    \ or changing the current\nnetwork. The attacker can also replace the original\
    \ node with a fake or malicious node,\ncausing a severe attack on the network\
    \ [92]. In a Sybil attack, a malicious node penetrates\neach cluster head of the\
    \ network and affects the operation of the routing protocol. Com-\npromised nodes\
    \ can be used to launch new attacks without exposing themselves [41,93].\nThese\
    \ nodes are difﬁcult to detect and isolate, allowing an attacker to alter data\
    \ or transmit\nmalware throughout the network that causes signiﬁcant damage [94].\
    \ Constant monitoring\nof the network is necessary to ensure that WSN nodes cannot\
    \ be tampered with and that\nnetwork performance remains stable [95].\n4.6.7.\
    \ Authorization and Authentication\nNodes are the building blocks of the Internet\
    \ of Things that must be deﬁned in the\nnetwork. Transmission between devices\
    \ and access to the entire network span a wide\nrange in IoT and WSN. IoT devices\
    \ perform role-based access control, and their devices are\nallowed to do only\
    \ what is required [96,97]. Devices and their data must be protected from\nphysical\
    \ and logical attacks on the network. Attacks on the DNS cache could affect the\n\
    overall performance of the network. Authentication is the process by which each\
    \ node on\nthe network can access data based on a ﬁxed connection to a server\
    \ or cloud-based server.\nIf the authentication process is not administered properly,\
    \ it will lead to security issues\nand questions. An attacker can easily access\
    \ the network and make it fail temporarily by\nmaking too many wrong attempts.\n\
    Authentication is complicated due to the massive proliferation of wireless media\
    \ and\nthe nature of sensor networks. Authentication is usually done using the\
    \ credentials of a\nlegitimate user [98,99]. However, this technique is not secure\
    \ enough. Therefore, passwords\nshould be changed regularly and computers should\
    \ not be left unattended to make this\ntechnique robust. Both the sender and the\
    \ recipient should perform authentication to verify\nthe origin of the communication\
    \ [100,101].\n4.7. RQ7: Limitations of the Literature Review\nIn this section,\
    \ Table 9 explains the proposed solutions of the work conducted by\nvarious authors\
    \ and the contributions with the limitations of their work are also described.\n\

    5. Challenges and Open Issues\nIntelligent systems can address various problems\
    \ faced by industry, but there have\nbeen some challenges in integrating IoT and\
    \ WSN into Industry 4.0. Technological improve-\nments in IoT and WSN have increased\
    \ concerns about security and data management [96].\nAs more and more data is\
    \ generated, it is difﬁcult for factories and industries to manage\nit properly.\
    \ Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms have been implemented to manage Big Data\n\
    and make systems and devices act more intelligently. The algorithms are used to\
    \ process\nthe data in different time periods. For education, the data must be\
    \ shared in a central\nrepository, while enterprises are mainly reluctant to share\
    \ their private data due to poor\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n30 of 36\nand insufﬁcient\
    \ organizational support for data in Industry 4.0. There are also safety\nmanagement\
    \ issues in Industry 4.0 [116].\nBig data: The emergence of various technologies\
    \ and the explosion of their use have\nled to the outstanding development of Big\
    \ Data technology and processing. Every device\nproduces a huge amount of data.\
    \ Due to the growing amount of big data, the improve-\nments of Big Data packages\
    \ encounter limitations and demand situations that need to be\n“overcome” in order\
    \ to manage the amount of data used efﬁciently.\nAdapting to 6G: 6G is another\
    \ challenge for wireless sensor networks and the Internet\nof Things. Processing\
    \ power is a major challenge in developing low-power and low-cost\n6G devices.\
    \ In addition, 6G brings privacy and security challenges for WSN and IoT.\nUpdates:system\
    \ components could not be upgraded due to interoperability between\nprotocols,\
    \ systems, and their components. Therefore, systems are more vulnerable to attack\n\
    if any part of a single system from a network is infected in intelligent factories.\n\
    Environment: security is also a critical challenge in WSN [97,100,106]. WSN nodes\n\
    are not secure when deployed in a prone environment due to the wireless transmission\
    \ of\ndata. An attacker can access them from anywhere in the world and manipulate\
    \ them easily.\nInternet attacks can also affect the vulnerability of sensor nodes.\n\
    Supply chain management systems: IoT devices are spreading erery day, posing new\n\
    challenges to the integrity and scalability of supply chain management systems\
    \ [117,118].\nSimultaneously connecting IoT devices to the cloud or the Internet\
    \ requires a lot of access\ncontrol, fault tolerance, data management, privacy,\
    \ and security.\nLimited resources: are other challenges in WSN domain that affect\
    \ the energy of\nsensor nodes used in the network. Sensor nodes usually change\
    \ their mode from sleep to\nactive and vice versa. Therefore, sleep mode is considered\
    \ as \"outside the network\" while\nactive mode brings some other issues such\
    \ as energy consumption [119]. Due to the high\nenergy consumption, they also\
    \ became dead. Sensor nodes usually have limited power,\nprocessing, and memory.\
    \ In addition, sensor mobility is another problem that hinders the\nintegration\
    \ of mobile sensor nodes with the Internet.\n6. Future Directions\nIndustry 4.0\
    \ leads to the merging of people and technology to complement human\nactivities\
    \ with intelligent machines. Industry 4.0 will lead to customized human fashion\n\
    that will minimize the oversupply and unavailability of supplies or items. Human-machine\n\
    interaction will increase productivity and customer satisfaction with customized\
    \ products.\nThe next version of Industry 4.0 is Industry 5.0, which is expected\
    \ to be more user-\nfriendly and better integrate technology with society and\
    \ the environment. It depends\nmainly on robots. Robots are already the backbone\
    \ of manufacturing, and Industry 4.0\ntechnologies [120,121] provide ﬂexibility\
    \ in manufacturing. Industry 5.0 combines human\ncreativity and craftsmanship\
    \ with the speed, productivity (e.g., CPS) [122], and consistency\nof robots.\
    \ In this version, robots can be programmed to work alongside humans.\nSoft computing:\
    \ can be used to reduce the dimensions of these large dimensional\ndata sets [123].\
    \ Good features are essential to make efﬁcient decisions. This is the reason\n\
    why soft computing techniques are used to obtain useful features.\nExplainable\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence (XAI): can be used for interpretability of the deci-\n\
    sion made by the classiﬁcation model. Classiﬁcation models make decisions in a\
    \ black box\nwhere the user does not know how the decision is made. XAI converts\
    \ this black box into a\nwhite box and interprets the decision made by a model.\
    \ XAI increases user conﬁdence to\ntake further action [124].\nFederated learning\
    \ (FL): is an optimal choice for privacy preservation. FL works by\ntraining global\
    \ and local models on the edge device. The model on the edge device does\nnot\
    \ share the data with the global, thus keeping the data private at each edge device.\
    \ Only\nparameters are shared globally to retrain the global model and optimize\
    \ the inference\nresults [125,126].\nSensors 2022, 22, 2087\n31 of 36\nSecure\
    \ devices: sensor nodes are designed to consume less energy and become active\n\
    when they are needed or an event occurs [59]. Further improvements are also needed\
    \ to\nprevent attacks from the Internet. While the IoT has no limitations in terms\
    \ of processing\nor energy. Due to the tremendous proliferation of IoT devices,\
    \ this paradigm is now being\nshifted from the IoT to the Internet of Everything.\n\
    Sustainability: IoT systems are now moving toward the idea of self-organization,\n\
    and systems are becoming capable of responding in an automated and adaptive manner\n\
    and dealing with changes and uncertainties in the environment [118].\nEducation\
    \ 5.0: in this digital era, education must also change from traditional to\nintegrating\
    \ hardware and software with co-bots to develop new skills and a smart society.\n\
    Educational institutes are now using pedagogical tools to provide a better experience.\n\
    Even though IoT-based education is still not widespread, there is still room for\
    \ further\nimprovement, such as sensor node coverage and efﬁciency, wireless data\
    \ transmission of\ndata [127], battery life, and high-cost nodes.\nGeneral directions:\
    \ there are many challenges. Future directions may address het-\nerogeneous interoperability\
    \ of systems, self-organization protocols, routing schemes for\nmanaging IoT networks,\
    \ data management [79], cross-platform optimization, and the\ndevelopment of network\
    \ security algorithms to secure wireless transmission from data\nmanipulation,\
    \ stealing, or hacking activities. On the hardware side, researchers are de-\n\
    veloping energy-efﬁcient sensor nodes [91,115], with net-zero power to reduce\
    \ maximum\npower consumption.\n7. Conclusions\nIn this digital and modern era,\
    \ technology is evolving every day. Due to the massive\nproliferation of technology,\
    \ IoT and WSN play an important role in Industry 4.0 to develop\nsmart applications,\
    \ design networked data centers, and build autonomous smart industries.\nData\
    \ networks have been created and improved with the help of new and smart devices.\n\
    In this systematic literature review, WSN and IoT network threats were analyzed\
    \ and a\ndescriptive comparative study was conducted. These networks are the main\
    \ attack surfaces\nfor attackers to draw meaningful patterns from system and user\
    \ data. Wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSN) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have\
    \ rapidly (and widely) evolved to meet\nthe increasing demand for conventional\
    \ application scenarios, such as plant automation\nand remote process control\
    \ systems. These smart devices are also being used to improve the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ existing networks and create new opportunities for automating and securing\n\
    industrial processes. In this article, we explore seven research questions: (i)\
    \ What are the\ncontributions of WSN in IR4. 0? (ii) What are the contributions\
    \ of IoT in IR 4.0? (iii) What\nare the types of WSN coverage areas for IR 4.0?\
    \ (iv) What are the main types of network\nintrusions in WSN and IoT systems?\
    \ (v) What are the main network security attacks in\nWSN and IoT? (vi) What are\
    \ the major issues in IoT and WSN systems? (vii) What are\nthe limitations and\
    \ research gaps in the current work? The main purpose of the fourth\nindustrial\
    \ revolution with WSN and IoT explicitly shows that the evolutionary transition\n\
    needs to be intensiﬁed and extended to include emerging research areas and intimidating\n\
    technological challenges. This article covers all elements of WSN, from the design\
    \ phase\nto the security requirements, from the implementation phase to the classiﬁcation\
    \ of the\nnetwork, and from the difﬁculties and challenges of WSN. Future studies\
    \ will address\nthe problems in the coverage regions of wireless sensor networks\
    \ and provide effective\nsolutions to the existing problems and challenges in\
    \ this area. The use and application of\nWSN and IoT in Industry 4.0 involves\
    \ the processing of extracted data and the efﬁcient and\nsecure transmission of\
    \ this data to a remote location.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.M.,\

    \ (IoT) with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)\noccurred, tens of applications including\
    \ smart agriculture have emerged to offer innovative solutions\nto modernize the\
    \ farming sector. This paper aims to present a low-cost platform for comprehensive\n\
    environmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This platform is deployed\
    \ and tested in a real\nscenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the period\
    \ of March 2020 to March 2021. The experi-\nmental work fulﬁlls the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time monitoring of the environmental\nparameters using\
    \ both under- and aboveground sensors. These IoT sensors are on a farm collecting\n\
    vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent to ground gateways every\
    \ 1 h, after which the\nobtained data is collected and transmitted by a drone\
    \ to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h.\nThis low-cost platform can\
    \ help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to predict environmental\ndata\
    \ over the geographically large farm ﬁeld, which leads to enhancement in crop\
    \ productivity and\nfarm management in a cost-effective, and timely manner. Obtained\
    \ experimental results infer that\nautomated and human-made sets of actions can\
    \ be applied and/or suggested, due to the innovative\nintegration between IoT\
    \ sensors with the drone. These smart actions help in precision agriculture,\n\
    which, in turn, intensely boost crop productivity, saving natural resources.\n\

    \ (FAO) predicts that by 2050, the world popu-\nlation will hit 9.73 billion,\
    \ and by 2100, it will be 11.2 billion; with the current population of\napproximately\
    \ 7.84 billion, this shows an increase of approximately 25% [1]. To feed this\n\
    larger population, food production should double by 2050 [2]. For example, the\
    \ current\nﬁgure of 2.1 billion tons of annual cereal production should reach\
    \ approximately 3 billion\ntons [3]. This means there is a serious need to enhance\
    \ productivity and meet the demands\nof nations [4]. However, the current agricultural\
    \ land is restricted by various factors such as\nland and climate patterns, population\
    \ density, and rapid urbanization, which are constantly\nposing threats to the\
    \ availability of arable land [5]. To illustrate, in 1991, the total arable\n\
    area for food production was 19.5 million square miles (39.47% of the world’s\
    \ land area),\nwhich was reduced to approximately 18.6 million square miles (37.73%\
    \ of the world’s land\narea) in 2013 [6]. Thus, the gap between the demand and\
    \ supply of food is becoming\nmore signiﬁcant and alarming as time progresses.\
    \ Therefore, authors in the literature [7,8]\nemphasize the signiﬁcance of enhancing\
    \ farm management by using scientiﬁc strategies\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908.\

    \ which, in turn, drastically boost crop productivity\nand help in saving natural\
    \ resources [9,10].\nIn recent years of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR),\
    \ researchers, engineers, and\nIT specialists are striving to participate in employing\
    \ advanced technology to achieve\na better life for our planet, as Figure 1 shows\
    \ [11,12]. One of those pillars of 4IR is IoT,\nwhich is considered as the fuel\
    \ of the 4IR since it contributes effectively by linking trillions\nof objects\
    \ and sensors, all of which generate real-time data. It is expected that around\n\
    100 billion devices have been connected to the internet by 2020 [13,14]. This\
    \ number will\nfurther increase since the IoT is progressively entering a wide\
    \ array of sectors and indus-\ntries, ranging from manufacturing, health, communications,\
    \ and energy to the agricultural\nindustry [15]. In an agricultural environment,\
    \ for instance, IoT technology has been uti-\nlized to deal with distributed data\
    \ collection from farming environments and, important\nfor directing farmers,\
    \ with real-time information of the farming ﬁeld [16]. On the other\nhand, integration\
    \ between IoT and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) attracts researchers’\nattention\
    \ for various reasons. UAVs’ reliability, ﬂexibility, portability, line of sight\
    \ (LoS)\nconnectivity, efﬁciency, applicability, rapid deployment, and low maintenance\
    \ cost are valid\nreasons for considering such a technology. UAVs cover a wide\
    \ range of platforms, from\ndrones to high altitude platforms (HAPs), low altitude\
    \ platforms (LAPs), or tethered plat-\nforms [17,18]. UAVs have drawn tremendous\
    \ attention, both in the industry and academia,\ndue to their advantages and wide\
    \ applications [19]. For example, telecommunications,\nmonitor disaster-relief\
    \ missions, empowering smart cities, atmospheric studies, service\ndelivery, surveillance,\
    \ high-resolution imaging, and military applications [20,21].\nSustainability\

    \ Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa)-based\nIoT platform for Smart Farming Modular\
    \ IoT Architecture called LoRaFarM that aims to im-\nprove generic farms management\

    \ in a real farm in Italy, where it collected environmental data\n(air, soil,\
    \ temperature, and humidity) related to the growth of farm products (e.g., grapes\n\
    and greenhouse vegetables) over a period of three months. A web-based visualization\
    \ tool\nfor the collected data is also presented, to validate the LoRaFarM architecture.\n\
    Authors in [27] developed a hierarchical smart farming structure based on the\
    \ collabo-\nration between UAVs and federated Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs)\
    \ for crop monitoring.\nTwo important aspects of such collaboration have been\
    \ considered: designing the UAV tra-\njectories for efﬁcient data collection and\
    \ implementing effective data processing algorithms\n(consensus and symbolic aggregate\
    \ approximation) at the network level to assess relevant\ndata transmission. Experiments\
    \ were carried out at a Romanian research institute where\nSustainability 2021,\
    \ 13, 5908\n4 of 26\ndifferent crops and methods are developed. The results demonstrate\
    \ that the collaborative\nUAV–WSN–IoT approach increases the performances in both\
    \ smart farming and ecological\nagriculture.\nA smart agriculture management system\
    \ (SAMS) was introduced in [28], which\nproposed an automated system to help farmers\
    \ to increase crop production by crashing\ninto natural resources. The system\
    \ used different sensors to collect data required for the\ngrowth of the crop,\
    \ where these data were fed into the ThingSpeak IoT cloud platform for\ndata visualization.\
    \ The real-time data were stored on Firebase Database and then used for\ncrop\
    \ prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁer.\nResearchers in [29]\
    \ presented an intelligent antifrost irrigation management system\nthat contains\
    \ a climatological station and ecological anti-disaster frost irrigation. The\n\
    solar-powered system interacts with the environmental system through a website,\
    \ allowing\nthe real-time interconnection, acquisition, and monitoring of information\
    \ through mobile\nphone systems (GSM/GPRS) and internet (TCP/IP) services. Additionally,\
    \ the proposed\nsystem uses an intelligent Fuzzy Expert System (FES) to predict\
    \ the greenhouse temperature\nand control activation of a water pump, considering\
    \ humidity, the temperature of inside\nand outside air, solar radiation, and wind\
    \ speed. The intelligent model gives a prediction\nby determining coefﬁcients\
    \ with the analysis of variance method.\nNestor et al. in [30] developed an application\
    \ for water irrigation called “Agrinex.”\nThis system is an alternative approach\
    \ in collecting and measuring physical parameters\nfrom the environment, particularly\
    \ in smart irrigation systems. Agrinex is connected to\nseveral in-ﬁeld sensors\
    \ such as a water level sensor, paddy temperature sensor, and a\nﬁeld weather\
    \ station. This work aimed to make this information accessible anywhere\nwherever\
    \ there is internet access using a mobile application, which makes Agrinex scalable\n\
    and adaptable to changes. The mesh-based network recorded a maximum transmission\n\
    distance of 11 m from sink to sensor node with a 90% success rate. Data from the\
    \ ﬁeld can\nbe accessed remotely close to real-time when short network delays\
    \ are accounted for. It\nalso gives the additional beneﬁt of equipping lands with\
    \ an automated irrigation system\nthat conserves up to 81% of water consumption.\n\
    Authors in [31] proposed a system that decides whether or not water is needed\n\
    for farms by predicting the rainfall using the Genetic Algorithm (GA) approach.\
    \ In the\nproposed system, voluminous weather and soil moisture data are stored\
    \ inside the cloud\nservers. Based on data collected by a UAV and then fed to\
    \ the GA, water spraying is\nperformed, which can be monitored using a mobile\
    \ application. Cloud servers are used for\nstoring and processing large volumes\
    \ of weather and soil moisture data. Results show that\nthe sensor-based system\
    \ is activated to check whether the GA-based system completes its\nprediction\
    \ correctly or not by sensing moisture levels from the soil. If the moisture level\n\
    of the soil crosses the predeﬁned threshold value, then plant watering is performed\
    \ by\nquadrotor UAV.\nResearchers in [32] developed a framework for monitoring\
    \ pests and diseases of crops\nbased on IoT and UAV that attempts to solve the\
    \ correlation between the occurrence of\npests/diseases and weather parameters.\
    \ The proposed framework is deployed in the\nYangtze River Zone of China, where\
    \ it uses rotary devices based on sun perception to\nobtain solar energy. Results\
    \ infer that low-altitude remote sensing and monitoring through\naerial imaging\
    \ of pests and diseases using UAV is reasonable, while more analyses of\nclimate\
    \ changes would provide some precautions in advance.\nA Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)\
    \ system is proposed in [33] to collect underground soil\nparameters in potato\
    \ crops using a UAV network. Around 2500 sensors deployed under\nand above ground\
    \ are connected to UAV using Low-Power Wireless Personal Area Network\n(LPWPAN).\
    \ Simulation results show that due to UAV altitude and path loss, the link quality\n\
    between the ground sensor and UAV is reduced. Another observation is that the\
    \ lifetime\nof sensor batteries was varied depending on the location of the sensor\
    \ under or above\nground. Using LoRa technology and proper path loss model are\
    \ recommended as future\nwork to enhance link accuracy and performance. Regarding\
    \ path loss, authors in [22–25]\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n5 of 26\ndiscussed\
    \ different types of propagation path loss from an aerial platform perspective,\n\
    where Free-Space and Air-to-Ground are typical deterministic propagation models,\
    \ while\nHata and Okumura are typical empirical ones. Results show that an appropriate\
    \ model can\nbe selected based on coverage range, adaption across different terrains,\
    \ and better Quality\nof Service (QoS).\nAuthors in [34] suggested a heterogeneous\
    \ IoT sensor node system to sense acoustic,\nrain, wind, light, temperature, and\
    \ pH levels of the cornﬁelds for smart agriculture applica-\ntions. The system\
    \ aimed to achieve productive corn harvest in large-scale ﬁelds using a\ndrone\
    \ that gathers data and sends it to a gateway. The simulation results that monitored\n\
    at the gateway using the IoT application called Grafana show that it offers maximum\n\
    efﬁciency from the soil and follows the crop development according to the weather\
    \ and soil\nconditions, in addition to reducing the workload and the risk of disease\
    \ and pest, as well\nas optimizing irrigation and obtaining better quality products\
    \ at low cost. As future work,\ncollecting a wider range of climatic data and\
    \ geographical conditions would be useful in\ndesigning a model of smart farming.\n\

    \ 2021, 13, 5908\n7 of 26\nThis paper is motivated to present a low-cost platform\
    \ for comprehensive environ-\nmental parameter monitoring using ﬂying IoT. This\
    \ integration between IoT and drone\nis also coupled with cloud computing technology,\
    \ which, in turn, helps in building sus-\ntainable smart agriculture and enhancing\
    \ crop productivity and farm management in a\ncost-effective, and timely manner.\n\
    Thus, the paper aims to implement a system that periodically collects data using\n\
    both under- and aboveground sensors on farms and sends them to the gateway; then,\n\
    using a drone with a LoRa module onboard, the obtained data are transmitted to\
    \ the cloud\nfor storage, analysis, and monitor the status of crops and farms.\
    \ The proposed platform\nis based on experimental work to fulﬁll the requirements\
    \ of automated and real-time\nmonitoring of the environmental parameters for 12\
    \ months. Thus, a clear picture can be\nobtained to make wise decisions in managing\
    \ the crop and enhancing its productivity.\nThis integrated system of multiple\
    \ technologies used in the proposed platform develops\ncomprehensive under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors, along with considering an optimized\npropagation path loss,\
    \ which is a noteworthy shift from existing works. In this context and\nto achieve\
    \ the paper’s aim, the following research objectives need to be pursued:\nO1.\n\
    Identiﬁcation of environmental parameters affecting crop productivity;\nO2.\n\
    Selection of a propagation model that is suitable for smart farming;\nO3.\nHardware\
    \ calibration of related devices for experimental work;\nO4.\nImplementation of\
    \ the proposed platform and testing ti in a real scenario;\nO5.\nAnalyzing ﬁndings\
    \ and drawing smart action plans to help in precision agriculture.\n3. Materials\
    \ and Methods\nThis section presents the architecture of the platform, which aims\
    \ to monitor using\nboth under- and aboveground sensors and a drone for smart\
    \ farming. Figure 3 shows\nthe conceptual work in a bird’s-eye view of the proposed\
    \ architecture, which consists of\nspace segment and ground segment. The space\
    \ segment comprises the drone, with its\npayloads including the camera, and LoRa\
    \ module, which is responsible for collecting data\nfrom a wireless server gateway\
    \ and then transmitting them to the cloud for storage and\nfurther analysis. The\
    \ ground segment contains three parts: (1) ground control station that\nis controlled\
    \ by the end user; (2) underground sensors gateway node that collects data\nfrom\
    \ underground sensors (soil moisture); and (3) HOBO U30 Weather Station Starter\n\
    Kit, which is an aboveground sensor that measures temperature/humidity, rain,\
    \ and solar\nradiation. Clearly, in the proposed platform architecture, the drone\
    \ acts as a focal point\nbetween ground devices including sensors, relays, and\
    \ gateways, on the one hand, and\ncloud, on the other hand, which reﬂects the\
    \ reliability and robustness of such a technology.\nThe rest of this section discusses\
    \ the proposed architecture from functions and speci-\nﬁcations in ﬁve layers,\
    \ namely, sensor nodes layer, wireless server gateway, drone-LoRa\nlayer, cloud\
    \ layer, and end-user layer.\nSustainability 2021, 13, 5908\n8 of 26\nSustainability\

    \ as presented in related works of the\nprevious section.\nHata’s equations are\

    \ is a notable shift\nfrom existing propagation models. The θ is a vital element\

    \ Implementation and Testbed\nThis section presents the proposed solution as deployed\
    \ and validated in a farmhouse\nthat covered a large set of different agricultural\
    \ activities using ﬂying IoT. The low-cost\nproposal platform was considered for\
    \ comprehensive monitoring of environmental pa-\nrameters using both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors. Field experiments were carried out\nfrom March 2020 to\
    \ March 2021 at Medenine, Tunisia; some background information about\nthis region,\
    \ such as geographic location, soil property, and climate can be referred to the\n\
    map of world climates.\nThe proposed system can be explained in ﬁve steps, as\
    \ Figure 9 shows. S-THB-M008\nrefers to temperature/humidity sensor, S-RGB-M002\
    \ refers to rain gauge sensor, S-LIB-\nM003 refers to solar radiation sensor,\
    \ and S-SMC-M005 refers to soil moisture smart sensor.\nFirst, both under- and\
    \ aboveground sensors collected relevant data from the farm every 1 h.\nSecond,\
    \ these data were stored temporarily on an embedded Secure Digital (SD) card in\n\
    the wireless server gateway. Third, the drone ﬂew and collected data from various\
    \ wireless\nserver gateways located in the farm every 12 h. Fourth, the drone\
    \ sent the data to the cloud.\nFifth, automated and human-made sets of actions\
    \ could be taken to apply smart actions\nfor precision agriculture, which, in\
    \ turn, dramatically boost crop productivity, and help\nin saving natural resources.\
    \ These actions could be obtained from the cloud into the user\ninterface smart\
    \ device. However, a decision support system could be introduced in a future\n\

    \ farming involves the integration of advanced technologies into existing farm-\n\
    ing practices to increase production efﬁciency and quality of agricultural products.\
    \ The\nevolution of IoT and UAVs has enabled the vision of sustainable smart farming,\
    \ where\nthese smart technologies have proven to increase the quality of crop\
    \ yield and reduce the\nenvironmental footprint from the agricultural sector.\
    \ This paper shows a low-cost platform\nfor comprehensive environmental parameter\
    \ monitoring using ﬂying IoT. The proposal is\nbased on experimental work to fulﬁll\
    \ the requirements of automated and real-time monitor-\ning of the environmental\
    \ parameters using both under- and aboveground sensors. These\nIoT sensors devices\
    \ on a farm collect vast amounts of environmental data, where it is sent\nto ground\
    \ gateways every 1 h, after which the obtained data are collected and transmitted\n\
    by a drone to the cloud for storage and analysis every 12 h. This platform is\
    \ deployed\nand tested in a real scenario on a farm in Medenine, Tunisia, in the\
    \ period of March 2020\nto March 2021, covering open-ﬁeld and greenhouse cultivation.\
    \ This low-cost platform\ncan help farmers, governmental, or manufacturers to\
    \ predict environmental conditions\ndata over the geographically large farm ﬁeld,\

    \ practical\nresults indicate that automated and human-made sets of actions have\
    \ been applied and/or\nsuggested that are smart actions for precision agriculture,\
    \ which, in turn, dramatically\nboost crop productivity and help in saving natural\
    \ resources. Examples of these actions are\nthe following:\n•\nFarmers are advised\
    \ to consider various strategies such as spraying chemicals on\nplants during\
    \ some seasons;\n•\nVarious plantings and quarterly grains are suggested;\n•\n\
    Estimate the amount of water needed to bring the soil to ﬁeld capacity;\n•\nFarmers\
    \ are advised to consider greenhouses to protect plants from high light intensity\n\
    during summer;\n•\nAdjust water irrigation using automated dripping and sprinkling\
    \ based on environ-\nmental parameters;\n•\nUsing solar panels for powering the\
    \ weather station leads to energy efﬁciency.\nFrom a practical point of view,\
    \ the deployed nodes, which are fed by a solar panel-\nrecharged battery, have\
    \ correctly transmitted data for 12 months, with underground and\naboveground\
    \ sensors and despite bad weather conditions. Indeed, even though some\nsamples\
    \ were lost during several rainy days, once their batteries were recharged by\
    \ solar\nlight during the following sunny days, nodes restarted to transmit properly.\n\
    PL and RSS of the Hata propagation model of the distance between the ground station\n\
    and the drone at the cloud layer show reasonable results, in which the obtained\
    \ values\nsatisfy a high level of reception with the smallest attenuated signal,\
    \ besides achieving line\nof sight wireless connectivity in an efﬁcient and timely\
    \ manner. More elaboration can be\ntaken into consideration for future work, e.g.,\
    \ to develop a machine learning algorithm\nto predict environmental conditions\
    \ and then suggest solutions and/or precautions. A\ndecision support system framework\
    \ could be introduced as part of a future project to link\nthe farm’s smart devices\
    \ together to achieve an autonomous system. Moreover, the power\nconsumption of\
    \ the drone can be optimized to enhance ﬂight time, which leads to covering\n\
    wider farm zones.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, software,\

    • SLR is conducted using PRISMA approach and148 articles are selected and critically
    analyzed. • The results show the extent of digital technologies adoption in agriculture.
    • The potential benefits of digital technologies and roadblocks hindering their
    implementation in agriculture sector are identified and discussed. • The study
    will positively impact the research around agriculture 4.0. Abstract Agriculture
    is considered one of the most important sectors that play a strategic role in
    ensuring food security. However, with the increasing world''s population, agri-food
    demands are growing — posing the need to switch from traditional agricultural
    methods to smart agriculture practices, also known as agriculture 4.0. To fully
    benefit from the potential of agriculture 4.0, it is significant to understand
    and address the problems and challenges associated with it. This study, therefore,
    aims to contribute to the development of agriculture 4.0 by investigating the
    emerging trends of digital technologies in the agricultural industry. For this
    purpose, a systematic literature review based on Protocol of Preferred Reporting
    Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses is conducted to analyse the scientific
    literature related to crop farming published in the last decade. After applying
    the protocol, 148 papers were selected and the extent of digital technologies
    adoption in agriculture was examined in the context of service type, technology
    readiness level, and farm type. The results have shown that digital technologies
    such as autonomous robotic systems, internet of things, and machine learning are
    significantly explored and open-air farms are frequently considered in research
    studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). Moreover, it is observed that most
    use cases are still in the prototypical phase. Finally, potential roadblocks to
    the digitization of the agriculture sector were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. This comprehensive review results in providing useful
    information on the current status of digital technologies in agriculture along
    with prospective future opportunities. Previous article in issue Next article

    problem Food security is a multidimensional concept that alleviates hunger by
    ensuring a sustainable, nutritious food supply. It is characterized by a four-pillar
    model shown in Fig. 1, with each pillar intrinsic to ensure food security [1].

    full-size image Fig. 2. Agriculture value chain: stages and main functions. Due
    to several anthropogenic factors, such as rapid population growth, urbanization,
    industrialization, farmland loss, freshwater scarcity, and environmental degradation,
    food security is becoming a serious global issue. This is because these factors
    are also directly impacting agricultural industry which is a primary source of
    agri-food production around the world. It is anticipated that by 2050 global population
    will be increased from the current 7.7 billion to 9.2 billion, urban population
    will be rise by 66%, arable land will be declined by approximately 50 million
    hectares, global GHG emissions (source of CO2 – promote crop disease and pest
    growth) will be increased by 50%, agri-food production will be declined by 20%,
    and eventually, food demand will be increased by 59 to 98% – posing an imminent
    threat to food security and adequate food availability [2], [3], [4]. To satisfy
    the increasing food demands, agricultural practitioners worldwide will need to
    maximise the agricultural productivity involving crop and livestock farming. In
    this review paper, the focus is on crop farming that involves cultivation of both
    food and cash crops. A typical agri-food value chain depicting three primary stages,
    namely pre-field (pre-plantation stage), in-field (plantation and harvesting stage),
    and post-field (post-harvesting stage) involved in the production of agricultural
    products is shown in Fig. 2. All the stages play a vital role in the value chain
    but, in this review, the second stage ˝in-field˝ will be considered that involves
    several crop growing processes such as plowing, sowing, spraying, and harvesting,
    etc. These processes currently employ traditional agricultural practices that
    are labor-intensive, require arable land, time, and a substantial amount of water
    (for irrigation) – making it a challenge to produce enough agri-food [5]. A part
    of problem is also related to irregular use of pesticides and herbicides and misuse
    of available technology which cause harm to crop and eventually resulting in agricultural
    wastes [6]. These issues can be addressed by integrating sophisticated technologies
    and computer-based applications that ensure high crop yield, less water consumption,
    optimised pesticide/herbicide utilization, and enhanced crop quality. This is
    where the smart agriculture concept comes in. 1.2. Smart agriculture Industry
    4.0, also known as the fourth industrial revolution, is revolutionizing, and reshaping
    every industry. It is a strategic initiative characterized by a fusion of emerging
    disruptive digital technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT), big data and
    analytics (BDA), system integration (SI), cloud computing (CC), simulation, autonomous
    robotic systems (ARS), augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), wireless
    sensor networks (WSN), cyber-physical system (CPS), digital twin (DT), and additive
    manufacturing (AM) to enable the digitization of the industry [7]. The integration
    of these technologies in agriculture is sparking the next generation industrial
    agriculture, namely, agriculture 4.0 – also termed smart agriculture, smart farming,
    or digital farming [7]. Smart agriculture provides farmers with a diverse set
    of tools (shown in Fig. 3) to address several agricultural food production challenges
    associated with farm productivity, environmental impact, food security, crop losses,
    and sustainability. For instance, with IoT-enabled systems consisting of WSNs,
    farmers can connect to farms remotely irrespective of place and time to monitor
    and control farm operations. Drones equipped with hyperspectral cameras can be
    used to collect data from heterogeneous sources on farmlands and autonomous robots
    can be used to support or accomplish repetitive tasks at farms. Data analytics
    techniques can be employed to analyze the gathered data with computer applications
    can be used to assist farmers in decision-making process. Likewise, a wide variety
    of parameters related to environmental factors, weed control, crop production
    status, water management, soil conditions, irrigation scheduling, herbicides,
    and pesticides, and controlled environment agriculture can be monitored and analyzed
    in smart agriculture to increase crop yields, minimize costs, enhance product
    quality, and maintain process inputs through the use of modern systems [8]. Download

    The concept of “Smart Agriculture”. 1.3. Research motivation and contribution
    The motivation for preparing this review stems from the fact that digital technologies
    in agricultural systems offer new strategic solutions for enhancing the efficiency
    and effectiveness of farms’ production. Moreover, digital transformation provides
    a way forward to implement modern farming practices such as vertical farming (hydroponics,
    aquaponics and aeroponics), which has the potential to overcome food security
    problems. But there is a set of problems and limitations associated with this
    transformation from the technical, socio-economic, and management standpoint that
    must be death to fully exploit the potential of agriculture 4.0 [9]. There are
    number of studies that have discussed emerging trends in the development of agriculture
    4.0 by providing succinct information on key applications, advantages, and corresponding
    research challenges of smart farming [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The research focus of these studies is limited to either explaining
    more generic technical aspects while paying attention to only one or few digital
    technologies, and/or enhancing agricultural supply chain performance, and/or developing
    agriculture 4.0 definition, and/or achieving sustainable agronomy through precision
    agriculture, and/or proposing a smart farming framework. Nevertheless, these studies
    do not involve explicit discussion on the tools and techniques used to develop
    different systems and maturity level of these systems. There is also a lack of
    studies considering modern soilless farms such as hydroponics, aquaponics and
    aeroponics (indoor/outdoor) and implications of digital technologies in these
    farms. Hence, it is necessary to analyse the evolution of agriculture 4.0 from
    different perspectives to stimulate the discussion in the area. This study aims
    to present a holistic overview of digital technologies implemented in second stage
    of agricultural production value chain (in-field) for different types of farms
    as mentioned in section 1.1. The main theoretical contribution of the study involves
    analysis and dissemination of the tools and techniques employed, the farm type,
    the maturity level of the developed systems, along with potential roadblocks or
    inhibiting factors in development of agriculture 4.0. The reflections presented
    in the review will support researchers and agricultural practitioner in future
    research on agriculture 4.0. 1.4. Paper organization Following the introduction,
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses the approach used to gather
    the relevant literature; then, Section 3 presents the statistical results obtained
    after a general analysis of the selected research studies; next, Section 4 provides
    a detailed overview of the core technologies used in the digitization of agriculture;
    after, Section 5 highlights the technical and socio-economic roadblocks to digital
    integration in agriculture; next, Section 6 outlines a discussion about the research
    questions followed by added value, considerations and future prospects related
    to agricultural digitization, and transition to agriculture 5.0; and lastly, Section
    8 concludes the review. 2. Research methodology A systematic literature review
    (SLR) is a tool used to manage the diverse knowledge and identify research related
    to a predetermined topic [19]. In this study, SLR is conducted to investigate
    the status of Industry 4.0 technologies in agricultural industry. Particularly,
    cases are searched where the term ‘agriculture’ appeared concurrently in the title,
    abstract, or keywords of an article with any of the ‘Industry 4.0 technologies”
    mentioned in section 1.2. Before conducting the SLR, a review protocol is defined
    to ensure a transparent and high-quality research process, which are the characteristics
    that make a literature review systematic [20]. The review protocol also helps
    to minimize bias by conducting exhaustive literature searches. This includes three
    steps: the formulation of the research questions, the definition of the search
    strategy, and the specification of inclusion and exclusion criteria. This paper
    uses a preferred reporting item for systematic reviews and meta-analysis (PRISMA)
    approach to conduct SLR. PRISMA is an evidence-based minimum set of items that
    are used to guide the development process of systematic literature reviews and
    other meta-analyses [19]. 2.1. Review protocol A review protocol (in Table 1)
    is defined before conducting the bibliographic analysis to identify, evaluate,
    and interpret results relevant to the research scope. First, research questions
    are formulated to provide insight into the analysis of published studies in the
    research area of interest from different dimensions. These questions need to be
    answered in the study. Next, the search strategy is defined, which helps identify
    appropriate keywords later in the search equation to identify the relevant information
    sources, such as academic databases and search engines that provide access to
    a massive amount of digital documentation. Three online research repositories
    are used to retrieve relevant studies: ScienceDirect1, Scopus2, and IEEE Xplore3.
    Finally, to refine the search results of each database, boundaries are set by
    predefining inclusion and exclusion criteria for further investigation and content
    assessments of selected publications. It involves, for instance, defining the
    time interval for the research process from 2011 to 2021 to limit the studies
    to those published in English, disregarding chapters of books and grey literature,
    such as reports and summaries of events and seminars. These last two steps of
    the review protocol allow the preliminary filtering of metadata sources and narrow
    down the scope of research. Table 1. Review protocol for systematic literature
    review. Review questions RQ1: Which Industry 4.0 technologies have been used in
    the literature for digitization of agriculture? RQ2: How and to what extent have
    these technologies been applied in the context of service type, tools and techniques

    search process is done in four stages: identification, screening, eligibility,
    and inclusion, as detailed by the PRISMA flow diagram shown in Fig. 4. After initial
    metadata filtering through the application of search expression, a total of 3165
    records are found (1690 from Scopus, 926 from ScienceDirect, and 549 from IEEE
    Xplore), which are then consolidated for the removal of duplicate items in the
    identification stage. The number of publications after this step is reduced to
    2876. In the screening stage, the titles and abstracts of the papers are analyzed,
    and only 498 papers are selected for integral reading. In the third stage, full-text
    screening of these articles is performed to verify their eligibility in relation
    to the objective of this paper, which is to answer the research questions mentioned
    in Table 1. Of the 498 papers, 137 are found to be relevant for this review. Another
    11 are added through a cross-referencing approach, adding up to 148 papers selected
    in the final stage for further analysis. Download : Download high-res image (624KB)

    search process (PRISMA). 2.3. Threats to validity i SLR replication: The presented
    SLR is susceptible to threats to validity because the current search is limited
    to only three online repositories. More publications could potentially be found
    if additional sources were explored. The process of SLR is described clearly in
    sub-sections 2.1 and 2.2, and hence, validity can be considered well addressed.
    However, in the case of replication of this SLR, it is possible that one can find
    slightly different publications. This difference would result from different personal
    choices during the screening and eligibility steps of PRISMA, but it is highly
    unlikely that the overall findings would change. ii Search string: the search
    string used to find the relevant studies cover the whole scope of SLR, but there
    is a possibility that valuable studies might have been missed. Additional keywords
    and synonyms with a broader search might return more studies. 3. Digitization
    trends in agriculture The year-wise distribution of the 148 articles from 2011
    to 2021 is represented in Fig. 5. Around 22% of the scientific publications in
    the last ten years were published in 2018. This reflects that the agricultural
    industry is making considerable progress in the context of the implementation
    of digital technologies, but the pace is still slow as compared to other domains
    such as healthcare, manufacturing, mining, automotive, energy, etc.,[15]. Download

    Year-wise distribution of selected research studies from 2011 to 2021. The breakdown
    of these publications with respect to digital technologies (mentioned in sub-section
    1.2) and targeted farm types is represented in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res
    image (321KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Technology-wise distribution
    of the 148 selected research studies. The farm type refers to the crop farming
    method considered while developing an application or framework. For instance,
    the farming method can be soil-based or soilless. The soil-based farming category
    involves open-air fields (traditional outdoor agricultural farms) and greenhouse
    farms (indoor). On the other hand, the soilless farming category involves modern
    farming practices such as aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics (mostly indoor).
    The numbers at the top of the stacked column in Fig. 6 indicate the total number
    of studies that have used the particular technology to develop a smart agriculture
    system, whereas different colors of columns indicate the respective farm types.
    Use cases are from these publications are analysed, and conclusions are drawn.
    For instance, it is found that autonomous robotics systems (including unmanned
    guided vehicles and unmanned aerial vehicles (drones)), internet of things, and
    machine learning appear to be the widely applied technologies in the agricultural
    domain in the last decade. The same illustration suggests that big data, wireless
    sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and digital twins are the emerging areas
    in agriculture. Moreover, open-air farms are the most frequently considered in
    research studies (69%), contrary to indoor farms (31%). For soilless farming systems
    (aquaponics, aeroponics, and hydroponics), only 22 publications are found, which
    insinuates that these modern farming practices are still in their infancy. Likewise,
    services of each use case are identified and are classified under nine different
    service categories, namely: i) crop management, CM (Estimation/ prediction of
    crop yield/ growth rate/ harvesting period and seed plantation/ harvesting/ pollination/
    spraying (fertilizer/ pesticide)); ii) crop quality management, CQM (fresh weight,
    green biomass, height, length, width, leaf density, piment content (chlorophyll)
    and phytochemical composition); iii) water and environment management, WEM (monitoring
    and control of flow rate, water level, water quality (nutrients), temperature,
    humidity, CO2, and weather forecast etc.); iv) irrigation management, IM (water
    stress detection and scheduling); v) farm management, FM (monitoring of farm operations,
    tracking and counting products, determining production efficiency, financial analysis,
    energy consumption analysis, technology integration and decisions implementation);
    vi) pest and disease management, PDM (pest identification and disease detection);
    vii) soil management, SM (moisture content, soil nutrients, fertilizer needs and
    application); viii) weed and unwanted vegetation management, WUVM (weed/unknown
    vegetation mapping, classification, and herbicides application); and ix) fruit
    detection and counting, FDC — as shown in Fig. 7. These categories illustrate
    the role of different digital technologies in smart farming. Upon analysis, it
    is found that crop management parameters, such as crop yield prediction, growth
    rate estimation, or evaluation of harvesting period are the most frequently researched
    areas for agriculture 4.0 in the last decade (29%), whereas very little heed is
    paid towards soil management (2%), fruit detection and counting (2%), and crop
    quality management (3%). Download : Download high-res image (561KB) Download :

    using European Union''s TRL scale that partitions system''s maturity level into
    three generic levels [21]. The first level is conceptual, that represents European
    TRL 1–2 (use case is in conceptual phase), the second level is the prototype,
    which means European TRL 3–6 (use case is working even without the complete planned
    functionality), and the third level is deployed, that includes European TRL 7–9
    (use case is mature with all the possible functions). Fig. 8 depicts the TRL of
    each use case developed in selected studies. It is observed that little progress
    has been made in advancing smart agricultural systems beyond the concept and prototype
    levels to the commercial level. For instance, most use cases (129) are at the

    provides critical insights towards answering RQ1 and RQ2 from Table 1. 4.1. Internet
    of Things driven agricultural systems Internet of things (IoT) refers to a cosmos
    of interrelated computing devices, sensors, appliances, and machines connected
    with the internet, each having unique identities and capabilities for performing
    remote sensing and monitoring [21]. The reference architecture of IoT with six
    layers, namely perception layer (hardware devices), network layer (communication),
    middleware layer (device management and interoperability), service layer (cloud
    computing), application layer (data integration and analytics), and end-user layer
    (user-interface), is shown in Fig.9. In the agricultural domain, IoT devices in
    the physical layer gather data related to environmental and crop parameters such
    as temperature, humidity, pH value, water level, leaf color, fresh leaf weight,
    etc. The transmission of this data takes place in the network layer, the design
    of which depends on the selection of suitable communication technologies relevant
    to the field size, farm location, and type of farming method. For instance, ZigBee,
    LoRa, and Sigfox are widely used and employed in outdoor fields because they are
    cheaper and have low energy consumption and a good transmission range [22,23].
    Despite being a secure technology, Bluetooth is only used in indoor farms as it
    offers a short transmission range [22]. Wi-Fi is not a promising technology for
    agricultural applications due to its high costs and high energy consumption [22].
    RFID (radio frequency identification) and NFC (near field communication) technologies,
    on the other hand, are increasingly being implemented in agricultural systems
    for tracking agricultural products [24]. GPRS or mobile communication technology
    (2G, 3G, and 4G) are used for periodic monitoring of environmental and soil parameters.
    In addition, communication protocols mostly used in the agricultural scenarios
    are HTTP, WWW, and SMTP. Likewise, to ensure interoperability and system security
    to their context-aware functionalities, middleware HYDRA and SMEPP are mostly
    employed in agricultural systems [25]. To store data, cloud computing techniques
    are employed in the service layer. This data is then used in the application layer
    to build smart applications used by farmers, agriculture experts, and supply chain
    professionals to enhance farm monitoring capacity and productivity. Download :

    architecture of Internet of Things (IoT), (adapted) [26]. The integration of IoT
    in agriculture is meant to empower farmers with the decision tools and automation
    technologies that seamlessly integrate knowledge, products, and services to achieve
    high productivity, quality, and profit. A multitude of studies is performed and
    put forward concerning the incubation of the IoT concepts in the agricultural
    sector. The main findings of some of the studies are presented in Table 2. Multiple
    technological issues and architectural problems have been addressed through the
    development of IoT-based agricultural systems. But most of these systems are either
    in a conceptual stage or in a prototype form (not commercial) at the moment. Focus
    is mainly laid on-farm management, irrigation control, crop growth, health monitoring,
    and disease detection. Some of these studies have also explained IoT implementation
    in modern agricultural systems such as vertical farming (soilless farming - aquaponics,
    hydroponics, and aeroponics) and greenhouse farming (soil-based). Moreover, most
    studies have focused on addressing a specific problem. Table 2. IoT-driven agricultural

    networks in agriculture Wireless sensor network (WSN) is regarded as a technology
    that is used within an IoT system. It can be defined as a group of spatially distributed
    sensors for monitoring the physical conditions of the environment, temporarily
    storing the collected data, and transmitting the gathered information at a central
    location [22]. The general architecture of WSN is shown in Fig. 10. A WSN for
    smart farming is made up of numerous sensor nodes connected through a wireless
    connection module. These nodes have a variety of abilities (e.g., processing,
    transmission, and sensation) that allow them to self-organize, self-configure,
    and self-diagnose. There are different types of WSNs, which are categorized depending
    on the environment where they are deployed. These include terrestrial wireless
    sensor networks (TWSNs), wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs), underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs), wireless multimedia sensor networks (WMSNs),
    and mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSNs) [55]. In agricultural applications,
    TWSN and UWSN are widely used. In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the ground
    surface, consisting of sensors for gathering the surrounding data. The second
    variant of WSNs is its underground counterpart – WUSNs, where sensor nodes are
    planted inside the soil. In this setting, lower frequencies easily penetrate through
    the soil, whereas higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation [56]. Therefore,
    the network requires a higher number of nodes to cover a large area because of
    the limited communication radius. Many research articles are available in the
    literature that discusses the use of WSN for different outdoor and indoor farms’
    applications such as irrigation management, water quality assessment, and environmental
    monitoring. A summary of some of these articles is given in Table 3. These studies
    have focused on developing WSNs architectures that are simplified, low cost, energy-efficient
    and scalable. Yet, various factors associated with WSNs need further attention,
    such as minimum maintenance, robust and fault-tolerant architecture, and interoperability.

    Standard and Technologies (NIST), cloud computing (CC) is defined as a model for
    enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of
    configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications,
    and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management
    effort or service provider interaction [67]. The main architecture of CC shown
    in Fig. 11 is comprised of four layers: datacenter (hardware), infrastructure,
    platform, and application [68]. Each of these layers is linked with specific cloud
    service models, which are classified as software as a service (SaaS), platform
    as a service (PaaS), and infrastructure as a service (IaaS). Cloud computing has
    gained great attention over the past decade in the agriculture sector because
    it provides: 1) inexpensive storage services for data gathered from different
    domains through WSNs and other preconfigured IoT devices, 2) large-scale computing
    systems to perform intelligent decision-making by transforming this raw data into
    useful knowledge, and 3) a secure platform to develop agricultural IoT applications
    [69]. In combination with IoT and WSN, CC is employed to develop different agricultural
    applications, most of which are presented in Tables 2 and 3. CC technology is
    also used to create operational farm management systems (FMSs) to support farmers
    and farm managers in efficient monitoring of farm operations Table 4. presents
    the salient features of some of these FMSs. Another topic of interest that is
    being explored in global research is related to the traceability of agri-product
    quality [70]. But only preliminary research has been attempted to explore traceability
    compliance with standards of food safety and quality. Download : Download high-res

    systems have the potential to solve problems of increasing food demands, environmental
    pollution caused by excessive use of pesticides and fertilizers, and the safety
    of agricultural products. These FMSs, however, do not have the capability to support
    run-time customization in relation to distinct requirements of farmers. Moreover,
    because most farm data is usually fragmented and dispersed, it is difficult to
    record farm activities properly in current FMSs applications [75]. 4.4. Edge/fog
    computing in agriculture The rapid development of IoT has led to the explosive
    growth of sensors and smart devices, generating large volumes of data. The processing
    and analysis of such an enormous amount of data in real-time are challenging because
    it increases the load on the cloud server and also reduces the response speed.
    Simply using a cloud server is not able to provide real-time response while handling
    such a large data set. Additionally, IoT applications are sensitive to network
    latency because they require a constant exchange of information between devices
    and the cloud, making CC unfeasible to handle these applications [23]. The emergence
    of the edge computing concept can resolve the problems associated with CC. This
    new computing model deploys computing and storage resources (such as cloudlets
    or fog nodes) at the edge of the network closer to data sources such as mobile
    devices or sensors. This way, it can facilitate real-time analytics while keeping
    data secure on the device [23]. Edge computing offers intriguing possibilities
    for smart agriculture, but the applications of this technology are only in their
    infancy in agricultural systems. Hence, few research studies are available in
    this area; see Table 5. Most of the edge computing-based agricultural systems
    discussed in these studies are prototypical and address a limited selection of
    problems in various agricultural domains. So far, interoperability and scalability
    issues have not received sufficient consideration. Table 5. Edge computing-based

    robot systems in agriculture Autonomous robot systems (ARS) are intelligent machines
    capable of performing tasks, making decisions, and acting in real-time, with a
    high degree of autonomy (without external influence or without explicit human
    intervention) [83]. Interest in agricultural ARS (AARS) has grown significantly
    in recent years because of their ability to automate some practices in outdoor
    and indoor farms - including seeding, watering, fertilizing, spraying, plant monitoring
    and phenotyping, environmental monitoring, disease detection, weed and pest controlling,
    and harvesting [15]. The agricultural robots use a combination of emerging technologies
    such as computer vision, WSNs, satellite navigation systems (GPS), AI, CC, and
    IoT, thereby facilitating the farmers to enhance productivity and quality of agricultural
    products. AARS in smart farming can be mobile AARS, which can move throughout
    the working field, or fixed AARS [84]. Mobile AARSs are further classified into
    unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) and 2) unnamed aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are
    explained in the following sections. 4.5.1. Unmanned ground vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) are agricultural robots that operate on the ground
    without a human operator. The main components of UGVs generally include; a platform
    for locomotive apparatus and manipulator, sensors for navigation, a supervisory
    control system, an interface for the control system, the communication links for
    information exchange between devices, and a system architecture for integration
    between hardware and software agents [85]. The control architecture of UGV can
    be remote-operated (controlled by a human operator via the interface) or fully
    autonomous (operated without the need for a human controller based on artificial
    intelligence technologies) [85]. Likewise, locomotive systems can be based on
    wheels, tracks, or legs [85]. Despite high ground adaptability, intrinsic omnidirectionality
    and soil protection of legged robots, they are uncommon in agriculture. However,
    when combined with wheels (wheel-legged robots), these robots offer a disruptive
    locomotion system for smart farms. In addition to their needed characteristics
    for infield operations, UGV should fulfill certain requirements such as small
    size, maneuverability, resilience, efficiency, human-friendly interface, and safety
    – to enhance crop yields and farm productivity. Table 6 summarizes the diverse
    range of UGVs designed for agricultural operations. Table 6. Different types of

    above have a 4WD locomotive system because it offers ease of construction and
    control. The drawback of 4WD is that the wheels are strongly affected by terrains
    containing stone elements and/or cavities [85]. Hence, it is significant to explore
    other mechanisms, such as legged or wheel-legged locomotive systems. Some robots
    have computer vision systems, but due to the difficulty of developing an accurate
    and reliable system that replaces manual labor, most of these robots are built
    with a low-cost computer vision system, that is, using conventional RGB cameras.
    Moreover, most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase,
    with no commercial use on a large scale. 4.5.2. Unmanned aerial vehicles in agriculture
    Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or aerial robots are aircrafts with no human pilot
    on board. Depending on the type of technology incorporated to fly (wing structure)
    and autonomy level, there is a wide variety of UAVs [96]. For instance, according
    to wing type, UAVs can be fixed-wing (planes), single-rotor (helicopter), hybrid
    system (vertical takeoff and landing), and multirotor (drone). Among these, drones
    (multi-rotor technology) which are lifted and propelled by four (quadrotor) or
    six (hex-rotor) rotors, have become increasingly popular in the agriculture sector
    due to their mechanical simplicity in comparison to helicopters, which rely on
    a much more sophisticated plate control mechanism [97]. Similarly, according to
    autonomy level, UAVs can be either teleoperated in which the pilot provides references
    to each actuator of the aircraft so as to control it, in the same manner, an onboard
    pilot would, or tele-commanded in which the aircraft relies on an automatic controller
    on board that is in charge of maintaining a stable flight [96]. Equipped with
    the appropriate sensors (vision, infrared, multispectral, and hyperspectral cameras,
    etc.), agricultural UAVs allow farmers to obtain data (vegetation, leaf area,
    and reflectance indexes) from their fields to study dynamic changes in crops that
    cannot be detected by scouting the ground [98]. This data permits farmers to infer
    information related to crop diseases, nutrient deficiencies, water level, and
    other crop growth parameters. With this information, farmers can plan possible
    remedies (irrigation, fertilization, weed control, etc.). Table 7 reviews some
    of the UAV-based systems used for different agricultural operations. Table 7.

    Most of the systems mentioned above are still in the research phase, with no commercial
    use on a large scale. Other problems with these UAVs are associated with battery
    and flight time [96]. At the moment, lithium-ion batteries are being used because
    their capacity is larger than that of conventional batteries. But an increase
    in battery capacity increases the drone weight, and now research is undergoing
    to address this issue. In addition, the existing UAVs have complex user interfaces,
    and only experts can use them to perform agricultural tasks. By improving the
    user interface making it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow people
    who are older or unfamiliar with UAV technology to control it more easily. 4.6.
    Big data and analytics in agriculture Rapid developments in IoT and CC technologies
    have increased the magnitude of data immeasurably. This data, also referred to
    as Big Data (BD), includes textual content (i.e., structured, semi-structured,
    and unstructured), and multimedia content (e.g., videos, images, audio) [119].
    The process of examining this data to uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations,
    market trends, customer preferences, and other useful information is referred
    to as big data analytics (BDA). Big data is typically characterized according
    to five dimensions defined by five Vs, which are displayed in Fig. 12 [120]. The
    paradigm of BD-driven smart agriculture is comparatively new, but the trend of
    this application is positive as it has the capacity to bring a revolutionary change
    in the food supply chain and food security through increased production. Agricultural
    big data is usually generated from various sectors and stages in agriculture,
    which can be collected either from agricultural fields through ground sensors,
    aerial vehicles, and ground vehicles using special cameras and sensors; from governmental
    bodies in the form of reports and regulations; from private organizations through
    online web services; from farmers in the form of knowledge through surveys; or
    from social media [120]. The data can be environmental (weather, climate, moisture
    level, etc.), biological (plant disease), or geo-spatial depending on the agricultural
    domain and differs in volume, velocity, and formats [121]. The gathered data is
    stored in a computer database and processed by computer algorithms for analyzing
    seed characteristics, weather patterns, soil properties (like pH or nutrient content),
    marketing and trade management, consumers’ behavior, and inventory management.
    A variety of techniques and tools are employed to analyze big data in agriculture.
    A summary of some of the studies is given in Table 8. Machine learning, cloud-based
    platforms, and modeling and simulation are the most commonly used techniques.
    Particularly, machine learning tools are used in prediction, clustering, and classification
    problems. Whereas cloud platforms are used for large-scale data storing, preprocessing,
    and visualization. There are still many potential areas that are not adequately
    covered in existing literature, where BDA can be applied to address various agricultural
    issues. For instance, these include data-intensive greenhouses and indoor vertical
    farming systems, quality control and health monitoring of crops in outdoor and
    indoor farms, genetic engineering, decision support platforms to assist farmers
    in the design of indoor vertical farms, and scientific models for policymakers
    to assist them in decision-making regarding the sustainability of the physical
    ecosystem. Lastly, most systems are still in the prototypical stage. Download

    [125] 4.7. Artificial intelligence in agriculture Artificial intelligence (AI)
    involves the development of theory and computer systems capable of performing
    tasks requiring human intelligence, such as sensorial perception and decision-making
    [126]. Combined with CC, IoT, and big data, AI, particularly in the facet of machine
    learning (ML) and deep learning (DL), is regarded as one of the key drivers behind
    the digitization of agriculture. These technologies have the potential to enhance
    crop production and improve real-time monitoring, harvesting, processing, and
    marketing [127]. Several intelligent agricultural systems are developed that use
    ML and DL algorithms to determine various parameters like weed detection, yield
    prediction, or disease identification. These systems are discussed in the next
    two sub-sections. 4.7.1. Machine learning in agriculture Machine learning (ML)
    techniques are broadly classified into three categories: 1) supervised learning
    (linear regression, regression trees, non-linear regression, Bayesian linear regression,
    polynomial regression, and support vector regression), 2) unsupervised learning
    (k-means clustering, hierarchal clustering, anomaly detection, neural networks
    (NN), principal component analysis, independent component analysis, a-priori algorithm
    and singular value decomposition (SVD)); and 3) reinforcement learning (Markov
    decision process (MDP) and Q learning) [128]. ML techniques and algorithms are
    implemented in the agriculture sector for crop yield prediction, disease, and
    weed detection, weather prediction (rainfall), soil properties estimation (type,
    moisture content, pH, temperature, etc.), water management, determination of the
    optimal amount of fertilizer, and livestock production and management [129] Table
    9. presents a list of publications where different ML algorithms are utilized
    for various agricultural applications. From the analysis of these articles, “crop
    yield prediction” is a widely explored area, and linear regression, neural network
    (NN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) is the most used ML
    techniques to enable smart farming. The presented use cases are still in the research
    phase with no reported commercial usage at the moment. Moreover, it is also found
    that AI and ML techniques are sparsely explored in the greenhouse and indoor vertical
    farming systems, particularly hydroponics, aquaponics, and aeroponics. There are
    only a few publications available summarized in the same table where ML techniques
    are employed. Considering the digital transformation''s cyber-security and data
    privacy challenges, new approaches such as federated learning and privacy-preserving
    methods are being developed to enable digital farming [130]. These approaches
    build ML models from local parameters without sharing private data samples, thus
    mitigating security issues. Table 9. Machine learning-based agricultural systems.

    Prototype [148] 4.7.2. Deep learning in agriculture Deep learning (DL) represents
    the extension of classical ML that can solve complex problems (predictions and
    classification) particularly well and fast because more “depth” (complexity) is
    added into the model. The primary advantage of DL is feature learning which involves
    automatic extraction of features (high-level information) from large datasets
    [149]. Different DL algorithms are convolutional neural networks (CNNs), long
    short term memory (LSTM) networks, recurrent neural (RNN) networks, generative
    adversarial networks (GANs), radial basis function networks (RBFNs), multilayer
    perceptron (MLPs), feedforward artificial neural network (ANN), self-organizing
    maps (SOMs), deep belief networks (DBNs), restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs),
    and autoencoders. A detailed description of these algorithms, popular architectures,
    and training platforms is available at various sources [150]. Fig. 13 illustrates
    an example of DL architecture of CNN [151]. In the agriculture sector, DL algorithms
    are mostly used to solve problems associated with computer vision applications
    that target the prediction of key parameters, such as crop yields, soil moisture
    content, weather conditions, and crop growth conditions; the detection of diseases,
    pests, and weed; and the identification of leaf or plant species [152]. Computer
    vision is an interdisciplinary field that has been gaining huge amounts of traction
    in recent years due to the surge in CNNs. It offers methods and techniques that
    allow the processing of digital images accurately and enables computers to interpret
    and understand the visual world [153]. A summary of agricultural applications
    using DL and computer vision techniques is given in Table 10. Among all the DL
    algorithms, CNNs or Convet and its variants are the most used algorithms in agricultural
    applications. The variants of CNN are region-based CNNs (RCNN), Fast-RCNN, Faster-RCNN,
    YOLO, and Mask-RCNN, among which the first four are mostly used to solve object
    detection problems. Mask-RCNN, on the other hand, is used to solve instance segmentation
    problems. The reader could refer to the existing bibliography for a detailed description
    of these algorithms and their applications [152]. Few studies have also used other
    DL techniques. Talking about datasets, most DL models are trained using images,
    and few models are trained using sensor data gathered from fields. This shows
    that DL can be applied to a wide variety of datasets. It is also observed that
    most of the work is done on outdoor farms, whereas next-generation farms (environment-controlled)
    are not extensively explored. Though DL has the potential to enable digital farming,
    most systems are still in the prototype phase. Additionally, the new challenges
    imposed by cyber-security and privacy issues require optimization of current DL
    and computer vision approaches. Download : Download high-res image (334KB) Download

    decision support systems A decision support system (DSS) can be defined as a smart
    system that supports decision-making to specific demands and problems by providing
    operational answers to stakeholders and potential users based on useful information
    extracted from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or models [170]. DSS
    can be data-driven, model-driven, communication-driven, document-driven, and knowledge-driven.
    The salient features of these DSSs are available at following source [171]. Fig.
    14 presents the general architecture of a DSS, consisting of four fundamental
    components, each having its specific purpose. Download : Download high-res image

    (adapted) [187]. Due to the evolution of agriculture 4.0, the amount of farming
    data has increased immensely. To transfer this heterogenous data into practical
    knowledge, platforms like agricultural decision support systems (ADSS) are required
    to make evidence-based and precise decisions regarding farm operation and facility
    layout [172]. Over the past few years, ADSSs are gaining much attention in the
    agriculture sector. A number of ADSSs have been developed that focus on a variety
    of agricultural aspects, such as farm management, water management, and environmental
    management. Table 11 presents a summary of the ADSSs found in the literature.
    From this analysis, most ADSSs have been found to not consider expert knowledge,
    which is highly valuable as it allows to development of systems as per user''s
    needs. The other reported issues with some of these ADDSs are complex GUIs, inadequate
    re-planning components, a lack of prediction and forecast abilities, and a lack
    of ability to adapt to uncertain and dynamic factors. It is also worth noting
    that all the ADSSs are for outdoor agricultural systems and are in the research
    phase. In comparison, the application of ADSS in indoor soilless farming is still
    very much unexploited. Table 11. Agricultural decision support systems. Use case

    As one of the main technologies of Industry 4.0, a cyber-physical system (CPS)
    refers to an automated distributed system that integrates physical processes with
    communication networks and computing infrastructures [184]. There are three standard
    CPS reference architecture models: namely, 5C, RAMI 4.0, and IIRA, and their detailed
    description is available at following source [185]. Among these, the 5C is a well-known
    reference model with widespread usage. The architecture of 5C consists of five
    levels which are represented in Fig. 15. CPS benefits from a variety of existing
    technologies such as agent systems, IoT, CC, augmented reality, big data, and
    ML [186]. Its implementation ensures scalability, adaptability, autonomy, reliability,
    resilience, safety, and security improvements. Download : Download high-res image
    (461KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 16. Schematic of a digital twinning
    process, (adapted) [199]. Agricultural field is regarded as one of the complex
    domains that can benefit from CPS technology. Agricultural cyber-physical systems
    (ACPSs) use advanced electronic technologies and agricultural facilities to build
    integrated farm management systems that interact with the physical environment
    to maintain an optimal growth environment for crops [188]. ACPSs collect the essential
    and appropriate data about climate, soil, and crops, with high accuracy and use
    it to manage watering, humidity, and plant health, etc. A variety of ACPSs has
    been developed for the management of different services, and their summary is
    given in Table 12. Looking at these ACPSs, most systems are still at the prototype
    and conceptual level. Moreover, most studies are conducted for outdoor farms,
    with only a few works published related to soil-based greenhouse systems. No study
    is found that is relevant to indoor soilless farming systems. ACPSs has attracted
    significant research interest because of their promising applications across different
    domains; deploying CPS models in real-life applications is still a challenge as
    it requires proper hardware and software [189]. Moreover, particular attention
    should be given to autonomy, robustness, and resilience while engineering ACPSs
    in order to handle the unpredictability of the environment and the uncertainty
    of the characteristics of agricultural facilities. There are multiple factors
    (humans, sensors, robots, crops, and data, among others) that impact ACPSs. To
    ensure a smooth operation while avoiding conflicts, errors, and disruptions, ACPSs
    need to be designed carefully and comprehensively. Table 12. Agricultural cyber-physical

    in agriculture Digital twin (DT) is a dynamic virtual replica of a real-life (physical)
    object of which it mirrors its behaviors and states over multiple stages of object''s
    lifecycle by using real-world data, simulation, and machine learning models, combined
    with data analytics to enable understanding, learning, and reasoning [198]. A
    complete description of the DT concept for any physical system requires consolidation
    and formalization of various characteristics, including the physical and virtual
    entities, the physical and virtual environments, the metrology, and realization
    modules that perform the physical to virtual and the virtual to physical connection
    or twinning, the twinning and twinning rate, and the physical and virtual processes
    [199]. The schematic showing the mapping of these characteristics is shown in
    Fig. 16. The DT concept has gained prominence due to the advances in the technologies
    such as the Internet of Things, big data, wireless sensor networks, and cloud
    computing. This is because these technologies allow real-time monitoring of physical
    twins at high spatial resolutions through both miniature devices and remote sensing
    that produce ever-increasing data streams [21]. The concept of DT in agricultural
    applications is rather immature as compared to other disciplines with its first
    references occurred in 2017; hence its added value has not yet been discussed
    extensively [21]. This is because framing is a highly complex and dynamic domain
    because of its dependence on natural conditions (climate, soil, humidity) and
    presence of living physical twins (plants and animals) and non-living physical
    twins (indoor farm buildings, grow beds, outdoor agricultural fields, agricultural
    machinery). The non-living physical twins interact directly or indirectly with
    plants and animals (living physical twins), thereby introducing more challenges
    for DT in agriculture. Whereas in other domains such as manufacturing DTs are
    mostly concerned with non-living physical twins. Table 13 summarises the agricultural
    DTs developed in the last 10 years. Table 13. Digital twins in agriculture Use

    have focused on open-air farming systems. Only one study is found that has proposed
    DT for soil-based vertical farming system and one study that implemented DT for
    soilless farming system (aquaponics). This might be because the design and management
    of modern farming systems are challenging. Moreover, most DTs are in the research
    phase with no commercial deployment at the moment. The reported benefits of the
    DT applications in agriculture are cost reductions, catastrophe prevention, clearer
    decision making, and efficient management operations, which can be applied to
    several agricultural subfields like plant and animal breeding, aquaponics, vertical
    farming, cropping systems, and livestock farming. While DT technology has great
    potential, achieving the synchronization between the physical entity and its digital
    counterpart is challenging. The complexity of this process is further amplified
    in agricultural systems due to the idiosyncrasies of living physical twins. Hence,
    implementation of agricultural DT should start with micro-farms, which can then
    be gradually enhanced to an intelligent and autonomous version by incorporating
    more components. 4.11. Roadblocks in digitization of agriculture industry This
    section provides an answer to RQ3 by listing a series of interconnected roadblocks
    hampering a larger adoption of digital technologies in the agriculture sector.
    After analysing 148 articles, 21 roadblocks are identified which can be categorized
    at technical and socio-economic levels. 4.12. Technical roadblocks • Interoperability:
    data is considered a cornerstone for the success of smart systems. Agricultural
    data usually comes from multiple heterogeneous sources such as thousands of individual
    farmlands, animal factories, and enterprise applications. This data can have diverse
    formats, making data integration complex. Hence, data interoperability is essential
    to enhance the value of this massively dispersed data after systematic data collection,
    storage, processing, and knowledge mining [208]. Likewise, for establishing effective
    communication between heterogeneous devices, they need to be interconnected and
    interoperable. With cross-technology communication, interoperability of the system
    can be improved [209]. • Standardization: to fully exploit the digital technologies
    for smart farming applications, standardization of the devices is essential. Output
    differences can occur because of misinterpretation and alterations from time to
    time. With standardization, the interoperability issues of the devices, applications,
    and systems can also be resolved [25]. • Dataquality: to produce meaningful results,
    data quality is also crucial along with data security, storage, and openness.
    The lack of decentralized data management systems is another roadblock hindering
    the adoption of smart farming practices [9]. This issue decreases the willingness
    of multiple actors to share agriculture data. • Hardwareimplementation: the deployment
    of a smart agricultural setup in large-scale open fields is extremely challenging.
    This is because all the hardware consisting of IoT devices, wireless sensor networks,
    sensor nodes, machinery, and equipment directly exposed to harsh environmental
    conditions such as heavy rainfall, high/low-temperature levels, extreme humidity,
    strong wind speeds and many other possible dangers which can destroy electronic
    circuits or disrupt their normal functionality [210]. A possible solution is to
    build an adequate casing for all the costly devices that is robust and durable
    enough to endure real field conditions [211]. • Adequatepower sources: typically,
    the wireless devices deployed at farms consistently operate for a long time and
    have limited battery life. A suitable energy saving scheme is necessary because,
    in case of any failure, instant battery replacement is complicated, especially
    in open-air farms where devices are strategically placed with minimum access [210].
    The possible solutions to optimize energy consumption are usage of low power sensors
    and, proper management of communication [24,212]. Wireless power transfer and
    self-supporting wireless system are other promising solutions to eliminate the
    need for battery replacement by recharging the batteries through electromagnetic
    waves. However, long-distance wireless charging is needed in most agricultural
    applications [9]. Ambient energy harvesting from rivers, fluid flow, movement
    of vehicles and, ground surface using sensor nodes offers another viable solution,
    but the converted electrical energy is limited at present – posing the need to
    improve power conversion efficiency [213]. • Reliability: The reliability of devices,
    as well as corresponding software applications, is crucial. This is because IoT
    devices need to gather and transfer the data based on which decisions are made
    using several software packages. Unreliable sensing, processing, and transmission
    can cause false monitoring data reports, long delays, and even data loss – eventually
    impacting the performance of agricultural system [25]. • Adaptability: agricultural
    environments are complex, dynamic, and rapidly changing. Hence, when designing
    a system, it is pertinent for the devices and applications to proactively adapt
    with the other entities under uncertain and dynamic factors - offering the needed
    performance [214]. • Robust wirelessarchitectures: wireless networks and communication
    technologies offer several benefits in terms of low cost, wide-area coverage,
    adequate networking flexibility, and high scalability. But dynamic agriculture
    environments such as temperature variations, living objects’ movements, and the
    presence of obstacles pose severe challenges to reliable wireless communication.
    For instance, fluctuations in the signal intensity occur due to the multipath
    propagation effects – causing unstable connectivity and inadequate data transmission
    [215]. These factors impact the performance of the agricultural system. Hence,
    there is a need for robust and fault-tolerant wireless architectures with appropriate
    location of sensor nodes, antenna height, network topology, and communication
    protocols that also require minimum maintenance [11]. • Interference: another
    challenge is wireless interference and degradation of the quality of service because
    of the dense deployment of IoT devices and wireless sensor networks. These issues
    can be mitigated with efficient channel scheduling between heterogeneous sensing
    devices, cognitive radio-assisted WSNs, and emerging networking primitives such
    as concurrent transmission [216]. Since agriculture devices are distributed at
    indoor greenhouses, outdoor farmlands, underground areas, or even water areas,
    cross-media communication between underground, underwater, and air is also required
    for the complete incorporation of smart technologies [217]. • Security and privacy:
    the distributed nature of smart agricultural systems brings potential vulnerabilities
    to cyber-attacks such as eavesdropping, data integrity, denial-of-service attacks,
    or other types of disruptions that may risk privacy, integrity, and availability
    of the system [218]. Cyber-security is a major challenge that needs to be addressed
    within the context of smart farming, with diverse privacy-preserving mechanisms
    and federated learning approaches [130]. • Compatibility: to achieve the standards
    of fragmentation and scalability, the models or software applications developed
    should be flexible and run on any machine installed in the agricultural system
    [13]. • Resource optimization: farmers require a resource optimization process
    to estimate the optimal number of IoT devices and gateways, cloud storage size,
    and amount of transmitted data to improve farm profitability. Since farms have
    different sizes and need distinct types of sensors to measure different variables,
    resource optimization is challenging [219]. Secondly, most of the farm management
    systems do not offer run-time customization in relation to the distinct requirements
    of farmers. Hence, complex mathematical models and algorithms are required to
    estimate adequate resource allocation [75]. • Scalability: the number of devices,
    machinery, and sensors installed at farms is increasing gradually due to advancements
    in technologies. To support these entities, gateways, network applications, and
    back-end databases should be reliable and scalable [220]. • Human-centereduserinterfaces:
    complex user interfaces of existing agricultural applications and devices are
    impeding smart farming practices. Most GUI is designed in a way that only experts
    can use to perform agricultural tasks. Improving the user interface by making
    it human-centered with multimodal feedback will allow a larger group of people
    to use it to perform different agricultural operations [96]. 4.13. Socio-economic
    roadblocks • Gap between farmers and researchers: the participation of farmers
    is a key factor toward the success of the digitization of the agricultural industry.
    Farmers face a lot of problems during the agri-food production process, which
    smart technologies could fix, but agricultural experts are not usually aware of
    these issues [16]. Moreover, to devise an adequate smart solution, first, it is
    important to fully understand the nature of problems. Hence, it is essential to
    bridge the gap between farmers, agricultural professionals, and AI researchers.
    • Costs associated with smart systems: the costs associated with the adoption
    of smart technologies and systems are the major deterrent in the digitization
    of the agricultural sector. These costs usually involve deployment, operating,
    and maintenance costs. The deployment costs of smart systems are usually very
    high as they involve; i) hardware installation such as autonomous robots and drones,
    WSNs, gateways, and base station infrastructure, etc., to perform certain farm
    operations, and ii) hiring the skilled labour [221]. Likewise, to facilitate data
    processing, management of IoT devices and equipment, and knowledge exchange, subscription
    of centralized networks and software packages is required, which ultimately increases
    the operating costs [222]. Though sometimes service providers offer free subscription
    packages with restricted features, the amount of storage capacity is limited.
    To ensure the adequate operations of the smart system, occasional maintenance
    is required, which then also adds up to total costs. Other types of costs associated
    with smart systems deployment could be environmental, ethical, and social costs.
    To overcome cost related roadblocks, initiatives focusing on cooperative farming
    are needed that provide; i) support services for better handling of costs and
    needed investments, and ii) hardware solutions to transform conventional equipment
    into smart farm-ready machinery to reduce high initial costs [222]. • Digital
    division: another factor that is slowing the digitization of the agricultural
    sector is the lack of knowledge of digital technologies and their applications.
    The majority of farmers have no idea about the significance of digital technologies,
    how to implement and use them, and which technology is suitable for their farm
    and meets their requirements [14]. Hence, it is essential to educate farmers about
    modern farming technologies and systems. Moreover, different strategies are needed
    to build tools using natural language that farmers with low education levels can
    easily understand [223]. • Return on investment: in agriculture, the profit margin
    is very important like other sectors. When it comes to the implementation of advanced
    technologies, farmers have concerns related to the time to recover the investment
    and to the difficulties in evaluating the advantages [12]. • Trust building: unlike
    in other disciplines, building trust regarding the effectiveness of smart technologies
    in agriculture is difficult because many decisions affect systems that involve
    living and non-living entities, and consequences can be hard to reverse [16].
    Additionally, insufficient proof of the impact of digital tools on-farm productivity
    further intensifies the current challenges. • Laws and regulations: different
    regions and countries have different legal frameworks which impact the implementation
    of digital technologies in the agriculture sector, particularly in monitoring
    and agri-food supply [70]. Likewise, regulations related to resource allocation
    (spectrum for wireless devices), data privacy, and security also vary from one
    country to another [70]. • Connectivity infrastructure: most less-developed countries
    usually have insufficient connectivity infrastructure that limits access to advanced
    digital tools that would help to turn data from heterogenous sources into valuable
    and actionable insights [10]. 4.14. Discussion This section discusses the main
    conclusions of RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3. In addition, added value, considerations, and
    future directions are also presented to ensure higher accuracy and great advancements
    in agricultural industry. 4.15. RQ1, RQ2 and RQ3 The present study tried to articulate
    the emerging digital technologies being implemented in agricultural industry to
    anticipate the future trajectories of agriculture 4.0. By looking at Table 2,
    Table 3, Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9, Table 10, Table
    11, Table 12, Table 13 in section 4, it can be seen some technologies such as
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins are not significantly explored in agriculture. A reason for this
    gap could be that implementing advanced technologies with more complex operations
    can be expensive, at least in the early experimental phase of their adoption.
    Hence, the development of these technologies in agricultural industry should increase
    in the coming years. The results of SLR also show that IoT is significantly implemented
    in farms. This is due to the broad functionality of IoT such as in the monitoring,
    tracking and tracing, agriculture machinery, and precision agriculture [21]. It
    can be said that IoT is one of the main research objectives within the agriculture
    4.0 approaches. Nevertheless, only few studies have considered data security and
    reliability, scalability, and interoperability while developing an intelligent
    agricultural system. The research findings also demonstrated that most use cases
    are still in the prototype phase. The possible reason could be because most agricultural
    operations have to do with living subjects, like animals and plants or perishable
    products, and developing systems is harder than non-living human-made systems.
    Another reason might be that agriculture is a slow adopter of technology because
    of transdisciplinary nature of this field, and hence to develop intelligent systems,
    the agricultural community must become familiar will all the digital technologies.
    Lastly, variations in plant/crops’ species, and growth conditions also make digitization
    of agricultural systems complex [188]. The SLR findings also show that most of
    the systems are developed for open-air soil-based farms contrary to indoor farms
    (soilless and soil-based). This is due to complex design and management of indoor
    farms particularly soilless farms where parameters and factors (pH, air temperature,
    humidity, etc.) to be controlled are diverse [5]. But with introduction of digital
    technologies and data-driven computer applications in indoor farms, a more robust
    control of the process can be achieved. Furthermore, it is also revealed from
    SLR that limited research is conducted in three (soil management, fruit detection
    and counting and crop quality management) out of nine different service categories
    mentioned in section 3. This corroborates that substantial research and development
    is needed in some areas to ensure successful digitization of agriculture industry
    in developed countries as well as in developing countries. The complexity of agriculture
    ecosystem presents a series of interconnected roadblocks that hinder the full
    integration of digital technologies for agriculture 4.0 realization. Hence, it
    is essential to identify potential roadblocks in order to come up with strategic
    solutions to overcome them. This study is an attempt to explore what these roadblocks
    are. Based on analysis, 21 roadblocks were identified and classified at technical
    and socio-economic levels. These roadblocks are listed in section 5, which suggests
    what needs to be done for digitization of agricultural industry on larger scale.
    But it is still not known, to what extent elimination or mitigation of these roadblocks
    assist in successful integration of digital technologies. 4.16. Added value of
    agricultural digitization Based on analysis, several benefits that can motivate
    framers and other actors to support digitization of agricultural industry are
    identified and summarised below. The presented benefits have potential to maximise
    the farm''s productivity and enhance product quality, but they should not be considered
    a panacea for challenges associated with smart agriculture [222]. • Improved agility:
    digital technologies improve the agility of farm operations. Through real-time
    surveillance and forecast systems, farmers or agricultural experts can rapidly
    react to any potential fluctuations in environmental and water conditions to save
    crops [221]. • Green process: digital technologies make the farming process more
    environmentally friendly and climate-resilient by significantly reducing the usage
    of in-field fuel, nitrogen fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides [224]. • Resource
    use efficiency: digital platforms can improve resource use efficiency by enhancing
    the quantity and quality of agricultural output and limiting the usage of water,
    energy, fertilizers, and pesticides [3]. • Time and cost savings: digital technologies
    enable significant time and cost savings by automating different operations, such
    as harvesting, sowing, or irrigation, controlling the application of fertilizers
    or pesticides, and scheduling the irrigation [225]. • Asset management: digital
    technologies allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment to
    prevent theft, expedite component replacement and perform routine maintenance
    [10]. • Product safety: digital technologies ensure adequate farm productivity
    and guarantee a safe and nutritious supply of agri-food products by preventing
    fraud related to adulteration, counterfeit, and artificial enhancement [218].
    4.17. Considerations and future prospects The upcoming initiatives would result
    in significant improvements in the agricultural sector. But in order to make things
    sustainable for small and medium-scale growers, roadblocks mentioned in section
    5 need to be addressed first. Awareness campaigns highlighting the significance
    of smart agriculture at every level of the agricultural value chain and promoting
    innovative ways (such as gamification) to encourage stakeholders to take on an
    active role in the digital revolution can mitigate some of the mentioned roadblocks
    [9]. Government level initiatives, grants and endowments, public-private partnerships,
    the openness of data, and regional basis research work can also assist in coping
    with potential roadblocks. Lastly, a roadmap can be adopted while developing a
    smart agriculture system, starting from basic architecture with few components
    and simpler functionality, gradually adding components and functionality to develop
    a complex system with the full potential of digitization [21]. These considerations
    can pave the way for successful implementation of agriculture 4.0. The future
    prospects of digital technologies in smart agriculture involve using explainable
    artificial intelligence to monitor crop growth, estimate crop biomass, evaluate
    crop health, and control pests and diseases. Explainable AI fades away the traditional
    black-box concept of machine learning and enables understanding the reasons behind
    any specific decision [15]. Description of big data through common semantics and
    ontologies and the adoption of open standards have great potential to boost research
    and development towards smart farming . Similarly, to ensure enhanced connectivity
    and live streaming of crop data, 5G technology need to be extensively explored
    [6]. 5G technology will minimize internet costs and augment the overall user experience
    of farm management and food safety by performing accurate crop inspections remotely
    [226]. Furthermore, it will significantly bridge the gap between stakeholders
    by keeping them well informed on produce availability. Lastly, blockchain in combination
    with IoT and other technologies can be implemented to address the challenges related
    to data privacy and security [227]. 4.18. Transition to Agriculture 5.0 The industrial
    revolutions have always brought a breakthrough in the agricultural sector. As
    formally discussed in previous sections, agriculture 4.0 has great potential to
    counterbalance the growing food demands and prepare for future by reinforcing
    agricultural systems with WSN, IoT, AI, etc. While the realization of agriculture
    4.0 is still underway, there is already a talk about agriculture 5.0. Agriculture
    5.0 extends agriculture 4.0 with inclusion of industry 5.0 principles to produce
    healthy and affordable food while ensuring to prevent degradation of the ecosystems
    on which life depends [228]. The European Commission formally called for the Fifth
    Industrial Revolution (industry 5.0) in 2021 after observing that industry 4.0
    focuses less on the original principles of social fairness and sustainability
    but more on digitalization and AI-driven technologies for increasing the efficiency
    and flexibility [229]. Industry 5.0 complements and extends industry 4.0 concept
    to recognize the human-centricity, sustainability, and resilience [230]. It involves
    refining the collaborative interactions between humans and machines, reducing
    environmental impact through circular economy, and developing high degree of robustness
    in systems to achieve optimal balance between efficiency and productivity. The
    enabling technologies of industry 5.0 are Cobots (collaborative robots), smart
    materials with embedded bio-inspired sensors, digital twins, AI, energy efficient
    and secure data management, renewable energy sources, etc [229].. In agriculture
    5.0 settings, farm''s production efficiency and crop quality can be enhanced by
    assigning repetitive and monotonous tasks to the machines and the tasks which
    need critical thinking to the humans. For this purpose, similar to manufacturing
    sector cyber physical cognitive systems (CPCS) that observe/study the environment
    and take actions accordingly should be developed for agricultural sector. This
    may include collaborative farm robots which will work in the fields and assist
    crop producers in tedious tasks such as seed sowing and harvesting etc. Likewise,
    digital twins in agriculture 5.0 can also offer significant value by identifying
    technical issues in agricultural systems and overcoming them at a faster speed,
    detecting crop diseases, and making crop yield predictions at a higher accuracy
    rate. This shows that agriculture 5.0 has potential to pave a way for climate
    smart, sustainable and resilient agriculture but as of now, it is in the developing
    phase. 5. Conclusions Increased concerns about global food security have accelerated
    the need for next-generation industrial farms and intensive production methods
    in agriculture. At the forefront of this modern agricultural era, digital technologies
    offered by Industry 4.0 initiative are suggesting a myriad of creative solutions.
    The scientific community and researchers integrate disruptive technologies in
    conventional agriculture systems to increase crop yields, minimize costs, reduce
    wastes, and maintain process inputs. An SLR discussing the prevailing state of
    these technologies in the agriculture sector is presented in this study. After
    applying SLR protocol, 148 articles were considered from the time frame of the
    year 2011 to 2021. Various research questions pertaining to i) current and continuing
    research trends, ii) functionality, maturity level, farm type and tools and techniques
    used, iii) primary roadblocks, and iv) added value of digital technologies; were
    put forward and answered. Several conclusions are drawn such as integration of
    big data and analytics, wireless sensor networks, cyber-physical systems, and
    digital twins in agriculture is only in its infancy, and most use cases are in
    the prototype phase. Likewise, 21 roadblocks are identified and classified at
    technical and socioeconomic levels. To ensure the digitization of agricultural
    industry, these roadblocks must be analyzed and overcome. The added value of digital
    technologies in agriculture industry are also identified and presented in the
    study. Overall, this study contributes to the research being carried around agriculture
    4.0. The primary limitation of this review is twofold: firstly, only three online
    repositories are considered for literature search (Scopus, IEEE and Science Direct),
    and secondly additional keywords and synonyms might return more studies. In both
    scenarios, it is highly unlikely that the overall findings would change. For the
    future work, additional research databases and aspects can be considered to provide
    holistic overview of agricultural industry in terms of digitization. Moreover,
    studies targeting agriculture 5.0 in general will also be included. Declaration

    the 21st century is the biggest challenge, especially for smart farm business.
    The smart farm has used agriculture automation system instead of traditional agriculture.
    Traditional agricultural methods employed by the local people are highly sustainable,
    although the all inclusive cost is not cheap. Our research goal is to provide
    long term sustainable solution for automation of agriculture. Agriculture automation
    has several methods to getting data from vegetable crop like sensor for environmental
    measurement. Therefore, we developed a portable measurement technology including
    soil moisture sensor, air humidity sensor and air temperature sensor. Moreover,
    irrigation system using wireless sensor network has installed these sensors, with
    the purpose for collecting the environment data and controlling the irrigation
    system via smart phone. The purpose of the experiment is to find better ways of
    controlling an irrigation system with automatic system and manual control by smart
    phone. In order to control an irrigation system, we have developed the communication
    methodology of the wireless sensor network for collected environment data and
    sending control command to turn on/off irrigation system. It is successful for
    controlling the irrigation system and controlling the water near the vegetable
    roots. In this paper, we have attempted to demonstrate the automation of the irrigation
    system that is useful for farm business which make it comfortable than using traditional
    agriculture by using smart phone for monitoring and controlling the system. Accordingly,
    in the long-term has reduced cost as well. The experimental result shows that
    the accuracy of sending and receiving command control for irrigation system is
    96 percent and accuracy of environment collection is 98 percent. Published in:

    Smart farming is the logical advancement of precision farming. The focus of precision
    farming was mainly on technological invention to allow for site-specific farming
    [1]. Moreover, smart farm is about empowering today''s farmers with the decision
    tools and automation measurement technologies that seamlessly integrate products,
    knowledge and services for better productivity, quality and profit. Technological
    advances in these areas gather increasing momentum and this means that maintaining
    an overview of latest developments becomes more and more of a challenge [2]. The
    most important things of smart farming are environmental measurements and water
    management. The reason is that the environmental and water management affects
    plant growth. In addition, environmental measurements using wireless sensor network
    and water management technology are much simpler, cheaper and lower running costs.
    Researchers had developed and used various devices for detecting and collecting
    soil conditions [3]. They had installed the sensor devices and transmission equipments
    in appropriate area [4]. These sensor devices have used in wireless sensor network
    (WSN). A case in point is some researcher had studied the reflected of ultrasonic
    wave signals monitor a soil moisture and groundwater levels [5] to predict the
    occurrence of landslides and slope. First, they installed an ultrasonic transducer
    inside steel pipe and take steel pipe buried in the ground then they calculated
    reflection of the wave period to measure the moisture content of the soil and
    the water level. That may cause the landslide when heavy rains. Therefore, the
    study of the measurement and surveillance environment in agriculture has performed
    extensive research and continuous with the technology to help for detecting the
    amount of light, humidity and temperature using wireless sensor networks to collect
    and process on a computer server and report to farmer through mobile device like
    PDA or cell phone [6], [7]. The environments have various factor relate to plant
    growth such as temperature, moisture in the air, soil moisture (the water leakage
    outflow speed of groundwater) [8] and soil PH. Automated Irrigation system has
    reported factors to farmer through mobile SMS, website[9] or voice mail alert
    [7]. The part of device to transmit data is often used as a TinyOS or microcontroller
    (MCU) and ZigBee (XBee) for radio transmission to send data signals from source
    to destination [10], [11]. The most of system are powered by solar cells and batteries
    [12]. This paper presents the process of how microcontroller (MCU) gather the
    environment information included humidity and temperature sensor, soil moisture
    and groundwater level in section II. Section III, the collected and transmitted
    methodology of environmental information for analyzed and controlled irrigation
    system on wireless sensor network (WSN) with smart phone application are explained.
    SECTION II. Hardware System Architecture In this section, we first describe the
    sensor devices for collected environment data which communication between Atmel
    AVR microcontroller (Arduino) and sensors by send and receive electrical voltage
    along a wire. A. The Environment Measurement Sensors We developed sensor and MCU
    to collect data from a four type of sensors including soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity and underground water level in the pipe. These sensors installed
    on vegetable crop and brought the level of water in the pipe to the MCU for calculating
    and determining the speed of water flow and leakage in the soil. Figure 1. The
    enclosed box for WSN acquiring system in field Show All 1) The Detection of Air
    Humidity and Temperature Firstly, we explain how to acquire the temperature and
    the humidity data of the vegetable crop from DHT22/AM2302 sensor. The circuit
    for wiring the DHT221 AM2302 sensor is shown in Figure 2. In case of sending a
    request for information, MCU send the start signal to the DHT22 for changing the
    AM2302 standby status to running status. After MCU has finished sent the start
    signal, the AM2302 will reply a response signal of 40-bit data that contains humidity
    and temperature data back to the MCU the MCU must send the start signal to the
    AM2302, Otherwise AM2302 will not give the response signal to the MCU. However,
    the AM2302 will change running status to standby status when transmission has
    finished or if it does not receive the start signal from the MCU again. The communication
    process is shown in Figure 3. The second part, we present how the MCU retrieve
    data from the DHT22 with a single cable. The MCU use a single cable in order to
    adjust voltage HIGH (5 Vdc) and LOW (0 Vdc) with time step. When the DHT22 status
    is in standby, the state of the signal data pin is HIGH with Pull-Up. When Meu
    begin to read, It assign data pin as output pin, and then make start bit by send
    voltage LOW to sensor at least 800 μsec (Microsecond). Actually it should be 1
    ms (1 Millisecond), and afterward the MCU changes the signal to HIGH voltage for
    20 μsec (Microsecond) and waiting for a reply. Finally, the MCU calculate the
    differential response values from the sensor. It has to change the signal voltage
    to LOW for 80 μsec and release back to HIGH for 80 μsec , then the DHT22 will
    send data one by one bit. If value of bit is “0”, the sensor will reduce the voltage
    to LOW for 50 μsec , then change the voltage to HIGH for 26–28 μsec . If value
    of data bit is “1”, the sensor will reduce voltage to LOW for 50 μsec and change
    to HIGH for 70 μsec . Figure 2. The DHT22/AM2302 circuit and printed circuit board
    Show All Figure 3. The communication process of DHT22/AM2302 Show All 2) The Detection
    of Soil Moisture and Underground Water Level Figure 4. The underground water level
    sensor circuit Show All The most important factor and the effective factor relate
    on plant growth is soil moisture. An approximately level of soil moisture can
    calculate from soil conductivity and underground water level. The surface soil
    moisture is calculated by measuring the conductivity of soil. Underground water
    level can measure from electrical conductivity in soil layer of around vegetable
    roots. We developed the underground water level sensor based on water leakage
    out of underground pipe. This sensor use the transistors and the shift register
    IC to read the electrical signals when electrical current runs through water to
    parallel input pin of IC. The circuit of underground water level sensor is shown
    in Figure 4. Figure 5. The circuit for making a PCB Show All The shift register
    circuits use for converting the parallel input signal to the serial output signal
    (Parallel input to Serial output). We use 2 units of CD402IBE IC shift register.
    The circuit for making a PCB is shown in Figure 5. The parallel input pin (PI-I,
    PI-2) of the second IC CD402I BE connect to the transistor for level 9 and 10
    measurement of underground water that it will be output to serial output pin (Q8).
    It has to send as input to the serial in pin of first IC (PIN 11 SERIAL IN) and
    the parallel input pin (PI-1, PI−2 … PI-8) of the first IC connect to the transistor
    for measuring the underground water level from level 1 to level 8. The shift resister
    IC is the parallel input to serial output (PISO) including a flip-flop circuit.
    When the MCU set latch pin to HIGH for 20 ms (20 Millisecond) and then set latch
    pin to LOW that mean MCU tell the shift register IC that MCU ready to get the
    information. After MCU is in ready state it has to set clock pin to HIGH for 2
    ms (2 Millisecond) and get data by reading data pin state. We set loop to get
    8 level of underground water level from each IC by sending clock pin HIGH and
    LOW for 8 times. However, we have to retrieve all level of underground water levels,
    we collect two sets of data and each set of data contains 1 byte. So the first
    data set is 8 bits, and it store 8 levels of underground water. The second set-the
    first 2 bits from the right (PI-I, PI-2) keep the underground water levels at
    level 9 and level 10 and the last 6 bits on the left (PI-3, PI-4 … PI-8) is set
    to “0” bits. MCU gather underground water levels from 2 shift register ICs by
    sending 16 times of clock signal for reaching all 10 levels and converting 2 set
    of 8 bits data to 1 byte. After that, the MCU added value of set 1 with set 2
    and converted to integer to assign each level of underground water. Figure 6.
    IC CD4021BE pins connection Show All The measurement pipe can be implemented by
    using the wires cable connected parallel input pins (PI-I, PI-2 … PI-8) to each
    point of a probe bar. Then put the probe bar into a plastic pipe. The pipe has
    drilled a drainage hole and each hold range is 2 millimeters diameter between
    levels 1 to 10. We had drilled the hole in a straight 3 horizontal lines of the
    pipe and each line distance was 6 centimeters from neighbor line. Figure 7. PVC
    tubes and rods for measure water level. Show All Figure 8. Soil moisture sensor
    and solenoid valve with water flow Show All The MCU collected data from each sensor.
    When the environment had changed, the MCU will convert a raw data to correctly
    transmission pattern. After the environment information was complete and ready
    to send. MCU will prepare Xbee module and serial communication to send information.
    SECTION III. Communication Architecture for Wsn In this section, we describe how
    ZigBee (XBee Series2) with mesh protocol and AT Command mode can work for communication
    with each other by the data transmission protocol that uses the word group pattern.
    A. Data Transmission 1) Wireless Data Transmission The communication between each
    node is the serial communication. The sensor nodes are placed at various points
    near the vegetable crop area and the coordinator node is placed near the sensor
    nodes and web server node. Each node consists of the XBee devices. Then, the sensor
    nodes will send the data to the coordinator node. If the sensor node is out of
    range from the coordinator node, then they will send the information through another
    node that can communicate with the coordinator node. The coordinator node process
    and send commands to control the environment to sensor nodes after it has received
    data. In the other hand, it sends information to web server node for collecting
    and reporting the environment information of the vegetable crop area. The communication
    framework is shown in Figure 9. Figure 9. The communication framework Show All
    2) Model of Data Transmission for Communication Within The Network To receive
    and send data for wireless sensor network. The data is transmitted via XBee (wireless
    module ZigBee XBee Series 2). The purpose is to build the WSN system. This system
    can work either indoors, outdoors and various environments as well. The XBee transmits
    the signal as the characters through small Chip. It can transfer the data as point-to-multipoint
    or point-to- point until the destination node has received the data. The XBee
    transceiver utilizes the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance
    (CSMA-CA) which is the multiple input-output channels to prevent the collision
    of signals. The network topologies would be a Star, Mesh or Peer-to-Peer. Each
    device address should be long as 64bit or 16bit. In this research, we have chosen
    to utilize the XBee Series 2 with Mesh Protocol. The required configurations of
    X-CTU by for each node serve in 3 forms. ZigBee coordinators: This node coordinate
    all nodes in network and control the irrigation system. If the coordinator node
    cannot talk to an ZigBee router/end device (Endpoint) because it is out of range,
    a router can use for bridge data between the coordinator and the endpoint. The
    working flow of coordinator node is shown in Figure 10. ZigBee router/end device
    for web server: This node provides an information for smart phone. At the same
    time, it receives and transmits the mobile command to control the irrigation system.
    The working flow of web server node is shown in Figure 11. ZigBee router/end device
    for the sensors and the water control: This node is a node on the endpoint of
    network. We use this node to receive the sensors signal or the irrigation controlling
    commands and sending the environment data to the ZigBee coordinator node. The
    working flow of end device and sensor node is shown in Figure 12. Figure 10. Coordinator
    work flow Show All Figure 11. Web server node work flow Show All Figure 12. End
    device and sensor nodes work flow Show All 3) Data Transmission Patterns We have
    defined the data transmission patterns of WSN. The protocol framework is shown
    in Figure 13. The detail of sending and receiving parameters are shown as follows.

    Data transmission patterns of wireless sensor networks. Show All 4) Data Transmission
    Between Router/end Device Nodes and Coordinator Node The data is measured by the
    sensor at router/end device nodes send to the coordinator node for collecting
    and analyzing data. We have defined the parameters as follows. Environment data
    collector: Router/End device node send message BF + PM ID (A to L) + environment
    data to coordinator node. Coordinator controlling solenoid valve: Coordinator
    node sends message RL + RO ID (2, 3, 4) + state (“H”, “L”) + Pin (“4”) to router/end
    device node. Transmission of water flow rate: Router/End device node send message
    TL + RO ID (2, 3 and 4) + water flow rate (liters/minutes) to coordinator node.
    Transmission for checking status of each node: Coordinator nodes send HELLO and
    waits for router/end device node reply working status message OKRO + RO ID (1,
    2,3, 4). Acceleration and deceleration of transmission rate: Coordinator node
    send RFAST to router/end device node for set router/end device node transmits
    only water level and water flow when their change and send RSLOW to router/end
    device node for set router/end device node send data when temperature or humidity
    or water level was changed every 30 minutes. 5) Data Transmission Between Web
    Server Node and Coordinator Node The coordinator node sends the environment data
    to the web server node. We have defined the parameters as follows. Controlling
    solenoid valve: Web server node send message RL + RO ID (2, 3, 4) + state (“H”,
    “L”) + pin (4) to coordinator node. Environment data transmission: Coordinator
    node message SV + RO ID (2, 3, 4) + PM ID (A to L) + environment data to web server
    node. Water flow data transmission: Coordinator node send message WF + RO ID (2,
    3, 4) + water flow rate (litters/minutes) to web server node. Time watering data
    transmission: Coordinator node send message TW + RO ID (2, 3, 4) + water volume
    for watering (litters) to web server node. Leakage speed of underground water:
    Coordinator node messaging TD + RO ID (2, 3, 4) + speed of water leakage out of
    pipe to underground (minutes) to web server node. Check the working status of
    nodes: Web server node send message CHKRO to coordinator node and waits for reply
    message OKST + RO ID (1, 2, 3, 4). 6) Web Server Node Displays an Information
    when Received the Request from the Smart Phone Web server node displays the collected
    information from the coordinator node in XML format including soil moisture (degree
    0–99), humidity (RH degree 0–99), temperature in Celsius degrees, underground
    water level 1 to level 10, water flow rate (litters/minutes), watering volume
    (liters) on each location and time of the water leakage from level 10 to level
    1 (minutes). Web server node send data to smart phone when receive http request.
    At the same time, it had been waiting a command for turn on/off the irrigation
    system. Web server node has serviced on the internet. The smart phone application
    is shown in Figure 14. Figure 14. The reporting and control system via smart phone
    Show All SECTION IV. Experimental Result We have designed to control the irrigation
    system with automatic system. In another way, we can use the manual control of
    the irrigation system by smart phone if automatic irrigation system going to waste
    or insufficient water. The system setup is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15. Overall
    system setup Show All A. Control Watering System 1) Irrigation System Control
    Via Smart Phone Watering system can order through the smart phone system to turn
    on/off the solenoid valve. It can be remotely controlled through the internet.
    Application on smart phone serves to turn on/off solenoid valve and fan. The commands
    for control are sent by an application on smart phone as well. 2) The Common Time
    To Watering The irrigation system was watering in the morning and evening. By
    the early morning hours of 7.00 AM and 6.00 PM in the evening. Otherwise, the
    irrigation system had been using some water in morning much more than in the evening.
    Because plants need nutrients and photosynthesis in daytime. B. Performance of
    System In the experiments, we collected an environment data to report through
    an application on smart phone and used a smart phone to control the irrigation
    system for start and stop watering. These experiments were done by sending and
    receiving the control commands from smart phone application via the internet to
    all nodes in 3 steps. Firstly, we used web server node to receive the control
    commands from smart phone and then forwarded commands to the coordinator node.
    Secondly, the coordinator forwarded command to another node with point to multipoint.
    Finally, end device node set a device pin is wiring with relay circuit to high
    or low voltage for control and tum on/off solenoid valve. In addition for collected
    sensor data, end device node sent sensor data to coordinator node then coordinator
    node processed data and forwarded information of vegetable crop to web server
    node. The MCU displays a transmission data of serial communication in the hyper
    terminal program to be known that the transmission can send and receive successfully.
    We had sent 50 times of data from smart phone to control irrigation system on
    each vegetable area for controlling the solenoid valve and collecting the environment
    information from vegetable crop. The results are shows in Table I. Table I. Summary
    of the remote control performance test The experimental results show 48 times
    of the completely sending a control command (completed 96%) and 49 times of collecting
    the environment data (completed 98%). The control commands sent from mobile phone
    to web server node has accuracy 98%, from web server node to coordinator node
    is 98%, and from coordinator to sensor node is 96%. The environment data collection
    that sent from sensor node to coordinator achieves the accuracy as 100%, from
    coordinator node to web server node is 96%. The data transmission for collecting
    the data and the controlling commands of smart phone can be controlled watering
    system. It means that the measuring and controlling the environment are powerful
    enough to meet the need for the growth of plants. The occurred error in the transmission
    of control commands on the phone was caused by the mobile network. Sometimes transmission
    data was incorrect pattern and it was dropped to prevent incomplete information.
    SECTION V. Conclusion and Futher Work The methodologies of automated irrigation
    control and handle by smart phone is working great. These methods can feed vegetable
    and made it growth normally. The experimental result shows that the accuracy of
    sending and receiving command control for irrigation system is 96 percent and
    accuracy of environment collection is 98 percent. However, measured and collected
    environment data from sensor to manage vegetable crop including water level, air
    temperature and air humidity were not enough for making the intelligence decision.
    Watering volume is a little faulty which is sometimes caused by overwatering.
    The error related to many factors such as rain, soil type, and specification of
    vegetable crops. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like

    \ exist in the wireless sensor\nnetwork, in spite of the shortcoming, it has been\
    \ gaining signiﬁcant attention among researchers and\ntechnologists due to its\
    \ versatility and robustness. WSN is subject to a high potential technology that\n\
    has been successfully implemented and tested in real-time scenarios, as well as\

    of temperature, criminal activity in borders and surveillance on trafﬁc monitoring,\
    \ vehicular behavior\non roads, water level and pressure, and remote monitoring\
    \ of patients. The application of the Wireless\nSensor Network in the assorted\

    \ most effective solution in remote areas which are not yet explored due to its\
    \ perilous nature\nand unreachable places. Here, in this study, we have cited\
    \ the recent and updated research on the\nubiquitous usage of WSN in diverse ﬁelds\
    \ in an extensive and comprehensive approach.\nKeywords: wireless sensor network\

    \ real-time application has gained prominent\nattention among technocrats and\
    \ researchers.\nIn order to eradicate the challenges of the sensors,\ntechnologists\
    \ and researchers found a solution by deploying the real-time applications of\
    \ Wireless\nsensor network (WSN). The real-time sensors will instantaneously sense,\
    \ record, and send feedback to\nthe end user for further processing of the obtained\
    \ information. Specifically, the real-time application\nis concerned with the\
    \ performance of critical applications that need bounded delay latency. Real-time\n\
    wireless communication is an emerging application arena of WSNs which has a potential\
    \ significant\nresearch direction. Real-time applications able to monitor, respond\
    \ immediately to user input, or control\nan external environment. The external\
    \ environment can be connected to the computer system via sensors,\nactuators,\
    \ and input-output devices. Wireless sensor networks that enable the network bounded\
    \ delay\nguarantee, which is essential for the end to end packet delivery, are\
    \ termed as real-time WSN [1,2].\nWireless sensor network (WSN) is of the utmost\
    \ importance in computer networking for the\nsearching area and in information\
    \ assortment. WSN ﬁnds its application in several areas, including\nmonitoring\
    \ and data storage. Due to rapid urbanization, the span of the applications of\
    \ WSN has been\nincreasing enormously. WSN has numerous sensors which are communicated\

    of3rd millennium industries makes it interesting to research WSN. The actual implementation\
    \ of WSN\nwas started in 1950 and the US military used this technology. The ﬁrst\
    \ mature WSN was named the\n“Sound Surveillance System” (SOSUS). It was used to\
    \ detect the threat of underwater submarines.\nAcoustic sensors (a type of sensor\
    \ used to check the amplitude of the waves) are used for (SOSUS)\nand this technology\

    \ is used\nto detect sound, detect any kind of vibrations, check the water level,\
    \ detect the temperature level [7],\nin smart houses [8], in smart phones, and\
    \ most importantly, we use some kind of sensors in the human\nbody [9]. The WSN\
    \ consists of nodes, and through these nodes, sensors communicate with each\n\
    other. The hierarchy of these nodes is like a star where every node connects to\
    \ each other or like\na mesh topology. Each node collects information from this\

    Terrestrial WSNs consist of numerous tiny sensor nodes. These nodes are randomly\
    \ deployed \nin a specific area from where an ad hoc network is used for communication\
    \ between the nodes. These \nnodes can be organized by optimal placement, grid\
    \ placement, or 2D and 3Dplacement models [13]. \nNadeem et al. (2009) investigated\
    \ this for applications of the terrestrial wireless sensor network in \nRadio\

    \ to enhance the reliability of WSN, efficient routing algorithms have been\n\
    carried out for solving the limitation of the WSN’s accuracy during the routing\
    \ process [15].\nZhe et al. (2011) proposed a mathematical framework in order\
    \ to analyze the dynamic connectivity\nin the wireless underground sensor network\
    \ (WUSN). Their aim was to monitor the changes in\nthe environmental parameters\
    \ such as the soil composition and the random soil moisture [16].\nIdrees et al.\
    \ (2016) developed a sensor node named Molenet to handle the wireless underground\n\
    operation. The proposed system is part of a revitalization project in Cameroon.\
    \ Their main goal was to\nkeep the network operational for a long time and enhance\
    \ the communication range [17].\nFuture Internet 2017, 9, 77\n4 of 22\n2.3. Underwater\

    \ signal. The aforesaid problem has been recognized by investigators, and in order\
    \ to\neradicate the problem, they proposed a solution via a suitable routing algorithm\
    \ [18]. Davide et al.\n(2009) proposed an underwater wireless sensor network based\
    \ on optical communication between\nnodes. Radio frequencies and acoustic waves\
    \ are profoundly attenuated in water. To overcome this\nproblem, optical communication\
    \ can be considered. In order to increase the efﬁciency of the system,\nthe authors\
    \ designed a user interface for managing the optical Physical (PHY) layer implementation\n\
    on a Digilent Spartan 3 Board [19]. Nithin et al. (2017) have assembled a review\
    \ for prevalent\napproaches and issues relating to a certain parameter of research.\
    \ They have presented a paper\nbased on a survey of the underwater wireless sensor\
    \ network with data aggregation to highlight\nits advantages and disadvantages.\
    \ The authors implemented different clustering techniques for\nperforming data\
    \ aggregation as a result to demonstrate the impact of data aggregation [20].\n\
    2.4. Mobile Wireless Sensor Network\nA mobile WSN has the advantage that power\
    \ changes its position and automatically connects to\nthe environment. Mobile\
    \ sensors connect with computers and communicate. Mobile sensors are used\nfor\
    \ collecting data from a wide area or information from other nodes or sensors.\
    \ The main limitations\nof mobile WSNs are the present status, coverage area,\
    \ navigation, reposition, and maintenance.\nThe aforementioned issues have been\
    \ resolved via a dynamic routing algorithm [21]. Cho et al. (2011)\nhave assembled\
    \ a review of prevalent schemes for the mobile wireless sensor network, while\
    \ keeping\na certain parameter as the center of research. Various parameters include\
    \ accepted classiﬁcations,\npotential attacks, performance metrics, and trust\
    \ metrics on the mobile wireless sensor network [22].\n2.5. Multimedia Wireless\
    \ Sensor Network\nA multimedia WSN consists of tiny sensor nodes that can sense,\
    \ compute, actuate, and\ncommunicate. A variety of applications of the WSN include\
    \ habitation monitoring, trafﬁc management\nsystems, and ecological monitoring.\
    \ The multimedia WSN is a network of wirelessly interconnected\ndevices that are\
    \ able to ubiquitously retrieve video and audio transmission, still images, and\
    \ scalar\nsensor data from the environment [23]. Akyildiz et al. (2006) analyzed\
    \ the recent developments on\nmultimedia WSNs and outlined the primary research\
    \ challenges. Algorithms, protocols, and hardware\nfor the enhancement of multimedia\
    \ WSN sensors were surveyed and open analyses were conducted\nfor the problems\
    \ mentioned. The authors tend to classify ready-made hardware as an accessible\n\
    research prototype for the multimedia WSN [24]. Muhammad et al. (2017) focused\
    \ on some advanced\nwell known multi channel assignment protocol in WSN. They\
    \ have listed challenging issues and the\nclassiﬁcation of different channel selection\
    \ policies, types of channel assignment, and methods of\nchannel assignment [25].\n\
    Some Key Requirements of Wireless Sensor Networks\n•\nScalability: It will expand\
    \ this network to add nodes as required. Its expansions should be easy\nto conduct.\n\
    •\nReliability: Many methods are there for reducing the power usage of (WSN) nodes,\
    \ which are\nresulting in an increase in the lifetime of the network and their\
    \ consistency.\n•\nResponsiveness: The response time is very quick because of\
    \ its limitations.\n•\nMobility: Mobility is the basic feature of WSN. It is a\
    \ wireless network so no wire is used for this\nnetwork. That is why mobility\
    \ is a key requirement of WSN.\n•\nPower efﬁciency: It uses a sensor that results\
    \ in low power consumption.\nFuture Internet 2017, 9, 77\n5 of 22\n3. Applications\
    \ of WSN\nThe real time application of WSN is like a hot cake. WSN is ubiquitously\
    \ used everywhere in modern\nsociety. It has been successfully implemented in\
    \ diverse fields such as military, habitual, business, health,\nand industry applications.\
    \ Furthermore, there are adequate scopes of research themes that have not yet\n\
    been explored pertaining to this field. Some of the applications have been delineated\
    \ below.\n3.1. Environment Monitoring\nThere are various requirements of environmental\
    \ monitoring applications, which include measuring\nthe parameters of wind speed\
    \ and direction. Figure 3, depicted the outline of environment monitoring\nsystem\
    \ applications for WSN. Many of them are slow in changing behavior which allows\
    \ one to sample\nthem efficiently from one to five minutes as they react. Yet,\
    \ a fascinating phenomenon of rockslides has\nbeen difficult to predict in such\
    \ a case and the developments should be long lasting in order to capture\nthem.\
    \ The following technical requirements are needed for the environment checking\
    \ system [26]. Table 1,\nrepresent the examples of real-time environment monitoring\
    \ system applications that utilize WSNs.\nFuture Internet 2017, 9, 77  \n6 of\

    \ the \ntechniques for mobility of the waste from one point to another point via\
    \ the Trash Track Project, \nwhich also provided insight regarding the tag performance\
    \ and some attained traces. This technology \nalso produced a concept and idea\
    \ regarding the transformation and perception of the cities. \nMao et al., 2012\
    \ studied the real time surveillance for CO2 monitoring in a specific urban area\
    \ \nnetwork. They conducted their study via simulations resembling practical deployment\
    \ in Wuxi, PR \nChina. \nHasanfratz et al., 2014 studied the largest spatially\
    \ resolved Ultrafine Particles (UFPs) data set \nin Zurich, Switzerland, which\

    \ severe diseases such as \nrespiratory problems, cardiovascular problems, etc.\
    \ They collected the data for more than two years. \nThe authors compared the\
    \ accuracy models on a different time scale and found that there are \nsignificant\
    \ changes obtained during their time frame. Furthermore, they developed a technique\
    \ via \nmodeling in which the previous data were incorporated with the metadata,\
    \ and the result was shown \nto be quite significant. Additionally, after deployment\
    \ of the model, they obtained a significant \nreduction in the root mean square\
    \ values which inferred that the data is statistically reproducible. \nJiang et\
    \ al., 2016 studied the deployment of sensors for air quality monitoring in Amsterdam,\
    \ \nthe Netherlands. The target compound was NO2.The authors delineated the mechanism\
    \ based on a \nbottom-up approach for the citizen of the urban area. They compared\

    \ should be large enough to support a weather station throughout the whole\noperation.\
    \ The condition of switching on the radio must not be entertained all the time.\
    \ Usage of the\nsolar system can be a good option.\n3.1.2. Reliability\nTo prevent\
    \ an unforeseen crash, the network should perform very simple and expected operations.\n\
    The end user may not have enough knowledge and the interested areas are isolated\
    \ most of the time.\nDuring the ruthless situation of weather (like very cold\
    \ weather and a lot of rain in), the packet could\nbe lost so it becomes harder\
    \ to achieve reliability.\n3.1.3. Robustness\nThe concerning network should be\
    \ able to diagnose this problem, including the poor connectivity\nof radio transmission\
    \ in the case of hardware failure or a bad weather situation like snow falling.\
    \ It has\nbeen observed that humidity can lead to short-circuits, which may lead\
    \ to restarting of the stations.\nSometimes it is better to incorporate and remove\
    \ the stations based on need. The new station could\nbe added at any point of\
    \ interest. It is not advisable to solely depend on earlier knowledge while\n\
    redesigning the network.\nFuture Internet 2017, 9, 77\n6 of 22\nBoustani et al.,\

    to use system, and low cost devices which are very helpful in business applications\
    \ [35]. The WSN\nuses the building decision support systems, avoiding various\

    \ sensor networks due to a limited bandwidth, node mobility, and end to end delay\
    \ in data\npacket transmission. Existing routing protocols have been analyzed\
    \ which investigate the optimization\nperformance of network services, node mobility,\
    \ end to end delay, and energy draining of sensor nodes.\nLarge numbers of routing\
    \ protocol have been developed for those that are working in Underwater\nWireless\
    \ Sensor Network (UWSN). These protocols evaluate the performance efﬁciency with\
    \ respect to\nan end to end delay, node mobility, network throughput, and energy\
    \ consumption, etc. [54]. Figure 6,\nshows the real-time example of underwater\
    \ sensor network implemented in Aquarium of Zaragoza.\nThe UWSN consists of four\
    \ different numbers of sensor nodes. Nodes that are anchored to the sea\nbottom\
    \ have randomly ﬂoated with the water current. Anchored nodes sense data within\
    \ range\nenvironments and route the sensed data toward the surface sink in multi-hop\
    \ fashion or through\nautonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The autonomous underwater\
    \ vehicles (AUVs), unmanned\nunderwater vehicles (UUVs) move in water in a ﬁxed\
    \ pattern to communicate with sensor nodes\nthrough a short range and high rate\
    \ data link. AUVs near the base station negotiate to the sink\nnode to forward\
    \ the collected data. In UWSN, link failure is a burning issue due to node mobility.\n\
    Node mobility will create holes in the network causing an increase in the end\
    \ to end delay in data\ntransmission. The efﬁcient underwater communication poses\
    \ signiﬁcant problems due to the intrinsic\nabsorption nature of water. The acoustic\
    \ signal also faces many problems due to a high error rate,\nlow available bandwidth,\
    \ node mobility, lower propagation speed, and high end to end delay. In recent\n\
    years, the wireless sensor network applications have spanned into different ﬁelds\
    \ for use in weather\nmonitoring; water pollution monitoring such as biological,\
    \ chemical, nuclear, and micro-organism\ntracking; and disaster prevention. UWSN\
    \ is also widely used in underwater oil and gas pipeline\ncorrosion detection\
    \ and military security applications. In order to design an efﬁcient UWSN routing\n\
    protocol, researchers face many challenges which attenuate the medium, such as\
    \ node mobility,\nend-to-end propagation delay, and energy saving [55]. Table\

    \ will broaden their horizon in terms of a human being’s activity.\nPertaining\
    \ to human health, WBAN systems give an insight into the physiological conditions\

    \ whose health is not critical, but still, the monitoring of their \nhealth is\
    \ required and due to any reason they are not able to stay in the hospital for\
    \ longer. All WBAN \napplications are based on three-tier architecture. All three\

    \ and are placed outside or inside of the human body. This sensor gets \nrequired\
    \ data from the human body and sends it wirelessly to the next layer. \n• \nLevel\
    \ 2: Second layer is called the body central unit. The body central unit contains\
    \ personal \nservers, and these servers get data from sensors which calculate\
    \ and manipulate this data, \ngenerating the required results. This layer can\

    \ for a patient’s \nfitness. If there are some emergency results, then the machine\
    \ sends an alarm to the end user \nand makes it possible to generate a quick response\
    \ so that patients can get proper treatment.  \nLv et al., 2010 studied a health\

    \ for\nthe diagnostics industry. Several applications are available, but are still\
    \ in their infancy, but here in\nthis study, the authors provide a comprehensive\
    \ approach for the aforesaid parameters. They have\ndeveloped a Desktop version\
    \ with printable facilities. The results are in the form of graphs and tables\n\
    for comprehension. They can be accessed in a speciﬁc area network such as from\
    \ 10 m to 50 m via\nZigBee without using the wire, which is more appropriate for\
    \ the WBAN.\nRasyid et al., 2016 investigated a non invasive approach for the\
    \ detection of the blood glucose\nlevel. The invasive approach for the detection\
    \ of blood glucose is an age old technique which is\ngenerally practiced in clinics\
    \ or hospitals for the diagnosis of diabetes. Of late, the authors have\ndeveloped\
    \ a non-invasive approach and quiet reproducible technique via the application\
    \ of real-time\nsensors and it plays a pivotal role in the Healthcare industry.\
    \ The authors have developed glucose\nsensor monitoring via a Glucometer sensor\
    \ with an Arduino Uno board and ZigBee module system.\nFurthermore, in this approach,\
    \ the patient does not need to be present physically for the routine\nexamination;\
    \ they can perform the test via a web-based application via the usage of mobile\
    \ phones.\nWu et al., 2017 investigated the application of sensors based on solar\
    \ inﬂux gathering. The authors\nplaced an emphasis on evaluating the body temperature\
    \ distribution, heartbeat, and shelf life of the\ninstrument via web-based smart-phone\

    \ worked on Internet of Things (IoT) and VANET. The combinatorial\napproach of\
    \ the aforementioned framework has been employed to detect accidents, avoid secondary\n\
    accidents, and contact the ambulance in a timely manner. Additionally, the sensor\
    \ will communicate\nwith the ambulances and hospital for further correspondence\
    \ regarding the incident. The authors\ninferred that their approach reduces the\
    \ time for contacting the aforesaid, which might lead to a chance\nof saving a\
    \ life.\nTai el al., 2017 developed a novel trafﬁc monitoring system for VANET-based\
    \ applications.\nTheir proposed model is able to generate and analyze trafﬁc condition\
    \ reports, including the current\ntime and location of the trafﬁc with the help\
    \ of image processing techniques. This approach exhibited\naround 85% accuracy\
    \ in maintaining the authenticity of the data, 84.093m/s for the implementation\n\

    \ Vehicles\nAutomatic vehicles possess the attribute of safety critical management\
    \ functions such as directing,\nregulating, or the usage of a brake. The aforesaid\
    \ attributes will work whenever a manual driver\ninput is unavailable. Automatic\
    \ vehicles could be “autonomous” (i.e., solely based on vehicle sensors)\nor could\
    \ use a communications system to connect with the vehicle technology. This communication\n\
    Future Internet 2017, 9, 77\n16 of 22\nwill work wirelessly with the ground level\
    \ lane during the movement of the vehicle. The automatic\nvehicles utilize multiple\
    \ techniques to comprehend their ambiance such as a microwave radar, optical\n\
    device light, GPS, odometer, and PC version. The advanced mechanism interprets\
    \ the sensory\ninformation to recognize the appropriate course-plotting ways,\
    \ in addition to hindrances and important\naccumulations. Furthermore, the autonomous\
    \ car possesses a mechanical system which is capable\nof investigating the sensory\
    \ information and is able to discriminate the other vehicle/car which is\nmoving\
    \ in the same lane with the same destination path speciﬁed. Additionally, the\
    \ input parameter\nsuch as connectivity plays a vital role and it is recognized\
    \ as an advantage [77]. In order to prevent\nthe trafﬁc accidents, automatic vehicles\
    \ could a good choice. The automatic vehicle showed some\npromising merits such\
    \ as a reduction in fuel consumption, help with parking in busy parking areas,\n\
    a reduction in the crime rate of the city, as well as being able to cater for\
    \ youth, senior, or elderly\npersons and physically challenged persons. For commercialization\
    \ and awareness among society\nregarding the automatic vehicle, business tycoons\
    \ should take the initiative and be facilitated for their\nbusiness models. Table\

    Dagher et al., 2014 investigated the smart navigating system. Due to rapid industrialization\
    \ and\nurban development, the number of vehicles has been increased in a very\
    \ rapid manner. To avoid\ncongestion in the streets and roads, the parking problem,\
    \ which is increasing in everyday life, needs to\nbe addressed. To resolve this\
    \ issue, the authors implemented real-time sensors in the smart cities to\neradicate\
    \ the problems for better daily life. The authors have developed a model which\
    \ is coined as\nAngle of Arrival (AoA), which depicts and measures the vehicle\
    \ position on the map. Additionally,\nthe authors have simulated the result and\
    \ the obtained data gave a signiﬁcant outcome, enhancing the\npositioning of the\
    \ vehicle.\nSrinivasan et al., 2016 investigated the application of real time\
    \ sensors with the help of IoT and\nsensor networks. They applied these approaches\

    The United States military used WSN for the ﬁrst time in a military application\
    \ in 1960, called\nthe Sound Surveillance System (SOSUS). This is used for the\
    \ detection and tracking of submarines.\nNowadays, WSN is used in many ways like\
    \ tracking or the moving of a solider or vehicles during the\nsurveillance mission.\
    \ This is also used for collecting data or necessary information from the target\
    \ area\nand sending it to the base station. However, the military needs to improve\
    \ the quality of WSN security\nby the routing algorithm [80]. Table 12, represent\
    \ the examples of real-time applications for Military.\nArora et al., 2005 investigated\
    \ the deployment of a dense wireless network sensor, which is coined\nas “Tripwire”.\
    \ The reason behind this project is to limit the intruder from crossing the border,\
    \ including\nany kind of sabotages, and from smuggling important plant species\
    \ which might be an indigenous\nspecies and will be a national treasure for the\
    \ country. Overall, for security reasons, the sensors need\nto be deployed in\
    \ the border region between the countries.\nAcar et al., 2006 investigated the\
    \ underwater sensor network for monitoring ﬁsh detection,\ncollision avoidance,\
    \ underwater vehicles, and long-term ecological inspection.\nThe authors\nstudied\

    5. Conclusions\nIn this study, we have copiously reviewed the usage of the WSN\
    \ in diverse ﬁelds. Due to the\nrapid and progressive development of society,\
    \ continuous innovation is an utmost requirement for\nhuman civilization and its\
    \ development. It has been observed that via the application of this intelligent\n\
    and smart technology, quality of life has been enriched. WSN has the potential\
    \ to be employed in the\nmeasurement and controlling applications. With the aid\

    \ data could be transferred at that scale, which is hard to achieve.\nWithout\
    \ any external guideline and supervision, it has the ability to develop a network\
    \ itself. WSN\nis beneﬁcial for numerous daily life applications where we have\
    \ tried to demonstrate through the\nvarious usage of WSNs. The scope of WSN applications\
    \ is not limited to, environmental monitoring,\nthe surveillance of criminal activities,\
    \ healthcare, and infrastructure monitoring. Each application\nhas its own features\
    \ and requirements. However, there are still several challenges that need to be\n\
    addressed in order to augment the development of WSN applications such as power\
    \ management,\nFuture Internet 2017, 9, 77\n18 of 22\nsecurity, and communication\
    \ protocols. By addressing these issues, the application of WSN can be\nhelpful\
    \ in numerous ﬁelds like predictive maintenance, high conﬁdence-asset tracking,\
    \ facilitating new\nknowledge, wind speed and direction, improving food, seismic\
    \ detection, mechanical stress detection\nafter earthquakes, intelligent buildings,\
    \ improving productivity, and energy saving smart grids.\nWe have tried our best\
    \ to categorize each application scenario speciﬁcally and have included prototype\n\
    examples that adequately ﬁt the scenario. This is accomplished by investigating\
    \ the extensive literature\nreview of various research papers and implication\
    \ contributions to this area. Several technologists and\nresearchers envisage\
    \ that the sensor network will bring several ﬁelds together in order to broaden\
    \ its\nhorizon. Furthermore, the incorporation of additional advancement in the\
    \ real-time applications of\nWSN possesses an extensive range of scope in this\

    In swarm robotics multiple robots collectively solve problems by forming advantageous

    structures and behaviors similar to the ones observed in natural systems, such
    as swarms

    of bees, birds, or ﬁsh. However, the step to industrial applications has not yet
    been made

    successfully. Literature is light on real-world swarm applications that apply
    actual swarm

    algorithms. Typically, only parts of swarm algorithms are used which we refer
    to as basic

    swarm behaviors. In this paper we collect and categorize these behaviors into
    spatial

    organization, navigation, decision making, and miscellaneous. This taxonomy is
    then

    applied to categorize a number of existing swarm robotic applications from research
    and

    industrial domains. Along with the classiﬁcation, we give a comprehensive overview
    of

    research platforms that can be used for testing and evaluating swarm behavior,
    systems

    that are already on the market, and projects that target a speciﬁc market. Results
    from

    this survey show that swarm robotic applications are still rare today. Many industrial

    projects still rely on centralized control, and even though a solution with multiple
    robots

    is employed, the principal idea of swarm robotics of distributed decision making
    is

    neglected. We identiﬁed mainly following reasons: First of all, swarm behavior
    emerging

    from local interactions is hard to predict and a proof of its eligibility for
    applications in an

    industrial context is difﬁcult to provide. Second, current communication architectures

    often do not match requirements for swarm communication, which often leads to
    a

    system with a centralized communication infrastructure. Finally, testing swarms
    for real

    industrial applications is an issue, since deployment in a productive environment
    is

    typically too risky and simulations of a target system may not be sufﬁciently
    accurate.

    In contrast, the research platforms present a means for transforming swarm robotics

    solutions from theory to prototype industrial systems.

    1. INTRODUCTION

    Swarms typically consist of many individual, simple, and homogeneous or heterogeneous

    agents (Dorigo and Birattari, 2007). They traditionally cooperate without any
    central control,

    and act according to simple and local behavior. Only through their interactions
    a collective

    behavior emerges that is able to solve complex tasks. These characteristics lead
    to the main

    advantages of swarms: adaptability, robustness, and scalability. Swarms can be
    considered as a

    Schranz et al.

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    kind of quasi-organism that can adapt to changes in the

    environment by following speciﬁc behaviors (Hamann and

    Schmickl, 2012), e.g.:

    • Pursuing a speciﬁc goal.

    • Aggregating or dispersing in the environment.

    • Communicating (direct, indirect).

    • Memorizing (local states, morphologies).

    In

    swarm

    robotics,

    multiple

    robots—homogeneous

    or

    heterogeneous—are

    interconnected,

    forming

    a

    swarm

    of

    robots. Since individual robots have processing, communication

    and sensing capabilities locally on-board they are able to interact

    with each other, and react to the environment autonomously.

    In this paper, we focus on swarm intelligence applied in

    the swarm robotics domain. The theoretical and mathematical

    foundations of traditional swarm algorithms are out of the

    scope of this paper, as this was already done by multiple other

    authors at a greater level of detail. For example, Bonabeau

    et al. (1999) depict phenomena in social insects that had

    been transferred successfully to algorithms. Biological swarm

    behaviors from which a number of computational algorithms

    were developed are also discussed by Parpinelli and Lopes

    (2011). Camazine et al. (2001) discuss general self-organization

    aspects in biological systems. Moreover, Garnier et al. (2007)

    provide a good overview of the biological principles of

    swarm intelligence. Floreano and Mattiussi (2008) discuss

    swarm

    intelligence

    alongside

    evolutionary

    computation,

    artiﬁcial neural networks, and bio robotics. Blum and Li

    (2008), Binitha and Sathya (2012), and Krause et al. (2013)

    address

    swarm

    intelligence

    algorithms

    for

    optimization.

    Hassanien and Alamry (2015) depict the natural inspirations

    of swarm intelligence–based optimization algorithms. Swarm

    intelligence–based optimization algorithms are analyzed by

    Yang et al. (2013), the link between swarm intelligence–

    based

    optimization

    algorithms

    and

    self-organization

    is

    examined by Yang et al. (2017). Rossi et al. (2018) classify

    existing multi-agent algorithms according to their underlying

    mathematical structure.

    Despite the large number of swarm algorithms, the step

    to industrial applications has not been mastered successfully,

    yet. In our research work on real-world applications, we

    noticed that oftentimes industry applications use the term

    “swarm,” but typically do not implement particular swarm

    algorithms. They rather use parts of swarm algorithms and

    implement them using centralized control. We refer to such

    parts of swarm algorithms as basic swarm behaviors in

    the following.

    The rest of the paper is organized as follows: In section 2

    we

    propose

    a

    taxonomy

    of

    basic

    swarm

    behaviors.

    In

    section

    3

    we

    show

    where

    these

    behaviors

    are

    applied

    by giving a comprehensive overview on current swarm

    robotics research platforms, projects, and products. This

    overview is complemented by a discussion that analyses the

    current situation, and explores open challenges in swarm

    robotics

    applications.

    Finally,

    in

    section

    4

    we

    conclude

    the paper.

    2. BASIC SWARM BEHAVIORS FOR

    SWARM ROBOTICS

    In most swarm algorithms, individuals perform according to

    local rules and the overall behavior emerges organically from

    the interplay of the individuals of the swarm. Translated to the

    swarm robotics domain, individual robots exhibit a behavior

    that is based on a local rule set which can range from a simple

    reactive mapping between sensor inputs and actuator outputs

    to elaborate local algorithms. Typically, these local behaviors

    incorporate interactions with the physical world, including the

    environment and other robots (Floreano and Mattiussi, 2008).

    Each interaction consists of reading and interpreting the sensory

    data, processing this data, and driving the actuators accordingly.

    Such a sequence of interactions is deﬁned as basic behavior that

    is repeatedly executed, either indeﬁnitely or until a desired state

    is reached.

    In the following subsections, we classify and list the

    basic swarm behaviors which are adapted and expanded

    from Brambilla et al. (2013) with additional swarm robotic

    behaviors including collective localization, collective perception,

    synchronization,

    self-healing,

    and

    self-reproduction.

    The

    behaviors are explained from a high level view describing

    the

    task

    of

    individual

    robots

    and

    the

    resulting

    global

    objective achieved by the swarm. We do not detail on

    the sensing and actuation part which is speciﬁc to each

    robotic platform.

    2.1. Taxonomy

    The taxonomy of swarm behaviors is given in Figure 1. It is

    based on the classiﬁcation by Brambilla et al. (2013) which we

    extended by several categories. In the following, we ﬁrst give an

    overview of the taxonomy and then an in-detail description of

    the additional behavior categories in subsection 2.2. For these

    behaviors we also give the original inspiration. For a detailed

    description of the existing categories we kindly refer the reader

    to Brambilla et al. (2013).

    2.1.1. Spatial Organization

    These behaviors allow the movement of the robots in a swarm

    in the environment in order to spatially organize themselves

    or objects.

    • Aggregation moves the individual robots to congregate

    spatially in a speciﬁc region of the environment. This allows

    individuals of the swarm to get spatially close to each other for

    further interaction.

    • Pattern formation arranges the swarm of robots in a speciﬁc

    shape. A special case is chain formation where robots form a

    line, typically to establish multi-hop communication between

    two points.

    • Self-assembly connects the robots in order to establish

    structures.

    They

    can

    either

    be

    connected

    physically

    or

    virtually

    through

    communication

    links.

    A

    special

    case is morphogenesis where the swarm evolves into a

    predeﬁned shape.

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    FIGURE 1 | Taxonomy of swarm behaviors adapted from Brambilla et al. (2013). The
    highlighted behaviors are newly added.

    • Object clustering and assembly lets the swarm of robots

    manipulate spatially distributed objects. Clustering and

    assembling of objects is essential for construction processes.

    2.1.2. Navigation

    These behaviors allow the coordinated movement of a swarm of

    robots in the environment.

    • Collective exploration

    navigates

    the

    swarm

    of

    robots

    cooperatively

    through

    the

    environment

    in

    order

    to

    explore it. It can be used to get a situational overview,

    search for objects, monitor the environment, or establish a

    communication network.

    • Coordinated motion moves the swarm of robots in a

    formation. The formation can have a well-deﬁned shape, e.g.,

    a line, or be arbitrary as in ﬂocking.

    • Collective transport by the swarm of robots enables to

    collectively move objects which are too heavy or too large for

    individual robots.

    • Collective localization allows the robots in the swarm to

    ﬁnd their position and orientation relative to each other via

    establishment of a local coordinate system throughout the

    swarm. See section 2.2 for more details.

    2.1.3. Decision Making

    These behaviors allow the robots in a swarm to take a common

    choice on a given issue.

    • Consensus allows the individual robots in the swarm to

    agree on or converge toward a single common choice from

    several alternatives.

    • Task allocation assigns arising tasks dynamically to the

    individual robots of the swarm. Its goal is to maximize

    performance of the entire swarm system. If the robots

    have heterogeneous capabilities, the tasks can be distributed

    accordingly to further increase the system’s performance.

    • Collective fault detection within the swarm of robots

    determines deﬁciencies of individual robots. It allows to

    Schranz et al.

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    determine robots that deviate from the desired behavior of the

    swarm, e.g., due to hardware failures.

    • Collective perception combines the data locally sensed by the

    robots in the swarm into a big picture. It allows the swarm to

    make collective decisions in an informed way, e.g., to classify

    objects reliably, allocate an appropriate fraction of robots to a

    speciﬁc task, or to determine the optimal solution to a global

    problem. See section 2.2 for more details.

    • Synchronization aligns frequency and phase of oscillators of

    the robots in the swarm. Thereby, the robots have a common

    understanding of time which allows them to perform actions

    synchronously. See section 2.2 for more details.

    • Group size regulation allows the robots in the swarm to form

    groups of desired size. If the size of the swarm exceeds the

    desired group size, it splits into multiple groups.

    2.1.4. Miscellaneous

    There are further behaviors of swarm robots that ﬁt neither of the

    categories above.

    • Self-healing allows the swarm to recover from faults caused by

    deﬁciencies of individual robots. The goal is thus to minimize

    the impact of robot failure on the rest of the swarm to increase

    its reliability, robustness, and performance (see also collective

    fault detection above). See section 2.2 for more details.

    • Self-reproduction allows a swarm of robots either to create

    new robots or replicate the pattern created from many

    individuals. The goal is to increase the autonomy of the swarm

    by eliminating the need of a human engineer to create new

    robots. See section 2.2 for more details.

    • Human-swarm interaction allows humans to control the

    robots in the swarm or receive information from them. The

    interaction can happen remotely, e.g., through a computer

    terminal or proximal in a shared environment, e.g., through

    visual or acoustic clues.

    2.2. Detailed Description of Additional

    Swarm Behavior Categories

    In the following, we describe the additional categories of basic

    swarm behaviors with which we extended the taxonomy by

    Brambilla et al. (2013), namely: Collective localization, collective

    perception, synchronization, self-healing, and self-reproduction.

    2.2.1. Collective Localization

    Collective localization allows the robots in the swarm to ﬁnd their

    position and orientation relative to each other via establishment

    of a local coordinate system throughout the swarm.

    2.2.1.1. Sources of inspiration

    The approaches given below are engineered without any

    mentioned inspiration.

    2.2.1.2. Approaches

    There are two approaches which originate from the multi-robot

    research domain. First, creating a map of the environment and

    localizing relative to it. This approach is called simultaneous

    localization and mapping (SLAM). It can use and merge diﬀerent

    sources of information, such as range sensors or visual sensors.

    Second, using stationary landmarks with known positions

    and localizing relative to them. To avoid relying on external

    information, other robots can be used as landmarks. The robots

    can move alternatingly through the environment while keeping

    precise localization information. If the initial positions of the

    robots are known, then also absolute localization is possible.

    The dead-reckoning approach where robots use odometry for

    localization is another possibility but introduces an accumulating

    error which renders it useless for most scenarios.

    2.2.1.3. Results

    Thrun et al. (2000) present a mapping algorithm where multiple

    robots can localize in a globally fused map. It requires that the

    approximate initial positions of the robots are known by all

    other robots. It uses an incremental expectation maximization

    approach

    which

    allows

    robots

    to

    localize

    themselves

    in

    maps created by other robots. Experiments demonstrate that

    the robots can localize robustly in real time in large-scale

    environments using low-end computers. In the follow-up work,

    the requirement of known initial positions is relaxed, assuming

    that robots share an overlapping part of their explored maps

    (Thrun and Liu, 2005). It employs the concept of information

    ﬁlters that represents the robot positions by Gaussian Markov

    random ﬁelds. The robots are able to identify the correct

    alignments between diﬀerent local maps by maximizing the

    correspondence of similar-looking landmark conﬁgurations. Fox

    et al. (2000) present a belief-based approach for collaborative

    multi-robot localization. It fuses localization information from

    diﬀerent sources, such as odometry, environment measurements,

    and mutual robot detections by combining visual and range

    sensors. This allows to improve the robots’ belief of the world

    by learning the detection model from data using a maximum

    likelihood estimator. Experiments demonstrate that a team of

    robots is superior in localization compared to single robots

    with a relatively small communication overhead. Kurazume and

    Hirose (2000) propose the method of cooperative positioning

    using robots as landmarks. There are two groups of robots

    that move alternatingly while using the other, stationary group

    as localization reference. An increased number of robots also

    increases the redundancy of position information. With the

    weighted least square method this redundancy decreases the

    localization error. The authors perform experiments where the

    robots use range sensors to measure their respective positions.

    Results show that this localization method performs better than

    the dead reckoning method including environments with uneven

    terrain. Rekleitis et al. (2001) propose a method where robots

    visually observe each other to improve the dead reckoning

    localization. They propose two algorithms based on triangulation

    and trapezoidation for small and large-scale environments,

    respectively. They perform experiments with two robots where

    one robot carries markers and the other a camera. The results

    demonstrate that joint localization leads to much more robust

    localization than odometry alone. When more robots are used the

    localization precision is increased. Howard et al. (2003) propose

    a maximum likelihood method combined with a distributed

    numerical optimization to eliminate the need for landmark

    robots to be stationary. It combines range measurements with

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    odometry. Robots observe each others motion and exchange

    this information to create a graph consisting of their positions

    and respective observations. Experiments with four robots

    demonstrate that this method is able to localize with adequate

    precision, and is robust to changes in the environment and

    to ﬂawed odometry. Furthermore, robots are able to infer the

    position of other robots they have never seen before. Rubenstein

    et al. (2014b) apply the robot-landmark approach to a large

    swarm of 1,024 Kilobots. There are four pre-localized seed robots

    which deﬁne the coordinate system. The other robots localize

    relative to these seed robots using trilateration of infrared signals.

    The robots were able to self-assemble and let the swarm morph

    to a given shape.

    2.2.2. Collective Perception

    Collective perception combines the data locally sensed by the

    robots in the swarm into a big picture. It allows the swarm to

    make collective decisions in an informed way, e.g., to classify

    objects reliably, allocate an appropriate fraction of robots to

    a speciﬁc task, or to determine the optimal solution to a

    global problem.

    2.2.2.1. Sources of inspiration

    Many social insects are able to get a global view using only

    local information. Examples are honeybees that assess the

    current global workload balancing by evaluating simple cues like

    queuing delays (Ratnieks and Anderson, 1999) and ants that use

    pheromone trails to ﬁnd shortest paths in large environments

    (Goss et al., 1989; Hölldobler and Wilson, 1994).

    2.2.2.2. Approaches

    For collectively determining the type of object observed, the

    predominant approach is classiﬁcation of the object among a

    set of predeﬁned models. Sometimes, the mobility of the robots

    is used to improve the perception of individual robots. The

    robots use explicit communication in order to propagate their

    ﬁndings and achieve consensus. The way the robots exchange the

    information is an important aspect. They have to add contextual

    information that allows the other robots to correctly interpret the

    data. Furthermore, the information can be simply forwarded and

    thus spread in the swarm or modiﬁed in order, e.g., to measure

    the distance to a speciﬁc location. There are also approaches from

    other research domains, such as camera networks (Schranz and

    Rinner, 2015), but the agents are typically stationary and often

    centrally controlled.

    2.2.2.3. Results

    Ye et al. (2002) propose a strategy where sensing agents

    collect, analyze, and categorize data, enrich it with contextual

    information, and forward it to synthesizing agents. The latter

    are then able to use the diﬀerent aspects observed by the

    sensing agents to perceive events using an eigen-space method.

    Using simulation experiments, the authors demonstrate that

    events can be detected reliably using only the ﬁrst few eigen

    values. Kornienko et al. (2005) develop a swarm of micro-robots

    for a collective classiﬁcation task. Based on evidence theory,

    the swarm has to identify the geometries of objects in space

    by exchanging data from infrared depth sensing while having

    limited communication capabilities. Experiments show that a

    wrong belief of an individual quickly converges to the correct

    belief after exchanging only few messages. King and Breedon

    (2010) present a simple model of a hexagonal grid world in

    which a swarm has to diﬀerentiate between diﬀerently shaped

    objects. They show that an increased number of agents leads to an

    overproportional decrease of object detection time. Giusti et al.

    (2012) present an approach for cooperative gesture recognition

    with a robot swarm. Each robot processes and classiﬁes camera

    images locally. Using a distributed consensus protocol, the robots

    exchange their opinions over a low-bandwidth wireless channel

    to ﬁnd a common decision by exploiting the diﬀerent view points

    and mobility of the agents. The approach is evaluated through

    simulation and physical experiments on 13 robots. The results

    show that the recognition accuracy of the system scales eﬀectively

    with the number of agents and is robust to communication

    failures. Stegagno et al. (2014) develop a method that allows a

    swarm of robots with diﬀerent types of low resolution sensors

    to collectively classify objects. Each robot processes the sensor

    data locally and exchanges its estimation. Using the naive Bayes

    classiﬁer together with the information received from other

    robots, the swarm is able to robustly classify objects. The more

    diverse the sensors are, the better the results. Olfati-Saber and

    Jalalkamali (2012) present a theoretic framework that employs

    mobility to improve the information sensed by the swarm using

    the Kalman-consensus ﬁlter. It is employed to track a target

    with a swarm of agents. Each agent tries to improve its sensing

    while avoiding collisions with the others. Simulations show

    that this solution can eﬀectively track linear and non-linear

    maneuverable targets.

    Mazdin and Rinner (2019) present a method for simultaneous

    coverage of surfaces with a swarm of robots. This method

    assigns robots to diﬀerent view points in order to allow eﬀective

    3D reconstruction of objects. Simulation results show that this

    method is able to coordinate the robots while minimizing the

    mission duration and maximizing the coverage quality. Schmickl

    et al. (2007) compare diﬀerent communication strategies for

    collective perception of a swarm, namely the hop-count strategy

    and the trophallaxis-inspired strategy. The presented solutions

    allow a swarm to collectively compare sizes of target areas which

    are too large for individual robots to perceive. Simulations show

    that the robots are able to aggregate in the target areas while their

    numbers are proportional to the size of the target area. Mermoud

    and Evans (2010) tackle a similar problem in which robots

    should distinguish good and bad spots using models of chemical

    reaction networks. They perform experiments with ﬁve robots

    and demonstrate that robots with limited sensing capabilities can

    collectively achieve good performance.

    2.2.3. Synchronization

    Synchronization aligns frequency and phase of oscillators

    of the robots in the swarm. Thereby, the robots have a

    common understanding of time which allows them to perform

    actions synchronously.

    2.2.3.1. Sources of inspiration

    During courtship, males of certain animal species synchronize

    their behavior. In some ﬁreﬂy species, the phase diﬀerence

    between the blinking of male and female ﬂashing period

    Schranz et al.

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    is important for mating (Buck, 1988). Hence the ﬁreﬂies

    synchronize by inﬂuencing their ﬂashing phase. Likewise,

    bushcrickets synchronize or alternate using chirps by altering

    their chirp periods in response to other chirps (Hartbauer et al.,

    2005). Igoshin et al. (2001) develop a model that describes the

    spatio-temporal wave patterns observed from myxobacteria cells.

    There are many more examples of coupled oscillating systems,

    e.g., pacemaker cells in the heart (Peskin, 1975) or clapping of

    spectators in a theater (Néda et al., 2000).

    2.2.3.2. Approaches

    The oscillators are synchronized to the same frequency with

    the phases being aligned among the robots in the swarm. Two

    approaches exist, either the oscillators continuously inﬂuence

    each other to adjust phase and frequency, or they are pulse-

    coupled meaning that they regularly ﬁre a signal corresponding

    to their current phase. The latter one is mostly used as it requires

    fewer interactions between the robots. Robots interact either

    through acoustic, visual signals or radio communication.

    2.2.3.3. Results

    Hartbauer and Römer (2006) employ synchronized oscillators

    as a communication and navigation system. In a synchronized

    system, robots at a target area increase their frequency and

    thereby produce phase waves in the swarm that can be used

    by the robots to perform wave-front navigation, i.e., travel

    toward higher frequencies. The authors analyze the robustness

    of the system by simulating up to 300 robots. The results

    show that this communication system is robust to changes in

    signal strength, signaling period length, and communication

    obstacles. Nevertheless, the signaling period is an important

    parameter to be ﬁt to the scenario. They conclude that pulse-

    coupled oscillator synchronization is especially suited for swarms

    of robots as it has low hardware requirements in terms of

    communication range and processing power. Christensen et al.

    (2009) apply synchronization to detect faulty robots in the

    swarm. Using pulse-coupled oscillators and visual signaling, the

    swarm can determine malfunctioning robots when their phases

    are not aligned to the rest of the swarm. The authors develop

    a discrete model that can be applied to robots. Simulations

    with 100 robots show that robots synchronize faster when

    they are mobile, synchronization time is linearly proportional

    to the swarm size where denser networks synchronize faster,

    and synchronization is robust to communication obstacles

    but decreases in performance. Experiments with ten physical

    robots conﬁrm the simulation results, despite the inherent

    latencies associated with the sensor and actuator systems. In

    contrast to the bio-inspired approaches, Trianni and Nolﬁ (2009)

    synthesize synchronization strategies using artiﬁcial evolution.

    These strategies perform phase coupling between robots in order

    to allow synchronous movement. Simulations with up to 96

    robots show that the strategies scale well and are mainly limited

    by collision avoidance behaviors. This is conﬁrmed through

    experiments with up to three robots where sensor and actuator

    noise is introduced.

    Bezzo et al. (2014) synchronize robots in a swarm to determine

    the network topology and detect changes. They develop a strategy

    for estimating the degree of oscillator coupling in the swarm

    and synchronizing them continuously. Applying this strategy to

    formation control allows three simulated robots to move in a

    formation. Simulations with ﬁve robots show that the network

    topology can be detected reliably. Barci´s et al. (2019) apply

    the novel concept of swarmalators (O’Keeﬀe et al., 2017) to

    robots. This concept couples the oscillator phase with spatial

    location in such a way that they mutually inﬂuence each other.

    They modify the original model taking into account the discrete

    nature of robots. Simulations of 100 robots and experiments

    with 10 robots show that the spatio-temporal patterns can be

    performed in stationary and dynamic scenarios. Perez-Diaz et al.

    (2015) perform a case study to analyze how motion and sensing

    capabilities inﬂuence the synchronization capabilities of a robot

    swarm. By altering the ﬁeld of interaction (e.g., camera ﬁeld of

    view) and the speed at which the robots travel, the emergence of

    synchrony can be inﬂuenced. The robot speed inﬂuences the time

    until synchrony is reached whereas a narrow ﬁeld of interaction

    results in a low degree of synchronization. Furthermore, high

    robot densities limit the synchronization possibility due to signal

    occlusion and robot collisions.

    2.2.4. Self-Healing

    Self-healing allows the swarm to recover from faults caused by

    deﬁciencies of individual robots. The goal is to minimize the

    impact of robot failure on the rest of the swarm to increase its

    reliability, robustness, and performance. After detecting the fault,

    appropriate countermeasures must be taken.

    2.2.4.1. Sources of inspiration

    The immune system of vertebrates shows how biological systems

    protect complex organisms against diseases. This serves as

    inspiration for the artiﬁcial immune system (AIS). Timmis et al.

    (2010) give an overview of how AISs and swarm intelligence

    relate. They point out many similarities and conclude that

    both systems are complementary tools for solving complex

    engineering problems. Regeneration in biological systems allows

    animals to self-heal their body, e.g., salamanders, starﬁsh, and

    lizards are able to regenerate lost limbs (Wallace, 1981). Another

    prominent example is the morphallaxis, i.e., tissue regeneration

    of Cnidarian hydra Shimizu et al. (1993). It exhibits what is

    sometimes referred to as scalable self-healing: When the hydra

    is dissected, each part can self-heal into a fully functional and

    independent hydra where its size is proportional to the number

    of cells.

    2.2.4.2. Approaches

    There are two ways to tackle the problem of self-healing.

    First, healthy robots can aid the faulty robots in recovering. It

    requires an explicit failure management routine which is typically

    inspired by the immune system. Second, the swarm can adjust

    its behavior while ignoring failing robots. This does not require

    any special handling of the failure case. It is typically inspired by

    biological regeneration.

    2.2.4.3. Results

    As self-healing is a relatively challenging topic for swarm

    robotics, only few embodied studies exists and most work is

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    done through simulation experiments. Dai et al. (2006) present a

    model for detecting and healing software components of swarm

    robots. It is part of the NASA autonomous nano technology

    swarm (ANTS) concept mission (Vassev et al., 2012). This

    model is only partly distributed as it relies on a central cyber

    disease library. Each robot runs one or more virtual neurons as

    background processes. They monitor certain system variables,

    such as CPU, memory, or network usage. In case of anomalies,

    it freezes the process in question and reports its behavior to

    a higher-level controller. It can perform further diagnosis, e.g.,

    by assigning more neurons, and generate a prescription based

    on the cyber disease library. The prescription is applied by the

    executor process which reports back results. This allows the

    cyber disease library to learn and improve prescriptions. In

    case the prescription does not work, further escalation steps are

    possible, such as killing the faulty process or even rebooting the

    whole machine. A simulation case study shows that a memory

    leaking process is successfully detected and eventually killed.

    The results show that the system becomes more reliable and

    robust against failures and failure propagation. Even though

    faulty processes degrade the overall system performance, the

    performance improves compared to systems without the self-

    healing properties. Timmis et al. (2016) apply self-healing to

    overcome hardware failures. They present a solution that is

    inspired by granuloma formation, a process of containment and

    repair found in the immune system. They apply it to a swarm

    of robots performing ﬂocking and taxis toward a beacon. When

    a robot has a discharged battery and loss of mobility, it would

    anchor the whole swarm which would then fail to reach the

    beacon. The proposed solution allows energy sharing between

    healthy and faulty robots. The faulty robots signal their need

    of help to the other robots within range. Depending on the

    required energy and the energy available at the healthy robots,

    a varying number of robots surround the discharged robots to

    share energy. Other robots ignore this robot cluster and regard

    it simply as an obstacle, continuing their mission. Simulation

    experiments with 10 robots show that the granuloma formation

    algorithm works well even when half of the robots in the

    swarm are experiencing low energy levels. Other algorithms are

    compared where only the nearest healthy robots perform the

    healing. They fail to heal the swarm when three or more robots

    have a discharged battery.

    A broad body of research is directed toward pattern formation

    and morphogenesis in self-healing. Cheng et al. (2005) propose

    the SHAPEBUGS approach where agents evenly disperse within

    a predeﬁned shape. First, the agents perform trilateration to

    establish a common coordinate system. This is aided by allowing

    a few agents to know their initial position. Then the agents use

    the contained gas model to move in a way that they are equally

    spaced within the desired shape. In case of agent failure, the other

    agents simply adapt their positions to again reach an equilibrium

    density. The agent model contains a proximity sensor and

    wireless communication to exchange positions. It furthermore

    requires a compass to determine the global orientation of the

    agents. Simulations show that the swarm can self-repair and

    restabilize in cases of agent death or displacement. Furthermore,

    it can overcome large degrees of sensor and movement errors

    of the agents. Rubenstein and Shen (2008) relax some of these

    assumptions and still achieve similar results. The model diﬀers

    in that the robots build compact shapes. Thereby, the size of

    the shape varies rather than its density. The model requires only

    a single sensor for local information and communication. The

    shape is given to the robots as a potential ﬁeld where the robots

    aim to move to its center while avoiding collisions. The scale of

    the shape is calculated as function of the estimated swarm size.

    Additionally, each robot changes its color to a color that is pre-

    deﬁned depending on the position. Thereby, the robots can form

    colored patters or displays. When properly synchronized, they

    can even show time varying patterns. Simulation results show

    that the robots can perform scalable self-healing by recreating

    the desired shape for varying swarm sizes. In later work,

    Rubenstein et al. (2014b) demonstrate this on a large swarm

    of physical robots as described above. Arbuckle and Requicha

    (2010) propose a model where the robot swarm builds shapes

    by arranging on the boundaries of a polygon. They propose an

    external compilation process that uses the polygon to derive a

    set of parameterized local rules to be executed by a swarm of

    homogeneous, stateless robots. By attaching physically to each

    other, the robots can communicate directionally. The agents stay

    connected as long as they are communicating. By replying with

    predeﬁned messages, the state of the system is “externalized” in

    the circulating messages. By attaching to each other, the agents

    grow the edges of the polygon while randomly wandering robots

    “diﬀuse” into the interior of the polygon by replacing boundary

    robots that in turn move into the polygon interior. Simulation

    experiments show that the swarm can build simple polygons.

    It can heal from failures due to communication faults, such as

    dropping messages. Robots that do not communicate anymore,

    drop out of the shape and are replaced by new ones. If the

    shape is broken into two, the swarm creates two shapes with the

    original size.

    2.2.5. Self-Reproduction

    Self-reproduction allows a swarm of robots either to create new

    robots or replicate the pattern created from many individuals. In

    the ﬁrst case, the robots produce identical copies of themselves.

    The goal is to increase the autonomy of the swarm by eliminating

    the need of a human engineer to create new robots. In the second

    case, the robots copy a structure consisting of many individual

    robots. Existing approaches are not fully autonomous yet and

    typically require at least the building blocks to be provided to

    the swarm. In contrast to self-reconﬁguration of formed patterns,

    the goal of self-replication is to assemble a functional robot from

    passive components.

    2.2.5.1. Sources of inspiration

    All biological organisms possess the ability to reproduce, either

    sexually or asexually.

    2.2.5.2. Approaches

    The theory of self reproducing machines already exists for

    several decades, e.g., von Neumann (1966) introduced the idea

    of an automaton model for self-reproduction. The research in

    this direction followed the general idea of template-replicating

    systems, i.e., to create a new robot according to an existing

    model. Gross and Dorigo (2008) give an historic overview of

    the development in this direction. Other approaches follow the

    evolutionary design strategy. The existing approaches assume the

    robot hardware to be modular in order to have base building

    blocks (Yim et al., 2002). The ﬁner the modules, the more diﬃcult

    the process, but the more ﬂexibly a new robot can be created.

    2.2.5.3. Results

    Lipson and Pollack (2000) evolve the design for simple

    electromechanical systems through simulation experiments. The

    building blocks are bars and actuators that are connected through

    joints and controlled by artiﬁcial neurons. The performance of

    the evolved systems is measured in terms of the distance it is able

    to locomote. The best performing designs are fabricated using

    rapid, additive manufacturing technology. This process allows

    robots to design new robots with minimized human intervention.

    The manufactured robots are able to locomote similarly to

    the simulation models. Suthakorn et al. (2003) present a fully

    autonomous, self-replicating robot built from Lego parts. It

    assembles a new robot from four pre-assembled subsystems that

    hold together using magnets and shape-constraining blocks. The

    controller of the replica is already pre-programmed with the

    same program as the original. Experiments show that the original

    robot, which is guided by lines on the ground, is able to detect

    the subsystems and assemble them into a fully functional replica.

    Zykov et al. (2007) present the design of a modular robot cube,

    called Molecube. These cubes can attach to each other using

    electromagnets and hence form complex patterns. These cubes

    have one actuated degree of freedom to control the shape of the

    assembled pattern. The authors present experiments where the

    spatial patterns and corresponding controllers are both manually

    created and automatically designed with artiﬁcial evolution. The

    results show that the swarm of Molecubes reproduces identical

    copies of its pattern, both in simulation and physical experiments.

    The only human interaction is by providing enough Molecubes

    as building material. The authors conclude that the more units

    are involved and the simpler and more homogeneous they

    are, the more information is being reproduced by the system

    itself, as compared with information pre-existing in the parts

    and environment.

    3. SWARM APPLICATIONS

    Even though swarm robotics is a relatively young ﬁeld of research

    and has not been widely accepted in industry, this section is a

    ﬁrst collection of existing applications and attempts at swarm

    robotic products. Swarm robotic researchers have designed and

    developed a number of platforms to test and analyze swarm

    algorithms. In their publications the authors always stated their

    attempt to envision future industry applications (Sharkey, 2007)

    out of the simplicity of swarm robotic research platforms. Thus,

    we split our survey into swarm robotics research platforms

    (Table 1) and industrial projects and products (Table 2). The

    industrial projects and products are mainly listed to serve

    as application examples in real-world environments above a

    technology readiness level (TRL) of four (Héder, 2017) where

    the validation of the platform is already in the relevant

    environment. The research platforms enable researchers to

    verify, demonstrate, and experiment with swarm algorithms in

    laboratory environments, thus on a TRL of maximum four.

    Both, research platforms and industrial projects and products

    are categorized according to the environment they are used

    in: terrestrial, aerial, aquatic, and/or space. All tables list the

    type of the application, the project or product name, the

    type of robot, the number of robots in the swarm, and the

    basic swarm behaviors corresponding to the deﬁnitions of

    section 2. The type of robot corresponds to one of the following

    categories: unmanned ground vehicle (UGV), unmanned aerial

    vehicle (UAV), unmanned surface vehicle (USV), unmanned

    underwater vehicle (UUV), or in general as UxV. The number

    of research platforms used in a swarm is proven with speciﬁc

    research publication. For the industrial swarm applications we

    refer the reader to the project’s or product’s website for this

    information. For each research platform, industrial project and

    product we list one or more basic swarm behaviors because no

    project or product uses integral swarm algorithms. They rather

    use parts of the algorithms, and adapt them to the underlying

    application. Additionally, the table for the research platforms

    diﬀerentiates between open-source (in hardware and software)

    and/or commercially available. We do not classify the swarm

    robotic platforms and products related to their price, dimension,

    and number of usage in diﬀerent research/engineering projects.

    The focus of this collection is on basic swarm behaviors

    embodied on robots. Therefore, we only list projects or products

    that are based on a robotic platform. We neglect research

    projects that focus solely on swarms with a purely theoretical or

    virtual nature.

    3.1. Research Platforms

    This section presents research platforms that are developed for

    educational and scientiﬁc purposes, summarized in Table 1. They

    allow to investigate the application of swarm algorithms to

    robots. Note, that other sophisticated robotic research platforms

    exist which are not included, as they are not developed with the

    intention of using them in swarm applications, e.g., the Balboa

    robot kit1.

    3.1.1. Terrestrial

    The Kilobots swarm (Rubenstein et al., 2014a) is probably

    the best known swarm of robots developed for research and

    education. Kilobots are very small with a diameter of 33 mm, the

    locomotion is based on vibration motors and the communication

    is implemented using infrared light reﬂecting oﬀ the ground.

    They became very famous for their self-assembling capability

    forming diﬀerent shapes with a swarm of 1,024 Kilobots (Wyss

    Institute, 2017). The Kilobot is available open-source2 or

    commercially at K-Team3.

    Jasmine is another widely used swarm robotic platform.

    recharge autonomously using a charging station. The robots in

    the swarm communicate using either IR or radio. The Khepera

    IV (Soares et al., 2016) is designed for any indoor lab application.

    A Linux core, color camera, WLAN, Bluetooth, USB Host,

    accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, loudspeaker, three top

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    robotic platform used in the Robotarium12 at Georgia Tech,

    Atlanta. The Robotarium provides remote access to a large team

    of robots. Scholars can upload code to run experiments remotely

    to collect data. Features like automatic registration of robots

    with a server, autonomous charging, wireless code upload to the

    robots, and automatic sensor calibration makes the Robotarium

    attractive for remote research experiments. All these platforms

    use wheels for their locomotion and a set of diﬀerent sensors,

    including distance and light sensors.

    The e-puck robot (Mondada et al., 2009), and its successor

    e-puck2, are designed as educational and research robots to

    make it easy to program and control the robots’ behaviors. It

    uses diverse sensors, e.g., infrared proximity sensors, a CMOS

    camera, and a microphone. The e-puck is available open-source13

    or commercially at GCtronic14. The Xpuck is an extension of

    the e-puck in terms of aggregate raw processing power (as used

    in modern mobile system-on-chip devices) of two teraﬂops.

    Thus, higher-individual robot computation can be achieved, e.g.,

    image processing using the ArUco Marker tracking (Jones et al.,

    2018). The Thymio II robot (Riedo et al., 2013) targets the

    understanding of programming and robotic concepts using a

    wide range of sensors, including temperature, infrared distance,

    accelerometer, and microphone. Programming can be done in

    Blocky using visual or text-based programming. The Thymio

    II is available both open-source and commercially at Thymio15.

    A recent platform for open-source16 swarm robotics education

    and research purposes is called Pheeno (Wilson et al., 2016).

    The user can adapt the platform with custom modules in three

    degrees of freedom. To interact with the environment it uses

    IR sensors. The Spiderino platform (Jdeed et al., 2017) is a six-

    legged open-source17 robot with spider-like locomotion. It is

    based on a hexpod toy that is enhanced by a PCB including an

    Arduino microcontroller, a WLAN module, and several reﬂective

    infrared sensors.

    The

    goal

    of

    the

    I-Swarm

    (Intelligent

    Small-World

    Autonomous

    Robots

    for

    Micro-manipulation)

    project

    is

    the development of micro robots to form a swarm. The robot

    has a small size of only 3 × 3 × 3 mm3, is solar powered

    without

    battery, performs

    locomotion

    via

    vibration,

    and

    communication via infrared transceivers (Seyfried et al., 2004).

    It has been developed with the goal to build a swarm of 1,000

    robots (Seyfried et al., 2004). Prototypes of this robot can be seen

    in the technical museum in Munich, Germany.

    The idea behind the open-source swarm robotics platform

    Zooids18 is diﬀerent: It handles both the interaction and

    the display, and thus oﬀers a new class of human-computer

    interfaces. The swarm is controlled via light patterns projected

    using an overhead projector (Le Goc et al., 2016). The APIS19

    (Adaptable Platform for Interactive Swarm) comprises several

    components: the swarm robotic platforms, the infrastructure and

    test environment for the swarm, and the software infrastructure

    and simulation (Dhanaraj et al., 2019). The focus are experiments

    related to human-swarm interaction. For these interactions,

    additionally to sensors, the platform is equipped with an OLED

    display and a buzzer. The Wanda (Kettler et al., 2012) swarm

    robotic platform has a special assembly that could be used, e.g., to

    clean up the environment with a swarm. In addition, the authors

    implemented a whole tool chain especially for these robots from

    design and simulation to deployment.

    The Droplet (Klingner et al., 2014) is another swarm robotic

    platform for teaching and research. It is a spherical robot which

    is able to organize into complex shapes with its neighbors by

    using vibration locomotion. It charges and communicates via

    a powered ﬂoor that is equipped with alternating stripes of

    positive charge and ground. It is available as an open-source

    project20. The Swarm-bots (Mondada et al., 2002; Groß et al.,

    2006) can conﬁgure themselves to diﬀerent geometric 3D shapes.

    The robots are constructed by a number of simpler, insect-

    like robots, which are built of relatively cheap components (the

    design is open-source21). A swarm of these robots is capable of

    self-assembling and self-organizing to adapt to its environment.

    With this assembling capability the swarm is able to transport

    objects that would be too heavy for the individual robots. The

    successor of the Swarm-bots project is the Swarmanoid project,

    which represented the very ﬁrst attempt to study the integrated

    design, development, and control of a heterogeneous open-

    source22 swarm robotics system. The swarm in the Swarmanoid

    project covers autonomous robots of three types (each with an

    additional set of sensors): eye-bots (UAVs that can attach to an

    indoor ceiling), hand-bots (UGVs capable of climbing), and foot-

    bots (UGVs capable of self-assembling) (Dorigo et al., 2013).

    The Termes robots (Petersen et al., 2011) collaborate without

    communication or GPS localization to create large structures

    using modular blocks. The underlying concept is stigmergy and

    is inspired by the way termites build their nests in nature. The

    Termes robots are block-carrying climbing robots that can create

    these structures in unstructured environments. Symbrion and

    Replicator (Kernbach et al., 2008) are two sister projects, that

    develop autonomous platforms for usage in swarms. They can be

    operated either individually or form special patterns by physically

    connecting to each other. The main goal of these projects is to

    create a road-map of how to achieve the evolvability of robot

    organisms. PolyBots (Duﬀ et al., 2001) are self-reconﬁgurable

    robots. Various types of locomotion capabilities and object

    manipulation modules are interchangeable that allow to form a

    number of shapes, e.g., an earthworm type to slither through

    obstacles, or a spider to stride over hilly terrain. These robots

    ﬁnd their application if the environment is unknown or if robots

    need to perform multiple tasks. Further modular robots that

    allow self-conﬁguration with similar robotic technologies include

    et al., 2010), Molecube (Zykov et al., 2007), but to name a few25.

    3.1.2. Aerial

    There are several miniature and micro UAVs which form a good

    basis for a swarm system of inexpensive robots for research

    and education. An overview of such small-scale UAVs can be

    found in the publications by Cai et al. (2014) and Swetha

    et al. (2018). Although multiple oﬀ-the-shelf Micro Air Vehicles

    (MAVs) exist and are quite popular in the games industry, and

    in businesses for video- and photography, they typically have

    closed ﬂight controllers that do not allow to develop custom

    algorithms (e.g., Qualcomm Flight Pro26, DJI M10027). One UAV

    designed speciﬁcally for usage in swarms is the MAV presented

    by Roberts et al. (2007). The MAVs are equipped with three

    rate gyroscopes, three accelerometers, one ultrasonic sensor,

    and four infrared sensors. It has been developed within the

    Swarmanoid project (Dorigo et al., 2013). A very distinct research

    platform is the Distributed Flight Array (Oung and D’Andrea,

    2011). Each UAV makes up a module of a larger array and has

    a single rotor only. The modules self-assemble into a multi-

    rotor system where all vehicles must cooperate for coordinated

    ﬂight. To facilitate this, they exchange information among

    each other and adjust local parameters. With the Crazyﬂies,

    available both open-source and commercially at bitcraze28, a

    swarm of UAVs can be realized indoors. They use multiple

    sensors, e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and a high

    precision pressure sensor (Preiss et al., 2017). Their low weight

    of 27 g allows experiments with reduced danger for humans.

    The Crazyﬂie’s localization relies on external tracking systems,

    such as OptiTrack29. Another indoor swarm can be build with

    the FINken-III (Heckert, 2016)30 and its predecessors. They

    use optical ﬂow, infrared distance, and a tower of four sonar

    ranging sensors.

    3.1.3. Aquatic

    In the CoCoRo (Collective Cognitive Robotics) project (Schmickl

    et al., 2011) a swarm of 41 heterogeneous UUVs has been

    developed. There are three types of vehicles: A base station USV,

    an exploration UUV, and UUV for relaying information between

    the explorers and the base station. Communication is performed

    with sonar and electric ﬁelds. The main applications envisioned

    are environmental monitoring, measuring water pollution and

    eﬀects of global warming. The UUV Monsun (Osterloh et al.,

    Drones for Maritime Tasks) (Christensen et al., 2015) is a

    project that develops swarms of USVs. Envisioned applications

    are environmental monitoring, sea life localization, and sea

    border patrolling. The platforms are available open-source31

    and can execute swarm algorithms generated using evolutionary

    computation (Duarte et al., 2016).

    3.1.4. Outer Space

    For space exploration, NASA has developed Swarmies32 to collect

    material samples, such as water, ice, or useful minerals on Mars.

    This application is referred to as in-situ resource utilization

    (ISRU). Simultaneously, NASA launched a swarmathon33 to

    entice students to develop swarm algorithms based on ant

    foraging. In an experiment 20 Swarmies could travel 42 km of

    linear distance in 8 h. The same distance was covered by Mars

    rover Opportunity in 11 years. Another innovative project was

    accepted by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC)

    program. The objective is to increase Mars exploration using

    a swarm of Marsbees (Kang, 2018). These are robotic ﬂapping

    wing ﬂyer the size of a bumblebee. They are to self-explore the

    environment and use the Mars rover Opportunity as base and

    charging station. During the NIAC funding, a concept for the

    technical implementation of the ﬂapping ﬂyer using insect-like

    wings will be proposed.

    3.2. Industrial Projects and Products

    3.2.1. Terrestrial

    One of the biggest challenges in agriculture is the increasing

    demand for food production (Tilman et al., 2011). SwarmFarm

    Robotics34 is a company that provides farmers with swarms of

    agricultural UGVs—the SwarmBot3.0. They work cooperatively,

    but follow a centrally planned schedule. Before starting the

    mission, a given ﬁeld is decomposed into smaller cells which are

    then allocated to the vehicles (Ball et al., 2015). The swarm’s tasks

    are diverse, but involve planting, applying fertilizer, eliminating

    weeds and insects, irrigation, and harvesting. A similar project

    is addressed by the Fendt company with the UGV Xaver35. Each

    Xaver is a battery-operated planting UGV that operates cloud-

    controlled and collaborates with the other UGVs in the swarm in

    terms of a centrally planned seeding plan (Blender et al., 2016).

    The series production of the robots started with the EU-project

    MARS (Mobile Agricultural Robot Swarms).

    released that severely impair human senses. The robots warn of

    toxic chemicals, provide and maintain mobile communication

    links, infer localization information, and assist in searching.

    They can generate a formation and navigate while keeping this

    formation using so-called social potential ﬁelds. All tasks can

    be achieved without central control, and some of the behaviors

    can be performed without explicit communication between

    the robots.

    Ocado (Telegraph, 2018) is an automated warehouse that uses

    a swarm of homogeneous cuboid UGVs. Grocery orders are

    assembled and dispatched using 1,100 collaborative robots. The

    robots collect ordered crates of food from stacks beneath a huge

    metal grid organized like a chess grid and deliver them to chutes,

    where human workers put the customer orders together. As the

    crates are organized in piles, the robots assist each other to lift

    out the ones standing in the way. They are operated in bursts to

    ensure breaks for charging. The robots are controlled centrally

    by a cloud server. Data is transmitted between the robots and the

    cloud using cellular technology. The cloud server handles the vast

    amount of data to coordinate the robots using machine learning

    approaches. The biggest player for robot swarms in warehouses is

    Amazon using the Kiva robot system (Brown, 2018). It uses up to

    100,000 robots worldwide to move shelf towers in its warehouses.

    The robots use motion sensors to recognize other robots or

    shelves in their way. To ﬁnd their way to the human workers who

    assemble the customer orders, they use visual tags on the ground

    of the warehouse to localize and navigate using the A* algorithm.

    The dispatching is organized centrally and communicated to

    the robots using WLAN. Robots drive to a charging station

    automatically in case of low power. A very similar system is used,

    among others, by the retailer Alibaba (Pickering, 2017).

    The

    SWILT

    (Swarm

    Intelligence

    Layer

    to

    Control

    Autonomous Agents) project (Khatmi et al., 2019)36 takes

    another approach to modeling UxV. The project focuses on

    industrial plants in the semi-conductor industry with a high-

    product mix (about 1,500 diﬀerent products), where the swarm is

    made up of lots, machines, and other equipment. The innovation

    in SWILT is to apply nature-inspired behaviors extracted from

    swarm intelligence algorithms to the individuals of the swarm

    instead of pre-calculating global schedules or routing tables.

    The main diﬀerence to traditional methods, such as linear

    optimization is that feasible, global solutions emerge from

    local behavior.

    3.2.2. Aerial

    Swarm missions in the air are typically covered by UAVs, and

    can be used for diﬀerent applications. For example, military

    applications are represented by the OFFSET (OFFensive Swarm-

    Enabled Tactics) project (Chung, 2017). The main idea of this

    project is to enhance reconnaissance with UAVs and UGVs inside

    cities. The applied robots should identify threats using more than

    100 diﬀerent swarm tactics in a game-based environment. The

    United States Air Force (USAF) works on a swarm of 250 UAVs

    that is able to perform a 6-h mission for the reconnaissance of

    eight city blocks. Another swarm of UAVs in military applications

    36SWILT website: https://swilt.aau.at/

    is funded by the Pentagon: the Perdix drone (Mizokami, 2017). A

    swarm of 103 Perdix UAVs is released from three F/A-18 Super

    Hornets. The swarm of Perdix drones is able to perform four

    diﬀerent missions, including hovering over a target, or forming

    a 100-m-wide circle in the sky. Their swarms have no central

    control, no leader, adapt to UAVs entering or exiting the team,

    are not pre-programmed, make collective-decisions, and can ﬂy

    in formation. Typical military applications include surveillance

    missions and targeted assassinations.

    The SMAVNET (Swarming Micro Air Vehicle Network)

    project (Hauert et al., 2009) belongs to the application

    domain of emergency and rescue. A swarm of autonomous

    MAVs is developed to deploy and manage an ad-hoc WLAN

    network (Varga et al., 2015). The application is to connect and

    coordinate rescue teams. Another aim is the exploration of

    disaster sites, with the goal of localizing victims and directing

    rescuers toward them. In the project SWARMIX37 they form

    a swarm of heterogeneous agents (humans, dogs, UAVs) that

    work cooperatively in a search and rescue mission (Flushing

    et al., 2014). Similar goals related to search and rescue were

    achieved in the CPSwarm project38, although the focus was

    on developing a toolchain for CPS swarm design, modeling,

    simulation, and deployment.

    For agriculture, the SAGA (Swarm Robotics for Agricultural

    Applications) project39 targets a distributed monitoring and

    mapping scenario using a swarm of UAVs, which is a novelty

    in smart farming (Albani et al., 2019). The ﬁtness of the

    swarm is measured as a trade-oﬀ between exploration and

    weed recognition time. An on-board vision system is used to

    detect weeds.

    Nowadays, entertainment in terms of light shows is a

    very attractive application for swarms of UAVs. The UAVs

    are equipped with LED lights and perform diﬀerent pattern

    formations creating a free-form display light show, typically

    accompanied by music. Most providers, like Spaxels40, Flyﬁre41,

    Ehang42, Intel (Barrett, 2018), and Lucie micro drone43 have

    central solutions: the “swarm” of up to around 1,000 UAVs is

    controlled centrally and follows pre-planned patterns.

    3.2.3. Aquatic

    Environmental

    monitoring

    is

    a

    common

    application

    for

    swarms in aquatic missions. Platypus (Jeradi et al., 2015) sells

    autonomous swarm robotic boats, so-called USVs, to measure

    and monitor water quality. They provide dense maps of deﬁned

    bodies of water to give a comprehensive picture of the water

    quality including salinity and oxygen stratiﬁcation. Diﬀerent

    platforms are used depending on the scale and type of the

    body of water. The boats perform centrally planned collective

    exploration and interact with the human operator using team

    oriented planning (Farinelli et al., 2017). Another example is the

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    Apium Data Diver44. It is a prototype vehicle built for operations

    in swarms on surface and under water. It is able to dive to a

    maximum depth of 100 m and has multiple sensors on board

    including temperature, pressure, and GPS. Possible applications

    include oceanography, aquaculture, hydrographic survey, and

    defense. The Data Diver swarm can receive high level commands

    from a human operator for navigating to a target and forming

    speciﬁc patterns (MacCready, 2015). Further autonomous UUVs

    were developed by Hydromea45. Their swarm of UUVs, the so-

    called Vertex swarm, is able to take water quality measurements

    at many locations simultaneously down to a depth of 300 m and

    create 3D data sets with high spatial and temporal resolution

    much faster than traditional methods. The small size of the

    UUVs allows for their application, e.g., under ice, in protected

    areas, underground water caverns, and storage tanks. The UUVs

    are able to localize in the swarm using acoustic triangulation.

    Using this positioning information, they form an underwater

    ad-hoc communication network (Schill et al., 2016). The main

    goal of the SWARMs (Smart Networking Underwater Robots

    in Cooperation Meshes) project (Real-Arce et al., 2016)46 is to

    make underwater and surface vehicles more accessible and useful

    for maritime and oﬀshore operations. The aim is to extensively

    use maritime vehicles instead of professional divers for the

    typically dangerous oﬀshore operations. SWARMs mainly works

    on the design and development of a set of software and hardware

    components to incorporate them into the current generation of

    maritime vehicles. This helps to improve autonomy, cooperation,

    robustness,

    cost-eﬀectiveness,

    and

    reliability.

    Exemplary

    applications of SWARMs comprise among others: corrosion

    prevention in oﬀshore installations, monitoring of chemical

    pollution, and tracking of plumes. A major research focus lies on

    reliable underwater communication (Rodríguez-Molina et al.,

    2017) leveraging topology control (Li et al., 2017).

    Another application in aquatic environments is military. The

    software kit CARACaS (Control Architecture for Robotic Agent

    Command and Sensing), initially developed by NASA for the

    Mars rover, has been adapted by the Oﬃce of Naval Research

    (ONR). This technology allows autonomous operation of US

    Navy boats where these USVs interact with each other (Smalley,

    2016). These characteristics allow the swarm of USVs to choose

    their own routes, to intercept enemy vessels as a swarm, and

    to escort and protect naval assets. To support changes in the

    swarm, CARACaS allows to re-plan and distribute new task

    lists. The ﬁrst successful demo in 2014 has been held on the

    James River in Virginia, where CARACaS was installed on

    multiple rigid-hulled inﬂatable boats. The main application has

    been demonstrated during the Safe Harbor mission (Hsu, 2016).

    The project subCULTron (Submarine Cultures Perform Long-

    Term Robotic Exploration of Unconventional Environmental

    Niches)47 uses the results of the CoCoRo project (described in the

    previous section Research Platforms) to deploy and test a swarm

    of UUVs in the Venetian Lagoon in Italy to evaluate the learning,

    3.2.4. Terrestrial/Aerial/Aquatic

    The

    project

    ROBORDER

    (Autonomous

    Swarm

    of

    Heterogeneous Robots for Border Surveillance)48 employs

    an autonomous swarm of heterogeneous robots (UGV, UAV,

    USV) equipped with multimodal sensors for sea and land

    border surveillance. Their aim is to detect and identify criminal

    activities in a vast heterogeneity of threats. The main objective

    of this project is to incorporate multimodal, statically networked

    sensors in a swarm of robots.

    The

    project

    BugWright249

    focuses

    on

    service

    and

    maintenance of large ships. This includes hull cleaning and

    inspection. Typically, this induces high costs. Therefore, the

    project’s objective lies in the deployment of diﬀerent cooperating

    UxV swarms (UGV, UAV, UUV) for a detailed multi-robot visual

    and acoustic inspection of the hull structure, detecting corrosion

    patches, and cleaning the surface where necessary.

    Sentien Robotics50 develops UGVs and UAVs to serve the

    needs of surveillance, environmental monitoring, infrastructure

    inspection, and national security. The company develops

    scalable swarm intelligence software, sensor data processing

    algorithms, and robot hardware. It furthermore develops a

    system for automatic launching and recovering of multiple

    UAVs (Borko, 2016).

    3.2.5. Outer Space

    Two swarms of satellites are currently in Earth orbit for space

    exploration: Swarm (Agency, 2004) and Cluster II (Escoubet

    et al., 2001). Swarm has been launched in 2013 and consists

    of three identical satellites, each 9 m long, and placed into two

    diﬀerent polar orbits: two side by side at an altitude of 450 km

    and a third at an altitude of 530 km. Their primary task is to study

    the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Cluster II has been launched in 2000

    and consists of four identical, cylindrical (2.9 × 1.3 m) spacecraft

    ﬂying in a tetrahedral formation. Their task is to study the impact

    of the Sun’s activity on the Earth’s space environment. This is the

    ﬁrst time a mission is able to provide three-dimensional data on

    the inﬂuence of the solar wind on the Earth’s magnetosphere.

    3.3. Discussion

    In the above sections we provided an overview of currently

    available industrial projects and products in the area of swarm

    robotics as well as research platforms for swarm robotics. This

    provides researchers and engineers in the domain of swarm

    robotics a comprehensive overview of current work, existing

    products, ongoing projects, and available research platforms.

    From this overview it can be seen that swarm robotic applications

    are still rare nowadays. Often, the swarm size depends on the

    number of robots that companies or research agencies have

    in stock, and are not always selected according to the desired

    swarm behavior. Although research has been going on for

    Schranz et al.

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    several decades, a breakthrough of swarm robotics, especially for

    industrial applications, has not yet occurred.

    This is because there are still several open issues. First

    of all, the dependability of the robot swarm is a concern.

    Natural swarms work with the assumption that individual swarm

    members might fail. In engineered swarms, high reliability

    and availability is desired in order to provide a working

    system. Failure of individual swarm members can increase the

    operational cost and can lead to safety issues, especially for UAVs.

    Swarm behaviors with their emergent characteristics executed by

    autonomous robots relying on distributed information cannot

    give the required guarantees on safety, security, and availability.

    Therefore, many industrial projects still rely on centralized

    control, e.g., in the agriculture and warehouse applications of

    section 3.2.1, or the entertainment applications in section 3.2.2.

    In these projects, the term swarm is solely used to imply

    the high number of agents. The implementations neglect the

    principal idea of swarm robotics which is distributed decision

    making that leads to self-organized behavior. Even though the

    robots have the ability to identify their environment, gather

    data locally, and communicate this data with the rest of the

    swarm, they rely on a central unit. This central unit either pre-

    deﬁnes the behavior of each individual robot or, in more dynamic

    scenarios, processes the information received from the robots

    to control their behavior. The issue of safety and security is

    addressed in research projects like SAGA (Albani et al., 2019),

    SWILT (Khatmi et al., 2019), and CPSwarm (Bagnato et al., 2017).

    In these projects additional routines are deﬁned that allow to stop

    individual swarm members or the entire self-organized swarm to

    prevent harm to humans or other machines. This is achieved by

    running multiple processes in parallel to react to certain events.

    For example, sensor data or emergency stop signals by a human

    operator can be processed in parallel to the behavior algorithm in

    order to immediately stop any movement of the swarm members.

    These emergency processes provide a deterministic behavior as

    opposed to the normal run time behavior. The safety issues

    are less critical in aquatic environments. The USVs and UUVs

    described in section 3.2.3 are able to perform fully autonomous

    exploration and localization. Compared to terrestrial or aerial

    environments, the possibility of harming humans is relatively

    low. Though, harm to the environment or animals is not taken

    into account.

    Another issue is the communication within the swarm

    and between the swarm and a central unit commanding and

    controlling station. For a swarm to work fully autonomously,

    it should provide its own means of communication. This

    is achieved by ad-hoc WLAN networks typically employed

    in emergency and rescue scenarios (see section 3.2.2). Such

    communication networks have a limited range and are less

    stable since they can break down when individual robots fail

    or move out of range. An infrastructure-based network, such

    as a cellular network, can provide more stable communication

    but it requires the installation of base stations. While this is

    typically available for terrestrial or areal environments, this

    does not work for space or aquatic missions. Especially in

    aquatic missions, commonly used radio communication does not

    work due to the high attenuation of water (Rodríguez-Molina

    et al., 2017). Therefore, robot swarms in such environments

    must use less researched technologies, such as sound or

    electric ﬁeld communication that have lower throughput (see

    section 3.1.3). Besides the technological limitations, an important

    issue when communicating is security. This is of special

    interest in military applications (section 3.2.2). First, information

    exchanged between robots could be sensitive and should not be

    disclosed to hostile parties. Second, the behavior of a swarm could

    be inﬂuenced based on the information the swarm members

    receive. This means that the behavior of a swarm could be

    inﬂuenced by altering the messages exchanged between robots

    or injecting false information in the swarm. Therefore, the

    communication in the swarm needs to be encrypted and swarm

    members must authenticate against each other in order to

    provide reliable behavior. This is especially important when a

    central station sends commands to control the swarm.

    Compared to the industrial projects and products, the swarm

    robotic research shows swarm behaviors close to the natural

    swarm inspiration that relies on distributed control. Generally,

    the research platforms’ hardware design technologically follows

    the inspiration from nature as it is small and cheap. They

    typically use simple and reduced microcontrollers, such as the

    Arduino. In terms of other hardware characteristics, they are

    quite diverse. Especially the UGVs show diﬀerent types of

    locomotion, e.g., the Kilobots (Rubenstein et al., 2014a) use

    vibration, the Spiderino (Jdeed et al., 2017) is a six-legged robot,

    and the AMiR (Arvin et al., 2009) and its successors use wheels.

    Furthermore, they show diﬀerent types of communication, e.g.,

    the Kilobots (Rubenstein et al., 2014a) use reﬂecting light, the

    I-Swarm (Seyfried et al., 2004) uses infrared, and the Khepera

    IV (Soares et al., 2016) uses WLAN. Additionally, diﬀerent

    types of power sources are used, e.g., batteries (which are most

    common) and solar cells for the I-Swarm (Seyfried et al., 2004).

    Besides the diverse actuators, they oﬀer a number of diﬀerent

    sensors that can be used for diﬀerent swarm behaviors to

    interact with the environment. As outlined by the authors, these

    platforms are mainly used for research. So, most circuit designs

    are published open-source online. Partially, these platforms

    are speciﬁcally dedicated for educational use. For example,

    the Thymio (Riedo et al., 2013) is oﬀered online with a lot

    of diverse educational material51 and the Spiderino (Jdeed

    et al., 2017) is oﬀered as part of workshops to pupils in the

    eduLab (Pitschmann, 2019).

    With all these available components on the swarm robotic

    research platforms, it is possible to test and evaluate swarm

    intelligence algorithms. This is not restricted to the software

    side but includes also the hardware needed to interact with

    the environment. This allows to draw ﬁrst conclusions on

    the emergence of swarm behaviors and required hardware

    in laboratory environments. Nevertheless, the step from these

    research platforms to a signiﬁcant number of applications or

    industrial products has not been achieved yet.

    Nevertheless, there is already a paradigm shift in the industry.

    Several companies in diﬀerent domains envision self-organizing

    solutions to the increasingly high complexity of their production

    Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Applications

    plants and activities in dynamic environments. Such industry

    projects are, e.g., SWILT, ROBORDER, and BugWright2. This

    establishes an opportunity for researchers in swarm robotics

    and swarm intelligence to get their ideas out of the lab and

    into a speciﬁc application. The main issue here is to map the

    swarm members onto the components of an existing system

    and to engineer their behavior with respect to the target

    application. In the SWILT project, swarm members are machines,

    products, or lots. They must fulﬁll certain conditions, e.g.,

    having computational resources to exhibit local intelligence.

    Nevertheless, real-world scenarios typically go beyond swarm

    robotics and fall into the area of swarms of cyber-physical

    systems. The most promising applications are in domains

    where it is impossible or too dangerous for humans to enter,

    the environment is unknown, or the real-time requirements

    are too restrictive to pre-compute globally optimal solutions.

    Speciﬁc examples could be the exploration of the deep sea,

    space, or celestial bodies, environmental monitoring, smart traﬃc

    concepts, or nano medicine. These visionary applications are

    further detailed by Schranz et al. (2020). To implement solutions

    in such environments, new methods, technologies, and visions

    are required in order to shift swarm intelligence from swarm

    robotic research platforms to swarm robotic products.

    4. CONCLUSION

    Research on swarm algorithms is a relatively young topic.

    Despite the large number of swarm algorithms, the transition to

    industry and industrial production, not to mention daily use, has

    not been made successfully. Nevertheless, several steps toward

    swarm applications have already been taken. The main objective

    of this paper is to motivate future research and engineering

    activities by providing a comprehensive list of existing platforms,

    projects and products as a starting point for applied research in

    swarm robotics.

    This paper classiﬁes basic swarm behaviors and presents

    a comprehensive overview of current research platforms and

    industrial applications. While this demonstrates the possibility

    of integrating basic swarm behaviors in current applications, it

    also shows that many applications of swarm robotics cannot fully

    exploit the advantages oﬀered by distributed swarm architectures

    due to systems with only few agents or central control. Swarm

    algorithms build upon self-organized swarm behaviors, e.g.,

    observed in natural swarm systems, such as insect colonies or

    ﬂocks of birds that are able to handle extremely diverse and

    dynamic environments. The same holds for robot swarms. They

    are meant to operate in the physical world, which typically

    faces continual dynamic changes and must cope with events

    and external conditions that are hard to predict or model.

    Besides huge potential for applications in areas like logistics,

    agriculture, and inspection, one suitable working environment

    for swarms are places that are unsuitable for humans, including

    places that are hard to reach, dangerous, or dirty. Applications

    in these environments could help to better observe, understand

    and exploit the advantages of swarm behaviors: adaptability,

    robustness, and scalability.

    In addition to industrial applications, we have also surveyed

    diﬀerent research hardware platforms dedicated to swarm

    robotic experiments. On the one hand, this overview allows

    to choose an appropriate research platform for implementing

    and testing swarm algorithms in laboratory environments. On

    the other hand, it shows that there is a huge potential in

    research to transform these platforms from pure prototyping

    platforms to productive, industrial robotic systems that are

    able to perform in the real world. This might require to shift

    from the current simpliﬁed robot models and controls to a

    trade-oﬀ between simplicity of design and capability of solving

    complex tasks in a reliable way, e.g., from reduced resource

    consumption to a more intensive usage of sensor data and

    information sharing.

    Outline Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Smart
    agriculture techniques have recently seen widespread interest by farmers. This
    is driven by several factors, which include the widespread availability of economically-priced,
    low-powered Internet of Things (IoT) based wireless sensors to remotely monitor
    and report conditions of the field, climate, and crops. This enables efficient
    management of resources like minimizing water requirements for irrigation and
    minimizing the use of toxic pesticides. Furthermore, the recent boom in Artificial
    Intelligence can enable farmers to deploy autonomous farming machinery and make
    better predictions of the future based on present and past conditions to minimize
    crop diseases and pest infestation. Together these two enabling technologies have
    revolutionized conventional agriculture practices. This survey paper provides:

    report by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Program (WWAP), the world’s population
    will increase by 33% in 2050, doubling the need for food and water [1]. This will
    have serious consequences for the whole world, especially the developing nations.
    Amongst the ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) technology, smart agriculture
    is one the most important emerging application, as shown in Fig. 1. Smart Agriculture
    Techniques [2], [3] have recently seen widespread interest by farmers and researchers
    alike to meet increased food demands. FIGURE 1. Block diagram showing IoT based
    emerging smart applications. Show All Smart Agriculture Systems (SAS) are driven
    by several key factors, which include the adoption of IoT technologies for remote,
    unmanned monitoring of the agriculture fields and taking corrective actions to
    make the environment most conducive for crop growth. SAS depends on a combination
    of hardware and software technologies for optimum benefits. The hardware side
    is now well supported by the availability of inexpensive, portable, power-efficient
    hardware with wireless connectivity, which enables their deployment in large numbers
    across vast indoor and outdoor agriculture fields. Rugged hardware modules may
    be installed underground to measure soil conditions, while others may withstand
    harsh climate conditions such as sunlight, rain, and extreme humidity. Other specialized
    hardware includes Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), which can process large amounts
    of data gathered by these modules as dictated by software-based Artificial Intelligence
    (AI) frameworks. On the software side, the recent boom in AI and Big Data technologies
    supports not only the managing of large amounts of data accumulated by hardware
    modules but also to give this data as input to state-of-the-art, AI-based predictors,
    which can give more well-informed decisions to the farmer. They can efficiently
    analyze the latest trends in the data and provide several insights to the farmer.
    These benefits range from greater crop productivity, saving of tightly managed
    resources such as water for irrigation purposes, and minimization of the use of
    toxic chemicals such as those used in fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides.
    Such a level of control over agriculture not previously possible gives the farmer
    greater flexibility and insight to plan his activities, such as determining what
    crops will result in optimum yield under existing and predicted climatic conditions.
    It keeps him well informed about his current and projected use of permissible
    fertilizer and pesticide use. It also helps him regulate the usage of tightly
    managed resources such as water for irrigation purposes. This paper presents a
    detailed review of the architectures of first-generation smart farms relying on
    various wireless sensors and communications technologies around which IoT technologies
    in SAS are based. We then discuss how recent advancements in AI-powered algorithms
    based on Deep Learning (DL) can use the collected data from diverse sources. This
    data can be collected from a large number of IoT sensors and imagery from unmanned
    aerial vehicles (UAVs) in different geographically diverse smart agriculture fields
    to make more accurate and informed decisions for pest detection, plant diseases,
    smart irrigation, limited use of herbicides, and other harmful substances. We
    then review the current state-of-the-art technologies, implementation challenges
    associated with them, and future trends and direction in SAS. In terms of significant
    contributions, this paper has presented 1) A detailed tutorial on the available
    advancements in the field of SAS through IoT technologies and AI techniques; 2)
    A critical review of these two available technologies and challenges in their
    widespread deployment; and 3) An in-depth discussion about the future trends including
    both technological and social, when SASs will be widely adopted by the farmers
    globally. The roadmap of this paper is as follows: Section II discusses the related
    work. Section III discusses the state-of-the-art wireless sensor network (WSN)
    technology and use-cases of IoT in SAS. Section IV discusses the smart irrigation
    technologies used currently in the world. Section V presents an overview of the
    use of UAVs, which is a current driving force behind AI-powered solutions for
    SAS. Section VI discusses these solutions in detail, which are possible via DL
    applications. Section VII discusses the challenges in SAS, and Section VIII discusses
    the future trends in the area of smart agriculture technology. Finally, Section
    IX concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Work IoT-based smart farming has actively
    been in development for the last two decades, ever since the boom in wireless
    sensor technology. A comprehensive survey on the role of IoT in SAS has been provided
    by Farooq et al. [2] and Ayaz et al. [3]. Li et al. [4] presented an actual working
    smart greenhouse (SGH) with remote monitoring option using the WSN technology.
    With the advent of smart lower-powered wireless sensor technology enabling deployment
    in high densities, micromanagement ideas for SAS have started to evolve quickly.
    As soil parameters could be monitored closely, water conservation strategies such
    as smart irrigation technologies were developed. Hydroponics [5] and Aeroponics
    [6] are two such cutting-edge, soil-less medium based water management technologies.
    Nalwade and Mote [5] described a hydroponics-based smart irrigation system in
    which plants are suspended into a nutrient solution instead of soil for direct
    application of water to crop roots as per requirements. Idris et al. [6] implemented
    an aeroponics-based water irrigation system for crops in which water is directly
    sprayed at crop roots as per need. Special hardware design for sensor nodes was
    actively developed especially for use in smart agriculture applications [7]. IoT-based
    SAS studies have also been a popular topic amongst researchers [8]. These have
    been practically implemented for efficient monitoring and controlling of the agriculture
    systems remotely, sometimes with the option of saving data to the cloud for the
    benefit of other farmers working in similar domains, e.g., crops and climatic
    conditions. Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new emerging concept [9].
    Monitoring soil factors and climatic conditions are two major contributors to
    the well-being of the crops. Like IoT, it represents an internet of wireless sensors
    and actuators which are located below ground to monitor and control soil conditions
    such as moisture, nutrients, acidity, pH levels, and soil electrical conductivity.
    Wireless signal propagation loss and protection of sensitive electronics inside
    wireless sensor nodes is a challenging issue for the IoUT technology. Single-hop,
    wireless, underground sensor networks have been discussed in detail by Tiusanen
    et al. [10]. UAVs for smart cities surveillance in real-time have been proposed
    previously [11], [12]. The use of UAVs in smart farming is also being explored
    by researchers [13]. UAVs equipped with specialized smart camera applications
    capture aerial images of the field, which, combined with advanced DL-based AI
    tools, can predict crop diseases, phenotyping, plant growth monitoring, weed detection,
    and used for irrigation pesticide spraying. Architecture of a neural network.
    In current circumstances of acute water shortages for agricultural purposes, it
    is crucial to devise smart strategies for water conservation. Advanced irrigation
    concepts centered around IoT-based precision agriculture include the techniques
    of hydroponics [19] and aeroponics [20]. Zahid et al. [46] present a novel TeraHertz
    (THz) waves based method to estimate water content in living plant leaves to maximize
    water conservation via smart irrigation strategies. The concept of greenhouses
    [17], [18] is not new and has been around and utilized for agriculture for a few
    decades now. However, with the advancement in IoT and wireless sensor nodes technology,
    the SGH concept is rapidly emerging [47], [48]. SGHs enable farmers to maintain
    micro-climate conditions, enhance irrigation and fertilizer use. Similar to SGHs
    is the concept of Tunnel Farming [19]. Plastic tunnel farming is successful in
    developing countries due to its low cost, having off-season crops, and better
    productivity [49]. Traditional tunnel farms use drip irrigation, overhead irrigation,
    or sprinkler irrigation methods for better results. This type of irrigation is
    better than normal flooding methods. Various irrigation methods provide various
    levels of water and energy efficiency. Semi-Circular cross-section tunnels are
    used, which are usually 14 to 28 feet wide and 7 to 12 feet tall at the center
    (depending on width), and 48 to 96 feet long. It is usually recommended that tunnels
    should be no wider than 30 feet for cross ventilation and to avoid snow accumulation
    on the roof. Like SGHs, it is also lined with IoT sensor technology to constantly
    monitor soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and light intensity and take corrective
    actions accordingly through appropriate actuators. The use of Machine Learning
    (ML) and DL has also been actively researched for improved crop yields [50], agriculture
    advisory systems [51], [52], detection of crop diseases, weed detection [53],
    and pests [38]. Zeynep et al. [21] have carried out an exhaustive literature survey
    on the use of DL techniques in smart agriculture. The use cases of DL in smart
    agriculture include detection of plant diseases, pest recognition, plant classification,
    smart irrigation, and weed detection. Table 1 summarizes the topics related to
    SAS covered in various research papers and compares them with the contributions
    we presented in this survey article. TABLE 1 Comparison of Recent Topics Covered
    in Research Literature and its Comparison With This Survey Paper SECTION III.
    Use of IOT in Smart Agriculture A. Wireless Sensor Technologies for Smart Agriculture
    1) Temperature Sensors Ambient temperature monitoring is vital for crops growth
    in indoor as well as outdoor smart farms. Some crops are susceptible to changes
    in temperature, e.g., wheat. Even for a short period, high temperature affects
    the growth of shoots and, in turn, reduces root growth. Similarly, the high soil
    temperature is more crucial as damage to the roots is severe, resulting in a substantial
    reduction in shoot growth. 2) Humidity Sensors Humidity monitoring is essential
    for crops to estimate water losses due to evaporation, which is vital for the
    process of photosynthesis. Other complications related to humid conditions are
    that it may promote the growth of mold and bacteria that cause plants to die and
    crops to fail, as well as conditions like root or crown rot. Humid conditions
    also invite the presence of pests, such as fungus gnats, whose larva feed on plant
    roots and thrive in moist soil [23], [24]. 3) Soil Sensors Multiple types of soil
    moisture sensors are in use in SAS to study parameters like pH and conductivity.
    Soil conductivity maps help to predict crop yield as they indirectly deduce soil
    organic matter and soil texture. These two parameters are indicators of available
    water content and the presence of potential weeds. Thus, soil electrical conductivity
    measurement is also used for the estimation of quantities of soil-applied herbicides.
    Similarly, soil pH is essential to have healthy crops as strongly acidic soils
    having pH in the range of 4.0-5.0 can have high concentrations of soluble aluminum,
    iron, and manganese, which may be toxic to the growth of some plants. A pH range
    of approximately 6 to 7 identifies the ideal level of plant nutrients. 4) Fluid
    Level Sensors Level sensors are used to detect the level of substances, including
    liquids, powders, and granular materials. Level sensors find their use in SAS
    to monitor the nutrient solution level if the hydroponics method is used for smart
    irrigation. B. How do Sensors Communicate? Physical Layer Wireless Communication
    Technologies Fig. 2 shows the smart agriculture architecture from the viewpoint
    of wireless communication strategies to communicate between field devices and
    Internet Gateways at various abstraction levels. The capabilities of these wireless
    technologies vis-a-vis their practical use cases are discussed in different sections
    below. FIGURE 2. Wireless physical layer standards for communication between IoT
    based sensors and smart farming machinery at edge to agriculture database servers
    at core. Show All 1) LoRa AND LoRa-WAN Kontogiannis et al. [54] and Ray et al.
    [55] have proposed Low Power Long Range (LoRa) and LoRa-Wide area network (LoRa-WAN)
    technology at the physical layer for data communication between the IoT transceivers.
    Both LoRa and LoRa-WAN technologies are used in sensor nodes to implement their
    AI-based irrigation systems, Open Watering System (OWS), and LoRa-Agri, respectively.
    LoRa is a low-power, long-range spread spectrum modulation technique enabling
    IoT sensors to communicate at a distance of up to 12Km [47]. It also provides
    the highest scalability (5-20K nodes) but low data-rates of about 100Kb/sec. 2)
    Rfm69 Besides LoRa, another physical layer technology to connect IoT-based sensor
    nodes proposed in recent literature includes the RFM69 standard. RFM69 [88] supports
    a communication range of up to 0.5Km and data-rates of up to 100Kb/s for up to
    65K nodes. RFM69 transceivers can operate over a wide frequency range, including
    the 433-, 868-, and 915MHz license-free industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM)
    frequency bands. 3) Zigbee Zigbee technology [36], also referred to as IEEE 802.15.4,
    is another low-powered wireless communication technology for sensor nodes. It
    has a moderate communication range of up to 1Km and supports data-rates of approximately
    1Mb/s for up to 65K nodes. Like RFM69, Zigbee operates in the ISM radio band,
    most popularly in the 2.4GHz band, though some devices also use 784MHz in China,
    868MHz in Europe, and 915MHz in the US/Australia region. Chikankar et al. have
    demonstrated the use of ZigBee technology in their automatic irrigation system
    [14]. 4) Bluetooth Bluetooth [49] is another low-power wireless connection solution
    for the sensor nodes. It has the least supported range of 50m for up to 7 nodes,
    for the maximum data transmission capacity of 1Mb/s. Bluetooth transceivers require
    the least power out of the technologies mentioned above. 5) Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)
    NB-IoT [48] is a low-power WAN technology (LPWAN) developed through the long-term
    evolution (LTE) standards, which support direct communication of wireless sensor
    nodes with the existing generations of cellular networks from 2G to 4G. It supports
    data-rates of up to 150Kb/s. 6) SigFox SigFox [48] is another LPWAN technology
    like NB-IoT. Sigfox employs the differential binary phase-shift keying (DBPSK)
    and the Gaussian frequency-shift keying (GFSK) modulation techniques that enable
    communication using the ISM radio bands. Sigfox technology works at 868MHz in
    Europe and 902MHz in the US. It utilizes a wide-reaching signal that passes freely
    through solid objects, called “Ultra Narrowband” and requires little energy. The
    network is based on a one-hop star topology and requires a mobile operator to
    carry the generated traffic. It supports low data-rates of 100bits/sec. 7) Wireless
    Fidelity (Wi-Fi) Wi-Fi belongs to the IEEE 802.11 family of IEEE standards. This
    technology is suitable for wireless sensor nodes where power consumption is not
    an issue, and higher data transmission rates are required. Thus, it may only be
    suitable for high data-rates such as video transmission in indoor settings like
    indoor farms. The transmission distances are lower in the range of 100ft only.
    For IoT use in SAS, such high data-rates are rarely required. Two Wi-Fi standards
    that have been developed, or are being developed, specifically for IoT are Wi-Fi
    HaLow (802.11ah) [48] and HEW (802.11ax) [49]. It can support up to 290Mb/s in
    the upstream. Wi-Fi based sensor connection has been used in a practical system
    by Buendia et al. [56]. 8) WiMAX Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access
    (WiMAX) is IEEE 802.16 standard [2], [48]. It is sometimes regarded as long-haul
    Wi-Fi due to its similarities with Wi-Fi standards. It supports up to 380Mb/s
    data-rate in the upstream. It has the same limitation as Wi-Fi and may be suitable
    when the wireless sensor nodes are present at an indoor location. 9) Cellular
    Technologies Cellular technologies will be used to connect IoT-based sensors and
    smart farming machinery in large fields that otherwise communicate only over a
    short distance, as depicted in Fig. 3. Future smart agriculture machinery like
    drones will frequently be having flights covering huge areas, and real-time communication
    with such drones/UAVs could only be with the help of cellular networks [11]. Newer
    cellular technologies such as 4G LTE, 5G, and B5G are not only facilitating large
    communication ranges but also permit large data transmission capability, which
    will be suitable for applications like real-time video transmission from agriculture
    drones [12], [104]. Another alternative benefit of using the cellular technologies
    is to create an Internet Gateway as these systems have connectivity to packet
    data networks as their core. This will enable the use of Internet-driven applications
    such as making the system “weather aware” in real-time, deciding against irrigation
    if rainfall is expected or predicted by real-time weather updates etc. Available
    cellular technologies include 2G/3G/4G and 5G. All previously mentioned physical
    layer, one hop wireless technologies are either directly compatible with cellular
    technologies like NB-IoT, SigFox, and WiMAX, or they may be linked to cellular
    technologies using a gateway. Jawad et al. [57] presented a comprehensive comparison
    of the different wireless technologies discussed above with technical quantifications.
    It was suggested by the authors [57] that LoRa and ZigBee wireless technologies
    are most suitable for SAS because of their low latency and power consumption,
    easy implementation, smaller size, simplicity, scalability, and most importantly,
    the communication range (typically small for ZigBee and long for LoRa). Although,
    as discussed that 5G and B5G technologies [104] with low latency, large communication
    ranges, high data transmission capabilities that allow real-time video transmission
    using UAVs/drones will dominate future SAS with higher reliability. FIGURE 3.
    Use of cellular network for real-time monitoring in large fields using smart agriculture
    machinery. Show All C. How Sensors and Actuators Coordinate - Microcontroller
    Platforms for IOT Based Smart Agriculture Systems Microcontroller-based platforms
    popularly used by researchers in IoT based SAS include ATMEGA328P [54] (sometimes
    used in conjunction with Arduino development boards), 18F458 PIC microcontroller
    [14], and ESP8266 NodeMCU microcontroller [58]. Most of these microcontroller
    platforms provide an integrated Wi-Fi module having TCP/IP protocol that can able
    to access any Wi-Fi network. These platforms are cost-effective, power-efficient,
    and require minimal external circuitry. They also feature moderate storing capability
    and on-board processing. On-board processing is required to define the logic that
    how corrective action will be taken according to the sensor reading. All smart
    irrigation algorithms (described later) can be implemented as a logic program
    running on the microcontroller. These platforms also allow the integration of
    different sensors through General Purpose IO (GPIO) pins with minimal run time
    giving these platforms to scale up to multiple sensors in a single platform. For
    example, ATMEGA328P having a limit of 8 sensors per actuator [54]. Jawad et al.
    [59] have presented a practically implemented ZigBee-based system interfaced with
    ATMEGA 328p microcontroller, which uses energy harvesting techniques and sensor
    sleep/wake cycles to reduce the power consumption of the WSN network. SECTION
    IV. Smart Irrigation Strategies A. Soil-Based Irrigation Techniques 1) Drip Irrigation
    Drip Irrigation [60] is the concept in which the surface irrigation method is
    substituted by a channel of pipes laid into the land for irrigation. Pinpointed
    locations are selected at various depths for placing water closest to the plant
    roots and thus minimizing excess water loss in the soil surrounding the plants.
    Using drip irrigation, farmers can save up to 95% of the water. However, the upfront
    cost of this irrigation system is high as farmers need an initial investment in
    purchasing and laying the network of pipes underground through the agricultural
    land and provisioning of expensive power to drive water pumps for circulation
    of water in these pipes. Using a renewable form of energy, e.g., solar power,
    for meeting the power requirements, has a high initial cost but is generally lower
    in the long run. B. Soil-Less Irrigation Techniques 1) Hydroponics Hydroponics
    is a branch of hydro-culture, where plants are grown in a soil-less environment
    using a nutrient solution [14], exclusively. A mechanical structure using coir
    or coconut fiber may be used for the support of plants. The nutrient solution
    parameters such as pH and electrical conductivity have to be monitored constantly
    [7]. There are two variations of this technique where water is continuously circulated,
    or nutrient solution is supplanted with a new solution to maintain the parameters,
    the latter method results in power savings. 2) Aeroponics Like Hydroponics, Aeroponics
    is also a technique where plants are grown in a soil-less environment, but instead
    of placing the plants in a nutrient solution, the roots are sprayed with a nutrient
    solution based on the data of root chamber moisture levels [20]. Presently several
    crops have been successfully undergone experimental cultivation using the aeroponics
    technique [6]. C. Smart IOT Based Irrigation Control 1) Fuzzy Logic Algorithms
    This is a class of algorithms based on a pre-defined set of rules and degree of
    membership calculations based upon sensor values [37]. Fuzzy algorithms are fast
    and smart adaptive algorithms and include error-control capabilities [61]. Practical
    systems implemented using Fuzzy control algorithms for smart irrigation control
    have been developed by several researchers [17], [37]–[54], [61]. 2) Majority
    Vote Algorithms In this type of algorithm, if the majority of the sensors report
    a reading greater or less than a pre-specified threshold value to trigger the
    irrigation process, then the irrigation is started. 3) Time-Controlled Algorithms
    In this type of algorithm, the actuators are activated at a particular time of
    the month and for the pre-specified duration. For this duration, they stay on
    as per pre-set or pre-programmed conditions by the farmer. This algorithm can
    sometimes use sensors as a feedback mechanism for adaptive actuator control. 4)
    Exponential Weight Moving Average Algorithms In this type of algorithm, the immediate
    sensor reading is multiplied by the weighting factor and then added to an average
    of previous n readings, again multiplied by a second weighting factor to generate
    a moving average as per the equation given below: S=a S c +(1−a) S n,avg (1) View
    Source where, the coefficient value a is between 0 and 1, S c is the current sensor
    reading, and S n,avg is the average over previous n sample readings. This mechanism
    is resilient to instantaneous sensor noise. 5) Proportional Integral, Derivative
    (PID) Control Algorithms This is an advanced control loop feedback process, as
    shown in Fig. 4, in which a setpoint set by the farmer is tracked by the system,
    using a function of the error to follow it and achieve it. The setpoint may be
    a control process variable such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, or humidity.
    The output of the system response is provided in Fig. 5. It can be seen that a
    proportional controller achieves fast control action in reaching the setpoint
    but may result in an overshoot in the process. The integral controller achieves
    low steady-state error while the derivative controller reduces system overshoots.
    The use of a PID controller in a solar-based irrigation system has been discussed
    in [62]. FIGURE 4. Depiction of a PID controller to control a process variable.
    Show All FIGURE 5. Depiction of process control variable evolution with respect
    to target point using PID control. Show All 6) Neural Network Algorithms These
    belong to an advanced class of ML algorithms in which the system is trained using
    training data composed of sensor values and the level of irrigation required.
    Training requires setting system weights to make the output, a weighted linear
    sum of input sensor values. An activation function is used to model non-linearities
    in the system to avoid getting negative output values and cater for situations
    not covered by an exclusively linear response, as shown in Fig. 6. Once the system
    weights are tuned in the training stage, the testing stage uses these leaned weights
    to derive an optimum irrigation requirement based on the input sensor value. These
    algorithms require an immense amount of training data to be able to give superior
    results. As the number of layers increases in the neural networks, so does the
    training complexity, which sometimes requires expensive GPUs. Recently, Al-Naji
    et al. [63] have developed a system using input RGB images to a pre-trained, feed-forward
    back propagation artificial neural network (ANN) and claimed high system accuracy
    in determining soil conditions and water requirement for irrigation. FIGURE 6.
    Architecture of a neural network. Show All SECTION V. Use of UAVs in Smart Agriculture
    UAVs are primarily used for crop monitoring through aerial images being acquired
    by the UAV and crop spraying owing to the ease offered by its aerial mobility
    and maneuverability. Velusamy et al. [44] provide an excellent taxonomy of the
    type of UAVs being used in precision agriculture being classified as fixed-wing,
    vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) based on their flight patterns and other
    architectural design such as the number of rotors, being classified as single
    rotor, multi-rotor (tri-copter, quad-copter, hexa-copter, octo-copter). These
    UAVs are equipped with multiple camera types: RGB, multi-spectral, and hyper-spectral.
    Different UAV architectures and mounted cameras may be suited for specialized
    applications. For example, fixed-wing may be better for broad surveillance and
    monitoring of the agriculture field, while VTOL-based multi-rotor design may be
    suited for pesticide spraying. Similarly, an RGB camera may be suited for low
    altitude UAV operation for close-range detection of different pests and plant
    diseases through real-time manual monitoring or DL-based automated monitoring,
    while hyper-spectral imagery is useful for high altitude UAV monitoring to monitor
    and assess the extent of plant disease or pest infestation spread across a large
    agriculture field through inspection of broad foliage. Often farmers will have
    to use one UAV type for monitoring of the field and another type of UAV for spraying
    purposes, as several factors come into play like UAV flight time, flying altitude,
    flight speed, camera, and other sensors’ limitations and on-board hardware processing
    [64], [44], [65]. Jawad et al. [65] have implemented a practical solar-powered
    wireless power transfer (WPT) based drone field-landing platform for drone battery
    recharging; authors claim 97% battery saving and flight endurance time increase
    from 25 minutes to 850 minutes on the specific X525 drone used in their study,
    when this system is augmented with a specialized sleep-wake strategy of WSN sensor
    nodes communicating with the drone. Crop Monitoring is enabled through special
    aerial images acquired by UAVs based on thermal, multi-band hyper-spectral, multi-spectral,
    and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) technology. This allows farmers to identify
    crop conditions and plant diseases through the use of advanced image data analytics
    along with exact geolocation data through GPS measurements [23]. The use of UAVs
    in modern SAS makes use of thermal, LIDAR, hyper-spectral and multi-spectral imaging
    technologies together with advanced image processing software to solve a variety
    of farmers’ issues. LIDAR technology has been used to detect crop/plant volumes
    to predict expected yield and areas with problems. Since, LIDAR is still a very
    expensive technology, similar parameters such as normalized difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) [66] and crop water stress index (CWSI) [67] can be obtained using
    aerial images acquired using hyper-spectral and multi-spectral cameras. The NDVI
    and CWSI parameters can help identify crop biomass levels and provide predictive
    information such as crop diseases, water stress levels, nutrient deficiencies,
    and pest infestations. Yang et al. [29] designed a deep Convolutional Neural Network
    (CNN) to estimate rice grain yield using images acquired by the UAVs. This framework
    can make estimations at the ripening stage. Dyson et al. [31] integrated a radiometric
    index with terrain height images for segmenting crops and trees using high-resolution
    UAV images. Nevavuori et al. [28] apply CNNs to crop yield prediction using RGB
    image analysis and NDVI data collected by the UAVs. An interesting combination
    of fusion of multi-spectral imaging and RGB images through UAVs in the detection
    of weeds was presented by Barrero and Perdomo [68]. Similarly, Lottes et al. [26]
    present a crop and weed classification system using a UAV-based application. Crop
    spraying is made possible through UAVs after identifying problematic locations
    which require spraying of pesticides through GPS-enabled UAVs. Deployed systems
    have claimed UAV payload capacities of up to 2 Kg and flight endurance times of
    up to 15 minutes [25]. Interestingly, some researchers have preferred the use
    of hybrid systems using both ground-based nodes and UAVs to achieve greater efficiency.
    An example is a system proposed by Faical et al. [24] in which UAVs are guided
    through ground nodes having information about wind direction and speed. The UAVs
    then incorporate their own flight parameters (position, current velocity, and
    direction of travel) so the spraying process is optimally planned and executed
    inside targeted areas where it is most required. The commercial supplier DroneFly
    estimates that drones can spray fertilizer 40 to 60 times faster than doing so
    by hand [69]. The use of UAVs is not limited to conventional SAS, but they are
    now also being used for aquatic farming of plants, e.g., lotus and other aquatic
    organisms, e.g., fish [45], where human monitoring is exceedingly difficult. SECTION
    VI. Use of Deep Learning in Smart Agriculture Z. Unal et al. [25] have compiled
    a comprehensive bibliography on the recent trends of DL-based CNNs in the area
    of Smart Agriculture, as shown in Fig. 7. The main feature by which DL networks
    are distinguished from neural networks is their depth, and that feature makes
    them capable of discovering latent structures within unlabeled and unstructured
    data. DL is a computationally expensive algorithm and practically requires powerful
    GPUs for the proper training of algorithms using large training datasets. Ma et
    al. present an approach where training could be speeded up using multiple GPUs
    in parallel [70]. FIGURE 7. A deep learning framework using convolutional neural
    networks to detect and classify plant diseases using labeled training images of
    affected plants with pre-known disease. Show All A. Plant Diseases In order to
    detect plant diseases in crops, current research has been focusing on image-processing
    based DL systems instead of the conventional practice of using RNA analysis for
    timely identification of any crop diseases saving the farmers from huge economic
    losses. The most popular image-based DL framework, shown in Fig. 7, uses a multi-layer
    CNN framework that initially self-learns features present in the labeled training
    image data. These learned features are then fed to an ANN in the second stage.
    Neural weights, bias functions, and non-linear activation functions are used to
    make the classification accuracy high. Gobalakrishnan et al. [27] present an exhaustive
    review of various systems development and in progress. Types of infectious diseases
    that can destroy the yield are fungal, bacterial, and viral. Similarly, types
    of non-infectious diseases result from non-ideal farming situations like improper
    soil acidity, mineral toxicities, and deficient nutrients. Efficient image processing-based
    ML systems have been developed by researchers [71]. Most notable of these include
    work by Mahlein et al. [72], who devised a technique based on the generation of
    spectral disease indices (SDIs) and spectral vegetation indices (SVIs) for sugar
    beet plants. Using hyper-spectral signatures, the plant diseases in sugar beet
    plants could be classified with accuracy in the range of greater than 85%. The
    advantage of this technique is that it is not affected by noise from other sources
    in the imaging process such as camera flash. Other techniques in the domain of
    image processing include genetic algorithms for image segmentation [73], pattern
    recognition techniques based on Gabor Transform [74], [75], CNN based DL frameworks
    [34]. Almost all of these claim accuracies of between 90 to 95%. Other specialized
    image-based techniques are developed keeping in view the detection of plant diseases
    in targeted crops like citrus fruits [76], mango trees [77], apples [38], and
    rice [78]. B. Agricultural Advisory Systems Niranjan et al. [51] discuss a chat-bot
    based farmers’ query answering system through which they can get specific answers
    to their queries. The system uses online web resources like documents as training
    data and Natural Language Processing to develop a DL-based Recurrent Neural Network
    (RNN) framework. The queries could range from crop types grown in particular geographical
    regions to the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Several ontology-based knowledge
    bases exist today, like ADANS [79] and AGRI-QAS [52], which can be queried using
    SPARQL queries. C. Edaphic Parameters Estimation Many researchers have devoted
    attention to the estimation of soil parameters [80], [81], which play a dominant
    role in other factors such as prevention of non-infectious diseases and increasing
    crop yield. Many soil-based factors are essential for maintaining healthy crops,
    such as moisture, air, temperature, mineral matter, organic matter, organisms,
    etc. While external climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, precipitation
    can only be controlled when crops are grown in an indoor environment, soil factors
    could be controlled when crops are grown in both indoor and open fields. Many
    studies using ML algorithms have investigated the soil properties to develop Digital
    Soil Maps [82]. Jia et al. [83] present the idea where comprehensive ML-based
    soil models could be applied to nearby land areas where less training data is
    available. D. Real-Time Pest Detection Pest detection has been investigated by
    some researchers. The most notable of these works is that of Brunelli et al. [38].
    The researchers claim that although many ML algorithms exist for the detection
    of plant diseases using images of damaged crops, there is no provision for real-time
    pest threat detection. It is due to the fact that ML algorithms are run on powerful
    hardware, physically distant from the wireless sensor nodes collecting the data
    from many vantage points, so detection is done after the damage has been done.
    They give a framework for real-time detection of codling moth pest detection,
    using AI at edge solution. The solution comprises of readily available and moderately
    expensive hardware like Raspberry PI-3, Intel Movidius neural compute stick (NCS),
    and Intel Myriad X neural accelerator as a vision processing unit (VPU) for real-time
    pest detection after the training of the deep neural network (DNN). Using this
    solution, pest detection accuracy was greater than 90%. E. Phenotyping Plant phenotyping
    is an emerging science that links the impact on functional plant body development
    from the dynamic interaction between its genetic background and the physical world.
    Using image-based DL methods such as CNN [21], as shown in Fig. 7, this is possible,
    as this problem is not too different from other problems such as detection of
    plant diseases and pest detection. Uzal et al. [33] have developed a DL technique
    to predict the number of seeds per pod. Similarly, grapevine phenotyping using
    the DL technique has been implemented using only a consumer-grade camera is carried
    out by Milella et al. [84]. Feng et al. [85] have fused multi-spectral imaging
    with ML for plant salt stress phenotyping. F. Weed Detection Like the nuisance
    of pests and plant diseases, weeds are other unwanted plants growing within the
    agriculture field and reduce the productivity of the farming lands. Ferriera et
    al. [86] and Moshia and Newete [32] have devised CNN-based DL approaches for the
    detection of weeds in soybean and cornfield. Bah et al. [87] have done the same
    with images acquired via UAVs. Kounalakis et al. [22] have used the transfer learning
    approach for the detection of weeds through the DL algorithm. Partel et al. [88]
    have developed a smart sprayer for real-time weed management using NVIDIA GPUs
    and CNN. Chang and Lin [53] developed a computer vision-based, robotic watering,
    and weed detection system. SECTION VII. Challenges for Smart Farming A. International
    Regulations on Use of Pesticides - a Case for Organic Farming According to a recent
    report of the World Health Organization (WHO), around three million cases of pesticide
    poisoning occur globally each year, leading to nearly 220,000 deaths in developing
    countries, making the case of pesticide-free organic farming [89]. Restrictions
    have already been implemented by the European Union (EU) and other regulatory
    bodies on the use of harmful pesticides. For example, the EU has indicated a zero-tolerance
    policy on the use of Tricyclazole chemicals in rice [90]. This makes a case of
    organic farming inside contained indoor environments where the climate can be
    maintained closely without the threat of pests as encountered in agriculture farms
    in open fields. B. Reduction of Arable Land Amid Drought-Like Situations - a Case
    for Vertical Farming Recently, we have seen several problems hampering the growth
    of agriculture. These problems include acute water shortages for proper irrigation
    of lands, reduction of farming lands due to rapid urbanization and industrialization,
    widespread crop diseases decreasing productivity, and harmful effects of pesticides/insecticides
    on human populations. Currently, researchers have begun giving a lot of attention
    to vertical farming techniques [5], [6], [15], [91], [92]. Vertical farming techniques
    solve all of the problems mentioned above by using water-based solutions and lightweight
    porous aggregates, e.g., coconut coir [16] instead of soil, giving the possibility
    of lightweight vertical stacking of plants/crops over a small area of land such
    as rooftops of buildings which have weight limitations. This also gives numerous
    other benefits such as the possibility of confining the vertical farming space
    in a green-house like an environment for controlled supply of water and nutrients
    using a variety of smart sensors connecting via IoT concepts [35], and increased
    crop productivity with minimal requirement of water over the small footprint.
    This is especially suitable for agro-based economies like the Middle East, Africa,
    and the Indian Sub-continent, which are facing increasingly drought-like situations
    and have a dire shortage of water for suitable irrigation. By using the IoT technology
    for intelligent vertical farming, new types of crops, genetically superior crops,
    or yield of certain crops may be increased tremendously with minimal use of water
    and creation of an artificial climate if the natural climate is not favorable.
    C. How Will Farmers Meet the Increased Technological Costs Associated With Smart
    Farming Yet Expect Food Prices to be Low? Smart farming has huge upfront and operational
    costs to build up the required infrastructure. The farmers could meet the upfront
    costs through the availability of loans on easy installments by government bodies
    to support Smart Agriculture practices. Similarly, Farmers may offset the operating
    costs through increased productivity than conventional farming methods. For example,
    farming inside closed spaces or earlier detection of crop diseases through advanced
    AI-based Agricultural Advisory systems may give timely prediction and protection
    from airborne and soil-borne crop diseases. Similarly, with smart irrigation strategies
    such as aeroponics, crops may grow up to 3 times faster [92]. There is also the
    potential possibility that food prices will again be lowered through the reduction
    of food-miles as smart indoor vertical farms will typically be located in urban
    locations such as rooftops or buildings or large warehouses. D. Global Consortium
    for Development of Seamless Wireless Sensor Technologies and Data Aggregation
    Focussed on Smart Agriculture Use Currently, researchers have been able to piece
    together available wireless sensor technologies and platforms for the development
    of Smart Agriculture infrastructures. Almadani and Mostafa [93] have developed
    a SAS using multi-vendor devices using a data distribution service (DDS) middleware.
    However, there is a need for a consortium specially dedicated towards the development
    of Wireless sensor development for Smart Agriculture use cases. Currently, this
    need is felt at various levels. For example, LoRa EU radio frequencies are in
    the ISM bands of 868MHz and 433MHz. The 868MHz band is mainly used in urban areas;
    for agricultural applications, the 433MHz band can achieve better distances with
    less attenuation over distance. However, existing devices in the market utilize
    only the 868MHz band for the LoRa Mac layer and infrastructure [54]. Similarly,
    WSN nodes deployment in underground situations to study soil parameters needs
    dedicated efforts by the researchers to study the behavior of wireless waves propagation
    through the soil [94]. Similarly, the issues of the development of standard communication
    protocols for seamless integration of different types of sensors and advanced
    security mechanisms are required to protect information transfer in the fields
    to preserve the privacy of growers [9]. Similar to the problem of heterogenous
    communication protocols of wireless sensors, the data being collected by them
    at application layers can suffer from similar problems. The diverse wireless sensor
    manufacturers use different data formats, which results in reduced syntactical
    and semantic interoperability among IoT environments. Sensor data can be encoded
    in binary, or represented in formats such as json, xml, text (e.g., csv), shapefile,
    or even proprietary formats. The heterogeneity of data types and formats can also
    affect the performance of a protocol employed for communicating the information.
    To cater to this problem Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF) for
    tractors and agricultural machinery, which is very relevant in arable farming,
    has developed a standard ISO 11783 [95]–[97]. Similarly, AgroXML developed by
    the Association for Technologies and Structures in Agriculture (KTBL) [98]–[100].
    E. Hacking Attacks on Smart Machinery and Cyber Threats to Agro Databases An imminent
    threat to smart farming will be from computer hackers who may attack smart self-driving
    farming machinery like smart tractors and UAVs. Self-driving cars already face
    several types of cyber threats like Denial-of-Service (DoS) and its sub-types
    (Sybil, Grayhole, Wormhole, Rushing attacks) [85]. IoT sensor node communication
    using several IEEE wireless communication standards, e.g., 802.11p used for autonomous
    cars and eventually autonomous farming machinery, are especially vulnerable to
    jamming/DoS attacks [110]–[112]. Similarly, DoS attacks on servers hosting smart
    agriculture historical data logs and other agricultural advisory systems will
    keep smart farmers ill-informed about timely measures against natural disasters
    (pest infestation). Robust counter-attacks techniques for these cyber threats
    will need to be present at the core (Servers) as well as the edge (Smart farming
    machinery and IoT field nodes) for the protection of smart farmers’ interests.
    SECTION VIII. Future Trends for Smart Farming A. Paradigm Shift from Cloud-Based
    to Edge AI Applications for Smart Agriculture As with other applications, AI-based
    SAS applications will undergo a paradigm shift in which edge devices like wireless
    sensors will become intelligent enough to make autonomous decisions independently
    without relying on powerful central servers running AI algorithms. With the recent
    advancements in electronics, embedded systems with increased processing power
    and memory, labeled as System on Chip (SoC) [27], [77], have the ability to provide
    a complete solution without reliance on other external entities. Smart AI-based
    embedded systems running computer vision algorithms have been developed using
    portable architectures as used for real-time pest detection by Brunelli et al.
    [38]. Similarly, Gia et al. [15] have developed an experimental framework in which
    CNN-based image compression is implemented inside the sensor node due to low data
    transmission rates of current WSN networks based on LoRa and NB-IoT. Thus, there
    will be a shift from cloud-computing solutions to edge-computing based solutions.
    These solutions will also be able to provide farmers with real-time threat detection
    and its timely prevention. Alsamhi et al. [101] propose using drones with B5G
    physical layer wireless technologies to perform federated learning and edge AI
    processing for smart environments. Intensive ML is possible over B5G networks
    due to its high data-rates and low latency [102]. B. Open Source Smart Agriculture
    Solutions for Farmers As there is a shift from cloud-based solutions to edge-computing
    based solutions, there will also be a shift from proprietary to open-source based
    solutions from the farmers. Farmers may not be technologically equipped to program
    AI-based algorithms from scratch [30]. Many of the edge AI-based solutions of
    the future will already be using open source based AI-algorithms such as OpenCV
    libraries [103] for computer vision or other publicly available software frameworks.
    This will bring down the cost of SAS. Similarly, the farmer will not have to design
    new systems from scratch each time; consultancy firms will provide plug-and-play
    based hardware plus software solutions to farmers alongwith aftersales support.
    Open-source software solutions would also mean that farmers’ measurements could
    be shared openly with other farmers enabling farmers to build a strong knowledge
    base. C. Huge Yields Will no Longer be Due to Farmers’ Laborious Efforts Rather
    His Intellectual Abilities In the future, most of the farming equipment will be
    self-driven, like smart cars [104]. These include smart farming tractors and UAVs
    using computer vision technologies to manage everything from sowing, irrigations,
    fertilizer application, weed removal, herbicides applications, and pest detection.
    In these situations, tech-savvy farmers could only survive amidst fierce competition
    through their knowledge of AI, big data analytics to fully understand the conditions
    of their crops. Many Smartphone software-based services owing to big leaps in
    Edge AI applications, will be available to identify crop conditions, e.g., conditions
    of fruits, detections of pests, etc. D. Rise of Blockchain Technology in Smart
    Farming Sector to Counter Cyber Threats Like other emerging areas in the IoT technology
    [104], Smart Agriculture will also be vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Hence, there
    would be a growing need to protect the farmer’s privacy as well as the data of
    his crops if it will be shared for cloud applications. Future threats to SAS will
    be in the form of control systems intrusion, secure key management for encryption/decryption.
    There could also be a potential threat to physical Smart Agriculture equipment.
    For example, GPS spoofing attacks causing incorrect positioning of UAVs/drones
    working in the crops field or a smart tractor could be given incorrect waypoints
    leading to physical damage. In addition, the delay caused by long-distance signal
    transmission from IoT sensors deployed at great distances in the field also increases
    the risk of Sybil attacks in which malicious data is spread through virtual nodes
    [18]. Additionally, it is found that the threat was not only in the form of software
    but also hardware threats were equally likely. In one instance, it was found that
    high voltage pulses emitted from solar-based insecticidal lamps interfered with
    the ZigBee based communication of other IoT nodes. Future Open Source smart farming
    technologies would also warrant this free sharing of possibly compromised or corrupted
    information to other smart farmers. BlockChain technology would be used to secure
    the data received for onward transmission from wireless sensors to cloud servers.
    E. Future Crops Will Not be Farmers Choice Rather Dictated by Data Driven Smart
    Farming Currently, farmers mostly depend on a combination of guesswork, estimation,
    and past experience when deciding about the crop to be grown and the fertilizer
    that should be used for optimum crop yield. In the future, ML models will be used
    to study long-term climate patterns in particular geographical locations, and
    these will be a guide to farmers on which crops to target at particular sites
    in the future. Villa-Henriksen et al. [105] review the impact of data-driven decisions
    on smart farming and identify six different stages of data flow which are: sensing/perception,
    communication/transport/transfer, storage, processing, analytics, and actuation
    and display. The data processing/analytics stage may differ in position according
    to architecture, e.g., fog/edge computing or cloud computing. Data processing/analytics
    typically has an AI-based prediction framework and forms the heart of data-driven
    agriculture. Chakrabarty et al. [113] have studied the climate patterns and other
    man-made factors such as fertilizer use in parts of Bangladesh and its effects
    on crop yields. These data points are used as input to a DNN for prediction framework.
    Similarly, Jin et al. [114] have studied a climate predictor that can predict
    weather conditions for the next 24 hours. Thus, in the future, crop production
    decisions will be heavily guided by the output of advanced predictor systems fed
    with climate and crop yield data from the past. F. 5G Wireless Technologies Will
    be Used for Always Connected Smart Farming Machinery It is increasingly evident
    that 5G wireless technologies [104] will dominate smart agriculture. This is because
    of the advantages of 5G technologies, such as higher data-rates, larger coverage
    areas, and adaptability to heterogeneous communication environments. These are
    essential for real-time crop monitoring in large farmlands [106]. 5G [104] also
    provides excellent support for the vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure
    (V2I) due to its low latency and new frequency bands, which will be the requirement
    in the future for always connected farming machinery like smart tractors and swarms
    of smart drones [107]. G. Rise of Green(ER) IoT Future IoT networks, including
    those deployed for SAS, will be energy efficient. Almalki et al. [108] present
    a comprehensive review on the greening of IoT networks in future smart cities
    by reducing their carbon footprint. Several techniques have been proposed for
    this, which include energy harvesting techniques, sleep/wake modes for IoT sensors,
    efficient routing protocols, cognitive WSN, and 5G-based mobile communication
    networks. Alsamhi et al. present a comprehensive survey on the use of B5G technology
    for green IoT [109]. SECTION IX. Conclusion A comprehensive review of existing
    research literature and recent state-of-the-art developments in the area of Smart
    Agriculture Systems was presented. The significant contributions of this paper
    are: 1) A detailed tutorial on the available advancements in the field of SAS
    through IoT technologies and AI techniques; 2) A critical review of these two
    available technologies and challenges in their widespread deployment; and 3) An
    in-depth discussion about the future trends including both technological and social
    when SASs will be widely adopted by the farmers globally. In this paper, we first
    discussed the importance of smart agriculture practices with the growing gaps
    in global food demand versus current food generation, the growing shortage of
    arable land for agriculture, stricter regulations by International organizations
    on the use of toxic pesticides/herbicides, and global shortage of water resources
    for irrigation purpose. Clearly, all of the challenges cannot be met through traditional
    agricultural practices. We then discussed in detail the current hardware building
    blocks of the smart agriculture system, which is primarily based upon a large
    number of IoT nodes deployed in the field with suitable sensors to monitor the
    current situations of crops. The monitored parameters are transmitted wirelessly
    through various available technologies for the farmer to take remedial actions
    manually or automatically through pre-programmed instructions to actuators. We
    discuss the automated control algorithms and strategies along with their advantages
    and limitations for one particularly important application, smart irrigation,
    in view of recently depleting water resources. We also discussed the currently
    available and implemented hardware, wireless communications technologies, and
    software aspects of the smart agriculture systems in terms of implementation with
    their use-cases and limitations. These use-cases will define their potential roles
    in newer Smart Agriculture standards and specifications as they evolve. Next,
    we presented a detailed insight into the emerging trends of applications of AI
    and DL in smart agriculture and the architectural building blocks for smart agriculture
    systems. We discussed at length practical prototype implementations and their
    effectiveness for applications in automated plant disease or pest detection. We
    also briefly discussed the impact of these technologies on future advancements
    in smart agriculture, such as the use of UAV/drones and other smart farming machinery.
    Finally, we discussed the challenges of smart agriculture systems to support the
    paradigm shift of adopting the latest technological advancements for mainstream
    systems. The foremost is the social implication of these technological advancements
    on traditional farming methods. These advanced techniques may redefine the way
    the farmers will practice agriculture in the years to come. Farmers will have
    to be tech-savvy to keep themselves abreast with these technological advancements,
    and traditional farming practices will become obsolete and impractical. Other
    technical challenges include standardization aspects of commercially available
    smart agriculture systems solutions to make them compatible across several manufacturers,
    make them backward compatible and lower costs associated with the wide adoption
    of smart agriculture systems. In the end, we also discussed the future directions
    of advancement in smart agriculture systems and the technological difficulties
    and challenges they will bring with them. These future directions primarily focus
    on bringing more AI-based solutions towards edge devices from the core for real-time
    threat detection and quick remedial actions, making the availability of more open-source,
    customizable solutions for farmers, and incorporating measures for cyber security.

    Get rights and content Highlights • Impact of catchment scale activities on water
    quality (WQ) degradation. • WSN suitable for real time and high resolution WQ
    monitoring with some limitations. • Absence of catchment monitoring, use of off-the-shelf
    components and proxy sensors. • Integrate WSN-controlled catchment activities
    for collaborative WQ management. • Collaborative WSNs to share information about
    critical events in a catchment. Abstract The challenge of improving water quality
    is a growing global concern, typified by the European Commission Water Framework
    Directive and the United States Clean Water Act. The main drivers of poor water
    quality are economics, poor water management, agricultural practices and urban
    development. This paper reviews the extensive role of non-point sources, in particular
    the outdated agricultural practices, with respect to nutrient and contaminant
    contributions. Water quality monitoring (WQM) is currently undertaken through
    a number of data acquisition methods from grab sampling to satellite based remote
    sensing of water bodies. Based on the surveyed sampling methods and their numerous
    limitations, it is proposed that wireless sensor networks (WSNs), despite their
    own limitations, are still very attractive and effective for real-time spatio-temporal
    data collection for WQM applications. WSNs have been employed for WQM of surface
    and ground water and catchments, and have been fundamental in advancing the knowledge
    of contaminants trends through their high resolution observations. However, these
    applications have yet to explore the implementation and impact of this technology
    for management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s
    contributions, in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Here, the potential of WSN-controlled
    agricultural activities and different environmental compartments for integrated
    water quality management is presented and limitations of WSN in agriculture and
    WQM are identified. Finally, a case for collaborative networks at catchment scale
    is proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for integrated water quality monitoring, control
    and management. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Wireless

    1. Introduction Water is a key natural resource which is vital for the survival
    of all ecosystems on the planet. However, less than 1% of the earth’s water resources
    are accessible to humans as fresh water, in the form of either surface or ground
    water (Krchnak et al., 2002, UNESCO, 2006). Although there is currently sufficient
    water for essential activities (Blanco et al., 2009) including drinking, irrigation,
    and domestic and industrial use on a global scale, the spatial distribution of
    water suggests that, in many cases, it is not available where it is required.
    Because of the unequal distribution of fresh water resources, billions of people
    around the globe live in water-stressed and water-limited environments. Therefore
    it is crucial to preserve water resources although in practice it is continually
    degraded and depleted owing to inappropriately targeted funding initiatives leading
    to poor water management, redundant and outdated agricultural practices and urban
    development (Rosegrant et al., 2002, Verhoeven et al., 2006). The key issues relating
    to global freshwater quality problems in the environment and public health are
    summarised as (FAO, 1996): (1) Non-economic cost of drinking water treatment.
    (2) Millions of annual deaths resulting from water-borne diseases. (3) Ecosystem
    dysfunction and loss of biodiversity. (4) Contamination of marine ecosystems.
    (5) Contamination of groundwater resources. (6) Depletion of usable water resources.
    (7) Deterioration of recreational activities. Problems associated with water quality
    are commonly attributed to nutrient, chemical and pathogen loadings into an aquatic
    system as a result of point source and non-point source activities (EPA, 2009).
    Discharges from point sources are identifiable and come from a single source.
    Examples include contaminants from sewage plant pipes or industries. On the other
    hand non-point source fluxes may come from diffused sources/activities with no
    direct source of entry (FAO, 1996). Examples mainly include agricultural and animal
    farming or peri-urban activities. A diagrammatic representation of major activities
    responsible for the degradation of water on a catchment scale owing to point and
    non-point sources is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    1. Water contamination activities in a catchment. While some regulations have
    been put in place by water quality control organizations in various countries
    to control toxic and chemical loadings from point source as well as non-point
    source (Borja et al., 2004, Pollard and Huxham, 1998), they have not been as effective
    for diffuse non-point sources as for point sources (Heimlich, 2003). In order
    to prevent and reduce water pollution in the US, the use of best management practices
    (BMPs) has been proposed by the EPA (Environment Protection Agency) for controlling
    and managing agricultural practices (UNEP, 1998). However, their effectiveness
    needs to be assessed using sufficient quantities of long term data. Therefore,
    it is established that monitoring nutrient and contaminant contributions by the
    various responsible factors, at key points in a catchment, is vital in assessing
    and preventing degradation of water quality, as well as informing future regulations
    (Coles et al., 2009, Hunter and Walton, 2008). In this paper, we review the impacts
    that different stakeholders have on water resources, and explore how a single
    stakeholder can have unintended impacts on others in a catchment. Various data
    acquisition methods from grab samples to satellite images, have been used to estimate
    and model relationships of land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Shrestha et al., 2008, Bolstad and Swank, 1997, Tong and
    Chen, 2002, Lemos et al., 2007). These sampling methods are further reviewed and
    evaluated in this paper. WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring
    of surface water (rivers, lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments.
    Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity
    and nitrates have been measured. Preliminary results have been fundamental in
    advancing the knowledge of contaminants trends, although they were based on spatially
    constrained observations. Most of these were small scale prototype deployments
    and were mainly aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous
    and real-time data availability. However, these applications have yet to explore
    the implementation and impact of this technology for management and control decisions,
    in order to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s contributions, in an
    autonomous and dynamic manner. This requires an integration of responsible activities
    into an autonomous water quality monitoring and management mechanism. Therefore,
    the potential for including existing WSN-controlled agricultural activities and
    water bodies, for integrated water quality management, is presented in this review.
    Later, research challenges in the existing applications of WSNs in this area are
    identified which, if addressed, would enable possible extension of the existing
    techniques to an integrated monitoring program. It is argued in this paper that
    it is not feasible to have a single monitoring system covering the entire catchment
    as individual stakeholder’s monitoring requirements vary as they undertake different
    activities. However, this enables a case for collaborative networks in a catchment
    to be proposed for enabling cooperation among individually networked activities/stakeholders
    (farming activities, water bodies) for managing water quality. The structure of
    this paper is as follows. In Section 2, the role of agricultural activities on
    water quality degradation in a catchment is discussed. Section 3 discusses existing
    data acquisition methods for WQM, and discuss their limitations, and Section 4
    investigates the ability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and management in
    a catchment. Section 5 discusses the unresolved research challenges that prevent
    wide adoption of WSNs for monitoring agricultural and water quality parameters
    and achieving water quality management in a catchment. Finally, Section 6 presents
    a case for integrated water quality management using collaboration among individually
    networked activities in a catchment, while Section 7 draws conclusions. 2. Role
    of agricultural activities on water quality degradation and ecosystem dysfunction
    in a catchment Surface and ground water contamination in a catchment is mainly
    attributed to outdated farm management practices. These include excessive use
    of fertilizers for high product yields, traditional irrigation practices, use
    of pesticides and herbicides and poorly managed animal farming operations (Moss,
    2008, EPA, 2009). Other sources include fracking, deforestation, atmospheric deposits
    by rainfall and untreated sewage waste. However, this paper focuses on the impact
    of farm management practices on water quality degradation. These practices may
    result in nutrient, chemical, pathogen and sediment fluxes with main nutrient
    issues being due to excess phosphorous and nitrogen losses (Carpenter et al.,
    1998, Hunter and Walton, 2008). 1 lists the impacts of catchment scale activities
    on the quality of surface and ground water resources. For a related representation

    fertilizer application Fertilizers rich in phosphorous, potassium and nitrogen
    are added to soil to increase crop yields. However, agronomic nutrient recommendations
    are often far in excess of environmental levels (Mueller et al., 1996). Therefore,
    application of nutrients contained in manures and artificial fertilizers often
    remain in the soil or are leached into the drainage water (Vanlauwe et al., 2001,
    McKergow et al., 2003). Enrichment of water because of nutrients, termed as eutrophication
    (Nixon, 1995), can give rise to toxic algal blooms which contaminates drinking
    water and harms aquatic life (Smith and Schindler, 2009, Min and Jiao, 2002).
    This acknowledges the need for a mechanism to monitor and assess nutrient inputs
    to crops, its uptake by crops and losses through runoffs and leaching from farms.
    2.2. Poor water management Irrigation techniques such as surface flooding, localised
    drip and subsurface irrigation might be efficient in some ways but they can lead
    to various problems. Under-irrigation, in the case of drip irrigation, can lead
    to salt buildup on the soil surface and can damage crops. Over-irrigation, in
    the case of surface irrigation, may not only trigger nutrient/chemical runoff,
    but can also cause perched water tables resulting in soil salinity problems (McKergow
    et al., 2003). Furthermore due to scarce water resources, low quality water is
    being increasingly used for irrigation, which is rich in nutrients and salts (Pereira
    et al., 2002). This increases the risk of salt accumulation in the root zone and
    consequent long term damage to crop production and soil fertility (Pitman and
    Läuchli, 2004, Tedeschi and Dell’Aquila, 2005). This acknowledges the need for
    an intelligent water management methodology to avoid wastage of water and allow
    its reutilisation. 2.3. Inadequately managed animal farming operations Manure
    run-off due to rainfall or poorly managed animal farming operations may carry
    pathogens like bacteria and viruses to water bodies, affecting water quality for
    both aquatic life and humans (Lipp et al., 2001, Ferguson et al., 2003). Pathogenic
    micro-organisms are responsible for causing infectious diseases in humans and,
    are a major cause of decline and destruction of coral reefs worldwide (Bellwood
    et al., 2004, EPA, 2012). In order to maintain and improve animal health within
    animal feeding operations (AFOs) facilities and to prevent any pathogen and chemical
    fluxes through fecal discharges from them, it is very important to continuously
    monitor and control the local environment. 2.4. Use of pesticides and herbicides
    Pesticide and herbicide applications on crops contribute to chemical deposits
    in soil, which are carried through runoff and leaching into rivers, lakes and
    groundwater (Cerejeira et al., 2003, Guzzella et al., 2006). Antibiotics are fed
    to livestock as growth enhancers, and manure containing these pharmaceuticals
    is spread on land, from where it leaches into ground water and reservoirs (Daughton,
    2004, Reynolds, 2003). This validates a need for: (i) monitoring microclimate
    of crops to prevent onset of moulds and other diseases, and (ii) a mechanism to
    control chemical laden water into or out of a farm preventing contamination of
    its own or other’s farm or water bodies. 3. Existing water quality data acquisition
    methods This chapter focuses on the major sampling methods which have been used
    to acquire water quality data to assess surface (rivers, lakes, dams) and ground
    water (reservoirs, aquifers) bodies. Also, this information has been used to model
    the relationship between land use and water quality degradation in a catchment
    (Glasgow et al., 2004, Lemos et al., 2007, Shrestha et al., 2008). This chapter
    briefly discusses grab sampling, in situ sampling using data loggers, and remote
    sensing using satellite imaging, while it focuses mainly on the use of WSNs. This
    chapter discusses the suitability of WSNs for water quality monitoring and argues
    how it overcomes the limitations of the other methods. For decades, field measurements
    for water quality evaluation have depended upon costly time- and labour-intensive
    on-site sampling and data collection. Water samples are collected from the field
    and are then analysed in laboratories. This not only give limited point measurements
    but also become an expensive method for remote sites (Glasgow et al., 2004). Additionally,
    transportation of samples may disturb their chemical properties (EPA, PacifiCorp,
    2002). As data utility is affected in grab sampling by extended holding times
    before analysis, monitoring programs have shifted towards continuous measurements
    using in situ sensors (Lemos et al., 2007) Initially data loggers were used for
    in situ monitoring; however they were limited by not providing data in real time
    as sites had to be visited to retrieve data. The expense of data loggers, infield
    reliability, calibration requirements and the need to extract data from them individually,
    prevent them from being used for a dense and long term deployment of sensors.
    Alternatively, remote sensing using optical and thermal sensors on aircrafts and
    satellites can be used to monitor water quality parameters like turbidity, chlorophyll,
    chemicals, nutrients and temperature (Glasgow et al., 2004, Webster and Grossman,
    2003). High resolution remotely sensed data is correlated by empirical or analytical
    models to a water quality parameter (Ritchie et al., 2003). Examples include a
    modelling approach to estimate phytoplankton in a shallow lake using satellite
    imagery with sparsely collected ground reference data, which demonstrates temporal
    stability (Tyler et al., 2006, Matthews et al., 2010). However, this is an expensive
    solution and its application is limited to regions covered by the satellites.
    Also, data sampling frequency may be insufficient and data may not be available
    in real time (Basha and Rus, 2007). It is reasoned that sudden fluctuations in
    water quality and quantity can be monitored using high frequency continuous measurements,
    and considerable differences in measurements are observed in daily/hourly readings
    in comparison to sparse readings (O’Flynn et al., 2010, Kirchner et al., 2004).
    Advancements in micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMSs), low-power and low-cost
    microcontrollers and radio modules enabled WSNs for environmental monitoring (Estrin
    et al., 2001), which overcame the limitations of previous expensive, and bulky
    monitoring equipment with low spatio-temporal resolution to a certain extent.
    WSNs are networks of small embedded computers referred to as sensor nodes or ‘motes’,
    spatially distributed to cooperatively monitor environment and transmit data wirelessly.
    The relatively low cost of a WSN allows in principle, the deployment of a dense
    population of nodes that can adequately represent the variability present in the
    environment. WSNs have been used for monitoring and managing farming activities
    (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009) and eco-hydrologic processes (Regan
    et al., 2009, Rundel et al., 2009). Water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), turbidity, salinity and nitrates have been measured in the reviewed
    applications using WSNs. A basic sensor node (Fig. 2) contains units for sensing
    and actuating, data processing, RF communications and power supply management
    (Jafer et al., 2010). A node can have many different types of sensors, for example
    measuring humidity, temperature, turbidity and nitrate but it should be noted
    that the quality of the data is dependent on the quality of the sensor. The acquired
    analogue samples are converted into digital signals using an on-board analogue-to-digital
    converter. The microprocessor may collect samples over time and aggregate them
    before transmitting them through the local radio transceiver to another node or
    a data sink (also termed as a gateway). Information collected from all the nodes
    is aggregated at the data sink and transmitted to and analysed at an off-field
    control node where a decisions might be taken. This could involve sending some
    actuation signal back to the network, for instance turning on sprinklers to irrigate
    the field. Furthermore, alternative networking approaches exist where information
    is processed and used entirely within the network, without the need for a central
    control node. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2. Sensor node architecture.

    WSNs deployed in a catchment. 4. WSNs for water quality monitoring and management
    WSNs have been employed for water quality monitoring of surface water (rivers,
    lakes, and dams), ground water, soil–water and catchments. These water bodies
    receive contaminants as a result of agricultural activities up in the catchment
    (as discussed in chapter 2). Preliminary results have been fundamental in advancing
    the knowledge of contaminant trends, through spatially constrained observations.
    Most of the applications were small scale prototype deployments and were mainly
    aimed at developing and testing the technology for remote, continuous and real-time
    data availability. These applications have yet to explore the implementation and
    impact of this technology for management and control decisions, in order to minimise
    and prevent individual stakeholder’s contaminant contributions, in an autonomous
    and dynamic manner. When this happens, the loop would be closed and better management
    policies by farmers would come into place. This would require monitoring of nutrients,
    pathogens and chemical contributions of different farming activities responsible
    for water quality degradation. WSNs have been used in agricultural activities
    but not specifically for WQM. For example a number of applications have been developed
    for precision irrigation for automatic and controlled irrigation, reducing the
    chances of water wastage (runoffs which are carrier of nutrients and contaminants)
    (McCulloch et al., 2008). However, runoff coming from elsewhere (e.g. another
    farm) cannot be avoided. This runoff can be carrying nutrients. In that case,
    current precision irrigation system can be extended to use information about runoff
    to modify the irrigation and fertilizer application of its field to save water
    and fertilizer usage. Other applications of WSNs for agriculture include pest
    control and animal farming. Pest control applications which are used to monitor
    microclimate (temperature, humidity, soil moisture) of a field to prevent conditions
    such as moulds etc. have been very important for viticulture (Morais et al., 2008,
    Beckwith et al., 2004). Furthermore, precision livestock using WSNs has been used
    to: (a) maintain animal health by monitoring environment of barns (Cugnasca et
    al., 2008, Darr and Zhao, 2008) and (b) manage cow herds in a virtual moving fence
    to control pasture area (Butler et al., 2004, Nadimi et al., 2008). The following
    sections review the applications of WSNs for WQM of different environmental compartments.
    Furthermore, the potential of including WSN-controlled existing agricultural activities,
    for integrated water quality management, is presented. 4.1. Application of WSNs
    for monitoring water fluxes and quality in different environmental compartments
    These projects are discussed below with respect to the area they monitor in a
    catchment. 4.1.1. Groundwater monitoring Groundwater contamination from human
    impacts is less obvious than surface water and cleaning it is more costly and
    technically demanding (Zektser and Lorne, 2004). Once polluted it may transport
    nutrients and chemicals to coastal waters (Gallagher et al., 1996, Valiela et
    al., 1999). WSNs have been used to measure rate, quantity and direction of water
    contamination flow in two different scenarios, one being to understand prevalence
    of arsenic in Bangladesh ground water, and the other to monitor nitrate propagation
    through soils and groundwater in parts of the USA. Although sensor nodes have
    become inexpensive, the high cost of some sensors (e.g. ammonium) is a major barrier
    for dense deployment of WSNs (Ramanathan et al., 2006). In order to monitor saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers, WSN have been deployed for monitoring water quality
    in a coastal area in Australia. Preliminary data showed potential for helping
    in decision support related to placement of extraction bores for irrigation to
    avoid groundwater degradation. However, it was not possible to set up a well-connected
    radio link in this particular humid environment (Le Dinh et al., 2007). 4.1.2.
    Surface water monitoring A test deployment project, ‘Lakenet’, was undertaken
    for water quality monitoring in a eutrophic lake by University of Notre Dame (Seders
    et al., 2007). The sensor pod system, consisting of MICA2 and MDA300 sensor board
    measuring temperature, dissolved oxygen, and pH was deployed for a short term
    (10 days). The primary objective of this deployment was to test the design of
    both the pods and the network under field conditions and to examine its ability
    to collect data continuously and reliably. This project was termed successful
    on the basis of collected data which showed diurnal fluctuations. To demonstrate
    the need for availability of high temporal rate data, as a requirement of water
    framework development (WFD), a WSN project (DEPLOY) was deployed at various locations
    on a river basin in Ireland. It achieved continuous sampling of parameters including
    conductivity, pH, chlorophyll, DO and temperature. The system consists of the
    Tyndall programmable system-on-chip sensor interface and data telemetry system
    using IDS data pod, and an optimised RF section to provide up to 4 km transmission).
    Results showed fluctuations in measurements due to activities such as runoff,
    rainfall or release of water from dams in the river. This demonstrated the potential
    for catchment behavioural analysis using statistical processing and interpretation.
    However, sensor fouling and maintenance issues were raised (Regan et al., 2009,
    O’Flynn et al., 2010). Similarly, another deployment involved performance evaluation
    of a prototype network of wireless nodes (Sunspot) on a dam in Malawi, Africa
    to counter severe health threats caused by degrading water quality. Water parameters
    such as acidity (pH), DO and turbidity were measured by integrating a sensor board
    with a sensor node. These measurements were then compared with numeric standards
    to decide on the suitability of water for drinking (Zennaro et al., 2009). Another
    application intended for WQM on dams utilises a combination of satellite remote
    sensing and WSN to enable real time analysis of satellite and surface data for
    overall coverage and the continuous monitoring of water quality. A floating sensor
    platform (buoy) is developed and deployed on a dam in Cyprus which transfers water
    quality data via wireless network to a remote central database (Papoutsa et al.,
    2010). Considerable research on developing technology to enable contaminant transport
    assessment and characterising urban stream quality and algal dynamics has been
    undertaken by CENS (Centre for Embedded Sensors), UC Los Angeles (Harmon et al.,
    2009, Gilbert, 2010). This started in 2007, by developing a test-bed for salinity,
    nitrate and soil moisture control in a 30acre land by using automatic irrigation
    control (Park and Harmon, 2007). Later progress on developing nitrate sensors
    for groundwater, soils and aquatic systems was made in 2009 (Ratâko et al., 2009).
    In 2010–2011, the project continued to focus on high resolution river observations
    using integrated sensing and model-driven analysis. Sensing is focused on temperature,
    dissolved oxygen and nitrate changes in the river (Harmon et al., 2009). For monitoring
    impact of poor water quality on aquatic life, parameters such as pH, dissolved
    oxygen, turbidity, salinity and electrical conductivity have been measured in
    various applications (He et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 2010). Real time information
    about these aquaculture environmental parameters can provide the means to give
    early warning signals. In one of the applications, based on historical data, the
    system was used to forecast water quality with artificial neural networks and
    control water quality in time to reduce the threat to fish farms. The model for
    forecasting dissolved oxygen half an hour ahead was validated with experimental
    data (Zhu et al., 2010). 4.1.3. Soil–water monitoring Monitoring drainage water
    of farms enables assessment of its quality. In this application (Kim et al., 2011),
    wireless lysimeter sensing stations were used 90 cm below the soil surface to
    monitor water flux leached below root zone under an irrigated cropping system.
    Continually monitored soil–water and weather data, sensed by a distributed network
    of sensors, was wirelessly transmitted to a base station using Bluetooth, which
    was connected to a web server for broadcasting the data via the internet. This
    provided remote online access to drainage water flux and field conditions for
    the whole growing season. This was targeted at measuring volume of drainage water
    based on irrigation frequency and rainfall events for different crops. However,
    this work could be easily extended to also monitor nutrient or salt parameters
    leached out from the soil. Another important project demonstrated the potential
    of WSNs for measuring soil water content, which was shown to be helpful in controlling
    hydrologic fluxes (Bogena et al., 2010). 4.1.4. Catchment monitoring Some work
    has been reported at catchment scale for water quality monitoring. Such catchments
    include mountains, forests, lakes, rivers, and agricultural lands. These are prototype
    deployments aimed at developing the technology and algorithms for large-scale
    remote monitoring and data processing for large volumes of heterogonous data for
    water quality. These are fundamental research efforts in this domain but improvements
    can be made. To find causes and interactions of physical/chemical variability
    on rivers and estuaries, work was started by US Geological Survey on creating
    a wireless catchment in Santa Margarita Ecological Reserve in Southern California.
    It was intended for high density monitoring of the catchment encompassing mountains,
    canyons and river channels. The system was primarily focused on developing and
    testing a network of radios and routers for wireless data transmission and its
    availability on the internet. Various issues were faced due to rugged topography
    and the difficulty of obtaining line-of sight communication. Despite these challenges,
    this provided an effective way of remote monitoring and was used further for monitoring
    meteorological properties related to pollutant loadings (Cayan et al., 2003).
    Similarly, for evaluating variation of regional weather, at mountain-to-sea scale,
    on water quality/quantity, and flooding in a catchment in Hawaii, a prototype
    system to provide 3D geospatial data visualisation utilising WSN was proposed.
    The system consisted of an array of nodes consisting of water quality sensors
    (temperature, pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and turbidity), weather stations,
    sensor data loggers (InteleCell), and video monitors. Preliminary results showed
    improvement over traditional sampling methods (Kido et al., 2008). The ‘SoilWeather’
    network was used in Finland for providing high temporal resolution on weather
    conditions, soil moisture and water quality (Kotamäki et al., 2009). The work
    was reported to have been used in developing a leaching model at sub catchment
    scale, including an improved hydrological model of the river, for monitoring water
    quality and nutrient retention in rivers and wetland. The network was deployed
    on a catchment covered by forests, river, lakes, and agricultural lands owned
    by private owners, who were the main users of the data. This is an important work
    highlighting data quality and processing issues with high volumes of heterogeneous
    data, received from catchment-scale observation using a single network, varying
    in content, accuracy, and spatial–temporal resolution. Additionally, maintenance
    of sensors due to such issues as bio-fouling, freezing, and rain gauge problems,
    which resulted in erroneous and missing data were viewed as major challenges in
    obtaining high data quality. 4.2. Leveraging current agricultural processes for
    water quality monitoring and management Some of the key research areas in precision
    agriculture which have received considerable attention include precision irrigation,
    pest control, viticulture and animal health monitoring (Wang et al., 2006, Ruiz-Garcia
    et al., 2009). Instead of taking decisions based on hypothetical average conditions,
    the real time information from these systems provides a solid basis for farmers
    to adjust strategies at any time (Ruiz-Garcia et al., 2009). There is a potential
    of leveraging existing networked agricultural activities for their extension into
    an integrated water quality management mechanism. In this regard, current agricultural
    processes such as pest control, precision irrigation and animal farming which
    are monitored and controlled using WSN are discussed below. 4.2.1. Pest control
    To determine and prevent the onset of a fungal disease, phytophtora, in a potato
    field, a network of sensor nodes was deployed to sense humidity and temperature.
    Sensed data was sent periodically to a gateway at the edge of the field from where
    it was forwarded to a server using Wi–Fi. The accumulated field data for a day
    was then fed into a decision support system server where it was combined with
    weather forecast to determine the treatment policy each morning, rather than spraying
    pesticides based on hypothetical assumptions. This experiment, though based on
    specialised hardware, still presented many challenges for radio coverage owing
    to crop canopy effect, routing protocol, software bugs and in-field deployment
    (Langendoen et al., 2006). It has had tremendous impact on improving deployment
    and practicality issues in WSN applications (Le Dinh et al., 2007, Liang and Terzis,
    2008). Furthermore, to prevent frost, pest and mould damage in vineyards, which
    are prone to quick damage if overstressed, WSNs have been used to monitor ambient
    temperature, soil moisture and soil temperature (Morais et al., 2008, Beckwith
    et al., 2004). This information enables vineyard owners to monitor the plants
    remotely and manage priorities accordingly (Burrell et al., 2004). These pest
    control applications could be extended, to include chemical sensing, in order
    to assess chemical levels in the crops and soil after pesticides and herbicides
    applications. Information obtained through such a mechanism could then be used
    to inform on and thus potentially control chemical fluxes into water bodies. 4.2.2.
    Animal farming In order to maintain and improve animal health within animal feeding
    operations (AFOs) and to prevent its negative impact on the ecosystem, information
    related to the local environment is very important. Moreover, by having a mechanism
    to monitor and control animal herds in pasture lands, pathogen and organic additions
    to the environment may be controlled and assessed. The deployment of WSNs in many
    AFOs has enabled monitoring of parameters such as temperature, humidity, noise
    and ammonia content in the air which has allowed the management and maintenance
    of healthy environments in these facilities (Cugnasca et al., 2008, Darr and Zhao,
    2008). For managing cattle herds in pasture land, an algorithm called ‘moving
    virtual fence’ was developed. Each animal in the herd was given a smart collar
    consisting of a GPS (for determining animal’s location), a PDA, a WLAN card and
    a sound amplifier. As the animal approached a perimeter, it is presented with
    an acoustic stimulus to drive it away from crossing over a designated virtual
    boundary. By dynamically shifting fence lines, the usage of feedlots is improved.
    In addition, it reduced the overhead of installing and moving physical fences
    (Butler et al., 2004). Other work has investigated online monitoring of cattle
    presence and pasture time using WSNs to register the time animals spend in specific
    areas of the field (Nadimi et al., 2008). This information can be used to indicate
    grass quality and quantity and can also determine the right time to provide access
    to a new grass strip. These applications can be clearly extended to monitor pathogen
    levels animal waste in a barn and their fluxes to water bodies and therefore manage
    it by raising alerts. Also, by managing animal herds with a virtual fence, the
    possible situation of them contaminating water bodies or others fields can be
    avoided or reduced. 4.2.3. Precision irrigation As established in the introduction,
    potable water resources are under pressure. Therefore an efficient way of utilising
    water resources by people in general and agriculture sector in particular is crucial
    to avoiding a global water crisis (Chartres and Varma, 2011). By monitoring soil
    and environmental parameters (like soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient temperature
    and humidity), an informed decision can be made by farmers to control the timing
    and quantity of irrigation. Unlike expensive, sophisticated, high maintenance
    and high energy sensor-based technologies like Adcon Telemetry and Automata, and
    labour intensive data collection from logging stations, WSNs provide real-time
    and less expensive sensing mechanisms for improving irrigation automation (Vellidis
    et al., 2008). It is estimated that 70% of the annual water usage of the agricultural
    industry, in the Australian state of Tasmania, is used to irrigate dairy pastures.
    In order to improve water use efficiency for pasture production, data is collected
    using 70 sensor pods which were developed using off-the-shelf components for this
    experiment. Accurate irrigation at targeted dry areas can be provided by studying
    soil dynamics, using soil and environmental parameters collected from the pasture
    field. Received data showed variation in soil moisture levels with events such
    as rains etc. (McCulloch et al., 2008). Another example made a comparison between
    traditional and sensor scheduling systems in a cotton field (2.3 ha) for the whole
    growing season (Vellidis et al., 2008). The East of the field, divided into four
    different irrigation zones based on soil type and historic yield map, was equipped
    with 9 sensor nodes and centre pivot variable rate irrigation (VRI) system. On
    the western side, 3 sensor nodes were deployed to monitor soil tension, and here
    irrigation was triggered based on traditional assessment of crops. Each sensor
    node was equipped with three moisture and temperature sensors buried at 0.2, 0.4
    and 0.6 m depth under the soil. Results showed water tension at more than double
    the trigger points at 0.4 and 0.6 m depth in western zone despite irrigation,
    whereas the eastern side never surpassed the trigger points. However, it is stated
    that further work needs to be done on the VRI controller for varying quantity
    of irrigation relative to the needs of individual areas, or for different crops
    in a single field. To address such a need, site specific VRI was employed in a
    3.6 ha plot by using six in-field sensor stations. These stations were based on
    off-the-shelf components, with a plug-and-play Bluetooth radio module, and would
    periodically sample data and transmit back to the base station. Each sensing station
    was equipped with water content reflectometers, a soil temperature probe, and
    a humidity probe. The irrigation machine was controlled by a programmable logic
    controller that would update the geo-referenced location of sprinklers from a
    differential GPS, and wirelessly communicate with a computer at the base station.
    This enabled variable rate irrigation according to the needs of individual crops
    in a large field. (Kim et al., 2008). As discussed above, a significant amount
    of successful work has been published using automatic and variable rate irrigation
    with some limitations regarding reliability. However, what is lacking is the inclusion
    of real time information about events elsewhere in the farm to alter irrigation
    decisions. For example, information about possible weather changes, like rain,
    from other networks in a catchment could be used to change time and quantity of
    irrigation by allowing forward planning and prediction. Also, information regarding
    irrigation in one farm can be used elsewhere in the catchment to prohibit entry
    of nutrient flux from that runoff. 5. Research gap in water quality monitoring
    and management using WSNs The literature review for the application of WSN for
    water quality monitoring and agricultural activities presents many possibilities
    and potential, yet identifies numerous limitations. Following are the major limitations
    commonly observed in the reviewed literature. 5.1. Absence of catchment scale
    integrated monitoring and management As identified in chapter 2, a number of catchment-scale
    activities are responsible for water quality degradation. Therefore, to identify
    the individual and major impacts of the diffused pollutant sources, it is vital
    to base the monitoring system on the entire catchment. It has been acknowledged
    in the literature that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends and quantification
    of the contributing factors. WSNs have been successful in understanding the trends
    of nutrients and contaminants fluxes owing to non-point source activities in a
    catchment. However, this understanding is limited as it can currently only use
    small-scale, localised and specific measurements at rivers, lakes, dams and groundwater
    reservoirs (Ramanathan et al., 2006, Le Dinh et al., 2007, Zennaro et al., 2009,
    Papoutsa et al., 2010, Seders et al., 2007, Harmon et al., 2007, O’Flynn et al.,
    2010, Regan et al., 2009). These water resources receive contaminants as a result
    of activities up in the catchment, thus providing insufficient information for
    quantifying explicit responsible activities. Fewer applications are intended for
    large-scale observations (Kido et al., 2008, Kotamäki et al., 2009, Cayan et al.,
    2003), but these are prototype deployments based on limited monitoring points
    across the catchment. A major step in this direction is the new network of terrestrial
    environmental observatories in Germany that provides real-time access to instruments
    in a multi-scale and multi-temporal mode for the monitoring of relevant fluxes
    of trace-gases, water and matter in all important environmental compartments at
    the catchment-scale, e.g. hydrological sensor networks, micrometeorological flux
    stations and clusters of lysimeters (Zacharias et al., 2011). Existing work does
    not implement multi-scale monitoring mechanisms that include all stakeholders
    in a catchment, to assess their individual contributions, which is fundamental
    for the understanding of cumulative impacts on water quality degradation. Current
    projects are focused on the development and deployment of the required infrastructure
    for enabling high-temporal, real-time water-quality observations to be made available
    through GSM or internet on a central data repository (Kotamäki et al., 2009, Kido
    et al., 2008). These do not include addressing management and control decisions,
    to minimise and prevent individual stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions,
    in an autonomous and dynamic manner. Thus a need can be identified for an autonomous
    and integrated catchment-scale monitoring mechanism, based on targeted wireless
    sensor technologies. 5.2. Absence of suitable sensors Water quality analysis requires
    monitoring of various parameters as represented in the tabulated contaminant constituents
    (Table 1). It is apparent that the advances in sensor development have not kept
    pace with the advances in potential sensor materials (Zhuiykov, 2012). The development
    of sensors from new materials to enable solid-state and film-based sensors requires
    significant development effort before they can be used in real applications, although
    they do offer significant potential. An example of an improved sensor is the development
    of a solid-state water quality sensor with metal oxide sensing electrodes under
    research efforts by Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO).
    This has provided the capability to measure pH, DO and dissolved metal ions in
    a way more appropriate for WSN applications (Zhuiykov, 2007, Zhuiykov, 2012).
    It is evident through the surveyed literature that existing work does not include
    all of the contaminants and parameters required for water quality monitoring,
    for example phosphorous, nitrates, and ammonia. This is because suitable in situ
    phosphate and nitrate sensors for terrestrial deployment are not available. The
    available sensors for nitrate monitoring are based on ultraviolet absorption and
    flow cell analysers which are very expensive for dense deployment (Robertson et
    al., 2009). Both electromechanical (Bobacka et al., 2008) and optical sensing
    modes (McDonagh et al., 2008) relevant to nitrogen and phosphorous species are
    still an active research area (Rundel et al., 2009). Furthermore, research on
    the development of miniature, reliable and inexpensive water quality solid-state
    sensors using metal oxide sensing electrodes is underway by CSIRO, CMSE and SSN
    TCP laboratories (Zhuiykov, 2012). In the absence of affordable and reliable in
    situ sensors for all of the necessary water quality parameters, estimation of
    constituent fluxes in streams and rivers relies on surrogate sensors which give
    proxy measurements. Examples include use of turbidity (clarity of water) and fluorescence
    intensities as a surrogate for suspended sediments and biochemical oxygen demand
    (Minella et al., 2008, Hudson et al., 2008). Another study demonstrated successful
    surrogate relationship, for road and roof surfaces, of dissolved total nitrates
    and total phosphates with total dissolved solids (TDSs). For measuring TDS, electrical
    conductivity was used as a surrogate (Miguntanna, 2009). These surrogates have
    been fundamental in advancing our knowledge about the trends in the actual parameters.
    However it is also noted that measurement error and uncertainty in the derived
    surrogate relationships can have a substantial effect on the uncertainty of flux
    estimates made using surrogates (Horsburgh et al., 2010) and require significant
    calibration of the environments in which they are deployed. Although sensor development
    is on-going (Zhuiykov, 2012), there are still few useable sensors for many of
    the parameters, thus it can be concluded that there is a requirement for accurate,
    inexpensive, low-power, long-lived, robust and miniature sensors for effective
    water quality analysis. 5.3. Issues related to the use of off-the-shelf components
    Current applications of WSNs for WQM are based on the use of off-the-shelf components
    which often fail to address the diverse range of environmental and degradation
    problems that can coalesce at catchment scales. Existing devices are not made
    to address the specific requirements of a particular application. Various limitations,
    as discussed above, have been faced in the existing literature by the use of off
    the shelf components (Le Dinh et al., 2007) such as the coverage problem (Regan
    et al., 2009), signal attenuation (Vellidis et al., 2008), configuration and operational
    difficulties (Trubilowicz et al., 2009), and absence of a network model for catchment
    areas with hilly terrains which has the potential to affect the radio links. Standards
    for WSNs were developed primarily for urban monitoring situations such as buildings
    and industries. However, they are less suited to remote and large scale applications
    such as agriculture with coverage and crop canopy problems due to the propagation
    environment and typical range requirements. For example, high frequency systems
    (typically 2.4 GHz) commonly rely on line-of-sight systems and physical obstructions
    such as plants, or conditions such as rain, can significantly reduce the communication
    range to as little as a few metres. Furthermore, these frequencies are unsuitable
    for underground WSNs, which are ideal for non-invasive soil monitoring, as they
    suffer data losses due to soil water content (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Li
    et al., 2007). In an experiment, sensor and link failures were handled by: (1)
    identifying patterns in data to indicate sensor failure and (2) using decision
    trees based on data flow models to identify link failure (Ramanathan et al., 2006).
    Top level concepts and protocols are applicable without any changes but care is
    needed for practical deployment and it may be that certain applications require
    a significant rethink of the communication requirements, which may not be addressed
    by current off-the-shelf solutions. This is an on-going research for the application
    of underground wireless sensor networks. (Bogena et al., 2009) evaluated signal
    attenuation by factors like soil depth, soil water content and soil electrical
    conductivity. They concluded that in a hybrid underground approach, which combines
    below ground and above ground data transmission, sufficient power will remain
    to ensure long distant data communication. As long term and spatiotemporal monitoring
    is required for effective analysis of water degradation trends in a catchment,
    a low cost, low power and reliable system is required. Existing literature has
    shown that many nodes lasted from only a few days to months, therefore effective
    design changes like wake up and power control need to be considered to prolong
    their lifetime to years. Furthermore, although separate sensor boards (Zennaro
    et al., 2009, O’Flynn et al., 2007) can be integrated with nodes to enable a multi
    sensing system with various sensor types, improvements can be made to take this
    further. The plug and play system constrains sensors to be compatible with that
    system, whereas a more reconfigurable interface may well extend the choice of
    sensors at the expense of some complexity in specifying to the host node what
    the sensor requires in terms of resources. Therefore, there is a requirement for
    a reconfigurable sensor interface for a sensor node, e.g. SDI-12, as this would
    allow a more rapid deployment for a specific application and thereby reducing
    the costs of the WSNs. In addition, various deployment and maintenance issues
    were faced due to the placement of sensors in soil and water. Bio-fouling of sensors
    deployed in water required regular cleaning and maintenance (Regan et al., 2009).
    6. A case for collaborative WSNs for integrated catchment-scale water quality
    management Through the review of related work and its limitations, it is established
    that for effective water quality management at a catchment scale, a system of
    individually networked activities needs to be included into an integrated monitoring
    system. Information sharing of critical parameters between networked environmental
    compartments and WSN-controlled agricultural activities can enable identification
    and quantification of the contributing factors in water degradation. This would
    further address management and control decisions, to minimise and prevent individual
    stakeholder’s nutrient/contaminant contributions, on waterways as well as on other
    stakeholders, in an autonomous and dynamic manner (Zia et al., 2013). Fig. 4 illustrates
    information sharing among individual networks in a catchment. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Collaborative catchment-scale management using integrated
    WSNs. It is proposed that monitoring should be based on three levels covering
    the micro-to macro- scales. Micro-scale monitoring is aimed at improved understanding
    of small scale processes such as leaching of nutrients in soil and groundwater
    and retention of fertilizers by soil. Then a medium scale monitoring which is
    focused on assessing agricultural practices such as improved irrigation strategies,
    and use of alternative fertilizers or reduced application rates while maintaining
    same crop yields. Finally, macro-scale monitoring considers catchment level, sub-catchment
    level and regional land use assessments. Monitoring environmental compartments
    continuously and spatially can identify specific local sources for nutrient/contaminant
    fluxes (e.g. a barn or a farm). If this information is fed back to the identified
    stakeholder in real time, there is the potential to control or minimise the fluxes
    emanating from the location. If there are other networks monitoring nutrient/contaminant
    levels and fluxes near the source location, then the information provided by these
    networks can be correlated with data from the original monitoring point. If it
    correlates well then this has identified a route from the source to the appropriate
    nearby network as well as characterising that route in terms of quantity and time
    constant, thus allowing a model of cause and effect to be built up for the locality.
    Based on this information, the responsible stakeholder can then assess its adopted
    practices and alter strategies to reduce its contribution to water quality degradation.
    A collaborative control and management strategy requires that individually targeted
    monitoring units or local networks, representing different stakeholders in a catchment
    e.g. a farm, should be able to share information with each other about runoffs,
    contaminants or nutrient fluxes. These events may be intense but are short-lived
    and so information sharing becomes important as they may be very fast compared
    with the usual sampling rate, and so may normally be missed. Allowing event information
    to be transmitted across multiple networks as they are detected will allow prediction
    of when the repercussions of that event might be seen downstream, allowing other
    stakeholder networks in the vicinity to adjust their monitoring strategy to improve
    the value of information e.g. by increasing their sample rate to catch transient
    events. This would than support the development of advanced models that are able
    to simulate catchment processes in a more detailed way. Implementing such a mechanism
    allows every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through
    the catchment from other networks. 7. Conclusion This paper has reviewed the potential
    impact of agricultural activities on water quality degradation in a catchment.
    It has proposed that the varied monitoring needs for individual areas of a catchment
    could be combined to allow an understanding of contaminant flow trends, their
    quantification and management of the contributing factors. This identifies a need
    for an autonomous and collaborative mechanism, based on targeted wireless sensor
    technologies. Furthermore, it is concluded that for effective and integrated water
    quality monitoring and management at a catchment scale, a system of individually
    networked activities is needed. This is likely to take the form of a combination
    of networks that have been installed for local monitoring purposes (e.g. at farm
    scale, primarily to provide local information for that farm), and some specific
    networks aimed at filling in information gaps in the catchment. This system of
    networks should be able to share information about critical parameters for events,
    such as rain, or floods, that could trigger consequences, such as contaminants
    runoff and so requires a higher level application to make use of this information,
    and also requires the individual networks to be aware that similar networks nearby
    are capable of passing information to them. This will inevitably lead to some
    form of standardisation of communication protocol and data representation between
    enabled environmental networks. Applications of WSNs for water quality monitoring
    and management for a catchment hold huge potential. However, certain limitations
    have been identified in this review such as small scale, single application deployments,
    limitations of off-the-shelf components, the lack of suitable sensors and the
    cost of deployment and data collection. Furthermore, it is determined that important
    application specific requirements are not well catered for by using off-the-shelf
    components such as variable sampling rates, well-defined and flexible sensor interfaces,
    lifetime, ease of deployment and configuration for hydrologists, and a network
    model for the broader environment. Hence, it is emphasized that although there
    is continual and improving design of sensor nodes for individual applications
    there is still a requirement for more flexibility in node design with a view to
    allowing networks to successfully interact with each other. In the absence of
    affordable and reliable in situ sensors for WQM, measurements rely on surrogate
    sensors which give proxy measurements. Therefore, it is concluded that there is
    still a need for accurate, inexpensive and miniature sensors with a long field
    life for WQM. Nevertheless, developments on all these areas are on-going, and
    as such deficiencies are addressed, the ability to monitor at catchment scales
    will improve. We argue that by implementing a collaborative mechanism that allows
    every stakeholder the option to contribute and use any data flowing through the
    networks, the overall value of that information will be increased. References

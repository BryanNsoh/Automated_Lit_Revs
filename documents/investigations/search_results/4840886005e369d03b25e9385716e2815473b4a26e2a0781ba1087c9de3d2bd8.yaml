    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    Abstract Digitalization provides access to an integrated network of unexploited
    big data with potential benefits for society and the environment. The development
    of smart systems connected to the internet of things can generate unique opportunities
    to strategically address challenges associated with the United Nations Sustainable
    Development Goals (SDGs) to ensure an equitable, environmentally sustainable,
    and healthy society. This perspective describes the opportunities that digitalization
    can provide towards building the sustainable society of the future. Smart technologies
    are envisioned as game-changing tools, whereby their integration will benefit
    the three essential elements of the food-water-energy nexus: (i) sustainable food
    production; (ii) access to clean and safe potable water; and (iii) green energy
    generation and usage. It then discusses the benefits of digitalization to catalyze
    the transition towards sustainable manufacturing practices and enhance citizens''
    health wellbeing by providing digital access to care, particularly for the underserved
    communities. Finally, the perspective englobes digitalization benefits by providing
    a holistic view on how it can contribute to address the serious challenges of
    endangered planet biodiversity and climate change. Graphical abstract Download

    1. Introduction The world is transitioning through the digitalization era in which
    most of our daily activities are highly dependent on innovative digital and computer
    technologies. These contemporary technologies have got their applications in socio-economic,
    environmental, sustainable, and climate research applications to enhance the productivity
    and efficiency of a given system (Balogun et al., 2020; Ceipek et al., 2020).
    Digitalization is the integration of digital technologies into everyday life.
    Such integration is possible by the digitization of information. Digitization
    is defined as the process of converting physically collected information (e.g.,
    sensors, written information, etc.) and knowledge into a computer-readable language.
    The tedious effort of digitizing information gathered over centuries (including
    paintings, images, and video formats) has given valuable fruits propelled by information
    technologies. The benefits resulting from digitalization contributed to the development
    of tools and sensors throughout integrated into the internet of things (IoT) environment.
    The IoT is a robust network of physical objects connected over internet through
    embedded sensors, software, and other technologies that enable interchange and
    collection of data. The convergence of simultaneously developed technologies for
    real-time analysis, machine learning, and artificial intelligence manages a massive
    amount of data, also known as big data. The high value of these massive data sets
    generated is not yet fully exploited but generates unique opportunities to catalyze
    the transition to more efficient and sustainable smart integrated cities. Digitalization
    brings a new set of tools that have to be carefully balanced to ensure smart application
    and their green character. The capability of making well-informed decisions to
    use more efficiently resources and services has a significant impact on sustainability
    and equal access (Appio et al., 2021; Ardito et al., 2018), but several challenges
    cannot be overlooked to ensure successful achievement of these goals. Development
    and manufacturing of electronic devices are depleting limited resources and generating
    e-waste (unwanted electronic products, not working, and nearing or at the end
    of their “useful life”) that is being hardly recycled (Ahirwar and Tripathi, 2021;
    Dhir et al., 2021). Considering life-cycle and developing e-waste recycling technologies
    is an urgent need. The necessity of better infrastructure is another challenge
    that may widen the gap between developed and developing regions instead of narrowing
    it. There is a need to ensure infrastructure and equal internet access to achieve
    the holistic goal of reducing inequalities and poverty, aligning with the need
    to provide digital education to the final users (Habibi and Zabardast, 2020; Lopez-Sintas
    et al., 2020; Matthess and Kunkel, 2020). Finally, data security is one of the
    major concerns on big-data sources'' wide accessibility and openness. Data security
    is a sensitive topic that generates debate associated to safety risks and network
    integrity of these digitalized services (Craig, 2018; Reveron and Savage, 2020).
    These challenges have to be considered but should not have to be seen as barriers
    to digitalization''s applicability to face sustainable challenges from an applied
    perspective. The United Nations (UN) defined in 2015 a roadmap towards equity
    and sustainable development with a horizon set in 2030 (United Nations, 2018).
    These so-called Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identify 17 existing challenges
    that should be overcome to reach this ambitious global goal: (1) No poverty, (2)
    Zero hunger, (3) Good health and wellbeing, (4) Quality education, (5) Gender
    equality, (6) Clean water and sanitation, (7) Affordable and clean energy, (8)
    Decent work and economic growth, (9) Industry, innovation and infrastructure,
    (10) Reduced inequalities, (11) Sustainable cities and communities, (12) Responsible
    consumption and production, (13) Climate action, (14) Life below water, (15) Life
    on land, (16) Peace, justice and strong institutions, and (17) Partnership for
    the goals. These interlinked SDGs present the urgent needs of our civilization
    to ensure a sustainable and competitive future. The creative development of digital
    tools to generate, use, transmit, or source electronic data for organizational
    activities can be used to achieve SDGs. These tools that contribute to achieving
    these specific targets could be defined as digital sustainability. Digital Sustainability
    is understood as the effort of developing and deploying smart technologies to
    secure sustainable economic growth while considering and integrating the SDGs.
    Modern digital innovations like artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques
    have seen exponential growth in their value, estimated to add around 14% to the
    global economy by 2030 (George et al., 2020; Magistretti et al., 2019). In this
    perspective, we explore how digitalization can pave the way towards sustainable
    development, which is essential to create a Smart Green Planet that provides resources
    while protecting the environment and health of all the planet''s inhabitants.

    protection. It is also considered the holistic, sustainable impacts resulting
    from the correlated benefits of all these actions. In this article, we explore
    how digitalization can assist in attaining SDGs in different sectors such as (i)
    food-water-energy nexus, (ii) industry, (iii) citizens'' health and wellbeing,
    (iv) climate change and biodiversity protection. Fig. 2 summarizes the different
    sections of this perspective with emphasis on the specific aspects addressed for
    the different SDGs. Each big topic is framed to answer a holistic question regarding
    how digitalization can lead the change towards a more sustainable and balanced
    society for each challenge. We will specifically discuss digitalization tools
    implemented in specific areas with the direct aim to benefit said sector and to
    tackle said SDGs. Even though it is important to remark the tight correlations
    and interlinks between the different areas that become hard to differentiate.
    For example, effects resulting from the food-water-energy nexus directly impact
    the wellbeing of citizens of smart cities. Therefore, it is assessed and discussed
    how digitalization aids in sustaining the main pillars of our civilization in
    the food-water-energy nexus, the benefits of industrial manufacturing, and the
    relevance for human health and wellbeing. The perspective ends with a discussion
    centered on the benefits of digitalization to protect biodiversity and mitigate
    climate change. Download : Download high-res image (382KB) Download : Download

    sustainable development goal addressed in this perspective. 2. Will digital technologies
    redefine the future of agriculture and food production systems? The ever-growing
    global demand for food, feed, fiber, and clean energy increases pressure on the
    agroecosystems. Increased stress adversely affects agroecosystems'' natural resilience,
    and it is expected to result in unprecedented environmental changes on a global
    scale (Okolo et al., 2019). Changing climatic conditions are accompanied by high
    and low heat stress, altered rainfall pattern, elevated carbon dioxide, increased
    frequency of extreme weather events like droughts, floods, cyclonic disturbances,
    and increased saline soils. These effects result in inflation of production costs,
    pest infestation and disease incidences which collectively add pressure on global
    agricultural land (Abhilash and Dubey, 2014; Lobell et al., 2012). Owing to the
    rising demand for food, the stressed supply chains, and diminishing soil carbon
    levels are depicting a daunting task for future generations to meet the nutritional
    requirements of 9.7 billion people by 2050. The advent of digital technologies
    within agriculture is a ray of hope on the horizon. Digital technologies are up-scaling
    the sustainable management of agricultural land and resources as well as strengthening
    the associated productivity, services, and livelihood security worldwide as summarized
    in Table 1. Crop variety, plot, and field-specific sustainable agricultural practices
    are being developed (Dubey et al., 2019; Okolo et al., 2019) and data generated
    from promising practices should be maintained and analyzed through digital technologies.
    Digitalization has made rapid strides within the agricultural sector, making its
    presence felt in varying dimensions such as land assessment, soil-crop suitability,
    weather information, crop-growth, biomass and productivity, precision farming,
    along with the various stages of the agriculture supply chain (processing, packaging,
    delivery, consumption, and agro-waste management). Digitalization adds multipurpose
    benefits to global agriculture via real-time monitoring, common fingertip-based
    smartphones and computers, and satellite and weather information-based consultation.
    These IoT technologies can alert and allow planning to deal with upcoming challenges
    such as pest infestation and/or disease outbreaks. Digital technologies also help
    select high yield-oriented optimum practices, precise resource inputs, less production
    cost with the better nutritional quality of agricultural produces, geo-tagging
    for precise prophecy, vigorous and elastic farming methods, crop data management,
    post-harvest services, and agro-based industries. Various technologies like remote
    sensing, Geographic Information System (GIS), smart-phone, robotics, artificial
    intelligence, genomics, bioinformatics and big data-based digital technologies
    are being utilized for attaining the target of agricultural sustainability (Basso
    and Antle, 2020) and the targets of United Nations SDGs (United Nations, 2018)
    (Fig. 3). Under digitalization, application of various hardware (sensors, ground
    robot, drones, nursery automation, robotics, robotics-based irrigation, precise
    fertilization at the base between densely grown crops, automated tractors for
    crop harvesting), software (geo-mapping, computer imaging technology), and their
    combination (micro-spraying robots for targeted herbicide application, automated
    weed uprooting and pruning robotics with computer imaging) are already being employed.
    Details and implications of the internet of agricultural things-based technologies
    are described in the following subsections that define promising opportunities
    enabled by digitalization. Table 1. Application of digital technologies in providing

    and their efficacies for improving the global agricultural sustainability, healthy

    Development Goals (UN-SDGs). 2.1. Remote sensing and GIS-based technologies for
    sustainable management of agricultural land Remote sensing (RS) and GIS techniques
    offer various solutions starting from crop species identification, farm and landscape-level
    sustainable management of farming systems, to policy formulation (Basso and Antle,
    2020). Thus, increasing agri-productions, resource conservation, above-belowground
    biodiversity, gender equality, and farmers'' empowerment opportunities could be
    achieved by integrating these modern digital tools. Integration of RS-GIS, Fuzzy-logic,
    and multicriteria assessment using the Analytical Hierarchy Process generate a
    superior database and a guide map for effective land-use patterns, crop variety,
    planning, monitoring of agroecosystem activities, and decision making with several
    examples summarized in Table 1. These integration techniques have quick and efficient
    access to a large amount of information, revealing relationships, patterns, and
    useful trends for combining soil survey information for better land-use suitability
    assessment (Singha and Swain, 2016). Research has demonstrated the benefits of
    implementing these techniques as a viable alternative for highly productive and
    stable agricultural systems over time. Smart integration of GIS-based technology
    promises better farming systems to production areas with enhanced resilience while
    mitigating climate change. For instance, GIS-remote sensing tools have been utilized
    in citrus orchards in China where digital mapping and modeling-based knowledge
    of area topography, land-use, soil types, climatic conditions, and altitude predicted
    the suitable area for citrus cropping and their sustainable management from field
    to end-users (Wu et al., 2011). The RS data helps decipher the spatiotemporal
    characteristics of the land exceptionally, including the impact of the environment
    on the growth of crops. According to Al-Gaadi et al., the GIS-RS technology and
    models (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, Spectral Reflectance, Fraction
    of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation, LandSAT Enhanced Thematic Mapper,
    Environmental Policy Integrated Climate models, Terra Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer) have been explored for improving the sustainability of potato
    production (Al-Gaadi et al., 2016). The use of advanced multispectral images in
    RS was highlighted as an effective monitoring tool for determining vegetation
    dynamics, plant health, and predicting crop yield under different practices (Al-Gaadi
    et al., 2016). Hence, decisions related to quantitative export and import of the
    product within the region could be made assuredly to strengthen the net economic
    benefits to the farming community. Through GIS-RS-based technologies, farm operators
    are provided with precision maps, information on crops, estimation of fields,
    and soil characteristics, which are beneficial for producers of the government,
    as they can provide the necessary projects to support the farmers. Besides, these
    systems provide better information on climatic parameters for the development
    of heat and drought-resilient crop varieties via different breeding approaches
    (Faloon et al., 2015). Also, GIS-RS equipped with Revised Universal Soil Loss
    Equation models helped explain the susceptibility to severe soil erosion in Syria
    with a soil loss of more than 109 tons ha−1 yr−1 by generating a map for soil
    degradation (Abdo and Salloum, 2017). Around 104–627 kg ha−1 plastic materials
    including synthetic polymers, are being used in agriculture in varied processes
    like mulching, hail protection, crop protection, shading nets and in irrigation
    support. Sustainable management of land and crops along-with soil biodiversity
    sustenance requires the regular removal of these polymers. Here again, readily
    updatable GIS-based databases and maps have been used to identify the extent of
    plastic in farms, delineate the place for plastic collection and develop a monitoring
    and decision-making system for the identification and collection followed by their
    proper delivery to the recycling companies (Blanco et al., 2018). The involvement
    of geoinformatics and decision support systems in precision irrigation plays a
    significant role in sustainable water management and is crucial for those countries
    where water is a scarce or highly limited resource and in arid and semi-arid areas.
    However, this technique requires combining large sets of precise and highly accurate
    data about land characteristics and water resources. Factors such as the high
    cost of maintenance and calibration of the sensors make its implementation tiresome,
    especially in developing countries. Although these technologies are still a challenge
    for many countries, the availability of open-source geospatial platforms like
    QGIS and R open up new possibilities for their application in low-income systems.
    Active stakeholder engagement is further required to highlight the accessibility
    and feasibility of such GIS software to the rest of the farming community and
    supply chain members. The world is in an era where online information is becoming
    more prosperous, with multiple applications for phones, computers, and other devices
    being launched. Scientific interventions can further boost the integration of
    emerging digital technologies within agricultural practices, offering several
    opportunities to significantly improve the social, economic and environmental
    sustainability of food production systems. 2.2. APP based agricultural services
    and climate-smart agriculture Globally, agricultural transformation is proceeding
    rapidly, with Information Communications Technology (ICT) and digitization being
    the central players behind this novel transformation. The use of mobile application
    software by almost all agricultural stakeholders enhances resource use efficiency
    and equally helps reduce costs associated with production while simultaneously
    increasing yields and net economic return (Qiang et al., 2011) with several examples
    collected in Table 1. The use of mobile-based apps by farming, scientific and
    technical professionals is enabling information access related to climate-smart
    agricultural (CSA) practices. The integration of digitalized access is assists
    in decision-making during production and subsequent stages of the supply chain.
    According to Global System for Mobile Communications Association real-time intelligence
    data, more than 5.2 billion people (~68% of the world''s population) have access
    to mobile devices worldwide. Globally, the current cellular phone users surpass
    3 billion, projected to grow by several hundred million in the next few years.
    The effectiveness of mobile phones/Apps and their implication in disseminating
    agricultural information to farmers have been validated (Mittal and Mehar, 2016).
    However, the use of ICT in agriculture does not always lead to higher yields and
    profits for every farmer (Eitzinger et al., 2019). Thus, despite the positive
    results of mobile applications in improving smallholder agriculture (Tata and
    McNamara, 2018), many farmers are still left in the “dark” owing to lack of technology
    access, especially in rural communities of developing countries (Eitzinger et
    al., 2019). Notably, vital impediments that hinder digitalization in agriculture
    (i.e., use of mobile phone/Apps and ICT), especially among smallholder farmers
    in a rural context, include lack of connectivity, missing digital capability,
    poor usability of ICT applications, and digital illiteracy (Eitzinger et al.,
    2019; Mittal and Mehar, 2016). Failure to address these shortcomings will eventually
    lead to farmers facing a new era of digital poverty. More importantly, recognition
    of the local context of connectivity, user''s capacities, synchronization with
    local dialects, and socio-cultural backgrounds should be focused upon as the new
    ICT cutting-edge initiatives with the potential to avoid the impending digital
    poverty among smallholder farmers (Aker et al., 2016; Eitzinger et al., 2019).
    Rising agricultural production, food security, and livelihood of millions of people
    across the globe are being threatened by climate change. Agriculture is a significant
    contributor to greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions and global warming (Gebresamuel
    et al., 2021). Digital technologies-based climate-smart agriculture (CSA) practices
    that integrated the benefits of sustainable production, climate resilience, and
    reduced GHGs emissions appear to be very promising and offer a potential solution
    to existing problems (Abegunde et al., 2020). However, despite the various benefits
    of CSA technologies, farmers'' current adoption rate is relatively low. Factors
    such as the socio-economic characteristics of farmers, the biophysical environment
    of a particular location, and the attributes of new technologies influence the
    adoption of CSA technologies (Bu and Wang, 2019; Deressa et al., 2011). Food systems
    must undergo significant digital transformation to meet the ever-growing challenges
    of food security and climate change. From a sustainability perspective, adoption
    of APP-based agricultural services with location-specific CSA practices could
    be the major driver of cleaner and greener agriculture, which is also an agenda
    for global sustainable development. 2.3. Precision agriculture, robotics, and
    artificial intelligence Precision agriculture is a farming practice undertaken
    at an accurate place under specific timing rather than uniform adoption across
    the field. Lesser ecological risks, higher crop yield (reduced global hunger),
    and economic gains (reduced poverty) to the farming communities are the fundamental
    attributes of precision agriculture. Precision agriculture employs robotics, artificial
    intelligence, and deep learning processes for the next generation and is climate-smart
    sustainable agriculture practice. Modern unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones
    enabled for providing hyper-class remote-sensing spatiotemporal and spectral records
    can solve the multifarious problems associated with agroecosystems, farming community
    and strengthen the path of precision agriculture. The UAVs contain various sensors
    for predicting the real-time information on drought, soil nutrient, plant growth,
    yield, disease, pesticide and weed, pest, weather parameters, soil type, moisture
    content, and spray pesticide and fertilizer (Maes and Steppe, 2019; Vasconez et
    al., 2019). Thermal imagery, combined thermal with hyper-spectral data, entity-based
    imaging, and UAVs models could be the better technologies for revealing the drought
    stress, pathogen, weed, nutrient status, and yield. Artificial intelligence has
    also proven to improve the impact of precision agriculture. For instance, integration
    of advanced artificial intelligence models, deep reinforcement learning, information,
    and cloud technology has the potential to conserve critical agricultural resources
    while enhancing food production and sustainability (Bu and Wang, 2019). The national
    governing bodies also adopt the advents of these integrated technologies for the
    betterment of advisory and data availability to the farming community (http://agricoop.nic.in).
    In another research, artificial intelligence developed several expert systems
    for the cotton plant such as COMAX (Cotton Management eXpert) and COTFLEX that
    provide decision-making information to farmers. Similarly, SOYGRO and PRITHVI
    expert system provides information regarding insect attacks and pesticides used
    for the soybean crop (Jha et al., 2019). Artificial intelligence enabled machine
    learning technologies and the internet of agricultural things. Wireless communications
    are increasing the farm knowledge system and decision making for better management
    of agriculture. Additionally, precision agriculture is growing faster because
    of rapid research and development of cheaper sensors, better control, and computer
    imaging systems with evolving artificial intelligence. Consequently, a myriad
    of semi and autonomous, unmanned ground vehicles or ground robotics are being
    successfully applied in seedbed grounding, irrigation, spraying, pruning, harvesting,
    real-time monitoring, and mapping for saving resources, finances, and the environment
    (Vasconez et al., 2019). In precision agriculture, data expressed in the form
    of different names such as Digital Farming, Agriculture 5.0 and Smart Farming
    enhances the accuracy of farm operation and helps in making critical operational
    decisions. For example, remote sensing technologies such as American Landsat satellites,
    European Sentinel 2 satellite system, Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) satellites,
    RapidEye constellation, GeoEye-1 system, WorldView series, and IKONOS provide
    agricultural information that helps in sustainable planning and management of
    agriculture. Some other examples of robotic technology such as Vinbot, VineRobot,
    VineScout, and GRAPE have crop sensing devices and afford multi-season ground-truth
    justification of vineyards. Furthermore, Naïo Technologies and RowBot Systems
    LLC are interesting robotics platforms. The first is associated with mechanical
    weeding, and the latter is used for selective application of fertilizer, mapping
    crop growth, and other field related tasks. The field-level geographic Information
    System (FIS) provides satisfactory information for implementation, operational
    planning, and documentation for the management of farming systems (Saiz-Rubio
    and Rovira-Más, 2020). 2.4. Role of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data in
    sustainable food productions Previously, genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    were inclined to explore the elementary processes of the life and biological sciences.
    However, nowadays, digital technologies-based omics and data science are performing
    far better in agri-sciences for improving the crop yield, nutritional quality,
    stress tolerance, and combating the negative impact of climate change. Global
    projections demonstrate that a one-degree upsurge in global average temperature
    could reduce the crop-yield of maize, wheat, rice, and soybean by 7.4, 6, 3.2,
    and 3.1%, respectively (Zhao et al., 2017). Therefore, extensive knowledge of
    crop genomics is essential to develop climate-smart, resource-efficient and high-yielding
    crop varieties. Furthermore, multiple draft genomes are being assembled for various
    cereals (Oryza sativa, Setaria italic, Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Zea
    mays), legumes (Cicer arietinum, Cajanus cajan, Glycine max, Phaseolus vulgaris,
    Vigna radiata), oilseeds (Brassica napus, Camelina sativa, Elaeis guineensis,
    Ricinus communis), vegetables (Brassica oleracea, Brassica rapa, Carica papaya,
    Capsicum annum, Cucumis sativus, Solanum lycopersicum, Solanum melongena, Solanum
    tuberosum) and fruits (Citrullus lanatus, Citrus clementina, Citrus sinensis,
    Cucumis melo, Fragaria vesca, Musa acuminate, Phoenix dactylifera, Prunus mume,
    Pyrus bretschneideri, Vitis vinifera) (Thottathil et al., 2016) as well as for
    their wild crop relatives (Chang et al., 2019) and based on their identified genomic
    traits various crop varieties can be developed with desired traits. Vast volumes
    of data gathered from the genomics mentioned above, proteomics, and metabolomics
    are managed through various bioinformatics-based tools and databases that ultimately
    store all information through computing and cloud technology. Bioinformatics tools
    are computer-based information technology that decodes the enormous digital data
    in agricultural sciences. Examples of dedicated databases for improving the crop
    traits are Integrated Breeding (https://www.integratedbreeding.net/), Wheat Barely
    and Oat Germplasm (https://triticeaetoolbox.org), Wheat Information System (http://wheatis.org/),
    Wheat Genome Information (http://www.wheatgenome.info), Rice-Informatics (http://iric.irri.org/),
    Rice Genome Data (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oryzabase (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/rice/oryzabase/),
    Rice Genome Annotation Project (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/), Oil-seed Proteomics
    (http://www.oilseedproteomics.missouri.edu/), Maize Genome Database (http://www.maizegdb.org/),
    and the International Crop Information System (ICIS) (http://www.icis.cgiar.org),
    among others. As evident application of genomics, bioinformatics, and big data
    play a crucial role in improving the crop agronomic traits such as abiotic stress
    tolerance, insect resistance, herbicide tolerance, higher grain yield, plant height,
    and weight and crop nutrient content of the crops, which in turn helps in maintaining
    the food and nutritional security (Batley and Edwards, 2016). Varshney et al.
    (2020) have proposed 5Gs crop breeding approaches consisting of a crop-specific
    gene assembly followed by genome and agronomic trait-based characterization of
    germplasm, gene identification combined with functional annotation, genomic breeding,
    and gene editing for improving climate-resilient high yielding, nutrient-rich
    crop varieties. Moreover, in precision genome editing technology, CRISPR-Cas9
    helps develop the disease, drought, and herbicide tolerant crops with better plant
    defense against the virus, bioactive compound production, crop yield, and nutritional
    quality. In integration, CRISPR-Cas9 with multiple targeting sgRNAs serves as
    an appropriate genome editing tool that increases nutrient content in wheat, maize,
    rice, tomato, and sweet orange. The aforesaid mentioned integrated technology
    had been proven to combat the bean yellow dwarf virus (BeYDV), tomato yellow leaf
    curl virus (TYLCV), and Beet Severe Curly Top geminivirus (BSCTV) infection by
    editing the viral genome. Using CRISPR-Cas9 can cause a mutation in TaMLO-A1 and
    TaMLO-B1 gene of wheat, OsERF922 gene of rice and SIDMR6–1 gene of tomato, increasing
    the resistance against the powdery mildew, rice blast and Xanthomonas spp. in
    wheat, rice, and tomato, respectively. Similarly, CRISPER based genome editing
    tool has modified the ARGOS8 gene locus in maize for enhancing the grain yield
    even under drought stress. Moreover, the mutation in acetolactate synthase genes
    ALS1 and ALS2 have increased the resistance against chlorsulfuron herbicides in
    maize (Eş et al., 2019). These examples highlight the application of information,
    computing, and cloud-based digital technologies in digging and improving the crop
    genomic traits for agricultural sustainability. Besides, various computational
    algorithm-based agricultural system modeling approaches are also being utilized
    extensively for sustainable land management. These models provide a robust prediction
    approach for crop yield, soil nutrient cycling, resource use efficiency, GHGs
    emission, ecosystem services, pest and disease mediated damage, food security,
    livestock production, agroecosystems responses to global climate change and policy
    assessment (Holzworth et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017) across the various global
    agroecological zones and socioeconomic conditions. Further decision-making systems
    use the knowledge of such models and other computer-based algorithms for enhancing
    the sustainability of agro-practices at plot, field, agroecosystems, landscape,
    national, and global scale. In addition to genomics and bioinformatics, information,
    and communication technology uses various massive, heterogeneous, and unstructured
    data (also known as big data) through the internet and cloud computing. These
    provide insight into the decision-making aspects of the smart farming system.
    Computational scripts allow us to analyze such big data in an integrated manner
    to optimize agricultural productivity and food supply chains. There are multiple
    robotics systems with heterogeneous nature of data in a single smart farming practice.
    These data now became accessible to the users through Application Programming
    Interfaces (APIs) technology. Similarly, technology and data start-ups-based different
    datasets can be combined through open standards (e.g., ISOBUS). Farmobile, a recently
    introduced hardware (passive-uplink communicator) can record all data from robotics;
    store it in the database, and transmit the data using a wireless system. Another
    example of big data analysis can be achieved through Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK)
    that provides farm management information via cheaper, readily accessible, user-friendly
    mobiles and stores data on the cloud. Likewise, in Europe, the FIWARE GEs application
    helps in big data analysis utilizing cloud technology, data collection, and secured
    information technology that opens up multiple options to identify socio-economic
    challenges and provide real-time operational decisions, thereby reducing the economic
    risks involved in the sustainable farming system (Wolfert et al., 2017). However,
    although all previously mentioned digital technologies are rapidly gaining influx
    and witnessing an upsurge in usage within developed nations, they are yet to gain
    ground within developing countries and could prove crucial in achieving the agriculture
    related targets of the various SDGs (no poverty; SDG1, zero hunger; SDG2, good
    health and wellbeing; SDG3, clean water and sanitation; SDG6, industry innovation
    and infrastructure; SDG9, sustainable cities and communities; SDG11 responsible
    consumption and productions; SDG 12, climate action; SDG13, life below water;
    SDG 14, life on land; SDG 15, etc. for global sustainable development) (Dubey
    et al., 2020; Moomen et al., 2019). 3. Can digitalization catalyze strategies
    to ensure clean water for all? 3.1. Artificial intelligence and data mining-assisted
    approaches for optimal design and control of water treatment systems Water treatment
    systems (WTSs), such as wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), drinking water treatment
    plants (DWTPs), and desalination plants, are complex systems that integrate different
    processes to remove pollutants, impurities, and salts from target water bodies
    (Asadi et al., 2017; Heck et al., 2019; Ming-Yang, 2013). The traditional design
    of WTSs relies on expert knowledge of different treatment processes and cannot
    be efficiently generalized. Generalization has lead to oversized designs of treatment
    units and improper selection of treatment processes, which increases capital expenditures
    and influences the final product water quality. Conventional operation of WTSs
    employs instrumentation, control, and automation (ICA) techniques, but sometimes
    fault signals from instruments without regular maintenance may lead to failure
    responses to the system''s control (Qiu et al., 2018). Most of central control
    systems in WTSs are only capable of acquiring data rather than processing data
    to guide subsequent actions due to the workforce lacking knowledge in data science
    (Newhart et al., 2019). The underutilization of the big data in WTSs would lead
    to the unnecessary increase in operating costs and sometimes inefficient treatment.
    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been increasingly
    applied to translate the passive data into actionable knowledge to improve the
    WTSs operation and support decision-making (Al Aani et al., 2019; Corominas et
    al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013; Li et al., 2021). The use of the AI approach to
    optimize the design and control of water treatment systems can be dated back to
    three decades ago (Krovvidy et al., 1991; Zvi, 1992). An early review outlined
    the difficulties of the expert system approach, which is based on advanced mathematical
    techniques and was prevalently used for operational control of WWTP in the early
    days, in acquiring and representing knowledge of the complex phenomena (Zvi, 1992).
    It highlighted the advantages of AI techniques particularly the artificial neural
    networks (ANN) in water and wastewater plant modeling, expert rule extraction,
    fault detection and diagnosis, plant and instrument monitoring, dynamic forecasting,
    and robust control (Zvi, 1992). One of the earliest studies using the AI approach
    to design a water treatment system proposed two phases: the analysis and synthesis
    phases (Krovvidy et al., 1991). In the analysis phase, an inductive learning algorithm
    and expert rules are arranged together to evaluate the treatment efficiency of
    several compounds at different concentrations by an individual treatment process.
    In the synthesis phase, the sequence of different treatment processes satisfying
    the treatment targets are obtained using the knowledge rules generated from the
    analysis phase via the neural network method. This study laid a foundation for
    the later decision support system (DSS) development to select and sequence water
    treatment processes, and design treatment facilities (Hamouda et al., 2009). Fig.
    4 shows the typical four-stage DSS for WTSs design involving AI techniques, including
    water treatment problem analysis and interpretation, developing reasoning models,
    process sequential decision optimization, validating DSS logic, and enhancing
    user interactivity (Hamouda et al., 2009). In a recent study, the optimization
    of WWTPs design was realized via the data mining and AI techniques such as artificial
    neural network and fuzzy logic, following an integral procedure including data
    collection and cleaning, data warehouse, data mining, and web user interface (Qiu
    et al., 2018). Download : Download high-res image (353KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Stages of developing a water treatment decision support
    system. Figure adopted from (Hamouda et al., 2009). Apart from the design of the
    WTSs, the optimal control and operation of the WTSs are equally important to maximize
    technical benefits and cost savings. During the treatment processes, vast volumes
    of data are generated and some are monitored online and collected simultaneously
    via various sensing technologies. Data-mining techniques are incorporated into
    sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create knowledge on plant malfunctioning
    (Corominas et al., 2018; Haimi et al., 2013). Advanced information extraction
    and Human-interpretable information extraction based on AI and data-mining techniques
    are further developed to transform the data into useful information and knowledge
    for the effective control and optimization of operation of WTSs (Corominas et
    al., 2018). Newhart et al. summarized the data-driven technologies used in WWTPs
    for the purpose of fault detection, variable prediction, and advanced automated
    control to reduce energy consumption, ensure product water quality and prevent
    system failure (Fig. 5) (Newhart et al., 2019). Li et al. reviewed AI and machine
    learning for nonlinear relationship analysis and process control for DWTPs (Li
    et al., 2021). They specifically introduced the current status of these data-driven
    technologies in each treatment unit from source water quality monitoring and identification
    to the accurate and efficient control of each treatment unit, such as the control
    and prediction of coagulation dosage, the analysis of the formation of disinfection
    by-products, and the advanced control of membrane fouling. Some recent cases were
    reported on the use of machine learning to develop model soft-sensor for predictive
    control of WWTPs (Bernardelli et al., 2020; Hernández-del-Olmo et al., 2019).
    AI and machine learning techniques have also exhibited promise to revolutionize
    the automation of the desalination process, especially in the renewable energy-driven
    desalination processes (Al Aani et al., 2019). Cabrera et al. (Cabrera et al.,
    2018) compared three machine learning techniques, namely artificial neural networks
    (ANN), support vector machines (SVM), and random forests (RF), in predicting the
    wind-driven seawater desalination performance (Fig. 6). They found that (1) SVM
    and RF are significantly better to predict the plant''s performances than neural
    networks, and (2) variable pressure and flow operating mode are more continuous
    than constant pressure and flow mode. Without focusing exclusively on either AI
    techniques or a conventional expert system approach, a recent study proposed a
    hybrid statistical machine learning method to improve the accuracy in predicting
    ammonia in municipal wastewater treatment (Newhart et al., 2020). This study provided
    a new perspective to develop new and rigorous treatment models by integrating
    conventional statistical methods and advanced AI methods. Download : Download

    developed to compare the three machine learning techniques in wind-driven seawater
    desalination plant. Figure adapted from (Cabrera et al., 2018). Despite the promise
    of AI techniques for predictive and optimal control of WTSs, the utilization of
    these advanced data techniques is constrained by some conditions. For example,
    although the data do not need to be linearly correlated or parametrically distributed,
    those monitored variables must have a high sample frequency and number of historical
    observations (Newhart et al., 2019). Some challenges for using these advanced
    techniques are also identified, such as (1) difficulties in the acquisition of
    useful data in complex environment for screening and identifying targeted contaminants,
    and (2) challenges on the establishment of a macro intelligence model and decision
    scheme for entire treatment plants to support the overall management in the water
    supply system (Li et al., 2021). 3.2. Integration of water sensing to ensure water
    quality and protect public health Water of drinking quality is a fait accompli
    that is being placed at stake due to increasing water quality violations (Dettori
    et al., 2019; “US Water Quality Wake-Up Call: Americans Report Increase in Instances
    of Water Contamination,” 2019). For instance, The American Society of Civil Engineers
    evaluated America''s actual condition of water infrastructure with “D” grade (ASCE,
    2017). However, water quality violations are an endemic problem worldwide that
    becomes more concerning in developing areas. Recent examples of significant quality
    violations are the Flint water crisis (i.e., lead contamination from aging pipes)
    (Morckel, 2017), the pressing problems associated with per- and polyfluoroalkyl
    substances (PFASs) in water (Sima and Jaffé, 2021), the high arsenic levels in
    drinking water sources (Gifford et al., 2018; Rahman et al., 2018), cyanotoxins
    blooms (Serrà et al., 2021), or water disinfection needs at point of use (Chu
    et al., 2019; Montenegro-Ayo et al., 2020). The variable water quality arises
    as a severe health threat for users. Smart cities of the future should warrant
    accessible water of the highest quality to all their citizens that meets maximum
    concentration levels defined by the World Health Organization. Water is one of
    the pivotal components that will define the smart cities of the future. Smart
    water refers to the holistic approach to manage this resource, related infrastructure,
    treatment, and delivery (Wu et al., 2020). As cities invest in updating old-fashioned
    infrastructure, it is the possibility to integrate internet-enabled tools and
    emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point of delivery
    or point of use). Real-time water quality audits at critical control points can
    define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate to ensure
    public health (Richard et al., 2020). Integrating such neural networks between
    information technology and modular on/off treatment systems can become a game-changer
    for ensuring access to water of drinking quality for all. There is an existing
    need to develop and deploy artificial intelligence systems that identify a water
    quality issue (e.g., high nitrate levels, bacteria presence, etc.) and activate
    immediate action for its remediation. Such Smart Actions will ensure sustainable
    and healthy environments in cities. 4. How can digitalization address energy challenges?
    The energy sector faces several challenges that range from well-known old dilemmas,
    such as overcoming barriers for the grid integration of the ever-fluctuating renewable
    energy resources, adapting the offer to the demand, or increasing the efficiency
    of the energy processes in the industry, to facing new foreseeable issues, such
    as addressing the upcoming increasing energy demands derived from the spread of
    digitalization worldwide (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019), and the security issues
    that may be derived from an interconnected energy generation system (Ebrahimy
    et al., 2018). Digitalization opens a broad range of exciting possibilities as
    in any technological revolution but brings, inevitably, a series of concerns.
    Digitalization is expected to increase the sustainability of our energy systems,
    spread electricity to remote areas, and improve the way we use it. However, digitalization
    may also open the door to novel challenges for our energy systems, for which we
    need to be prepared. In the following sections, we discuss how digitalization
    will impact the sustainability of energy systems by addressing its role in the
    integration of renewable resources, its smart management in the complexity of
    our energy systems puzzles, its use to optimize energy in the ever-insatiable
    industrial sector, and the needs for storage systems that its use will bring,
    as an essential part to fulfill the former targets. 4.1. Renewable energy sources
    and distributed electricity generation The conventional electricity grid is designed
    around centralized generation. As such, large power plants are used to generate
    electricity, typically powered by fossil fuels. Subsequently, the electricity
    is sent through the transmission lines to consumers, providing, essentially, a
    one-way flow of electricity in the grid. However, even in this situation, digitalization
    has been a key for a few years. For example, detailed modeling is performed daily
    to predict electricity demand based on weather conditions, climatology, or societal
    habits (i.e., when people come home from work to cook dinner, large events such
    as football matches, and even advertisement breaks which drive people towards
    their fridge). As such, and despite few events that may cause over-generation
    of electricity, supply and demand can be managed with high accuracy. However,
    the introduction of scalable renewable energy technologies such as wind and solar
    have shaken up the system by introducing the concept of distributed energy generation.
    There are several potential benefits of distributed electricity generation. First,
    electricity can be generated close to where it is needed. This is particularly
    the case of rooftop solar photovoltaics (PV), where consumers can generate their
    own electricity or become electricity generators for other households. Second,
    it avoids the need to upgrade infrastructure by avoiding transmission losses.
    Furthermore, some distributed generation sources closely match the demand (e.g.,
    solar with the demand for air-conditioning load on a hot summer day). As such,
    distributed generation can help reduce one of the biggest costs to electricity
    networks, which need to have transmission lines over-dimensioned to accommodate
    the highest demand of the year placed on the overall transmission system. Third,
    generation only needs to compete against the retail cost of electricity, not the
    wholesale cost, providing potential savings and investment opportunities for consumers.
    Nevertheless, the use of distributed energy systems, intermittent in nature, requires
    further digitalization of existing systems to accurately model the contribution
    of individual electricity supplies into the grid, and their dynamics due, for
    instance, to changing weather conditions. Digitalization, including distributed
    generators modeling, projections of energy demand, and smart control for energy
    savings, is therefore needed to help ensure the grid''s stability in terms of
    both voltage and frequency, which is disrupted by the asynchronous nature of the
    renewable energy systems. Hence, the transition to distributed energy systems
    that renewable resources bring will imply a more critical role of digitalization.
    Moreover, consumers may benefit from increased digitalization of energy systems,
    as, for instance, the shift to smart digital meters can encourage them to avoid
    the use of electricity during peak times (Maglakelidze et al., 2019). Additionally,
    smart energy management can be used for intermittent electricity generation and
    supply in households, for example, choosing when to heat hot water (i.e., which
    can be seen as a thermal battery) instead of exporting excess electricity to the
    grid when it is not needed. Moreover, a grid-wide smart energy system can also
    decide when that surplus electricity is more valuable being transmitted through
    the grid for another purpose (e.g., charging electric vehicles or hydrogen generation).
    This enables the opportunity for peer-to-peer electricity trading, allowing electricity
    exchanges with neighboring consumers rather than selling it to the electricity
    provider. For large apartment buildings or micro-grids, this can effectively happen
    by having the main meter and sub-meters for each individual consumer so that the
    surplus electricity by one user can be exported to another user within the microgrid,
    and net surplus or deficits can be exchanged with the main electricity grid. This
    system may maximize energy savings to the expense of increasing the system and
    control complexity, for which digitalization of the measuring systems will be
    crucial. These features, in turn, can be upscaled, allowing the optimal tracking
    of energy exports and trans-national energy exchanges. The digitalization of large
    energy distribution systems can also be used to control, manage, and provide grid
    protection with energy storage or grid stabilization by using large batteries
    such as in South Australia (Faunce et al., 2018), which can provide urgent stabilization
    of the grid and avoid a complete network shutdown in the event of an unforeseen
    shutdown of a major fossil fuel power plant. Distributed energy systems offer,
    therefore, the path towards sustainable energy systems, and their development
    requires parallel development of their digitalized control and modeling. Nevertheless,
    it has to be mentioned that despite notable advances in digitalization in the
    last few years, the main driver and accelerator in the shift to distributed energy
    systems has been the drop in photovoltaic systems cost, which has gone below that
    of other renewable and fossil-based resources, as shown in Fig. 7. In fact, as
    of today, the low payback times for solar-generated electricity at the residential
    level, and even large solar plants, can be cheaper than the generation cost of
    coal-based electricity. Thus, the current situation is the best possible, and
    digitalization offers the key solution to the biggest challenge for distributed
    renewable energy systems, which is the supply and demand management for intermittent
    generation technologies. It is up to the development of digitalization technologies
    to catch up and make the most of it. Download : Download high-res image (379KB)

    of different energy sources It is clear that the modernization of power systems
    brings a number of benefits to all energy stakeholders. However, these advantages
    are challenged by the system transit to the new technology and system innovation.
    Nevertheless, despite the high level of complexity that integrated and distributed
    energy systems may imply, the concept of smart grid technologies offers a solid
    platform for a safe, stable, and sustainable transition. The conceptual framework
    of smart grids, which can be represented as in Fig. 8, consists of (i) the application
    of intelligent strategies to effectively allow the coordination of the energy
    flow between generation and the consumption of power (Bansal, 2019; Mbungu et
    al., 2020, Mbungu et al., 2019); (ii) the coordination of diverse energy resources
    by encouraging maximum use of renewable energy resources; (iii) the integration
    of distributed and diverse energy storage systems; (iv) energy management policies
    through which the relationship between the consumer and the supplier is coordinated.

    Fig. 8. Overview of intelligent energy system (Mbungu et al., 2020). In order
    to become a reality, smart energy systems need the development of optimal control
    schemes from the production sites to the consumption sites. Currently, energy
    management strategies use smart grid technologies to guarantee optimal energy
    coordination into the electrical system. The features that the smart grid technologies
    offer provide the electrical system with the opportunities of having a digitalized
    system with diverse possibilities to optimally coordinate several energy resources.
    Contrary to traditional energy networks, smart grids are adaptive, distributed,
    and have smart metering sensors that allow two-way communication, providing pervasive
    control, self-monitoring, and remote checks in a real-time and dynamic environment.
    The development and deployment of smart grids will define the implementation perspective
    of the future electrical. One of the greatest challenges will be to guarantee
    a better relationship of the energy trilemma (Mbungu et al., 2019), which consists
    of solving the equilibrium aspect of the equilateral triangle where the sides
    are energy equity, energy security, and environmental sustainability. Therefore,
    in the future perspective of power systems, we will not only be looking for affordable
    and green and clean energy generation, but also secure and reliable energy resources.
    And to this purpose, the novel approach of smart grid will need to integrate the
    concepts of energy internet and the internet of energy (IoE). 4.3. Energy efficiency
    in industries and transportation Distributed generation and smart grids are thus
    the keys for a greener energy supply, but a crucial factor that may impact the
    energy use sustainability to the same or even greater extent as its efficient
    use. When it comes to energy use, the industrial and transport sectors represent
    more than half of the total energy consumption in the world (Taylor et al., 2010).
    A great majority of processes consuming energy in these sectors require high temperatures,
    which are achieved, mostly through the combustion of fossil fuels, therefore contributing
    to most of the greenhouse gas emissions on the planet (Panayiotou et al., 2017).
    These processes, have efficiencies between 45% (i.e., Diesel engines) to about
    85% (i.e., gas boilers), meaning that around 15–55% of the energy provided by
    fossil fuels is wasted in the form of residual heat. This heat represents a significant
    waste of energy resources, which in turn contributes to global warming, exposing
    these sectors'' incapacity for using the valuable resources in a smart way. The
    standardization of inline sensors for processes metering and the popularization
    of logging systems and connectivity (Halstenberg et al., 2019), conforming the
    concept of the internet of things in the industry, will soon provide extensive
    datasets for process optimization that may allow for energy savings of up to 20%
    in industry (Kagermann, 2015). Beyond static operation, the continuous availability
    of processes data will allow a rapid adaptation of the processes configurations
    in combination with autonomous control systems, which in turn, may self-learn
    daily from the generated data by using neural network-based systems (Han et al.,
    2016). This new capability may be easily extended to the transport sector, especially
    the one concerning the shipping of goods by air, sea, and road (i.e., trucks),
    which are the three main contributors to the CO2 emissions from transport (Dray
    et al., 2012). Data logging onboard ships and trucks have become a reality in
    recent years, where many companies initially motivated to reduce the economic
    stress of ship owners by reducing fuel consumption, have found their side contribution
    on cutting down emissions (Fruth and Teuteberg, 2017). Similarly, the road transport
    sector is taking up the baton, as digitalization is currently claimed as the main
    driver for change in the sector (Noussan et al., 2020; Schiller et al., 2016).
    Interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization, ensuring better capacity utilization and fuel savings. Equally,
    individual systems that monitor each driver''s style, and the maintenance needs
    for each vehicle (e.g., wear on components) may be used to dynamically optimize
    the operating parameters to save fuel, reduce emissions, and increase the truck''s
    lifetime. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that increased energy efficiency
    from the user side may bring with it the so-called induction effect, by which
    more optimized energy systems may create new energy demands. For instance, it
    has been claimed that the evolution of autonomous cars may increase the amount
    of users that, because of special mobility needs, may not be using cars before
    or were using the ‘greener’ public transport (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). Moreover,
    the forecasted gains in efficiency may be more than outweighed by the increase
    in energy consumption due to new digital services, therefore resulting in a counterproductive
    effect. It is therefore in our hands, and those of the future generations, to
    investigate the impact of different aspects of digitalization in our energy systems,
    aiming at define which digital technologies and services may foster more environmentally
    friendly and sustainable energy production technologies, and which may only result
    in a rebound effect (Coroamă and Mattern, 2019). 5. Does digitalization hold the
    key to catalyze changes on industry and social wellbeing? 5.1. Industry 4.0 towards
    sustainable manufacturing and infrastructure Industrial production of goods and
    services is undergoing significant changes in the last years evolving rapidly
    as digital technologies improve communication among the actors along the value
    chain (Correani et al., 2020). The term Industry 4.0 was coined to address the
    fact that the fourth industrial revolution will rely on digitalization rather
    than only automation as the third did, and that future production will be modular
    within factories consisting of “smart” objects. This trend is given by an application
    pull that requires standardization of systems, short development periods, individualization
    on demand (batch one manufacturing), flexibility, setting safe and secure production
    environments, resource efficiency, and decentralization for decision-making. Simultaneously,
    there is a technology push that will enable increased automation and mechanization,
    networking of elements leading to completely digitalized environments and an increasing
    degree of miniaturization (Lasi et al., 2014; Oztemel and Gursev, 2020). Industry
    4.0 conceives an integration of the entire product life-cycle ranging from the
    raw material acquisition stage all the way to the end of life of the product.
    In between there are manufacturing (and intermediate transformation) steps and
    the users, which also requires transportation (see Fig. 9) (Ardito et al., 2019;
    Stock and Seliger, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (413KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 9. Vision of the product life cycle in Industry
    4.0 integrated with material, energy and information flows through digital technologies.
    The vision of Industry 4.0 perfectly aligns with the concept of lean manufacturing
    (LM) since both approaches pursue improvements in quality, productivity, seek
    a reduction of waste, and are customer-oriented. With its historical origin in
    the Toyota Production System, LM has been a paradigm that has pushed industrial
    practice to operational excellence for years. It is based on five main guidelines,
    namely: the identification of value, map the value stream, creation of continuous
    flow between production steps, introduce pull between these steps, and, finally,
    seek perfection in the performance (D''Ippolito et al., 2019; Womack and Jones,
    1996). The reutilization of material flows is indeed a point of paramount importance
    in LM practice and, obviously, Industry 4.0 and must be emphasized. In this sense,
    the principles of both concepts are coherent with the perspective of a green chemical
    sector of the future, whereby industry would need to consider and implement “waste
    design.” This philosophy deals with how production should be readapted to design
    processes that (a) avoid as much as possible waste creation and subsequent management
    and (b) make by-products in the processes useful raw materials (Zimmerman et al.,
    2020). In the end, this will lead to the creation of value by reutilization throughout
    the supply chain contributing to a circular economy, which is crucial to consider
    sustainable manufacturing decisions (de Sousa Jabbour et al., 2018). Another consideration
    is that the transportation of completed or intermediate goods demands the use
    of the most sustainable infrastructure to connect the different stations of the
    value chain, optimizing costs while minimizing emissions and safety issues (Dev
    et al., 2020). As for energy flows, originating from renewable sources, they will
    go into smart grids to which each smart factory is connected to manage the demand
    or supply of energy. The core of the manufacturing process would be the smart
    factories (also referred to as “dark factories,” “lights out factories,” or “unmanned
    factories”). Smart manufacturing aims to optimize concept generation and production
    by employing computer control and high levels of adaptability hence promoting
    self-organization and decentralized decision-making. For this, it takes advantage
    of advanced information and manufacturing technologies to enable flexibility in
    physical processes to operate in dynamic global markets (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020).
    In turn, smart factories are heavily reliant on machine-to-machine communication
    through cyber-physical systems (CPSs). CPSs are one of the key aspects of Industry
    4.0, and they encompass a network of objects and systems communicating with each
    other over the internet and a virtual environment created by computer simulation
    of objects and behaviors in the real world. Cloud computing becomes essential
    for the interconnection of CPSs as it enables data mining and determining responses
    to be given by the self-organized systems. Within smart factories, virtual manufacturing
    (VM) allows the simulation and optimization of operations and processes of the
    different modules with different technologies like computer-aided process design,
    product life cycle management, virtual or augmented reality, or 3D modeling, to
    name a few. VM technologies, in the end, are key elements to the individualization
    of the production, which in the end will be realized by additive manufacturing,
    such as 3D or 4D printing (Kamble et al., 2018; Kerin and Pham, 2019; Oztemel
    and Gursev, 2020). In contrast with Industry 4.0 and considering its prior establishment,
    the LM philosophy can be regarded as a relatively low-tech approach whose excellence
    stems from its simplicity and the consideration of humans as a foundation to sustain
    continuous improvement of practices. Although this may represent a potential conflict
    from the standpoint of the involvement of manpower, given the similarity of many
    of the objectives of LM and Industry 4.0, it is more than arguable that positive
    associations between the two exist (Tortorella and Fettermann, 2018). A recent
    study by Pagliosa et al. covered precisely the potential synergies and the application
    of Industry 4.0 technologies that can overcome difficulties that directly concern
    LM (Pagliosa et al., 2019). After identifying a total of 9 Industry 4.0 technologies
    and 14 LM practices and analyzing their pairwise interactions, it was realized
    that very positive associations exist with a very high potential to achieve higher
    operational performance. A total of 24 relationships were suggested for prioritization,
    such as the relationship between CPSs and value stream mapping. Likewise, some
    technologies were also deemed a lower priority, such as advanced robotization,
    as they did not pose a definitive advantage to several LM practices. Another conclusion
    of the study is the highlight of the opportunities in research related to the
    area of Industry 4.0 and LM, which include the obvious need for validation of
    the synergies proposed, a categorization of technologies and LM practices in different
    levels of the value stream and the examination of the effects of the proposed
    relationships on operational performance (Pagliosa et al., 2019). Integration
    of life cycle assessments for decision-making is still underexplored and undoubtedly
    necessary to consider material and energy flows (Jose and Ramakrishna, 2018),
    which can help establish concepts like zero-waste manufacturing. This idea advocates
    for an industrial transformation that will reduce the designing for zero waste,
    smart auditing and collecting of any waste generated, subsequent waste to resource
    conversion, and establishing collaborative platforms for industrial symbiosis
    (Kerdlap et al., 2019). While it appears that the development of environmental
    and economic impacts of Industry 4.0 is promising, and several projects are already
    running (Oztemel and Gursev, 2020), the societal impact will have to be thoroughly
    assessed. Artificial intelligence technologies will enable autonomous vehicles
    and lights-out manufacturing, whereby the presence of operators will be minimal.
    These will reduce hazards by avoiding the presence of workers in the corresponding
    factories or transport infrastructures but could also lead to significant job
    losses. In the current context of ongoing rapid changes, the definition of the
    fifth industrial revolution is starting to take shape. Industry 5.0 would represent
    an extension to Industry 4.0 evolving into manufacturing practices that focus
    on the personalized demands of individual customers. Therefore, the application
    of human intelligence is key to the development of this concept. Thus, many efforts
    are being put into tools to increase personalization, including virtual reality
    or holography among which capitalize on the human-machine interaction (Javaid
    and Haleem, 2020). 5.2. Use of e-Health technologies to promote wellbeing and
    quality of life Digitalization is revolutionizing healthcare facilitating access
    to health services and addressing significant challenges in aging, mental health,
    and other costly and complex health care needs, overcoming the shortage of workers,
    and providing care to remote locations. e-Health is a critical area to expand
    and support as eHealth has the potential to provide affordable, sustainable, and
    quality health care (Bucci et al., 2019; Krick et al., 2019; Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016). Digital health includes different technological advances
    such as telehealth and telemedicine. Telehealth is the use of electronic information
    and telecommunication technologies to support and promote long-distance clinical
    health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health,
    and health administration. Whereas, telemedicine refers to connections at a distance
    with professional providers to obtain treatment via videoconferencing (Weinstein
    et al., 2018). However, the World Health Organization uses the term e-health to
    encompass all these different aspects related to the internet of health things
    (IoHT) that are advancing healthcare during the Digital Age (Larson et al., 2018;
    Ossebaard and Van Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; WHO, 2019). The reliance on IoHT has increased
    over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19 Pandemic
    as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting social
    distancing measures. Telemedicine brings solutions to consumers regarding their
    location and provides equal access to health, increasing health services at a
    lower price (Weinstein et al., 2018). Telemedicine is a helpful tool for reaching
    outpatients in rural areas to provide equal access to healthcare. With federal
    legislation increasing demand for medical services already in short supply, telehealth
    and telemedicine are often seen as more efficient methods for people to receive
    care. Eliminating traveling implies a series of savings, reduce hassles in many
    homes, and saves time, especially in rural areas (Larson et al., 2018; Rupert
    et al., 2017). Furthermore, telemedicine offers the opportunity to support persons
    of different ethnicities, cultures, and languages by facilitating access to health
    care providers that are culturally competent and offer translator services (Larson
    et al., 2018). Despite improvements in high-speed internet in developing countries,
    there are many barriers to overcome to implement telehealth from the part of organizations
    (e.g., cost), patients (e.g., age, level of education, computer literacy), and
    providers (e.g., technically challenged staff, resistance to change) (Scott Kruse
    et al., 2016). The IoHT is still in its infancy but a promising public health
    tool with the potential to significantly increase access to health care for medically
    underserved populations of different backgrounds and ethnicities. Furthermore,
    there is a widespread belief that IoHT can reduce healthcare costs and improve
    health outcomes overall (Bashshur et al., 2016). Wellbeing is one of the SDGs
    gaining importance worldwide. Digital tools play a vital role in promoting wellbeing
    and improving quality of life as these facilitate access to health care. Quality
    of life is an individual perception of physical, mental, and social wellbeing
    state even in the presence of a disease. Mobile phone apps and computers are resources
    for the population to communicate in different ways (phone call, video conference,
    email, app), allowing patients to meet and follow up with their providers. Implementation
    and normalization of eHealth enable the person to self-manage their health condition,
    improve their wellbeing, and prevent future health problems (Ossebaard and Van
    Gemert-Pijnen, 2016; Weinstein et al., 2018). Some examples are apps for promoting
    positive mental health strategies, physical activity, better management of diabetes,
    and heart control, among others (Weinstein et al., 2018). These IoHT applications
    have demonstrated that digital tools improve the overall quality of life of patients
    with chronic conditions while helping them manage their health from the comfort
    of their homes. Persons engaged in e-health achieve the same positive health outcomes
    as those who have the usual care at the clinic or hospital (Larson et al., 2018).
    Some examples of the use of telehealth and other digital sources to improve quality
    of life are: (i) telemonitoring to assist in the care and management of diabetes
    (Lee and Lee, 2018), (ii) use of telemedicine to help to control asthma (Chongmelaxme
    et al., 2019), (iii) telemedicine to help individuals with heart failure (Lin
    et al., 2017), (iv) telehealth to assist Cancer patients (Larson et al., 2018),
    and (v) telemonitoring for individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
    or COPD (Tupper et al., 2018). Telemedicine can reduce the number of admission
    and length of stays in the hospital. Preventive measures have demonstrated to
    delay mortality (Lin et al., 2017). All these aspects diminish the use of medical
    resources and positively impact the healthcare system and accelerate care attention.
    Emerging technologies such as virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and
    videogames that induce the participant to exercise (also known as exergaming)
    present opportunities to improve our community''s wellbeing and quality of life.
    VR/AR offer quasi-naturalistic and real-life experiences that might not perform
    in a safe environment for the person. VR/AR allows treating, stimulating, and
    improving the patient''s wellbeing by training physical and cognitive abilities
    (Zucchella et al., 2018). VR reality can make dull activities more entertaining
    and increase adherence (Schröder et al., 2019; Slater and Sanchez-Vives, 2016).
    For example, adding VR to a stationary bike contributes to increasing the person''s
    motivation for training by making the stationary exercise more attractive (Slater
    and Sanchez-Vives, 2016). In rehabilitation, VR offers a safe home-training environment
    to improve mobility (Schröder et al., 2019). Additionally, VR interventions improve
    cognition (memory) and psychological functioning, such as alleviating anxiety,
    impacting the wellbeing of persons with neurocognitive disorders such as Alzheimer''s,
    stroke, and mild cognitive impairment (Moreno et al., 2019). 6. Can digitalization
    tools assist us in climate research? In climate research, multi spatial-temporal
    climatic data form a baseline to understand climate variability and future projections.
    Digitalization of historical climate data and availability of real-time climate
    data revolutionized the prediction of extreme climate events, and developed strategies
    for their mitigation and adaptation (Munang et al., 2013). The open-source data
    policy, robust storage and processing infrastructure, advanced algorithms, less
    cost and time, and participatory scientific forums have enthused global researchers
    from interdisciplinary fields to work in sustainability research at different
    scales. This section focuses on the role of digital solutions as a way forward
    to comprehend more about the prospect of digital solutions for climate actions
    to attain ecological sustainability. The key areas of our interest are the application
    of digitalization in biodiversity research, earth observation, and climate action.
    6.1. Digitalization in Global Biodiversity Assessment Since the beginning of the
    Anthropocene epoch, human-induced impacts on the environment, including urbanization,
    pollution, globalization, Green House Gases (GHG) emission, and climate change,
    are ever-increasing. Quantifying such impact based on available data is a big
    debate since there is a question on delimiting the onset of the Anthropocene still
    prevails (Lewis and Maslin, 2015). The practice of collecting and availability
    of historical and real-time biodiversity data in digital format has evidently
    increased worldwide from the beginning of the twenty-first century. The Global
    Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) is an intergovernmental organization
    that hosts an online interoperable network of biodiversity databases from biological
    surveys and collections done at different geographical realms. The GBIF holds
    nearly one billion biodiversity occurrences records, of which nearly 150 million
    were based on a preserved specimen from natural history collection (Edwards, 2004;
    Yesson et al., 2007). However, estimates suggest that only 10% of specimen samples
    are available in digital format (Ball-Damerow et al., 2019). Online public participation
    has the potential to further accelerate the digitalization of biodiversity research
    specimens through three stages: transcription, geotagging, and specimen annotation.
    There are concerns over the data quality during the incorporation of citizen science
    data. But, this could be overcome by data quality control efforts such as standardization
    of transcription, spatial data accuracy, targeted training, development of pliable
    and multistage database management systems, practicing appropriate statistical
    procedures, and data validation protocols (Ellwood et al., 2015). It is conclusive
    that digitalization of collection-based research helps to derive and assess biological
    baseline to evaluate the impact of climate change, land use (biophysical characteristics
    of land) and land cover (anthropogenic utilization of land) change, invasive species,
    and anthropogenic induced impact on global biodiversity (Hedrick et al., 2020).
    6.2. Ecological monitoring to evaluate land and marine ecosystems The need for
    studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic factors on the environment
    is much needed to assess biodiversity loss and its implications on biogeochemical
    cycles and global food security (Shiklomanov et al., 2019). Environmental monitoring
    procedure incorporates processes such as background investigation, scheme determination,
    distribution optimization, field sampling, experimental analysis, data collection,
    and analysis complexion. Traditional data collection methods collect field samples
    on environmental change and pollution, which is now augmented through the intervention
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The vast amount of such scattered,
    unstructured and data collected worldwide could be connected through telecommunication
    and the internet for a single-point access. Big data analysis and cloud computing
    have enabled mining of such a vast amount of data to extract useful information
    to frame environmental management strategies (Li, 2014). Recent advancements in
    the sensing and communication infrastructures with storage infrastructure, flexible
    and interoperable geodatabase, cloud processing, and advanced algorithms have
    made the digital data inevitable input for continuous mapping and spatiotemporal
    monitoring of the land and marine ecosystems. Contemporary earth observation sensors
    such as multispectral, hyperspectral, microwave, and LiDAR provide high spatial
    and spectral resolution data utilizing diverse wavelength regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum. The archived and real-time data from these sensors provide a plethora
    of information that could be effectively combined with ground-based information
    to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of earth''s ecosystems. The IoT technologies
    enable us to build and deploy the communication of interconnected sensors to avail
    continuous real-time data (Abraham et al., 2017). The latest developments in the
    open-access interactive tools and frameworks for processing such a massive volume
    of data using LiMES (Live Monitoring of Earth Surface), and xROI helps even a
    non-expert in remote sensing to analyze and derive useful products out of raw
    data (Giuliani et al., 2017; Seyednasrollah et al., 2019). Furthermore, the integration
    of social sensing data through mobile technologies in participatory environmental
    management programs suggests that the participation of stakeholders enhances mapping
    and provides new information on the socio-ecological system (Brammer et al., 2016;
    Dong et al., 2019). 6.3. Digital earth observation data for the assessment of
    essential climate variables Geospatial information infrastructure consists of
    technological, semantic, organizational, and legal components which enable the
    user to discover, share, and utilize geospatial data to assess the rapidly changing
    climate and its implications on our physical environment. The multi-source, multi-band,
    multi-variable, and multi-scale earth observation data combined with auxiliary
    data has inherent 4 V qualities (volume, variety, veracity, and velocity) of big
    data, which could valuably contribute to the effective monitoring of 34 Essential
    Climate Variables (ECVs) as identified by UNFCCC at multiple scales (Guo et al.,
    2015). Time series satellite data for understanding the temporal dynamics in vegetation
    (Measho et al., 2019), deltas and estuarine wetlands (Kuenzer et al., 2019), alpine
    wetlands (Wang et al., 2020), snow line changes (Hu et al., 2019), polar ice cover
    (Eythorsson et al., 2019), urban impervious surface (Kuang, 2019), urban microclimatic
    regions (Bechtel et al., 2019), marine phytoplankton (Dutkiewicz et al., 2019),
    and sea surface temperature (Merchant et al., 2019) in response to the global
    climate change have proven the application potential of geospatial data in different
    domains of environmental monitoring. Recent digital advances, including IoT, big
    data, cloud computing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques together
    can handle a massive number of datasets generated from synchronous satellite-aerial-ground-based
    observation systems for the continuous monitoring of atmosphere, hydrosphere,
    lithosphere, and cryosphere. From these observations, accurate, comprehensive,
    and diverse information on essential climate variables, extreme climate events,
    and global environmental change could be derived to further investigate spatiotemporal
    dynamics of climate change indicators from regional to global scale (Jia et al.,
    2020). 7. Conclusions The United Nations defined in 2015 the sustainable development
    goals (SDGs) to roadmap research and social needs towards equity and sustainable
    development of our society. The advent of digital technologies is a ray of hope
    on the horizon that can guide and catalyze the change towards achieving all the
    holistic 17 SDGs. The role of digitalization and the technologies associated with
    the internet of things (IoT) have been discussed for their potential to solve
    big challenges in the food-water-energy nexus, and enabling Industry 4.0, improving
    social wellbeing, and reducing the effects of climate change. The ever-growing
    global demand for food is one of the greatest challenges of this century, aggravated
    by the unequal access to food resources. Digital technologies are up-scaling sustainable
    agricultural land and resources management and strengthening the associated productivity,
    services, and livelihood security worldwide. For example, the use of remote sensing
    and GIS techniques is increasing agri-productions. The use of data is mapping
    and guiding effective land-use pattern, defining crop variety, and monitoring
    agroecosystem activities. The early implementation of various hardware (e.g.,
    sensors, drones, precise fertilization, etc.) combined with geo-mapping leads
    the new agriculture revolution, given the prediction capabilities to magnify production
    yield and improve sustainable agriculture. The use of mobile application software
    provides unique opportunities for connectivity with agricultural stakeholders
    and farmer independence. Furthermore, applications position the farming communities
    as the essential attributes of precision and sustainable agriculture while ensuring
    economic gains (reduced poverty). Smart cities of the future should ensure accessible
    water of the highest quality for all of their citizens. Big data and digitalization
    play an essential role in meeting these goals. The underutilization of big data
    in water treatment systems may be leading to an unnecessary increase in operating
    costs and sometimes inefficient treatment. Artificial intelligence technologies
    can translate passive data into actionable knowledge to improve operation and
    lead decision-making. Digitalization can lead to an optimized design of water
    treatment plants. Optimized control and operation through efficient data management
    can maximize technical benefits and result in cost savings. Data-mining techniques
    are incorporated into sensing techniques to verify process normalcy and create
    knowledge on plant malfunctioning to respond faster. Advanced automated control
    through digitalization holds the promise to reduce energy consumption, ensure
    product water quality and prevent system failure. Integration of internet-enabled
    tools and emerging decentralized smart technologies (e.g., treatment at the point
    of delivery or point of use) for-real time water quality audit at critical control
    points can define when decentralized water treatment may be required to operate
    to ensure the public health and facilitate equal access to safe water for all.
    Digitalization can enhance energy efficiency and provide sustainable alternatives.
    Modeling electricity usage based on data is used to predict demand based on weather
    conditions, climatology, or societal habits. These data-driven strategies can
    be translated to decentralized energy systems based on renewable sources (e.g.,
    photovoltaics). Smart management in the complexity of our energy systems puzzles
    is an extraordinarily complex matter that can be dealt with through integration
    on the internet of things. Energy management strategies based on digitalization
    tools can contribute to managing with high accuracy supply and demand for a more
    efficient and sustainable generation and use of energy. It has been suggested
    that smart use of datasets for process optimization may allow up to 20% energy
    savings. Similar energy benefits can be observed in transportation systems where
    interconnected devices between trucks and supplier centers may allow dynamic route
    optimization. These strategies will ensure better capacity utilization and fuel
    savings while decreasing CO2 emissions associated to transportation. Sustainable
    manufacturing is one of the key aspects of Industry 4.0 that conceives an integration
    of the entire product life-cycle. Digitalization and material selections become
    an essential element to improve green manufacturing approaches considering the
    entire product life and its reusability/recyclability. Furthermore, smart manufacturing
    integrates computer and internet of things aid strategies to optimize industrial
    yield. Computer control and machine-to-machine communication through cyber-physical
    systems have shown high adaptability and demonstrated optimized self-organization
    and decentralized decision-making. Healthcare and equal access to health are being
    revolutionized by digitalization. Reliance on the internet of health things has
    increased over the years, but it has gained more popularity during the COVID-19
    Pandemic as an efficient alternative to access health services while respecting
    social distancing measures. Telemedicine has been indispensable to bring solutions
    to consumers regardless of their location and income. Digital tools play a vital
    role in promoting wellbeing and improving quality of life through facilitating
    access to health care. Implementation and normalization of e-Health enable the
    person to self-manage health conditions, prevent them, monitor chronic needs,
    and improve citizens'' wellbeing and quality of life. The interconnection of SDGs
    is undeniable. Sustainable approaches have demonstrated synergies that can mitigate
    climate change and its effects. Digitalization and artificial intelligence support
    low carbon energy systems with the integration of highly efficient renewable energy
    that can also monitor and model responses of climate and biodiversity over time.
    In climate research, multi-spatial-temporal climatic data form a baseline to understand
    climate variability and future projections. Digitalization of historical climate
    data and availability of real-time climate data have revolutionized prediction
    and provided a framework for understanding the current climate events and impacts
    on biodiversity. The recent implementation of Internet of Things technology has
    drastically improved collection methods and on-time big data analysis, which could
    favorably contribute for the effective monitoring and solutions deployment. There
    is a clear need for studying the long-term impact of climatic and anthropogenic
    factors on environment and biodiversity. Digitalization is a game-changing tool
    to assist the scientist in this race against time to stop climate change. Digitalization
    defines the path towards a smart Green Planet by providing solutions and assisting
    sustainable development. Integration of IoT, big data management, and artificial
    intelligence have already demonstrated a myriad of benefits. Special attention
    should be paid to implications of inequal data access that can result in digital
    poverty and hence increase inequalities instead of reducing the gap. Cybersecurity
    of strongly interconnected systems through the cloud should be reinforced. However,
    the benefits of big data integration in our daily lives can promote quality of
    life and drastically assist humanity towards the sustainable challenges to ensure
    human, biodiversity, and earth resilience. Declaration of competing interest The

    \ of the installation and adjustment of an\nexclusively mechanical standalone\
    \ automatic device that self-adjusts to weather changes to control\nthe frequency\
    \ and duration of the irrigation. The “hydraulic evapotranspiration multisensor”\
    \ (HEM)\nis composed of a reduced evaporation pan with water, a magnet with a\
    \ ﬂoater ﬂoating in the pan, a\nhydraulic device operated by a magnetic hydraulic\
    \ valve that has the ability to adjust the frequency of\nirrigation, and a hydraulic\
    \ system that returns water to the pan during each irrigation event through\n\
    an adjustable dripper to replace the water lost due to the fact of evaporation.\
    \ This note is particularly\nrelevant for arid–semi-arid regions where agricultural\
    \ production is fully dependent on irrigation.\nKeywords: evapotranspiration;\
    \ smart irrigation; patented\n1. Introduction\nIn the process of evaluating the\
    \ effects of atmospheric conditions on water consump-\ntion in irrigation scheduling,\
    \ experiments are needed to investigate the hydrological cycle\nof evapotranspiration\
    \ (ET) across varying ﬁeld conditions. One model that adequately\ndescribes these\
    \ processes is surely the Penman–Monteith equation, which concerns the\ninﬂuence\
    \ of different climatic variables (e.g., air temperature and humidity, solar radiation,\n\
    and wind velocity) [1,2]. Different models have been used for irrigation control\
    \ in open-\nﬁeld and protected types of cultivation based on the original evapotranspiration\
    \ equation\nby Penman–Monteith. However, when using such models, it is difﬁcult\
    \ to measure vari-\nables, including the canopy and aerodynamic resistance of\
    \ crop surfaces [3]. Additionally,\nthe model equation’s coefﬁcients must ﬁrst\
    \ be calibrated for the speciﬁc crop under the\nprevailing climatic conditions.\
    \ Alternatively, the optimal approaches to irrigation con-\ntrol may include plant\
    \ stress sensing as opposed to climate or substrate irrigation-based\napproaches.\
    \ Nowadays, companies that manufacture irrigation systems have released\nweather-sensitive\
    \ irrigation regulators on the market that sense the weather constituents\naffecting\
    \ ET. Readings from said sensors are fed into computer models to assess ET using\n\
    intelligent decision algorithms that modify the irrigation schedule, which is\
    \ set for normal\nweather conditions. For deviations from a normal to lower ET\
    \ rate, these models increase\nthe time interval between consecutive irrigation\
    \ cycles to avoid excessive irrigation. Thus,\ncompanies claim up to 30% water\
    \ savings [4].\nAn enabler of precision irrigation system is the adaptation of\
    \ Internet of Things\napplications [5]. IoT bridges the gap between the physical\
    \ and cyber worlds through the\nintegration of sensor-based information, data\
    \ communication, data cloud or fog-computing\nacquisition, and intelligent processing\
    \ in real time [6]. Artiﬁcial neural network-based\nmodels for estimating evaporation\
    \ were proposed in [2], which took into account climatic\nAgriEngineering 2023,\
    \ 5, 876–885. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriengineering5020054\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriengineering\n\
    AgriEngineering 2023, 5\n877\nparameters. Along this line, other authors have\
    \ indicated that the water requirements\nfor several crops can be sufﬁciently\
    \ modeled for the considered climate based on virtual\nsensors and fuzzy logic\
    \ control systems [7,8]. Li et al. [9] proposed a composite irrigation\ncontroller\
    \ that considers predictive algorithms, crop coefﬁcients, fuzzy algorithms, and\n\
    sliding mode control methods for maize irrigation scheduling.\nEstimating ET from\
    \ climate variables, however, can be a difﬁcult task for farmers, who\nmay not\
    \ be familiar with the use of complex hydrological and energy models. Because\
    \ most\nof the Earth’s irrigated lands are located in developing countries, where\
    \ climatological data\nare often incomplete and inaccurate, it is thus important\
    \ to use the cheapest, simplest, and\nmost practical monitoring method to improve\
    \ efﬁciency in irrigation [10].\nCommonly used timer-based controllers (i.e.,\
    \ no feedback irrigation decision support\nsystem) apply excess water in weather\
    \ conditions when irrigation is not necessary. For\nexample, along the central\
    \ coast of California, open-loop control irrigation systems apply\nmore than 200%\
    \ of the actual evapotranspiration requirements of vegetables through\nsprinklers’\
    \ irrigation systems [11].\nIn arid and semi-arid regions, the need for water\
    \ management at the farm level is\nof high importance due to the fact of a rainfall\
    \ deﬁcit, which calls for crop irrigation\nduring most of the growing season.\
    \ Under these conditions, dry farming productivity is\nvery low and restricted\
    \ to a few drought-resistant species, as the rainfall varies from year\nto year\
    \ and its occurrence is unpredictable. However, the adoption of micro-irrigation\n\
    techniques, such as drip irrigation and sprinkler irrigation, the adaptation of\
    \ planting\ndates, the selection of drought-resistant varieties, and the use of\
    \ mulch-based cultivation\ntechniques would be beneﬁcial for improving water-use\
    \ efﬁciency and conserving water\nresources [12,13]. The number of irrigation\
    \ events required for optimal yields of the main\nirrigated crops are estimated\
    \ to be between eight and ﬁfty-eight (e.g., in Cyprus), with\na total amount of\
    \ irrigation water applied being between 355 mm (e.g., vegetable crops)\nand 2400\
    \ mm (e.g., Colocasia crops) from April to October [13]. Since there are so many\n\
    applications of water, the strategic timing of irrigation events is critical.\
    \ Cyprus’ water\nresources depend entirely on rainfall, and Cyprus is expected\
    \ to experience the most\nadverse climate change effects of any Eastern Mediterranean\
    \ country, including changes\nin precipitation and increases in temperature [14].\
    \ Important waterworks that store river\nwater were constructed approximately\
    \ 60 years ago, and this was a multiannual operation.\nThe optimum capacity was\
    \ provided using mathematical models based on the rainfall\nrecords that were\
    \ available at the time. Around the 1990s, it was realized that the amount\nof\
    \ water stored in the dam was less than expected. An analysis of the rainfall\
    \ records up to\n1993 revealed that the rainfall values used to calibrate the\
    \ model, which were prior to the\ndam’s construction, were too high. A graphical\
    \ presentation of the yearly rainfall record for\nCyprus in the hydrological year\
    \ 1900–1901 revealed a steady rainfall decrease in the 30-year\nmoving average.\
    \ This decrease persists up to today at a rate of approximately 1.1 mm y−1.\n\
    This decrease in rainfall since the construction of Cyprus’ most important dam\
    \ until today\nis approximately 13%, which means a run-off reduction of approximately\
    \ 40% [15].\nIn Cyprus, approximately 70% of the amount used for irrigated agriculture\
    \ is fresh-\nwater, and every effort must be made to reduce the waste of irrigation\
    \ water through\npromoting low-cost means and practices that simple farmers can\
    \ afford, understand, and\naccept. So, a novel, environmentally friendly system\
    \ that does not require software, elec-\ntricity and batteries, or weathermatic\
    \ and that both saves irrigation water and protects\nplantations from water deﬁcit\
    \ stress is the proposed hydraulic evapotranspiration multi-\nsensor system. Its\
    \ installation and adjustments are explained in this paper [15].\nClass A evaporation\
    \ pans (i.e., large open, circular containers that are 120.7 cm in\ndiameter and\
    \ 25.4 cm deep, ﬁlled with water) have been used around the world as a ready\n\
    source of evaporation data. Several individuals have used this method because\
    \ of their\nsimplicity and low cost to estimate ET and irrigation scheduling,\
    \ as it may still be the\nmost practical and accurate meteorological method [10,16,17].\
    \ Their simplicity and high\ndegree of adaptation at the farm level, which are\
    \ characteristics of the evaporation pan,\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n878\nseem\
    \ to be the primary reason for the pan’s expansion among producers. The work of\n\
    Thomson and Fisher (2006) [9], who designed an evaporimeter based on a washtub\
    \ for\neasy cotton irrigation scheduling, is relevant. Similarly, other researchers\
    \ have proposed\nactivating a drip irrigation system based on a water level sensing\
    \ system in a mini-pan [18].\nAdditionally, ﬁeld devices that integrate environmental\
    \ effects and measure evaporation\nsuch as atmometers can also be used to schedule\
    \ irrigation [19,20].\nThe “hydraulic evapotranspiration multisensor” (HEM) product’s\
    \ design and opera-\ntion, as an exclusively mechanical standalone automatic device\
    \ for irrigation scheduling,\nis described in detail in [21]. The novelty of an\
    \ HEM lies in its integrated approach to\nirrigation scheduling, which considers\
    \ only the energy obtained from piped water by\nmonitoring water evaporation in\
    \ the pan. It is composed of a reduced evaporation pan,\na magnet with a ﬂoater\
    \ ﬂoating in the pan, a hydraulic device operating with a magnetic\nhydraulic\
    \ valve with the ability to adjust the frequency of irrigation, and a hydraulic\
    \ system\nthat returns water to the pan through a dripper to replace the water\
    \ lost due to the fact\nof evaporation. The information in this note is aimed\
    \ at providing a quick overview of\nthe HEM’s installation and adjustment. During\
    \ the installation of the HEM, the frequency\nand duration of the irrigation were\
    \ considered the crop water requirements, which were\ncalculated using the classical\
    \ pan A method, with a statistically correct water volume (Cv),\nunder average\
    \ weather conditions for each month at different topographical elevations.\n2.\
    \ Installation\nThe HEM prototype (Figure 1) was installed at an inland, semi-arid\
    \ location in south-\nern Cyprus, near the (1) water supply pipe of a pressurized\
    \ irrigation system in which a\npressure controller was set to reduce the pressure\
    \ to 2 Bar from 4.5 Bar (i.e., drip irrigation\nsystem pressure requirements).\
    \ On an outlet from this pipe, a common solenoid irrigation\nvalve transformed\
    \ into a (2) hydraulic irrigation valve was installed after a (3) faucet,\nwhich,\
    \ for the moment, was closed. The location of the installation was selected to\
    \ ensure\nuninterrupted sunshine with no barriers that would block the ﬂow of\
    \ wind in order to sense\nthe changes in the all-weather constituents in holistic\
    \ way. A vertical angle (4) iron pole\nwas driven into the ground at the upper\
    \ end of which a ﬁxture supported a (5) magnetic\nhydraulic valve with the (6)\
    \ stem in the vertical position. This was inserted in the base (7)\npipe of the\
    \ (8) evaporation pan, which was placed in a horizontal position without water.\n\
    Then, the (10) ﬂoater was left to slide down gently on the base pipe until it\
    \ was stopped by\nthe (9) ring screw. Slightly before, a click noise was heard,\
    \ which meant that the magnet\nreached the correct level to raise the (11) magnetic\
    \ rod, opening the magnetic hydraulic\nvalve. No adjustment with the ring screw\
    \ was necessary. The next step was to connect\na small pipe to the (12) inlet\
    \ of the said valve and to the chamber of the (13) hydraulic\nirrigation valve\
    \ in order to be controlled by the HEM. When the magnetic hydraulic valve\nis\
    \ closed, the water in the said chamber is kept under pressure, and the hydraulic\
    \ irrigation\nvalve is closed. The (14) outlet of the magnetic hydraulic valve\
    \ was connected with a\nsmall pipe to run the escaping water to the irrigation\
    \ line through the (15) adaptor, which\nreplaced the solenoid of the transformed\
    \ solenoid irrigation valve. To the said outlet, one\nend of the (16) water return\
    \ pipe was connected to the transfer part of the water escaping\ntowards the evaporation\
    \ pan. At the other end, an (17) adjustable dripper was connected,\nﬁxed at the\
    \ edge of the pan, returning the water lost by evaporation, and resetting the\n\
    system. At this stage, by removing the ﬂoater, the (11) magnetic rod dropped keeping\n\
    the magnetic hydraulic valve closed. The faucet was opened, ﬁlling the (13) chamber\n\
    of the hydraulic irrigation valve and the (6) stem of the magnetic hydraulic valve\
    \ with\nwater under pressure that kept the hydraulic irrigation valve closed.\
    \ At this stage, the\n(18) frequency screw was set at an intermediate indication,\
    \ and the ﬂoater was replaced,\nopening both the magnetic and irrigation valves.\
    \ The water was released for irrigation, and\nfrom the fully opened adjustable\
    \ dripper water started ﬂowing in the evaporation pan with\nits level quickly\
    \ raised. To complete the installation, the irrigation frequency was adjusted\n\
    AgriEngineering 2023, 5\n879\nwith the frequency screw and the watering duration\
    \ also through the adjustable dripper, as\nexplained below.\nAgriEngineering 2023,\
    \ 5, FOR PEER REVIEW  \n4 \n \n \nfrequency screw was set at an intermediate indication,\
    \ and the floater was replaced, open-\ning both the magnetic and irrigation valves.\
    \ The water was released for irrigation, and \nfrom the fully opened adjustable\
    \ dripper water started flowing in the evaporation pan \nwith its level quickly\
    \ raised. To complete the installation, the irrigation frequency was \nadjusted\
    \ with the frequency screw and the watering duration also through the adjustable\

    \ multisensor (HEM) has one sensor to assess, in a \nholistic way, the changes\
    \ in the all-weather components affecting evapotranspiration. This \nis accomplished\
    \ by monitoring the water evaporation rate in the evaporation pan, as \nshown\
    \ in Figure 1, with a floater that floats in the water of the pan, moving in a\
    \ vertical \ndirection following a drop in the water level because of evaporation.\
    \ The rate of this drop \ndefines the time interval between the consecutive irrigation\
    \ cycles. In evapotranspiration \nformulas, the readings from a Class A evaporation\
    \ pan are important components. An \nelectronic-based, weighable reduced pan A\

    \ dripper; (18) frequency\nscrew; (19) permanent magnet; (20) magnetic component\
    \ of the rod [22].\n3. Setting the Time Interval\nThe hydraulic evapotranspiration\
    \ multisensor (HEM) has one sensor to assess, in a\nholistic way, the changes\
    \ in the all-weather components affecting evapotranspiration. This\nis accomplished\
    \ by monitoring the water evaporation rate in the evaporation pan, as shown\n\
    in Figure 1, with a ﬂoater that ﬂoats in the water of the pan, moving in a vertical\
    \ direction\nfollowing a drop in the water level because of evaporation. The rate\
    \ of this drop deﬁnes the\ntime interval between the consecutive irrigation cycles.\
    \ In evapotranspiration formulas, the\nreadings from a Class A evaporation pan\
    \ are important components. An electronic-based,\nweighable reduced pan A evaporimeter\
    \ (i.e., RS-EVA-N01-2; Shandong Renke Control\nTechnology Co., Ltd.; Jinan City;\
    \ China) for the automatic monitoring of the evaporation\nprocess was installed,\
    \ based on the manufacturer’s instructions, for correlation purposes of\nthe pan\
    \ readings with those of the HEM pan readings. To make the HEM readings easy\n\
    and accurate, an external tube that graduated in mm, which was a ﬂoating object\
    \ with\na ﬂat upper surface, as the reference line was installed. This tube was\
    \ connected to the\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n880\nHEM’s evaporation pan (Figure\
    \ 2). The per day water level drop rate of the pan, because of\nevaporation, was\
    \ expected to be analogous with that of the Class A evaporation pan but\nless\
    \ because the open water area in the multisensor pan was partly covered by the\
    \ ﬂoater.\nThe drop in mm of the water level in the multisensor pan per day, Dday,\
    \ was (Equation (1)):\nDday = Eca ∗\n\x12Ap − Af\nAp\n\x13\n(1)\nwhere Eca is\
    \ the per day evaporation in the Class A evaporation pan in mm, Ap is the\ncross-sectional\
    \ area of the evaporation pan, and Af is that of the ﬂoater at the water level\n\
    in cm2.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5, FOR PEER REVIEW  \n5 \n \n \nthe evaporation\
    \ process was installed, based on the manufacturer’s instructions, for cor-\n\
    relation purposes of the pan readings with those of the HEM pan readings. To make\
    \ the \nHEM readings easy and accurate, an external tube that graduated in mm,\
    \ which was a \nfloating object with a flat upper surface, as the reference line\
    \ was installed. This tube was \nconnected to the HEM’s evaporation pan (Figure\
    \ 2). The per day water level drop rate of \nthe pan, because of evaporation,\
    \ was expected to be analogous with that of the Class A \nevaporation pan but\
    \ less because the open water area in the multisensor pan was partly \ncovered\
    \ by the floater. The drop in mm of the water level in the multisensor pan per\
    \ day, \nDday, was (Equation (1)): \nDday = Eca ∗ (Ap − Af\nAp\n) \n(1)1) \nwhere\
    \ Eca is the per day evaporation in the Class A evaporation pan in mm, Ap is the\
    \ cross-\nsectional area of the evaporation pan, and Af is that of the floater\
    \ at the water level in cm2. \n \nFigure 2. External tube connected to the HEM\
    \ prototype for use as a water evaporated (mm) meter-\ning device. \nEquation\
    \ (1) can be regarded as an empirical equation. The correct volume of evapo-\n\
    rated water in the HEM (mm) can be obtained by regressing the measured evaporation\
    \ in \nthe Class A evaporation pan against that measured in the HEM. The potential\
    \ evapotran-\nspiration (i.e., ETO, the capacity of the atmosphere to remove water\
    \ from a surface over a \nspecified region with an unlimited water supply through\
    \ plant transpiration and evapo-\nration) and water evaporation from pans are\
    \ governed by the same climatic factors. Con-\nsequently, a strong correlation\
    \ between them exists. \nHowever, as plant surfaces react differently to the prevailing\
    \ climatic conditions, it is \nnecessary to establish experimentally the relationship\
    \ between the potential evapotran-\nspiration and pan evaporation. The relationship\
    \ also depends on the size, shape, and ex-\nposure of the pan (i.e., pan coefficient\
    \ KP; ETO = KP × Eca) with a high degree of accuracy \nconcerning the wind speed\
    \ and relative humidity. If the pan calibration is to be extrapo-\nlated to other\
    \ sites, it is necessary to standardize the type of the pan and its exposure.\
    \ \nErtek [23] suggested that the proper use of the pan coefficient and its calibration\
    \ are rele-\nvant. \nFigure 2. External tube connected to the HEM prototype for\
    \ use as a water evaporated (mm)\nmetering device.\nEquation (1) can be regarded\
    \ as an empirical equation. The correct volume of evap-\norated water in the HEM\
    \ (mm) can be obtained by regressing the measured evaporation\nin the Class A\
    \ evaporation pan against that measured in the HEM. The potential evapo-\ntranspiration\
    \ (i.e., ETO, the capacity of the atmosphere to remove water from a surface\n\
    over a speciﬁed region with an unlimited water supply through plant transpiration\
    \ and\nevaporation) and water evaporation from pans are governed by the same climatic\
    \ factors.\nConsequently, a strong correlation between them exists.\nHowever,\
    \ as plant surfaces react differently to the prevailing climatic conditions, it\n\
    is necessary to establish experimentally the relationship between the potential\
    \ evapotran-\nspiration and pan evaporation. The relationship also depends on\
    \ the size, shape, and\nexposure of the pan (i.e., pan coefﬁcient KP; ETO = KP\
    \ × Eca) with a high degree of accuracy\nconcerning the wind speed and relative\
    \ humidity. If the pan calibration is to be extrapolated\nto other sites, it is\
    \ necessary to standardize the type of the pan and its exposure. Ertek [23]\n\
    suggested that the proper use of the pan coefﬁcient and its calibration are relevant.\n\
    The linear regression analysis that was developed considers the water evaporation\n\
    rate from the HEM (E HEM, mm) as a predictor and the water evaporation rate from\
    \ the\nreduced A pan evaporimeter (E reduce pan, mm) as the dependent variable\
    \ (Figure 3). For\na speciﬁc time period, the mean values of the E HEM (mm) was\
    \ shown to be a signiﬁcant\npredictor for the E reduce pan (mm), with a coefﬁcient\
    \ of determination of r2 = 0.98.\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n881\n \nThe linear\
    \ regression analysis that was developed considers the water evaporation \nrate\
    \ from the HEM (E HEM, mm) as a predictor and the water evaporation rate from\
    \ the \nreduced A pan evaporimeter (E reduce pan, mm) as the dependent variable\
    \ (Figure 3). For \na specific time period, the mean values of the E HEM (mm)\
    \ was shown to be a significant \npredictor for the E reduce pan (mm), with a\
    \ coefficient of determination of r2 = 0.98. \n \nFigure 3. Linear regression\
    \ modeling between evaporation (mm) measured with the HEM and the \nreduced pan.\
    \ \nAs with other automatic irrigation regulators, an original irrigation schedule\
    \ was set \nfor delivery over a month or season and for the correct water volume\
    \ for the statistically \nexpected average weather conditions by setting the irrigation\
    \ time interval (Ti) in days \nand in combination with the watering time (Wt)\
    \ and the installation’s watering capacity. \nA one-day time interval was required\
    \ for the water level in the evaporation pan to drop \n(Dday) in mm over a normal\
    \ day. The frequency screw with graduations in mm was turned \nto set the preferred\
    \ time interval in days at the indication on the screw (Is) in mm: \nIs = (Dday\
    \ ∗ Ti) − Sm \n(2)2) \nwhere Dday is the per normal day drop in the water level\
    \ in mm; Ti is the wished time \ninterval in days; Sm is the sensitivity of the\
    \ regulator in mm, which is the necessary rise in \nthe water level in mm to push\
    \ the floater up to overcome the force of the magnet holding \nthe magnetic rod\
    \ to let it drop and terminate the irrigation. Sm is usually 2 to 4 mm, de-\n\
    pending on the magnetic force and the floater’s diameter.  \nThe common timer\
    \ regulators kept the time interval between all irrigation cycles and \nwatering\
    \ duration as set in the schedule. For the hydraulic evapotranspiration multisen-\n\
    sor, the time interval was the time required for the water surface and, thus,\
    \ the floater to \nbe lowered from the high level, at which the irrigation was\
    \ terminated, to the low level, at \nwhich the magnet raised the rod to start\
    \ the irrigation, changing with the evaporation rate. \nThis time period was increased\
    \ for low evaporation and evapotranspiration rates to save \nwater, and it was\
    \ diminished at high rates to protect plantations. \n \n \nFigure 3. Linear regression\
    \ modeling between evaporation (mm) measured with the HEM and the\nreduced pan.\n\
    As with other automatic irrigation regulators, an original irrigation schedule\
    \ was set\nfor delivery over a month or season and for the correct water volume\
    \ for the statistically\nexpected average weather conditions by setting the irrigation\
    \ time interval (Ti) in days\nand in combination with the watering time (Wt) and\
    \ the installation’s watering capacity.\nA one-day time interval was required\
    \ for the water level in the evaporation pan to drop\n(Dday) in mm over a normal\
    \ day. The frequency screw with graduations in mm was turned\nto set the preferred\
    \ time interval in days at the indication on the screw (Is) in mm:\nIs = (Dday\
    \ ∗ Ti) − Sm\n(2)\nwhere Dday is the per normal day drop in the water level in\
    \ mm; Ti is the wished time\ninterval in days; Sm is the sensitivity of the regulator\
    \ in mm, which is the necessary rise in\nthe water level in mm to push the ﬂoater\
    \ up to overcome the force of the magnet holding the\nmagnetic rod to let it drop\
    \ and terminate the irrigation. Sm is usually 2 to 4 mm, depending\non the magnetic\
    \ force and the ﬂoater’s diameter.\nThe common timer regulators kept the time\
    \ interval between all irrigation cycles and\nwatering duration as set in the\
    \ schedule. For the hydraulic evapotranspiration multisensor,\nthe time interval\
    \ was the time required for the water surface and, thus, the ﬂoater to be\nlowered\
    \ from the high level, at which the irrigation was terminated, to the low level,\
    \ at\nwhich the magnet raised the rod to start the irrigation, changing with the\
    \ evaporation rate.\nThis time period was increased for low evaporation and evapotranspiration\
    \ rates to save\nwater, and it was diminished at high rates to protect plantations.\n\
    4. Setting Watering Time\nThe watering time (Wt) for the hydraulic evapotranspiration\
    \ multisensor is the length\nof time to return the amount of water required to\
    \ replace that lost from the evaporation pan\ndue to the fact of evaporation in\
    \ order to increase the level from when the irrigation started\nto that when the\
    \ irrigation is terminated. During this time, part of the water that escapes\n\
    from the outlet of the magnetic hydraulic valve with the return water is replaced,\
    \ obtained\nfrom the irrigation line or another suitable place. It is directed\
    \ through the adjustable\ndripper towards the evaporation pan. The ﬂow of the\
    \ return water is set to a low ﬂow\nAgriEngineering 2023, 5\n882\nrate (Rr) in\
    \ order for the watering time (Wt) to last as long as necessary and to provide\
    \ the\ncorrect water volume to plantations, in consideration with the irrigation\
    \ frequency (Ti) and\nwatering capacity of the network. The same parameters, in\
    \ days, for the frequency and\nwatering duration, in minutes or hours, are set\
    \ by the farmers on the automatic irrigation\ntimers, either from their own experience\
    \ or after scientiﬁc advice. The difference with\ntimers is that at every irrigation\
    \ cycle, the correct water volume for the season remains\nconstant, while in HEM\
    \ an original irrigation schedule is prepared to meet the watering\nneeds for\
    \ the statistically averaged weather, but in reality, this deviates from the normal\n\
    schedule, according to weather deviations. The effect of water evaporation rate\
    \ on the\ntime interval between consecutive irrigation cycles, or frequency was\
    \ previously indicated,\nin connection to some construction details of every particular\
    \ apparatus. The watering\nduration (Wt), in minutes, at a steady water supply\
    \ pressure remains the same for irrigation\ncycles, as set in the original irrigation\
    \ schedule. This depends on the ﬂow rate of the return\nwater (Rr), in ml min−1;\
    \ the area open to evaporation of the water level of the evaporation\npan (Ap)m,\
    \ in cm2; normal day water level drop (Dday), in cm; and frequency (Fd) in days.\n\
    These are connected in the following formula:\nRr ∗ Wt = Ap ∗ Dday ∗ Fd\n(3)\n\
    In case the return rate is set through an adjustable dripper, adjustments are\
    \ repeated\nuntil measurements, using a timer and a volumetric tube, result in\
    \ the correct value, as\ngiven by the follow formula:\nRr = (Ap ∗ Dday ∗ Fd)/Wt\n\
    (4)\n5. Adjustments in a Pilot Plot\nThe plantation on which the hydraulic evapotranspiration\
    \ multisensor prototype was\ninstalled for irrigation is an existing one with\
    \ a variety of trees scheduled to be irrigated\nover the hot season at 2-day intervals\
    \ with a watering duration of a half an hour. To\ncontinue using the same irrigation\
    \ practice as the original, an irrigation schedule was\nprepared. The decisive\
    \ factor controlling the irrigation frequency of the HEM was the\nevaporation\
    \ rate, from which the time depended on the water level in the evaporation\npan,\
    \ which decreased or increased, resulting in the termination or start of the irrigation.\n\
    This drop depends also on the number of days set between the irrigation cycles,\
    \ certain\ndimensions of the multisensor components affecting the water volume,\
    \ and the sensi-\ntivity of the equipment. The dimensions of the particular equipment:\
    \ evaporation pan,\nΦP = 232 mm; ﬂoater, ΦF = 120 mm. The sensitivity was approximately\
    \ 3 mm. Sensitivity\nwas the increase in the water level of the pan required for\
    \ the ﬂoater to push the magnet\nup, overcoming the magnetic force holding the\
    \ magnetic rod, releasing and dropping to\nclose the magnetic hydraulic valve.\
    \ This depended on the size of the magnetic component\nof the rod, strength of\
    \ the magnet, and size of the ﬂoater.\nAs the original irrigation schedule was\
    \ prepared for average weather conditions,\nthe highest average daily value of\
    \ evaporation recorded in a Class A evaporation pan in\nCyprus was 9 mm, which\
    \ was for the hottest month, and this value was used as a guide.\nHowever, it\
    \ was expected that the corresponding drop in the water level in the evaporation\n\
    pan would be less, because part of the area of the pan was covered by the ﬂoater,\
    \ and\nthe pan was not ﬁlled up to the edge. The daily drop in the water level\
    \ accepted in this\ncase was 7 mm, considering Equation (1) and several comparisons\
    \ between the water\nevaporation measured with the HEM and the potential evapotranspiration\
    \ calculated with\nthe Penman–Monteith equation based onsite climatic data, as\
    \ mentioned in [12].\nSo, for this hydraulic evapotranspiration multisensor prototype,\
    \ the frequency screw\nwas set at a graduation (upper end of the Screw) for a\
    \ two-day frequency reading 11 mm,\n14 mm, as expected for two average days in\
    \ the hot season, and less than 3 mm for\nthe sensitivity.\nAgriEngineering 2023,\
    \ 5\n883\nThe watering duration is deﬁned by the ﬂow rate at which water returns\
    \ from the\nirrigation line to the evaporation pan to replace that lost by evaporation\
    \ and to reset the\nHEM. This volume, in mL, is the product of the water surface\
    \ area, in cm2; the expected\ndaily water level drop, in cm; and the frequency,\
    \ in number of days, which in this case\nwas 423 × 0.7 × 2 = 592 mL (this volume\
    \ in mL is the product of the water surface area,\nin cm2; expected daily water\
    \ level drop, in cm; and frequency, in number of days). This\ncalculated volume\
    \ had to be replaced in 30 min, which was covered at a rate of 19.74 mL min−1.\n\
    The adjustable dripper ﬂow for the return water was set at 20 mL min−1. The ﬂow\
    \ rate\nmeasurements were carried out using a volumetric tube and a timer.\n6.\
    \ Further Application to Vegetables Crops\nTwo tables with estimated return rate\
    \ values for spring and autumn potato plantations\nin a coastal semi-arid location\
    \ of southern Cyprus (lat. 35◦1’50 N, long. 33◦46’17 E, and\naltitude 20 m, m.s.l)\
    \ are presented as examples, with the hydraulic evapotranspiration\nmultisensor\
    \ prototype having Ap = 422.5 cm2 and Af = 113 cm2, considering average Eca\n\
    values from the two nearest Class A evaporation pans in the area (Tables 1 and\
    \ 2).\nThe spring potato season is March–May, and the watering requirements is\
    \ a total of\n300 m3 1000 m−2 [6], the irrigation installations delivers 10 m3\
    \ h−1, and the average Eca for\nthe season is 4.5 mm day−1. For this case, Dday\
    \ 0.35 cm day−1 was considered (Table 1).\nTable 1. Water return rate (Rr, mL\

    \ and a 1 h\nwatering duration, the return rate (Rr) must be adjusted to 7.4 mL\
    \ min−1. With the\nfrequency screw set at 4 day intervals and 1 h irrigation durations,\
    \ the adjustable screw\nwas set for a return rate at 9.8 mL min−1. The reduced\
    \ irrigation events at 22.5 imposed\nan increase of the installations’ capacity\
    \ to 13.3 m3 h−1. Alternatively, with 10 m3 h−1, the\ninstallations capacity of\

    \ of 502 m3 1000 m−2 [6]. The irrigation installations delivered 10 m3 h−1 and\
    \ the\naverage Eca for the season was 5.8 mm day−1. The Dday for this apparatus\

    Irrigation agriculture consumes the largest proportion of water diverted for various\n\
    uses in semi-arid areas of the world. In response, farmers must manage their water\
    \ more\neffectively, and this requires the incorporation of irrigation scheduling\
    \ techniques into\ntheir standard management practices. Irrigation scheduling\
    \ may require farm managers to\nmake decisions as frequently as daily for the\
    \ crop production system. One of the essential\nelements of an irrigation scheduling\
    \ program is the availability of climatic data. However,\nin many locations, the\
    \ complete datasets of meteorological variables required are not\navailable. A\
    \ hydraulic evapotranspiration multisensor (HEM) prototype for the on-farm\nmonitoring\
    \ of evaporated water was developed and used in a pilot plot. Continual access\
    \ to\nthe effects of climatic parameters on water evaporated will allow a farmer\
    \ to better manage\nhis irrigation scheduling system. The HEM senses changes in\
    \ the weather constituents\n(e.g., rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind velocity,\
    \ and sunshine) in a holistic way, thus\nmore efﬁciently, and it is applicable\
    \ where drip or sprinkler irrigation is practiced, no\nmatter whether electric\
    \ power is available. This product meets the criteria for farmers’\nacceptance,\
    \ as it easy to install and maintain, and it requires minimal record keeping and\n\
    evaluation. The conﬁguration, operation, and use of this device will undoubtedly\
    \ be reﬁned\nand improved as more farmers use and depend on it.\nAuthor Contributions:\

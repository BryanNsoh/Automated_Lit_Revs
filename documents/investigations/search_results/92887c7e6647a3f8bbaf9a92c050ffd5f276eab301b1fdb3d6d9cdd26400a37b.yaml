    agriculture plays a vital role. For the cultivation of crops, farmers need to
    think a lot, i.e., which crop would give a better yield, how the weather would
    be and lot more. Predicting which crop would give better yield involves different
    factors like soil pH value, rainfall, area, temperature and many more. This helps
    the farmer to get a good crop with good revenue. By this, farmers will also be
    able to lead a better life. Knowing which crop to grow is a very important aspect
    before we cultivate any crop. Here, in this paper, we would be using few factors
    and predicting which crop to grow so that it gives a better yield. The factors
    which we are going to use in this are from a dataset which has N, P, K values,
    temperature in that area, humidity in that area, pH values and rainfall. Here,
    N, P, K values involve the values of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium levels
    in the soil. These values play a vital role in knowing how the soil is and will
    help in knowing which crop would grow better that soil. Rainfall is also an important
    aspect to know the weather conditions and how many centimeters rainfall might
    occur. We would be using those factors and predicting which crop to grow like
    rice, paddy, coffee, maize, etc. We are going to split the data and then apply
    few machine learning-based techniques to predict which crop to grow and then predicting
    the accuracy percentage to know which algorithm is going to work better to predict
    the crop. The machine learning algorithms involves decision tree classifier algorithm,
    random forest algorithm and k-nearest neighbor algorithm. After predicting which
    crop to grow, we would calculate some accuracy score so that we would be able
    to know which algorithm is giving best prediction among them. By getting the accuracy
    score, we can help farmer by predicting which crop to grow in their farm by using
    the best algorithm among them which we applied. We also applied few dimensionality
    reduction techniques like PCA and LDA to get better accuracy and also cross-validated
    the accuracy predicted. By predicting the accuracy percentage to know which algorithm
    works better, we also represented that graphically to get it easily understandable.
    2 Literature Review Suganya et al. [1] paper is about predicting the yield of
    the crop using different algorithms in machine learning techniques like k-nearest
    neighbors, support vector machine, logistic regression, random forest and decision
    tree. By applying all those algorithms, they concluded that logistic regression
    works better among all the algorithms and support vector machine gives worst performance
    among all of them. Venugopal et al. [2] paper is about predicting which crop to
    be grown and which crop gives the maximum yield for the farmer. The factors on
    which the crop and yield are predicted are temperature, rainfall, area, etc. In
    this, different machine learning algorithms like naïve Bayes, logistic regression
    and random forest are applied on the dataset having the abovementioned factors
    for predicting the crop and also for getting the accuracy percentage. Among them,
    random forest gives the best accuracy. Anbananthen et al. [3] paper is about helping
    the farmer to know which crop to grow so that it gives good yield. Here, different
    hybrid machine learning techniques are applied like random forest regressor, gradient-boosted
    tree regression and stacked generalization so that we can analyze which algorithm
    gives better accuracy for recommending the crop to the farmer. From the above
    three hybrid machine learning algorithms, stacked generalization gives the best
    accuracy of yield and this algorithm can be used to know which crop can be grown.
    Suresh et al. [4] paper is about predicting the crop and also yield of the crop
    based on the factors of location such as state name, district name and also based
    on the season. Here, for predicting the crop, they used the machine learning algorithm
    named decision tree, and for predicting the yield, they used machine learning
    algorithm named linear regression, and the model gives a good accuracy percentage
    when predicted. Kakaraparthi et al. [5] paper is about predicting the price of
    the crop based on the factors rainfall and wholesale price index. Here, they used
    machine learning technique named decision tree for estimating the price of the
    crop for next twelve months. This prediction of price would help the farmer in
    getting a good revenue. Nagini et al. [6] paper is about predicting the yield
    of a particular crop in a particular region based on the factors like soil characteristics,
    soil moisture, surface temperature, nitrogen, water, rain water. Here, they used
    various regression-based machine learning techniques like linear regression, multiple
    linear regression, non-linear models. The accuracy percentage of predicted yield
    among different algorithms is compared to know which algorithm works better. Jadhav
    et al. [7] had stated about working with some advanced farming technologies like
    GPS technology app that captures the user details and locations are given to it
    and it will provide yield prediction and crop through various machine learning
    algorithms applied on the data. Suruliandi et al. [8] have conveyed that for healthy
    production, we need to prefer latest procedures like comparing and selecting the
    feature selection methods with various classification or machine learning models
    based on the accuracy to get the optimal result. Choudhary et al. [9] have expressed
    about providing the importance of latest farming techniques and machine learning
    algorithms to farmers that prevent imprecision farming and also identify crop
    as well as classify plant disease through a GUI app. Kadam et al. [10] have portrayed
    the content which explains about consistency in yield will be regularized by a
    framework called crop recommendation model that includes deep learning algorithm
    and predefined data are linked with AgroSYS neural network architecture to give
    valid accuracy. Anguraj et al. [11] have mentioned that the procedure for a crop
    to be grown is of capturing soil parameters with help of IOT sensor device that
    collects the data and that is given to the GUI which performs operation and displays
    the required crop based on given attributes. Vaishnavi et al. [12] have explained
    about planting crops with help of its content related to productivity and season
    which are given to machine learning models that allow to choose the right crop
    for cultivation that reduces the climatic risk factors and maintains healthy agricultural
    environment. Gupta et al. [13] have stated about an android application that operates
    on machine learning platform which depicts the crop yield and type as soil and
    weather parameters are concatenated as well as given to train the models and will
    provide suitable crop according to given attributes gained from soil testing laboratory
    and agriculture experts. Palanivel et al. [14] stated that how various machine
    algorithms are useful in the prediction of yield because of number of factors
    like water shortage, soil fertility affect the crop yield and accuracy. They achieved
    the prediction of crop yield using algorithms in big data computing paradigm.
    Romero et al.’s [15] main objective is that to predict the durum wheat yield through
    the machine algorithms and compare them to detect which algorithm gives the best
    result. Ying-Xue et al.’s [16] project is about to generate rice development stage
    and yield prediction model and then it is used to integrate into SBOCM system.
    SBOCM system is used for perennial simulation and one-year rice predictions within
    certain scale ranges. Shekoofa et al. [17] analyzed a large number of physiological
    and agronomic traits by screening, clustering and decision tree models to select
    the most relevant factors for the prospect of accurately increasing maize grain
    yield. Decision tree is the most used tool. The results showed that the model
    techniques are useful tools for crop physiologists. Everingham et al. [18] stated
    that a data mining method like random forest is used to generate a prediction
    model for sugarcane. They have significantly saw the changes in the yield of the
    sugarcane, and the algorithm is working perfectly. Better crop predictions allow
    farmers to improve their nitrogen management to meet the demands of the new crops.
    Champaneri et al. [19] stated that prediction of the crop yield in advance of
    its harvest would help the farmers and policy makers for making appropriate measures
    for marketing and storage. Random forest is the most powerful algorithm capable
    of performing both classification and regression tasks. It predicts the yield
    of the crops accurately. Mufamadi et al. [20] had viewed the concept related to
    choosing appropriate crop on the basis of applying and performing machine learning
    algorithms and its related operations such as support vector machine and random
    forest on the soil features, namely nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus as well
    as pH value which in turn gives the right crop. 3 Motivation Agriculture, as the
    world’s largest industry, is finding it increasingly difficult to forecast profits
    as the world’s population grows exponentially. Our country, India, has over 70
    percent of its population dependent on agriculture. Recently, most of the farmers
    are leaving farming and doing other daily wages work for their livelihood because
    of the losses they are making in the agriculture they cannot live with loses.
    If they know the exact yield, they can produce before the harvesting, then they
    can escape from their losses, to do that there are different approaches in the
    technologies to predict the yield before the harvesting. With the perfect decision-making
    algorithm, we can predict the accuracy of each crop and make them cultivate so
    that they can get profits. With the exact values of the soil content and the factors
    affecting the agriculture, we predict which crop should be grown. 4 Methodology
    In this methodology, we would be discussing about the different aspects of the
    project such as the dataset attributes, the algorithms applied and the steps involved
    in getting the crop recommendation. 4.1 Dataset Retrieval In agriculture crop
    prediction, we consider various factors for prediction and each has a unique importance
    for their consideration. The dataset is collected and should be preprocessed before
    any machine learning techniques are applied on the dataset. In this project, we
    considered few factors and based on those factors we would be predicting the crop.
    The attributes of dataset involve temperature, pH value, humidity, rainfall and
    nutrients like nitrogen (N), potassium (K), phosphorous (P). Using these, we would
    be predicting the crop name. The independent attributes of the dataset involve
    temperature, pH value, humidity, rainfall and nutrients. The dependent variable
    will be the label which is the name of the crop, and it is predicted using all
    the independent variables. We would be applying different algorithms on this dataset
    like decision tree, random forest and KNN. We would also be applying the dimensionality
    reduction techniques like PCA and LDA before applying any algorithm to improve
    the accuracy percentage of crop prediction. 4.2 Algorithm Building Three machine
    learning algorithms make up the model in this study. The algorithms make predictions
    depending on the correctness of each individual’s work. In some cases, the accuracy
    supplied by the algorithms may be identical, but we have incorporated extra features
    to forecast the best method in addition to the accuracy provided by the algorithms.
    K-nearest neighbor, decision tree, random forest are the algorithms employed.
    To acquire the projected crop accuracy, we apply several algorithms to the dataset
    during algorithm development. We compare the predicted crop accuracy with the
    different algorithms with cross-validation and without cross-validation (Fig.
    1). Fig. 1 Architecture of crop recommendation system Full size image We have
    applied dimensionality reduction methods like principal component analysis (PCA)
    and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) to the algorithms, and we have compared
    the predicted crop accuracy with cross-validation and without cross-validation.
    In PCA dimensionality reduction, it reduces the number of input variables for
    dataset and increases the accuracy of the crop prediction. In LDA, it is used
    to project the features in higher dimension space to the lower dimension space
    and increase the accuracy, and it is compared with cross-validation and without
    cross-validation. The key benefit of applying dimensionality reduction is to improve
    the accuracy of the model and the model to run as soon as possible with least
    amount of time complexity while still providing the best output with the best-predicted
    values. 4.3 Accuracy Prediction and Comparison 4.3.1 Accuracy Prediction Without

    on the scale of 20 in the range of 0–100 (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Accuracy using different

    5.1 Accuracy Prediction Table 5.1.1 Without Any Dimensionality Reduction Technique
    These are the accuracy values of different machine learning algorithms obtained
    before and after applying cross-validation on the dataset; the above table shows
    that random forest has given the highest percentage and responded positively for
    both with and without cross-validation compared to other algorithms (Table 1).
    Table 1 Accuracy percentages without any dimensionality reduction technique Full
    size table 5.1.2 With PCA Dimensionality Reduction Technique The table represents
    the accuracy results of three algorithms gained after applying dimensionality
    reduction technique called principal component analysis to get much better output;
    here, a difference to be noticed is that by applying cross-validation on KNN,
    we got highest value of 96.7 than other techniques (Table 2). Table 2 Accuracy

    Accuracy Prediction Table with LDA Dimensionality Reduction Technique The second
    dimensionality reduction technique that is used to improve the working of algorithms
    is linear discriminant analysis applied on the dataset which leads to the compression
    of dataset gives more efficient and the highest results that random forest has
    got up to 99.18% with cross-validation (Table 3). Table 3 Accuracy percentages
    with LDA dimensionality reduction technique Full size table 5.2 Time Complexity
    for Accuracy Predicted 5.2.1 Without Any Dimensionality Reduction Technique The
    time complexity table shows and states that in how much duration that each algorithm
    has taken to provide the result and accuracy. From above dataset, we can say that
    the random forest has taken the least and minimum time of 0.3 s to provide the
    result (Table 4). Table 4 Time complexity without any dimensionality reduction
    technique Full size table 5.2.2 With PCA Dimensionality Reduction Technique The
    above data in table show the time complexity for principle component analysis
    which has provided the least time that random forest has taken without cross-validation
    (Table 5). Table 5 Time complexity with PCA dimensionality reduction technique
    Full size table 5.2.3 With LDA Dimensionality Reduction Technique The above table
    shows about time taken by each algorithm after applying linear discriminant analysis,
    we can see that without applying cross-validation on KNN has taken 0.08 milliseconds
    of time to complete the task which is very less compared to other algorithms (Table
    6). Table 6 Time complexity with LDA dimensionality reduction technique Full size
    table 6 Conclusion This project ensures the reduction of farmer’s suicide rate
    by improving the production per yield, due to which there will be a healthy society.
    By using machine learning algorithms, we are able to predict which type of crop
    to be grown based on given conditions, as it performs some operations like classification
    and regression and applies algorithms such as decision tree, random forest and
    KNN on the given dataset which contains values related to weather and soil. Among
    all the classifiers, the random forest has given the best accuracy of 98.8%.On
    comparing dataset accuracy percentages of different machine learning algorithms
    along cross-validation, we can state that without and with applying dimensionality
    reduction technique such as principle component analysis, both got exact potentiality
    values and there percentages got increased. We can conclude from above research
    that the cross-validation has increased the accuracy percentage of crop prediction
    in each and every case whether we applied dimensionality reduction technique or
    not. But we can also say from above results that the accuracy prediction when
    LDA dimensionality reduction technique is applied gives very similar accuracy
    to that when no dimensionality reduction technique is applied. Among all the algorithms
    applied, i.e., decision tree, random forest and KNN, the random forest gives the
    best accuracy with or without any dimensionality reduction technique and also
    random forest works the best among three algorithms even when cross-validation
    is applied. References Suganya M, Dayana R, Revathi R (2020) Crop yield prediction

    (FLANN) approach Article 01 July 2022 1 Introduction From a climatic and topographic
    perspective, the planet Earth is divided into eight main biogeographic realms:
    Nearctic, Neotropical, Palearctic, Afrotropical, Indo-Malayan, Australian, Oceanic,
    and Antarctic. Colombia, due to its geographic location, is within the Neotropical
    Kingdom, a region rich in biological diversity that encompasses South America,
    Central America and Mexico [1]. Corn plays a crucial role as a global staple food,
    consumed daily by more than 4.5 billion people. It is highly relevant due to its
    caloric content and environmental adaptability, and its demand is expected to
    experience significant growth in the coming years due to the increase in the global
    population [2,3,4,5,6]. In the specific case of Colombia, corn accounts for 9%
    of the daily calorie supply; however, the country relies on imports for 74% of
    its demand [7]. This situation highlights the urgent need to strengthen domestic
    production, ensure crop availability, and reduce global dependence. Ensuring effective
    corn production with high yields requires preventive policies based on information,
    commonly obtained through decision-making guided by predictive data models [8,9,10,11,12].
    The estimation of crop yields is a task of paramount importance for food security
    [12,13,14,15]. With this information, farmers, commercial improvement organizations,
    and government agencies make informed decisions that allow for proper crop management,
    the implementation of development policies, the promotion of national food policies,
    and the promotion of international trade [4, 16,17,18,19]. In the case of corn
    crops, estimating their yield helps to understand their response to different
    environmental stresses [20, 21] and, thus, provides relevant information for their
    management in a sustainable agriculture environment [22,23,24]. However, making
    estimates with a high degree of accuracy is a complex task. This process involves
    multiple factors that directly and indirectly affect plant growth [4, 25,26,27].
    The constant spatial and temporal changes in planting environments, as well as
    the continuous interaction between factors, result in highly complex and non-linear
    effects that, in practice, make it difficult to provide accurate estimates [28,29,30].
    To achieve successful predictions, a representative dataset for each study case
    is required, containing a subset of features capable of appropriately describing
    the target concept. Predictive models that employ many features are often irrelevant
    and noisy, with low precision and accuracy, requiring analysis and selection of
    the features to be used to ensure the accuracy of the results obtained [31]. The
    objective of this research is to identify the climatic factors that are critical
    in the accurate prediction of corn crop yields in Colombia, a country belonging
    to the Neotropical zone, to guide the construction of more accurate predictive
    models with regional applicability. To achieve this, a feature relevance estimation
    technique is employed, and prediction algorithms are used to validate their performance.
    While some studies have revealed highly influential factors that can improve model
    accuracy [32, 33], very few have focused their efforts on identifying those that
    are predominant in the Neotropical zone for this type of crop. The rest of the
    document is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the related works in the
    case study. Section 3 shows the methodology used in the research. Section 4 describes
    the development and results obtained. Section 5 provides the discussion of results.
    Section 6 addresses the conclusions and Sect. 7 discusses future work followed
    by the references. 2 Related works According to the systematic review conducted
    in SCOPUS, Science Direct, Web of Science, PugMed, IEEE and Google Scholar, among
    the researches that focus their efforts on examining the influence of the various
    factors involved in the yield of corn crops, there are varied approaches in the
    estimation of the relevance of factors; the quality of this estimation depends,
    to a large extent, on the availability of data and the methods used, their complexity
    and performance significantly impact the selection of attributes and, therefore,
    the precision of the proposed predictive models. A common approach is the use
    of statistical methods. In the study [34], the “C–D production function model”
    algorithm was applied to evaluate the relevance of factors such as the application
    of fertilizers, pesticides, sown area and precipitation, respect to the yield
    of corn crops in Daqing city, China. It was concluded that the application of
    pesticides and fertilizers significantly influences yield, as does precipitation,
    whose impact varies depending on the variety of corn planted. Similarly, in [35],
    Pearson correlation coefficient and coefficient of determination were used to
    analyze variables associated with soil and topography in the states of Illinois
    and Indiana, EE. UU., highlighting elevation and terrain curvature as the most
    influential factors on yield. In [36], multiple linear regression was used to
    evaluate 18 factors related to crop growth in the EE. UU., highlighting precipitation
    and late season temperature as the most influential. Another approach focuses
    on checking the relevance of factors by testing different subgroups of attributes
    directly on predictive models. In research [37] they use the Random Forest (RF)
    algorithm to estimate the yield of corn crops in the EE. UU., using different
    combinations of variables until they find the one that presents the best performance
    for the predictive model. In this case, the result is that the year, region, irrigation
    and seasonal climate are the most relevant factors to predict with high accuracy
    the yield to be obtained at the end of the season. The authors of [38] evaluate
    the influence of 20 attributes related to soil, topography and type of corn crop
    in two fields in Illinois, EE.UU., using different variations of Artificial Neural
    Networks (ANN). They use an intelligent problem solver to randomly test 150 combinations
    of ANN attributes and configurations, to find the model with the best precision,
    resulting in: corn hybrid, relative terrain elevation and cation exchange capacity
    are the factors with the highest degree of influence on the estimation of crop
    yield. Finally, in the research [39], the Hybrid-Maize model, which allows simulating
    corn crop yield and the influence of each factor on the yield, is used to analyze
    12 factors related to corn hybrids, crop management and climatic factors in Huanghuaihai,
    China. Through verification of multiple variations in these factors, precipitation
    and temperature were identified as the most relevant, explaining approximately
    50% of the yield obtained at the end of the season. 3 Methodology This research
    is based on the CRISP-DM methodology, widely used by various authors to describe
    the life cycle of standard data mining projects [40]. It aims to develop the necessary
    mechanisms for identifying and selecting the climatic factors with the highest
    degree of influence on predicting corn crop yield in Colombia. Below, we present
    a detailed description of the phases that comprise the methodology used: 1. Understanding
    the Problem: This phase addresses the lack of precision in predictive models for
    corn crop yield, emphasizing the importance of selecting influential factors for
    model training. This identifies the knowledge gap to be addressed, leading to
    the case study and the research objective. 2. Understanding the Data: Involves
    the search and collection of data in the form of historical records related to
    climatic factors and corn crop yield in the region. Through analysis, the necessary
    processing and transformation procedures are identified to create a dataset ready
    for use. There is a fundamental relationship between the phase of understanding
    the problem and understanding the data; understanding the problem implies the
    need to have access to the data and its adequate interpretation. 3. Data Preparation:
    Various techniques are employed to transform the data according to the study’s
    requirements. Initially, attribute cleansing is carried out on the datasets by
    analyzing their frequency of use in research related to the case study, establishing
    a starting point for transformation processes. Subsequently, the climatic dataset
    is adjusted to a semi-annual periodicity corresponding to the yield data. Next,
    the datasets are integrated by matching them based on date and location, outlier
    values are removed, and normalization is performed. Finally, using RReliefF as
    a method to estimate feature relevance, a subset of attributes representing the
    best configuration for the predictive model is selected, resulting in a single
    transformed dataset ready for use in the modeling phase. 4. Modeling: ANN and
    Linear Regression (LR) are used to build two predictive models, each with two
    different configurations: one employing the selected subset of variables and the
    other using the total available variables in the study. This is done to validate
    the performance of the selected attributes. In this context, the modeling phase
    is closely linked to the data preparation phase. During model configuration and
    testing, it may be necessary to make additional adjustments to the data set to
    ensure efficient and accurate integration with the required information. 5. Evaluation:
    The results obtained in the modeling phase are evaluated to verify the performance
    of the selected subset of factors and determine if there is a significant improvement
    compared to using the total available variables. This phase seeks to ensure the
    fulfillment of the research objective, depending on the result of the model evaluation,
    its determined if it can advance to the next phase of the process. If its insufficient,
    it returns to the phase of understanding the problem to carry out the necessary
    changes and make the corresponding adjustments. 6. Deployment: The obtained results
    are discussed, highlighting the most important findings regarding the factors
    with the highest degree of relevance in estimating corn crop yield, potential
    associations between features, and the overall performance of the models with
    and without the use of the selected subset of attributes. Figure 1 illustrates
    the general structure of the methodology and the interaction between its phases.

    description The dataset used in this study consists of historical records of climatic
    factors and corn crop performance in Colombia. Yield data has been recorded semi-annually
    from 2006 to 2021 in various regions of the country. 4.1.1 Climatic data These
    data are provided by the Consultation and Download of Hydrometeorological Data
    system of the Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology, and Environmental Studies of
    Colombia [41]. They originate from over 4.400 meteorological stations located
    throughout the country. The dataset comprises 20 climatological variables, including
    Maximum Temperature, Minimum Temperature, Average Temperature, Precipitation,
    Vapor Pressure, Solar Radiation, Sunshine Hours, Cloud Cover, Evaporation, Wind
    Speed, and Relative Humidity, with over 1.5 million daily records. 4.1.2 Yield
    data These are obtained from the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development
    [42] and come from historical records of traditional maize harvests across the
    country. The dataset includes 17 variables related to production data, including
    Yield, Planted Area, Harvested Area, Physical Production Status, and Production,
    totaling 22.440 individual records with semi-annual periodicity, commonly used
    for transient crop types. 4.2 Data preparation Data preparation begins with the
    refinement of features in the previously described datasets based on their frequency
    of use in related research concerning the case study. This reduces the number
    of attributes to be transformed and analyzed in later phases. To determine which
    attributes are commonly used in other research, the results obtained from 19 related
    studies are reviewed, with reference to the variables available in the climatic
    dataset. Table 1 presents the results, with attributes analyzed horizontally and
    the reviewed research studies listed vertically, marked with an (X) for attributes
    used in each study. Table 1 Frequency of use of climatic factors for corn crop
    yield prediction Full size table The results reveal that precipitation, minimum
    temperature, maximum temperature, average temperature, vapor pressure, solar radiation,
    and evaporation are the most frequently used climatic characteristics, with a
    total of 17, 17, 17, 8, 8, 5, and 3 appearances, respectively. In contrast, cloud
    cover, wind speed, and dew point temperature are excluded from the study due to
    their low utilization in the case study. Next, the climatic dataset is transformed
    by calculating the arithmetic mean of each attribute semi-annually, reducing the
    annual records from 364 to 2, corresponding to each year’s A and B semesters,
    resulting in a total of 10.225 records with semi-annual periodicity. Subsequently,
    using the Department, Municipality, Year, and Period fields as reference points,
    the climatic and yield datasets are integrated, resulting in 2.984 records and
    13 attributes, including yield. Temporal and location attributes are then removed,
    leaving the dataset with 8 variables. Through the calculation of Z-Score by attribute,
    which indicates how far a particular value deviates from its arithmetic mean,
    outlier values accounting for 5.46% of the data are identified and removed, resulting
    in a total of 2.821 records. The Min–Max data normalization method is applied,
    using the minimum and maximum values of each attribute as reference. Table 2 displays
    a segment of the resulting dataset after applying these transformation techniques.
    Table 2 Fragment of the resulting dataset after data preparation Full size table
    As a final step, the RReliefF algorithm is applied to identify variables with
    the highest relevance to the dependent variable. RReliefF is an improved version
    of the Relief and ReliefF methods, allowing for the identification of statistically
    influential attributes with respect to a target attribute through case-based learning.
    Relief involves assigning a weight to each attribute, modifying it based on the
    Euclidean distance calculation between randomly selected instances of the attribute
    and their nearest neighbors, both from the same attribute (near-hit) and the target
    attribute (near-miss). Finally, attributes that exceed a predefined threshold
    are selected [52]. On the other hand, RReliefF incorporates the ability to address
    regression problems, where the target class is continuous [53]. Table 3 presents
    the results of applying the RReliefF method, which indicates that the attribute
    with the highest degree of relevance to yield is solar radiation, followed by
    precipitation, vapor pressure, and maximum and minimum temperatures. Average temperature
    and evaporation have a lower degree of influence compared to the other attributes.

    table 4.3 Predictive model In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the chosen
    attributes in estimating corn crop yields, two predictive models were developed:
    one using ANN and another using LR. For each, two different configurations are
    presented: one involving all the variables used in the research and another based
    on the selected subset of attributes. Each configuration is detailed below: Artificial
    Neural Network: The Multi-layer Perceptron type was used, which, due to its structure
    and high performance in pattern association for predictions [54], is optimally
    suited for the needs of this research. The ANN is configured using 10 and 5 neurons
    in the input layer corresponding to the number of input variables in the model,
    considering all available attributes and the selected subset, respectively. It
    has 3 hidden layers with 64, 32, and 16 neurons each and an output layer with
    1 neuron. Adam is used as the optimization function, Relu as the activation function,
    Mean Squared Error (MSE) as the loss function, and 200 training epochs. Linear
    Regression: The Ridge algorithm (L2) is employed, an alternative regularized version
    of least squares that reduces variance and mean absolute error [55], configured
    with a penalty coefficient (Alpha) of 0.0001. 70% of the data, randomly selected
    from the dataset, were used for model training. The remaining percentage was used
    to validate the accuracy in each case. Table 4 presents the results obtained,
    specifying each model’s configuration and performance, evaluated using metrics
    such as MSE, Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE), both
    in the training and validation phases. Table 4 Performance of predictive models
    in the training and validation phase Full size table The results reveal that the
    ANN model with the selected subset of variables exhibited the best performance,
    achieving an RMSE of 0.1216, translating to a notable accuracy of 87.84%. In contrast,
    the LR model with the same subset of variables achieved an RMSE of 0.1417, equivalent
    to an accuracy of 85.76%. On the other hand, the ANN model that used all available
    variables showed significantly lower performance compared to its counterpart that
    used the selected subset of variables, registering an RMSE of 0.1403 and an accuracy
    of 85.97%. Similarly, the LR model obtained an RMSE of 0.1424, equivalent to an
    accuracy of 85.76%. 5 Discussion of results Most research on factors affecting
    corn crop yields focuses on biogeographic zones of the: Nearctic that exhibit
    climatic diversity with variation in conditions from arid in the southwest to
    a temperate climate on the east coast, a topography that encompasses vast plains,
    majestic mountains and extensive plateaus, such as the United States, and the
    Palearctic and Indo-Malayan, which experience climates from arid and cold in the
    north to tropical in the south, with a topography that includes vast plains in
    the east, majestic mountains in the west and plateaus in the center, such as China
    [1]. According to the literature review, there is little research in relation
    to countries near the equator, which make up the Neotropical, characterized by
    tropical and equatorial climates, with warm temperatures throughout the year and
    rainy seasons. Climate variability has a differentiated impact in each region,
    affecting corn crop yields in a unique way in each geographic area. The presence
    of seasons in countries such as the United States and China introduces specific
    challenges, such as seasonal droughts, which can have direct consequences on corn
    production [56], while in equatorial countries, the absence of different seasons
    minimizes these climatic risks, offering distinct conditions for corn cultivation.
    This diversity in corn response to climate highlights the need for research that
    analyzes the relevance of climatic factors on crop yields, considering the biogeographic
    and topographic heterogeneity of the region. In research such as [35, 38], focused
    on the analysis of topographic factors and soil properties, although they do not
    establish a direct correlation with the present study as they do not address climatic
    aspects, they make it possible to understand and compare equally relevant elements.
    These include the type of methods used to evaluate the relevance of characteristics,
    the methodology employed and the relative influence of other types of factors
    on corn crop yields. This study proposes an approach that identifies the most
    influential factors in the prediction of corn crop yields by evaluating the degree
    of relevance of each attribute with respect to crop yield, considering the interaction
    between attributes by assigning weights based on their neighborhood, using the
    RReliefF algorithm. The results show that in the Neotropical zone, solar radiation
    exerts the greatest degree of influence, followed closely by precipitation. In
    addition, vapor pressure and maximum and minimum temperature exhibit values greater
    than 0.020. Although their magnitudes are smaller than those corresponding to
    solar radiation and precipitation, they have a high influence on the estimation
    of corn crop yields. In the studies that consider the influence of climatic factors,
    a high correspondence is evidenced in relation to precipitation and temperature,
    when accurately estimating the yield to be obtained at the end of the season,
    as presented in Table 5, ratifying the results obtained in this research. Table
    5 Most influential factors in corn crop yields by research Full size table The
    choice of RReliefF in feature selection before implementing a predictive model
    offers key advantages compared to other approaches such as using statistical methods
    [34,35,36] or direct implementation of predictive models [37,38,39]. RReliefF
    stands out for its sensitivity to local interactions, predictive model independence,
    robustness to noise, interpretability, and computational efficiency. By focusing
    on evaluating feature relevance at the local level, RReliefF can capture specific
    patterns and provide more robust and efficient feature selection, independent
    of the subsequent prediction algorithm. These features make RReliefF an attractive
    option in situations where feature interpretation, noise resilience and computational
    efficiency are valued. On the other hand, the values obtained for average temperature
    and evaporation are slightly lower compared to the other attributes. Although
    these factors have also been identified in previous studies as relevant for estimating
    corn crop yield, their relative influence in the case study is lower. It is important
    to note that despite their lower degree of influence, these attributes can still
    play a significant role in yield prediction when considered together with other
    climatic factors. According to the results, solar radiation is the most important
    factor in estimating corn crop yield. It plays a fundamental role by providing
    the necessary energy for the photosynthesis process in plants, which directly
    influences carbohydrate production and crop growth. The energy captured through
    solar radiation is essential for driving the biological processes that determine
    corn crop production and yield [57]. Precipitation also plays a crucial role due
    to its significant influence on yield. Its variability during the crop growth
    cycle has a significant impact on the outcomes. This factor is the primary source
    of water for crops, making it crucial for meeting their water needs. Unlike other
    factors like temperature, solar radiation, and wind, which are consumers, precipitation
    directly supplies the water needed for plant development and growth [58]. Vapor
    pressure is another determinant factor in this estimation process, allowing us
    to understand the pressure exerted by the water vapor content in the air in a
    specific area, and consequently, how much water vapor is present in the air. Additionally,
    it determines the air’s capacity to hold water molecules and has a direct relationship
    with temperature. When temperature increases, the air’s capacity to store water
    molecules in the air and vapor pressure increase [59]. Maximum and minimum air
    temperatures are essential characteristics in the yield forecasting process as
    they regulate plant development rates and the duration of growth processes. Moreover,
    they control the capacity of the air to hold water molecules, and their variation
    over time determines a significant part of the corn crop growth stages [60]. During
    the training and validation process of the models, an increase in accuracy was
    observed when reducing the input variable set from 10 to 5. In the case of the
    ANN-based model, the configuration with 5 variables achieved an accuracy of 87.84%.
    In contrast, the accuracy of the model with 10 variables was 85.97%. Similarly,
    in the LR model, the configuration with 5 variables resulted in an accuracy of
    85.83%, surpassing the accuracy of the model with 10 variables, which was 85.76%.
    The reduction of variables allowed the models to more effectively capture the
    relationships between climatic factors and corn crop yield, confirming the importance
    of the selection process in the predictive capability of the models. The use of
    climatic factors and models based on them plays a fundamental role in addressing
    the issue of corn production. By identifying the relevance of attributes such
    as solar radiation, precipitation, vapor pressure, and maximum and minimum temperatures
    in predicting corn crop yield, a more comprehensive understanding of how climate
    changes affect agricultural production is achieved. This information is crucial
    for making informed decisions in crop planning, irrigation, and other agricultural
    practices. Anticipating the values of these attributes and their influence on
    corn crop yield allows farmers to take necessary management measures to improve
    results, adapting agricultural practices according to forecasted weather conditions.
    6 Conclusions The climatic and topographic diversity between biogeographic zones
    shows specific challenges and different patterns in in corn crop yields. The Nearctic
    biogeographic zone experiences seasonal challenges such as droughts, the Palearctic
    and Indo-Malayan zones have climates ranging from arid and cold to tropical, and
    the Neotropical zone, to which the equatorial countries belong, presents warm
    temperatures throughout the year and rainy seasons. From the study carried out
    in Colombia, a country in the Neotropical zone, its evident that solar radiation,
    precipitation, vapor pressure and maximum and minimum temperature are the climatic
    factors that have the greatest influence on the estimation of corn crop yields,
    with a relevance factor (RRelifF) of 0.033, 0.032, 0.026, 0.022 and 0.021, respectively.
    These factors, both individually and in their interaction during the crop growth
    cycle, play a determining role in the yield obtained at the end of the cycle.
    The significant relevance of these variables in the estimation of agricultural
    yield is essential for the construction of high- precision predictive models,
    which are crucial for improving production processes at the regional level. When
    contrasting the performance of predictive models that used the complete set of
    variables with the subset representing the most relevant climatic factors, the
    importance of identifying the fundamental variables that should be considered
    when defining high-precision and reliable models becomes evident. In this case
    study, the ANN model achieved higher accuracy in yield estimation when using the
    selected variable set, achieving an RMSE of 0.1216, compared to the configuration
    that used all available variables, which obtained an RMSE of 0.1403. Similarly,
    the LR-based model showed better performance when using the subset of variables,
    obtaining an RMSE of 0.1417 compared to the configuration that used all variables
    and obtained an RMSE of 0.1424. 7 Future works To optimize the predictive capacity
    of the models and adapt to specific contexts, additional variables could be considered
    in future work, such as soil quality, fertilizer use, and presence of pests. Conducting
    detailed temporal analyzes of corn crops to establish how climatic factors affect
    each phase of the growth cycle. Improving accuracy and efficiency may include
    techniques such as deep learning algorithms and optimization methods and integrating
    satellite data sets for more accurate measurements and improved spatial resolution.
    These improvements will result in a better understanding of the factors that influence
    corn crop yield estimation and facilitate effective application of the results
    in agricultural decision making. Data availability In accordance with the transparency

  description: 'Sugarcane is the most important renewable commercial crops in India.
    The sugarcane farming and sugar industry are essential to the socio-economic development
    of rural communities by generating greater income and employment opportunities.
    The ability of decision-makers and planners to choose import or export strategies
    is based on the early detection and control of issues related to sugarcane yield
    indicators. In this manuscript, Sugarcane Yield Classification and Prediction
    Using Light weight Deep Network (SY-CP-LWDN) proposed. At first, the data are
    gathered via field and mill. Afterward, the data are fed to pre-processing using
    Triangle Filter (TF). Here the noise present in the data’s are reduced. Then these
    data’s are undergoes segmentation for segmenting canopy, leaf size and color.
    The segmented data’s are given for Adaptive Fuzzy Segmentation Algorithm (DAFSA)
    for segmenting canopy, leaf size and color of Sugarcane. Then the segmented data’s
    are fed to the Feature extraction using Swin Transformer (ST) for extracting the
    features such as Standardizing and Imputation. Finally classification is done
    using light weight deep network (LWDN). The classification results are grade1,
    grade2 and grade 3 of sugarcane yield. Simulation of the model done using python
    and performance metrics also examined. The performance metrics like accuracy,
    ROC used to analyze performance of proposed technique. The Performance of the
    proposed SY-CP-LWDN approach attains 24.11%, 27.12% and 32.73% high accuracy compared
    with existing methods such as Sugarcane yield prediction with data mining and
    crop simulation models (SYP-DM-CSM), Integration of RNN with GARCH refined by
    whale optimization algorithm for yield forecasting: a hybrid machine learning
    approach (IRNN-GARCH-WOA-HMA) and An improved multilayer perceptron approach for

    sector of India''s economy is its primary driver. India is often thought of being
    a land of farmers as well. In India, half of the working population is dedicated
    to the agricultural sector. For farmers, soil is the most fundamental component
    of their work. But, even the farmers have begun returning to more conventional
    practices. Farmers aren''t happy with their yields since they''ve been using the
    same outdated techniques for decades. Better soil quality is essential for growing
    more crops. Thus, a soil test is conducted. Although not essential to farming,
    soil testing is still crucial. Soil is crucial to both crop yield and quality.
    Testing the soil is important because it reveals the levels of key nutrients like
    calcium, potassium, and nitrogen (Nitrogen). Crops and yields are declining for
    Indian farmers as a result of the drought that has hit several parts of the state
    of Maharashtra. As a result, they are completely in the dark regarding the nutritious
    potential of their land. The crop is ploughed using the farmer''s own knowledge
    and expertise, a strategy with a poor success rate. They failed to make a sufficient
    profit from their harvest to repay the loan that had been approved for them. As
    they can''t afford to pay back the debt, they decide to end their lives by hanging
    themselves. One of the primary causes of the rise in suicide rates [1]. We were
    inspired to create this approach so that farmers could more easily choose which
    crop to sow. This data collection includes information about the soil nutrients
    and precipitation that a region''s farmers may take use of. Our method classifies
    soils based on their nutrient content. There is a technique for predicting which
    crops would thrive in a given environment based on the soil type. Hence, both
    the crop output and the farmer''s income improve as a result of adopting this
    new technique. We use cutting-edge technologies to design and build the system.
    To build the system, techniques. The field of machine learning focuses on developing
    automated systems that can retrieve and analyze large amounts of data with the
    purpose of improving their performance. Chances for data-intensive research in
    the interdisciplinary field of agritechnology may be created via the use of machine
    learning, which enables the construction of the automated taking of decisions
    based on previous experiences. In the agriculture industry, for example, machine
    learning is not some mystical trick or magic; rather, it is a well-defined collection
    of models that gather certain types of data and use particular algorithms to produce
    desired outcomes [2]. The proposed algorithm will suggest the best crop to grow
    on a given plot of land. According to variables in the atmosphere and the soil,
    such as precipitation, temperature, humidity, and pH. We gathered them from the
    government''s website, the meteorological service, and V C Farm Mandya. Farmers
    or sensors that measure factors like temperature, humidity, and pH are used to
    provide data into the system. Machine learning predictive algorithms, such as
    [3], use this information to learn from data and make predictions about how that
    data will be used in the future. Farmer recommendations include both crop and
    nutrient addition amounts based on the system''s predictions. The system also
    displays additional details, such as an estimated yield in q/acre, the amount
    of seed needed for cultivation in kg/acre, and the crop''s current market price.
    2 Literature Survey Some of the major efforts done in the world of agriculture
    for crop prediction are reviewed here. The writers of [4] focused on the practical
    uses of data mining methods in the agriculture sector. As data mining is a promising
    new tool, the authors also delved into the challenge of predicting agricultural
    output. Finding data models that provide high accuracy and great generalizability
    in yield predicting skills was cited as the primary motivation for this endeavour.
    These data mining methods were evaluated by the authors on a variety of datasets.
    An approach called the Crop Selection Technique is presented in [5] (CSM). The
    authors detail how the suggested approach may be used to address crop selection
    issues, increase the net yield rate of crops over growing seasons, and promote
    maximum economic development. Several crop forecasting models rely on a variety
    of influencing factors, which the authors reviewed. The writers also provide details
    on machine learning and the many approaches to it. Seasonal crops, all-year crops,
    short- and long-term plantation crops, and fast-growing and slow-growing crops
    were all assigned distinct categories in the suggested Crop Selection System.
    In [6], the authors provide a method for accurately predicting harvest quantities
    and recommending climatic conditions that will result in optimal harvest results.
    In this study, we attempted to predict the per-hectare harvest yield using a variety
    of statistical methods, including models. The author gathered from the USDA and
    included it into his proposed methodology. Besides using the median absolute error
    and R-Square values, the author compared regression, and random forest using Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) values. The authors of
    [3] employed a analysis of historical data to make predictions about future crop
    output and prices. The writers conducted research in many districts throughout
    Tamil Nadu. An automated system, as suggested by the authors, would advise a farmer
    on which crops would provide the highest yield. The system design has previously
    classified demand levels. fluctuating agricultural market prices as a function
    of demand levels allows one to estimate the demand for the crops. The inventors
    of the suggested system performed the text-to-speech conversion themselves. In
    [2], the authors offer a perfect system called Agro Consultant to aid Indian farmers
    in selecting crops according to the current growing season, local climate, and
    soil conditions. Machine learning algorithms including random forest, K-NN, Decision
    Tree, and Neural Network were utilized to create this system. Both a rain forecaster
    and a map viewer are included into the proposed system. The is a novel framework
    developed by the authors of. (XCYPF). For the purpose of predicting crop yields,
    this framework allows for the selection of both the crop and the datasets. The
    authors emphasized the framework''s flexibility and scalability. The authors predicted
    rice and sugarcane yields using weather data and surface temperatures. The authors
    included a fresh approach, which utilizes vegetation indices in tandem, into their
    work. The authors of developed a crop yield prediction model (CRY) based on an
    adaptive clustering method. It analyses and categorizes crops according to their
    growth patterns and harvests using a model inspired by the honeybee hive. The
    authors also provided an overview of the Bee Hive Cluster, which was consulted
    due to its description of agricultural statistics useful for determining crop
    development and its status as a heterogeneous data cluster kept as repositories.
    The writers looked at the Bee Hive, which outperformed similar structures. The
    graphs depicting the yield fluctuation are the result of using the Bee Hive algorithm
    for pattern extraction. The authors of developed to better serve Indian farmers
    and the agricultural industry. This scheme allows for the categorization of soils
    and the prediction of crop yields. Wheat yield predictions are made using a hybrid
    support vector machine/artificial neural network. The authors also used Amazon
    S3 and the Heroku cloud to store agricultural data. 3 Methodology To that end,
    we have developed a machine learning-based system for soil categorization and
    crop prediction. In this study, we compared data from two separate sources. Two
    types of soil and crop information make up the first set of data. Crop data includes
    information such as soil type and crop list, whereas soil data includes information
    such as and potassium levels. There are two parts to the soil dataset: the training
    set and the testing set. The model was trained with 70% of the data and then put
    through its paces using 30% of the data. We''ve developed a web-based app to make
    an informed guess on what will grow in a given plot of land by analysing soil
    characteristics. Our primary objective is to create a functional system that is
    grounded on soil characteristics. In data mining, preprocessing is the process
    of cleaning and organizing raw data before analysis. Data mining may be accomplished
    in several ways. Data pretreatment has been completed, including data cleansing,
    and data reduction. By eradicating outliers and fixing inconsistencies, data cleaning
    may be accomplished. The information comes from a variety of sources. Information
    from several sources may be combined via data integration. To convert data is
    to standardize it, or to undergo data transformation. By grouping and the elimination
    of superfluous details, data reduction may significantly decrease data volume.
    We have utilized five different algorithms: the Support Vector Machine, the Bagged
    Tree, the Ad boost, the Naive Bayes, and the Artificial Neural Network. Using
    an ensemble technique, we''re improving the precision of our system. The ensemble
    model produces more precise findings than the baseline model. The ensemble technique,
    seen in Fig. 1, combines many base models to provide a more precise prediction.
    The majority vote is used to choose which crops the farmer should plant based
    on the predictions of the basic models. Fig. 1 Architecture of the proposed system
    Full size image 3.1 Data Collection The best way to gather and evaluate information
    from many sources like government websites, VC Form Mandya, APMC website… etc.
    is via data gathering. A rough dataset is needed so that the system can function.
    The following characteristics must be present in this data set: The criteria that
    will be taken into account for crop forecast are as follows: (i) Soil PH, (ii)
    Temperature, (iii) Humidity, (iv) Rainfall, (v) Crop data, (v) NPK values. We
    average the precipitation totals from the prior years to make a yearly forecast.
    The Preparation of Data for Analysis 3.2: Following the amassing of data sets
    from many sources. Preprocessing the dataset is required prior to training the
    model. Reading the obtained dataset is the first step in the data preparation
    process, followed by data cleaning. Some of the characteristics in the datasets
    are duplicates, and those are thrown out during the data cleaning process before
    being used in crop prediction. Thus, we must eliminate extraneous characteristics
    and missing values from datasets containing certain missing values must be removed
    or filled with unnecessary nan values for improved accuracy. After that, you must
    specify the goal of the model. The sklearn library will be used to divide the
    cleaned dataset into a training and test set. Predictive algorithms in machine
    learning need highly optimized estimate in order to provide a probable conclusion
    based on learned data (Sect. 3.3). Data, statistical algorithms, and machine learning
    methods are used in predictive analytics to determine the probability of future
    events given existing data. The goal isn''t just to piece together what occurred;
    it''s to predict the future as accurately as possible. Our method made use of
    a supervised machine learning approach, which includes classification and regression
    techniques. As a result, a classification algorithm is the best option for our
    infrastructure. Support Vector Machine Algorithm for Predicting Rainfall. Predicting
    crops using a decision tree algorithm. Instances of the Classification Algorithm
    The first stage in classifying data is developing a classification model, and
    the second is using the model to make predictions about the data''s class label.
    We apply five different categorization methods, including an Artificial Neural
    Network. One supervised machine learning approach is the Support Vector Machine
    (SVM). Although while may be used for both classification and regression, its
    primary use is in the former. SVM method because to its high rate of accuracy.
    Each data point is then placed in an N-dimensional space, and a hyper plane is
    built to divide the space into classes that may subsequently be utilized for classification.
    Hyperspace separates data sets into positive and negative categories. ANN or Artificial
    Neural Network: An ANN is a computational system that simulates the functioning
    of the human brain''s neural networks. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are computer
    simulations of the complex interconnected networks of neurons seen other animals.
    The building blocks of an ANN are synthetic neurons (ANN). The artificial neuron
    is made up of several separate parts that work together. Synapses in a real brain
    are responsible for signal transmission, while their artificial counterparts,
    neurons in an ANN, are responsible for signal reception and processing. An artificial
    neuron functions as a node in an Artificial Neural network, and the link between
    two nodes is known as an edge. We may attribute some value to the neurons and
    the edges. Depending on how strong the signal is, the weight may go up or down.
    Some kind of threshold is built into the neurons and is utilized to trigger neuron
    firing. When the overall signal strength exceeds a certain point, the neuron is
    termed to “fire,” which signifies that the signal is sent to neighboring neurons.
    Naive Bayes is a machine learning classification method also known as a probabilistic
    classifier. One example of is the Naive Bayes algorithm. Naive Bayes employs Bayes’
    theorem on the assumption that characteristics are unrelated. In the realm of
    Bayesian network models, the Naive Bayes is the most basic. This is the statement
    of Bayes’ theorem, which can be found in: $${\\text{P}}\\left( {{\\text{h}}|{\\text{d}}}
    \\right) = \\left( {{\\text{P}}\\left( {{\\text{d}}|{\\text{h}}} \\right)*{\\text{P}}\\left(
    {\\text{h}} \\right)} \\right)/{\\text{P}}\\left( {\\text{d}} \\right)$$ The probability
    that data d exists if and only if hypothesis h holds is denoted by the notation
    P(d|h). Probability P(h) is the likelihood that hypothesis h is correct. Statistically,
    the data have a certain probability, denoted by P(d). AdaBoost: AdaBoost is most
    effective at accelerating judgment in binary classification issues. Several boosting
    algorithms, including the AdaBoost, are described here. The system''s efficiency
    is boosted with the help of the boosting. Because of its recent shift towards
    classification rather than regression, it has been referred to as discrete AdaBoost.
    Every machine learning algorithm may benefit from AdaBoost''s ability to boost
    its performance. A poor classifier may be learned with its help. These are models
    that outperform chance at the highest level possible in a classification task.
    Several other learning algorithms may benefit from using it in tandem with them.
    Starting with a uniform distribution of weights, the preceding classifier who
    failed to make a prediction is given greater weight in subsequent iterations.
    For the ensemble classification, we employed a bagged tree, also called a bagged
    decision tree. Bagging is a technique for increasing the system''s efficiency
    statistically. As a result of bagging, a collection of models is produced that
    have been trained using a random subset of the data. In order to arrive at a final
    crop prediction, the models’ recommendations are being combined [7]. 4 Crop Recommendations
    The system will suggest the best crop to grow based on factors like expected precipitation,
    soil composition, and climate forecasts. In addition to displaying the seed needed
    for a cultivation in Kg per acre, this method also displays the necessary fertilizer
    data, including Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), and potassium (K), in Kg per hectare
    for the suggested crop. The system also includes extras like showing the predicted
    yield in quintals per acre for the crop that is being advised. Such information
    will be invaluable to farmers when they decide which crop to grow. 5 Conclusion
    Right now, our farmers aren''t making the most of available technology and data
    analysis, which increases the likelihood that they''ll make a poor crop choice
    and decrease their revenue. To help mitigate such losses, we''ve built a graphical
    user interface (GUI)-enabled system that can determine which crop is most suited
    to a given plot of land and then supply the farmer with details on the necessary
    nutrients, seeds, cultivation methods, expected yield, and market price for that
    crop. In turn, this encourages farmers to make thoughtful crop selections, leading
    to growth and innovation in the agricultural industry. 6 Future Scope Just providing
    a land''s GPS coordinates allows us to access the government''s weather prediction
    database, allowing us to accurately anticipate the harvest. We can refine the
    model to prevent food shortages and surpluses. References Kushwaha AK. Swetabhattachrya

    estimation 1. Introduction Winter wheat is a crucial staple crop in China, playing
    a vital role in upholding national food security and fostering economic development
    (Al-Shammari et al., 2021). Field-scale crop yield data can provide a valuable
    reference for smallholder farmers to implement timely production interventions
    and apply for agricultural insurance (Zheng et al., 2017). Precise crop yield
    estimation at the regional field scale also holds great significance for national
    food trade and the formulation of agricultural policies (Sagan et al., 2021).
    However, China''s agricultural mechanization lags, with most harvesters lacking
    onboard field yield recorders (Wen et al., 2022b). The collection of crop yield
    samples within a large-scale area has proven to be time-consuming and costly (Franch
    et al., 2015). Additionally, relying on small samples also limits the algorithm''s
    generalization capability (Li et al., 2022). Thus, it is imperative to employ
    appropriate samples and algorithms to improve the precision and reliability of
    winter wheat yield estimation at the regional field scale. Thanks to the rapid
    development of satellite remote sensing technology, we can utilize a greater number
    of remote sensing images with high spatiotemporal continuity in crop yield estimation
    (Liu et al., 2021). Several methods have also been proposed to acquire crop growth
    and yield information over extended periods by integrating field yield samples
    with remote sensing images (Jiang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2016, Wu et al.,
    2021, Zhang et al., 2021). Most studies employed input data from the Moderate-Resolution
    Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat satellite images, or extracted the
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) from these
    images to establish yield mapping relationships (Huang et al., 2022b, Huang et
    al., 2015, Wang et al., 2022a, Xie and Huang, 2021). Although initial yield information
    can be obtained, the restricted spatial resolutions and infrequent revisits of
    their images make it challenging to accurately capture yield variations across
    field plots and account for the complex growth patterns of crops over time. Consequently,
    these studies are less practical and entail significant uncertainty (Lv et al.,
    2013, Qin et al., 2015, Tian et al., 2021b, Wang et al., 2011). Moreover, as the
    resolution of remote sensing images decreases, the mixed pixel effect becomes
    increasingly pronounced in yield estimation (Dalla Marta et al., 2019, Lu and
    Fan, 2013). Field-scale yield estimation often necessitates higher-resolution
    remote sensing images for filtering and extracting intricate crop growth features
    (Liu et al., 2021). Fortunately, the Sentinel-2 satellite, equipped with 13 bands,
    a 10-meter spatial resolution, and a 5-day temporal resolution, empowers accurate
    yield estimation of winter wheat at a large regional field scale through long-term
    series analysis of crop growth cycles (Tian et al., 2021b). Many studies have
    employed long time series images captured by Sentinel-2 imagery as inputs for
    statistical and physical models, enabling the depiction of crop growth conditions
    from multiple temporal viewpoints (Dalla Marta et al., 2019, Tian et al., 2021b,
    Zhuo et al., 2019). The traditional agronomic method for measuring winter wheat
    yield involves a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, including counting
    ears, and grains, and determining the thousand-grain weight. While this method
    provides high precision in small areas, it encounters challenges when estimating
    yields in larger regions (Li et al., 2019). Currently, three primary methods are
    employed for winter wheat yield estimation. The first method involves process-based
    growth simulation and data assimilation (Mubeen et al., 2020). This approach utilizes
    fine-tuned crop models to simulate the dynamic growth process of crops, culminating
    in the final yield estimate (Ojeda et al., 2017). The assimilation of remote sensing
    data has been demonstrated to enhance the precision of crop model simulations
    (Huang et al., 2019). Nonetheless, employing remote sensing data assimilation
    on large regions can be challenging, primarily due to the complexities of establishing
    initial conditions and parameter calibration (Wu et al., 2021, Zhuo et al., 2019).
    The second approach entails conducting a statistical regression between field-scale
    measured yield and vegetation indices, such as NDVI and LAI. Huang et al. (2015)
    predicted the county-scale wheat yield in China by regressing peak NDVI against
    the measured yield, achieving a reasonable level of accuracy with an R2 of 0.53
    and an RMSE of 281 kg/ha. These regression-based models provide smooth yield estimates
    but have limitations in representing field-scale yield variability. they may not
    effectively support smallholder farmers in making timely and informed decisions
    regarding irrigation and fertilization (Kumari et al., 2016, Wang et al., 2011).
    Conversely, machine learning algorithms can facilitate the extraction of crucial
    features from sequences of remote sensing data, serving as the third method for
    field-scale yield estimation (Cao et al., 2021, Zhang et al., 2020). Traditional
    machine learning algorithms like Random Forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB), and Logistic
    Regression (LR) have frequently been employed for remote sensing-based crop yield
    estimation (Huang et al., 2019, Jiang et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2011). Nevertheless,
    these algorithms struggle to extract collinearity information from different spectral
    bands and encounter difficulties in identifying key yield features (Mamat et al.,
    2022, Narkhede et al., 2022, Rauff and Bello, 2015). As a branch of machine learning,
    deep learning has demonstrated remarkable performance in agricultural remote sensing
    tasks (Wang et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2020, Yang et al., 2021, Zhou et al., 2019).
    Prominent deep learning models, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (Li
    et al., 2022) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) (Jiang et al., 2020), excel
    in feature extraction through a hierarchical learning framework (Minu and Canessane,
    2022). Many researchers opt for a selection of typical crop growth indicators,
    such as NDVI, LAI, soil data, and meteorological data, as input for deep learning
    models to estimate crop yield (Vannoppen and Gobin, 2021, Wang et al., 2022a,
    Xie and Huang, 2021, Zhuo et al., 2019). However, crop growth is influenced by
    a multitude of environmental factors, including light, temperature, and water
    availability, which can lead to various stresses and significant yield uncertainty.
    Depending solely on a limited set of typical crop indicators for crop yield estimation
    may not sufficiently account for the complexity and fluctuations in crop yields
    (Liu et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2020). Additionally, the morphological characteristics
    and greenness of crops exhibit irregular changes throughout various growth stages
    and when observed from different angles. This presents a formidable challenge
    in extracting crop growth features consistently over an extended period using
    a uniform standard. For example, Nevavuori et al. (2019) found that directly feeding
    optical or multispectral images into a CNN model led to more accurate yield predictions
    compared to using vegetation indices. In another study, Cunha et al. (2018) attempted
    to estimate county-level crop yields by incorporating satellite soil and climate
    data, but they achieved a low R2 value of 0.55. High-resolution optical images
    are beneficial for analyzing long-term crop growth patterns, whereas field-scale
    yield samples offer a better understanding of geographic variability (Wen et al.,
    2022a). The quantity and quality of field samples play a pivotal role in determining
    the reliability and applicability of a deep learning-based yield estimation model
    (Zhang et al., 2019). However, China''s agricultural sector faces a shortage of
    field-scale yield samples primarily because of the absence of onboard yield recorders
    on harvesters (Cunha et al., 2018, Huang et al., 2022a). A shortage of samples
    severely hampers the training of robust models, and the substantial cost of field
    sampling also constrains their application in large regions (Ide et al., 2017,
    Nevavuori et al., 2019). To our knowledge, few deep learning algorithms effectively
    address the issue of underestimating high values and overestimating low values
    when estimating crop yields, particularly in the context of large geographical
    areas. One-dimensional (1D) CNN is a neural network architecture tailored for
    the processing of 1D sequential data (Ide et al., 2017). It''s adept at extracting
    global spatial features, decreasing feature dimensionality, and averting model
    overfitting through the application of multiple 1D CNN layers, pooling, and fully
    connected layers (Zhang et al., 2019). Utilizing 1D CNN models to extract spatiotemporal
    patterns from high-resolution remote sensing images, without the need for complex
    feature engineering, represents a practical approach to yield estimation (Wang
    et al., 2022b). Some researchers have achieved comparable results by employing
    1D CNN models with long-term series features derived from Sentinel-2 imagery to
    output end-to-end yield (Yang et al., 2021). However, despite the advantages of
    crop yield estimation, they also come with limitations. Underfitting can occur
    when too few filters are employed, while overfitting can arise when too many filters
    are applied (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020, Sagan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2022,
    Zhang et al., 2020). The channel attention mechanism employs trainable weights
    to amplify the importance of key channels while reducing the significance of less
    critical ones, resulting in an improved feature extraction ability (Qiao et al.,
    2023, Tian et al., 2021a). Integrating a channel attention mechanism into a deep
    learning-based yield estimation model amplifies the weights of important input
    crop parameters within the neural network while reducing the weight of other parameters
    (Cunha et al., 2018, Lin et al., 2020). These models optimize the extraction of
    unexplored collinear crop yield features and significantly enhance their interpretability.
    For instance, Han et al. (2022) devised an advanced deep-learning model by integrating
    a channel attention mechanism into an LSTM network. This approach resulted in
    impressive accuracy in county-scale winter wheat yield estimation. Hence, the
    development of a scalable and robust deep learning-based yield estimation model,
    utilizing uniformly and adequately distributed yield samples and high-quality
    remote sensing data with a coupled multi-channel attention mechanism, has the
    potential to alleviate the problems of yield overestimation and underestimation
    observed in previous algorithms. To fill the knowledge gaps, we developed a novel
    deep learning model called ACNN by coupling a 1D CNN model with a multi-channel
    attention mechanism. This model was employed for winter wheat yield estimation,
    utilizing a dataset comprising 2,885 high-quality field yield samples and 3,500
    well-preprocessed Sentinel-2 imagery scenes of Henan Province, China. By analyzing
    the interdependence of different feature dimensions and learning the importance
    of corresponding features on a rolling basis, the ACNN model recalibrates and
    optimizes the weights of these features, ultimately leading to an enhancement
    in the network''s estimation capability. The objectives of this study were as
    follows. (i) To develop a novel adaptive deep learning model called ACNN, capable
    of automatically assigning appropriate weights to distinct features, thereby mitigating
    issues associated with underestimating high values and overestimating low values
    in regional winter wheat yield estimation. (ii) To explore the model''s innate
    capacity for autonomously learning the significance of diverse input data features
    across different growth stages, using an end-to-end approach. (iii) To demonstrate
    the model''s robust performance across a wide geographical region via multi-scale
    experiments, thereby investigating its potential to identify crucial phenological
    stages and extract key wheat yield features. 2. Materials 2.1. Study area Henan
    Province, situated in central China between 31°23′-36°22′N and 110°21′-116°39′E,
    is renowned as a significant grain-producing region, consistently leading the
    nation in both winter wheat cultivation and annual yield (Fig. 1). The province
    boasts a temperate continental climate, characterized by 1848–2488 h of sunshine,
    an accumulated temperature range of 4300–5000 °C, and annual precipitation between
    600 and 800 mm. Moreover, with the majority of its areas situated at an elevation
    not exceeding 500 m above sea level, the terrain in Henan Province is highly conducive
    to winter wheat cultivation (Li et al., 2019). In Henan Province, the winter wheat
    planting season typically begins in early October, with emergence occurring in
    mid to early December. During the following year, its green-up stage occurs in
    late February to early March, jointing in mid-April, heading in early May, and
    reaching maturity in June, resulting in a growth duration of approximately 250
    days. Download : Download high-res image (742KB) Download : Download full-size

    2.2. Data and preprocessing 2.2.1. Yield sample data Yield samples provide the
    most accurate representation of yield fluctuations in winter wheat fields and
    serve as a dependable benchmark for estimating winter wheat yield within a specific
    area. In this study, we conducted field sampling in 62 primary winter wheat cultivation
    counties of Henan Province in 2020. As shown in Fig. 2, 10–15 parcels were selected
    in each county based on winter wheat growth. While making preliminary assessments
    of various yield levels, we also conducted a quantitative evaluation of the feasibility
    of employing a five-point sampling experiment for each parcel. Following that,
    five sampling points were designated within each parcel to ensure uniform distribution.
    These points were then visited to record the wheat ears, latitude, and longitude
    data using a 30*30 cm sampling frame and GPS. We uniformly collected 10–15 ears
    for threshing, resulting in 573 parcels and 2,885 yield sample labels. After weighing
    the threshed grains, the study converted the yield unit from the sampling frame
    into parcels (kg/ha) using Eq. (1). We visualized the distribution of yield label
    data points and observed that it closely resembles a normal distribution. This
    not only attests to the reliability and scientific validity of our field-sampled
    data but also enhances the potential for more accurate estimations of crop yields
    at a regional field scale. (1) where k is the weight of winter wheat; p is the

    3,500 Sentinel-2 time series images and 6,250 ground survey points to discern
    the spatial distribution of winter wheat in 2020 employing an RF classifier(Fig.
    2) (Huang et al., 2022c). Following their investigation, four vegetation indices
    were selected for this analysis: Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) (Xiang et al.,
    2020), Inverted Red-Edge Chlorophyll Index (IRECI) (Frampton et al., 2013), Green
    Chlorophyll Vegetation Index (GCVI) (Zhang et al., 2021), and NDVI. Additionally,
    a topographic slope factor (extracted from Shuttle Radar Topography Mission data
    (https://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/srtm/)), was also included (Table 1). All of the calculations
    aforementioned were performed on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Table

    Winter wheat cultivation in Henan Province typically commences in October of one
    year and culminates in maturity during June of the following year. In this study,
    3,500 scenes of Sentinel-2 Level-2A imagery were preprocessed based on the phenology
    of winter wheat (Fig. 2). Employing the mean smoothing method, we composited these
    images across the growth stages into 25 intervals, each spanning 10 days. Each
    data sample has a shape of 25 temporal steps by 12 bands. By incorporating yield
    information from 2,885 field-scale yield sample points, the 25 temporal steps
    time series images were aggregated into a single multi-band feature image, creating
    training data with the shape [2885, 25, 12]. Notably, the training data constructed
    in this study was disjointed temporally. To accelerate model convergence and improve
    computational efficiency, we employed the normalization method using the maximum
    and minimum values for the training data. 3. Methods 3.1. Construction of ACNN
    In this study, the 1D CNN model is composed of sixteen 1D convolutional layers
    (Conv 1D), six global average pooling layers, and one fully connected layer, all
    interleave with each other (Fig. 3). Specifically, a residual module is integrated
    after every three Conv 1D layers, with a Global Average Pooling layer employed
    before each residual module to reduce the feature map dimensionality. Following
    all Conv 1D layers, the ReLU function is utilized for activation, and the Conv
    1D layers hold channel numbers of 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024, respectively. The
    convolutional layer applies filters to the input data sequentially, generating
    a group of feature maps as output. The pooling layer downsamples the feature maps
    by taking the average value in a 2*2 kernel, while the fully connected layer performs
    a linear transformation to the input from the preceding layer and estimates output
    values based on the extracted features. Fixed weights and biases are utilized
    in each layer to capture and extract significant features from discrete training
    data (Koskinen et al., 2023). Minu and Canessane (2022) incorporate parallel convolutional
    kernels to enhance feature extraction diversity and reduce training parameters
    with a 1*1 convolutional kernel. Several studies have also demonstrated that 1D
    CNN-based models with various convolutional kernel sizes can achieve superior
    accuracy and reliability in crop classification compared to LSTM, XGBoost (Yan
    et al., 2022), and RF models (Yang et al., 2021, Yao et al., 2017, Zhang et al.,
    2019). However, for crop yield estimation, previous time series information significantly
    impacts the final yield. Unlike LSTM and GRU models, 1D CNN models cannot efficiently
    learn accumulated temporal information. The limitation stems from the lack of
    loops or recurrent connections, which are crucial for offering feedback and facilitating
    iterative computation to integrate historical data into the learning process.
    Besides, the model may encounter long-term dependency issues and struggle to enhance
    its generalization ability. While increasing the depth of convolutional layers
    typically enhances accuracy, it also presents issues, such as overfitting, given
    the substantial increase in parameters, particularly when dealing with limited
    training data. Download : Download high-res image (663KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. The coupling process and construction framework of ACNN
    (a), along with the internal working mechanism of the multi-channel attention
    mechanism (b). To address the aforementioned issues, we devised a novel ACNN model.
    This model incorporates a multi-channel attention mechanism, strategically placed
    after several Conv 1D layers and before the flattening layer of the 1D CNN model
    (Fig. 3). The ACNN model was driven by long-term series yield samples and comprised
    of three main components: the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Since
    the training data used in this study is 1D, all convolutional layers adopted 1D
    convolution operations. All the 1D CNNs were designed for the hidden layer to
    capture key global features from the training data along the time dimension by
    employing uniform weights. After the 1D CNN layer, the integrated multi-channel
    attention mechanism performed weighted averaging, calibration, and optimization
    of extracted global features. As shown in Fig. 3(a), the constructed long-term
    series training data {x1, x2, …, xk, xt} was initially fed through multiple conv
    1D layers, each using different step sizes (1, 3, 5), and varying numbers of channels
    to extract global features. Through a sequence of nonlinear interactions, the
    convolved and pooled features were effectively derived to identify the long-term
    growth characteristics of winter wheat. During forward propagation, the shallow
    features undergo a sequential transformation into deeper features, where the interdependence
    among them becomes more pronounced. Conversely, the absence of nonlinear interaction
    between Conv 1D layers hampers the extraction of deep discrete features and the
    capture of subtle differences in spectra among various input samples. As a result,
    collinear disturbances may arise, potentially causing field-scale underestimation
    or overestimation of winter wheat yield. To enhance deep feature extraction, we
    applied a Global Average Pooling procedure to the output tensor {a1, a2, …, ak,
    at}, followed by feeding it into a layer incorporating a multi-channel attention
    mechanism. The multi-channel attention mechanism serves three primary roles. Firstly,
    we employed a Global Average Pooling layer to condense the features input from
    the upper layer into a channel-wise description, effectively establishing interdependencies
    among the channels (Fig. 3(b)①). Secondly, a gating mechanism, consisting of a
    Dense layer and a ReLU activation function, was incorporated to enable nonlinear
    interactions among multiple channels. This step further recalibrates and optimizes
    the weights of the aggregated features during the compression process (Fig. 3(b)②).
    Finally, to achieve weight calibration of the original features, another Dense
    layer with the Sigmoid activation function was utilized for rescaling transformation
    (Fig. 3(b)③). Following shallow processing using 1D CNN and deep processing via
    the multi-channel attention mechanism, the input data''s redundant features were
    efficiently simplified into highly correlated features with winter wheat yield.
    Moreover, this approach facilitates accurate discrimination of spectral differences
    among field plots with high, medium, and low yields, thereby enhancing precision
    in crop yield diagnosis and monitoring. Importantly, it overcomes the significant
    limitations of traditional deep learning algorithms, specifically the issues of
    high-value underestimation and low-value overestimation. The interaction of the
    multi-channel attention mechanism layer is represented as (2(3(4). (2) (3) (4)
    In the above equation, Fpooling(hb) is the pooling operation of the Global Average
    Pooling layers, where b are the remote sensing bands, T is time, and h denotes
    the remote sensing information at time i. Fdense(Hb,(W2, W1)) denotes the activation
    operation of the Dense layer, where σ and ρ are the ReLU and Sigmoid activation
    function, and W1 and W2 denote the weight matrices of the two fully connected
    layers. Frescale(Ab, Hb) denotes the multiplication of Sb by Hb to rescale and
    transform features, allowing the feature vector to recover the original dimension
    of Xb. Specifically, the values {a1, a2, …, ak, at} input to the multi-channel
    attention mechanism layer are element-wise multiplied by the values {h1, h2, …,
    hk, ht} output from the same layer to obtain the final weight feature values {a1h1,
    a2h2, …, akhk, atht}. The model finally outputs the yield estimate Y and the evaluation
    metrics via the Dense layer, leveraging the learned mapping relationship described
    in Fig. 3(b). 3.2. Parameter Initialization To expedite the convergence of the
    proposed model, we employed the L2 loss function for gradient optimization during
    backpropagation and superimposed the Dropout layer for overfitting prevention.
    Additionally, we utilized the Variance-scaled Initialization method proposed by
    (Moussa et al., 2022) to adjust the variance of initial random weights according
    to the input/output tensor of each layer. The approach facilitates an enhanced
    forward propagation of yield features and is calculated as (5). To strengthen
    the resistance to irrelevant features and improve spatial extrapolation performance,
    we also applied L2 parameter regularization to penalize the weight of less important
    features. The calculation formula is shown in (6). (5) (6) where U is the uniform
    distribution function; n is the size of the upper layer (the columns of W); denotes
    the introduced regularization term, λ is a hyperparameter used to balance the
    relative contributions between the regularization term and the standard objective
    function J, j is the original objective function. 3.3. Feature importance and
    evaluation metrics Feature importance analysis, such as Permutation Importance
    (PI) and Leave-One-Covariate-Out (LOCO), can aid in identifying and eliminating
    minor features. Strobl et al. (2007) found that the LOCO-based method for measuring
    feature importance was limited when dealing with numerous collinear features,
    whereas the PI-based approach for calculating Mean Decreasing Accuracy (MDA) did
    not encounter similar issues. Hence, we opted for the PI-based method to evaluate
    parameter importance. The calculation formula is shown in (7). (7) where Acc is
    the accuracy before disruption, ShuffAcci is the accuracy after disruption, i
    denotes the disrupted parameters or growth stages. Besides, we utilized the Coefficient
    of Determination (R2), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)
    as measures for evaluating the model. Their calculation formulas were shown in
    (8(9(10). (8) (9) (10) where is the measured yield of sample i; is the estimated
    yield of sample i; is the mean yield; is the number of samples. 4. Results 4.1.
    Training of ACNN We implemented the ACNN model based on TensorFlow 2.2 and using
    Python 3.9. After undergoing several rounds of progressive exploratory iterative
    optimization, the model was meticulously fine-tuned, culminating in the selection
    of the following parameters: the training data was shaped as [2885, 25, 12]; the
    training set to test set ratio was set at 7:3. It''s worth noting that to mitigate
    overfitting, measures were taken to ensure that sample points within the same
    sampling field were not simultaneously present in both the training and testing
    datasets. The optimization process involved 2000 forward calculations and backpropagation
    iterations, utilizing the Adam weight update function. The initial learning rate
    was set to 1e-3, but it gradually dropped to 1e-5 after several batches of training.
    Additionally, a batch size of 64 was employed, and the keep_prob parameter was
    set at 0.25. Additionally, a validation set was established to monitor the optimal
    model''s performance. The saved optimal model was updated whenever the loss of
    the current batch was lower than that of the previous batch; otherwise, training
    proceeded. Upon completion of the training, the saved optimal model was utilized
    to evaluate the model''s accuracy on the designated validation set. As shown in
    Fig. 4, the loss curves for RMSE (a) and R2 (b) of the ACNN model stabilized at
    a “Good Fit” state after several rounds of training and tuning. The steady progress
    in model training, without encountering overfitting, indicates the ACNN model''s
    robust capability in simulating and characterizing complex winter wheat growth
    using long-term series data. It is worth noting that due to the striking similarity
    between the loss curves of MAE and RMSE, only the RMSE curve was presented. Download

    CNN, and ACNN The study performed an ablation experiment by removing the multi-channel
    attention mechanism layer from the ACNN model. To assess their performance across
    different sample sizes, a commonly used machine learning Random Forest (RF) model
    was utilized as a baseline reference. The critical parameters of the RF model
    were: the ratio of the training set to the test set was 7:3; the maximum number
    of weak learners at 500; a maximum tree depth of 40; and a maximum number of features
    of 4. In Table 2, increasing sample input enhanced the estimation ability. The
    accuracy of the ACNN model (MAE = 1158 kg/ha, RMSE = 1460 kg/ha, and R2 = 0.44)
    was superior to that of the RF model (MAE = 1211 kg/ha, RMSE = 1544 kg/ha, and
    R2 = 0.39) and 1D CNN model (MAE = 1230 kg/ha, RMSE = 1582 kg/ha, and R2 = 0.31)
    when evaluated under entire sample. The limited noise immunity and potential data
    waste of the RF and 1D CNN models were disclosed by their poor improvement in
    accuracy with increasing input sample size. On the contrary, the ACNN model demonstrated
    notable robustness through its utilization of diverse convolution kernel sizes
    and its execution of nonlinear interactions to extract intricate features related
    to winter wheat yield from continuous input samples, all while preserving its
    generalization capabilities. It is worth mentioning that the RF model exhibited
    relatively strong feature extraction capabilities due to its unique random sampling
    and feature partitioning mechanism, resulting in slightly higher accuracy than
    the 1D CNN model. Table 2. Accuracy of the three models under different sample

    +0.05 −52 −25 +0.06 −61 −82 +0.13 We visualized the fitting curve of estimated
    points and sampled points under the entire sample. In Fig. 5, points above the
    1:1 line indicate that the model overestimated the yield, and vice versa for points
    below the line. Overall, all three models tended to underestimate high values
    and overestimate low values. However, when compared to the other two models, the
    proposed model exhibited the least error and the best fit, with estimated points
    concentrated closer to the 1:1 line, yielding a more reliable inner reflection
    of the field yield situation. Based on these observations, we tentatively conclude
    that the ACNN model outperforms both the 1D CNN and RF models in terms of evaluation
    metrics. It also demonstrates a more linear distribution of estimated yield points
    and mitigates the impact of underestimation for high values and overestimation
    for low values. Download : Download high-res image (315KB) Download : Download

    under the whole sample. By dividing the training data of 25-time steps into five
    growth stages, namely Emergence (Mid-October - Mid-December), Green-up (Mid-December
    - Late-January), Jointing (Early-February - Mid-March), Heading (Mid-March - Mid-May)
    and Maturity (Late-May - Mid-June), we then conducted additional accuracy tests
    for the ACNN model with data from each of these growth stages. As shown in Table
    3, the Heading stage obtained the highest accuracy with MAE = 1172 kg/ha, RMSE
    = 1495 kg/ha, and R2 = 0.39, while the worst accuracy was the Emergence stage
    with MAE = 1221 kg/ha, RMSE = 1547 kg/ha, and R2 = 0.31. It is crucial to highlight
    that the heading stage of winter wheat directly influences the number of ears,
    grains, and grain fullness, thereby playing a pivotal role in yield formation.
    In the absence of any other unfavorable factors, data obtained during the heading
    stage can serve as a reliable proxy for the entire growth stage. Additionally,
    it''s worth noting that during the Emergence stage, winter wheat plants were frequently
    characterized by their sparse growth and relatively shorter stature. The lack
    of distinguishing features essential for precise yield discrimination contributed
    to the lowest level of estimation accuracy. Table 3. Accuracy of the ACNN model

    Clarifying the importance of input features is a prerequisite for accurate crop
    yield estimation. To ascertain the importance of these features, the study employed
    RF and ACNN models, which demonstrated higher accuracy as discussed in Section
    4.2, for Permutation Importance (PI) analysis. As shown in Fig. 6, the importance
    of features exhibited significant variations across different spectral bands and
    growth stages. Model-wise, the RF and ACNN models yielded similar outcomes, but
    they differed in what they presented. The RF model provided smoother and lower
    feature importance values, while the ACNN model offered a more intuitive and precise
    discrimination of feature importance magnitudes. Band-wise, it was observed that
    both models emphasized the significance of the B4 (Red) and B5 (Vegetation red
    edge) bands as the most key variables. In contrast, bands such as B1 (Coastal
    aerosol) and B8A (Narrow NIR) were regarded as less significant. Growth stage-wise,
    the Heading stage demonstrated a substantial capacity to represent winter wheat
    yield in both models compared to the Emergence and Maturity stages, which had
    comparatively minor impacts on yield formation. The inherent opacity of conventional
    deep learning algorithms poses a challenge when trying to identify discriminative
    features within the growth and yield formation of winter wheat, especially when
    taking phenological and spectral aspects into account. Nevertheless, by embedding
    the multi-channel attention mechanism and incorporating reliable yield samples,
    we enhanced the ACNN model''s prowess in extracting key features tied to yield.
    Moreover, it was clear that the weight allocation within the multi-channel attention
    mechanism was notably more rational compared to the random assignment in the RF
    model. Download : Download high-res image (235KB) Download : Download full-size

    the field-sampled winter wheat yield in Henan Province in 2020 exhibited significant
    variation due to unpredictable factors causing yield reduction, such as drought,
    frost, and pests, leading to a yield range of 2,055–12,705 kg/ha. To evaluate
    the model''s reliability, we estimated the winter wheat yield in Henan Province
    in 2020 at county and field scales using both the RF and ACNN models. For the
    RF model, integrated the selected optimal parameters into the RF interface function
    within GEE to perform yield regression. For the ACNN model, we uploaded the training
    data to the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for model training and subsequently deployed
    the trained model for yield estimation. The county-scale yield estimation results
    for the 62 major wheat-producing counties are shown in Fig. 7. In terms of spatial
    distribution, both models exhibited that the winter wheat yield in Henan Province
    was higher in the northeast and lower in the southwest. Nevertheless, the range
    of estimated values by RF was limited, ranging from 4,423 to 9,701 kg/ha, which
    did not fully consistent with the measured yield. Thanks to the weighted averaging,
    optimization, and recalibration of key yield features through the multi-channel
    attention mechanism layer, the county-scale yield values by the ACNN model ranged
    from 2,415 to 11,726 kg/ha, which is more closer to the maximum and minimum values
    within the sampled yield. Moreover, when evaluating the county-scale distribution
    map of various yield grades, it is evident that the ACNN model estimated a notably
    higher proportion of both high and low yields compared to RF. Download : Download

    winter wheat yield estimation with RF (a) and ACNN (b). To further evaluate the
    performance of the ACNN and RF models at the county scale, we obtained the statistical
    yields of winter wheat in 62 major wheat-producing counties in Henan Province
    from the 2020 statistical data of the National Bureau of Statistics of China (https://www.stats.gov.cn/sj/zxfb/).
    Simultaneously, we conducted zonal statistics based on the yield estimates provided
    by both models for each county, facilitating a direct comparison with the statistical
    yields. As shown in Fig. 8, the county-level yield fitting curve of the ACNN model
    exhibits a notable improvement compared to RF (R2 of 0.72 for ACNN and 0.57 for
    RF). The estimated yields for each county are closer to the actual yields, with
    relatively smaller estimated errors. Overall, the ACNN model at the county level
    surpasses that of RF. However, due to the spatiotemporal discontinuity of samples
    and estimation areas, both models are subject to varying degrees of limitations
    in yield estimation. While not fully resolving the challenge of high-value underestimation
    and low-value overestimation between parcels, the ACNN model demonstrated the
    potential to alleviate this influence. Download : Download high-res image (291KB)

    and statistical yields between RF (a) and ACNN (b). Based on the results mentioned
    above, we hypothesized that deploying the ACNN model to a field-scale yield estimation
    experiment would result in more satisfactory performance. To validate the hypothesis,
    we conducted another experiment using the field-scale planting area obtained from
    section 2.1. As illustrated in Fig. 9(a), the RF model generated field-scale estimates
    ranging from only 3,790 to 10,888 kg/ha. It demonstrated a considerably broader
    spatial distribution encompassing both high and low yields in comparison to the
    county-scale yield estimates. However, the RF model still struggled to accurately
    estimate the actual field yield range. In contrast, the ACNN model effectively
    learned rich features from within the field plots, providing the most accurate
    yield estimates. As shown in Fig. 9(b), the final yield values ranged from 1,637
    to 13,619 kg/ha. In addition, we randomly zoomed in on three high, medium, and
    low-yielding plots to more closely assess yield variability among them. The results
    indicate that the ACNN model accurately estimated yields with substantial spatial
    variability, effectively distinguishing between different yield grades within
    the high, medium, and low parcels. This further illustrates the model''s robustness
    in accurately estimating the actual yield of winter wheat. In contrast, the RF
    model struggled to differentiate yield levels, producing yield estimates that
    were too uniform to accurately represent the actual variations in winter wheat
    yield across different plots. Download : Download high-res image (1001KB) Download

    Thanks to the nonlinear interaction and recalibration of the initial feature weights,
    the proposed model could more effectively simulate the complex growth of winter
    wheat compared to the traditional machine learning model. Moreover, the ACNN model
    diminishes the need for an extensive number of yield samples and effectively extracts
    the globally accumulated features by leveraging the attention mechanism and incorporating
    reliable survey samples. This showcases its robust capabilities in estimating
    winter wheat yield. The results of feature importance analysis revealed that the
    ACNN model consistently provided more discernible importance values, whether considering
    various growth stages or spectral bands. This further underscored the model''s
    precise comprehension and identification of key phenological periods and significant
    bands within the remote sensing spectrum. Moreover, the ACNN model notably mitigated
    the issue of underestimating high values and overestimating low values in field-scale
    yield estimation. Its estimations closely matched the field’s actual yield, which
    carries significant implications for agricultural insurance and timely production
    interventions. In the field of crop yield estimation research, remote sensing
    data inherently offers the capability to observe the same crop using various spectral
    bands or perspectives, which may result in collinear perturbation across different
    bands. The spectral reflectance curves derived from Sentinel-2 imagery and field
    sample points serve as a lucid elucidation of the remarkable performance of the
    proposed ACNN model. We randomly selected three representative samples with high,
    medium, and low yields (with average yields of 3,500 kg/ha, 7,000 kg/ha, and 10,500
    kg/ha, respectively) and presented their spectral reflectance curves. As shown
    in Fig. 10, the spectral reflectance curve of high, medium, and low yield samples
    exhibited a relatively stable pattern over time, with only minor fluctuations,
    particularly in the Water Vapor, NIR, and Red Edge bands. However, the presence
    of overlapping collinear spectral features led to feature confusion between high
    and low-yield samples, which could potentially result in the overestimation of
    low values and the underestimation of high values. Besides, the similarity in
    yield contribution across different growth stages may introduce additional uncertainties.
    Therefore, the integration of the multi-channel attention mechanism becomes pivotal
    in fully capturing the key phenological stages and important spectral bands. Download

    Sentinel-2A spectral reflectance curves with high, medium, and low yield. The
    Sobol Sensitivity Analysis (SSA) is an effective method for quantitatively evaluating
    the influence of diverse input parameters on the output through the calculation
    of sensitivity coefficients (Han et al., 2022). Based on the Python Sensitivity
    Analysis Library, the SSA not only demonstrated the robustness of the ACNN model
    concerning parameter sensitivity but also examined sensitivity levels at both
    field and county scales. As shown in Fig. 11, the first-order and global sensitivity
    coefficients exhibited higher values at the field scale in comparison to the county
    scale. Importantly, noteworthy variations were detected in the first-order and
    global sensitivity coefficients of bands B5 (Red), B7 (Vegetation red edge), and
    B4 (Vegetation red edge). These findings further emphasized that the nonlinear
    interactions performed by the multi-channel attention mechanism played a significant
    role in enhancing the performance and interpretability of the ACNN model, especially
    as the scale of yield estimation shifted from county to field levels. Download

    Potential uncertainties While the proposed ACNN model showcased competence and
    resilience in estimating field-scale winter wheat yield, its accuracy slightly
    trailed behind similar studies conducted at the county scale (Hunt et al., 2019).
    One of the primary factors was the variability in altitude, meteorological conditions,
    and phenological patterns attributed to the diverse wheat varieties and field
    management practices within the extensive winter wheat cultivation regions of
    Henan, which span a considerable north–south range. Additionally, accidental errors
    played a role. On the one hand, the 30*30 cm field sampling frames were too small
    to represent the actual yield in the plot compared with the 10*10 m pixels of
    Sentinel-2 imagery. On the other hand, human errors were introduced due to the
    difference in sampling operation, large and small ridge plots among parcels, and
    the uneven distribution of winter wheat plant density. To quantify the uncertainty
    of the experiment, we conducted zonal statistics on the field-scale yield data
    produced by the ACNN model. The zonal statistics was carried out using municipal
    and county administrative divisions. The results were compared with the reported
    yields from the 2020 Henan Province Statistical Yearbook. As shown in Fig. 12,
    the yield fitting curves at the municipal level displayed the most robust R2 at
    0.92, whereas the R2 value at the county level was comparably lower at 0.87. Significantly,
    a trend emerged where the R2 decreased as the scale of analysis expanded. The
    pattern elucidated the rationale behind the ACNN model''s R2 of 0.44 at the field
    scale. And it further indicated the model''s heightened susceptibility to geographical
    disparities as the scale decreased. Download : Download high-res image (273KB)

    learning algorithms are frequently referred to as “black boxes” because the inner
    mechanisms of the model can be intricate and difficult to interpret or elucidate.
    To be specific, the application of a deep learning model for yield estimation
    at large regional fields is in the exploratory stage, and the collection of a
    substantial number of high-quality crop yield samples with higher spatial and
    temporal resolution remains a challenging task. The study exclusively utilized
    Sentinel-2 images and field yield sample points to construct the training dataset.
    Additional data variables that have the potential to influence the model''s estimation
    capabilities, such as organic matter content, soil water content, pH levels, and
    meteorological data, were not incorporated. Additionally, considering that Sentinel-2
    images might not undergo synchronous updates during specific periods and could
    be subject to substantial cloud cover, localized streaking, and smoothed values
    could manifest in the yield estimation. Moreover, Wen et al. (2022a) found that
    the B3 (Green) and B7 (Red Edge) bands were the most relevant to plant growth
    monitoring and crop yield estimation. Nonetheless, the parameter importance results
    indicated that the B4 (Red) and B5 (Vegetation Red Edge) bands held more significance
    in winter wheat yield estimation. This observation warrants further validation.
    In the future, it is both necessary and feasible to incorporate winter wheat variety
    information and historical yield trends to achieve a more comprehensive simulation
    of its intricate growth dynamics. Furthermore, broadening the coverage of the
    sampling frame and strategically improving the spatial distribution are essential
    steps to enhance the quality and representativeness of sample data. With the increasing
    accumulation of winter wheat samples, a larger number of high-quality samples
    can be effectively utilized to represent field-scale crop yields. This augmentation
    will subsequently enhance the accuracy and generalization capability of the proposed
    model across various years, crops, and spatial scales. 6. Conclusion Accurate
    estimating of winter wheat yield at the regional field scale poses a challenge
    due to limited sample availability and the inherent opacity of conventional deep-learning
    algorithms. The study developed the ACNN model by leveraging the multi-channel
    attention mechanism and incorporating reliable survey samples to learn and optimize
    key yield features of winter wheat from phenology and spectral perspectives. The
    proposed model attained satisfactory accuracy at the sizeable regional field scale
    and effectively differentiated among fields with high, medium, and low yields,
    offering detailed yield differences. Besides, it sheds light on the importance
    of diverse growth stages and input parameters in influencing crop yield, demonstrating
    its robust ability to generalize across various scales. Compared to existing methodologies,
    the proposed model adeptly addressed the challenge of underestimating high values
    and overestimating low values in field-scale crop yield estimation, presenting
    a novel benchmark for crop yield estimation in broader geographical regions. CRediT

    Using Machine Learning Algorithm Chapter © 2022 Introduction The twenty-first
    century is facing many challenges like climate change, rapid urbanization, population
    growth, food shortage, poverty and hunger (Mondal et al., 2014; FAO. 2021). The
    world population is expected to grow from 7 billion (1.2% growth per year) to
    around 10 billion by 2050 (UNFPA, 2012; FAO., 2017), which will accelerate the
    high demand for food consumption and increase pressure on natural resources. Therefore,
    an innovative agricultural research and better management practices are necessary
    to increase productivity to reduce food insecurity. In this context, maize (Zea
    mays) crop has the potential to reduce food insecurity, generate better income
    for the farmers and also qualifies as the potential of doubling the farmer’s income
    (Maize Vision, 2022). Maize is the second most cultivated crop in the world and
    production is about 104 crore MT in 2016–17. In which, the USA is the highest
    producer (38%), and China (23%) is on second position. India was on fourth position
    in acreage (about 4%) and seventh in production (about 2%) among the maize producing
    nations. About 1.5 crore farmers were involved in maize farming in India (DACNET,
    2020; Maize Vision, 2022). Bihar is a leading producer of Rabi maize in India,
    contributing about 10% of India’s total production (Maize Vision, 2022). In Bihar,
    the northern part (North Bihar) is a major contributor of rabi/winter maize. Accurate
    and timely information on crop type, acreage and yield is essential for estimating
    crop production to reduce food insecurity, loss assessment for crop insurance
    schemes and developing adaptation strategies at local, national and global levels
    (Arumugam et al., 2021; Kumar et al., 2022). Hence, an innovative agriculture
    management plan for better agriculture practices is urgently needed for countries
    like India, where about 58% of the population is engaged in the agriculture fields
    for their livelihood. The majority of farmers (about 75%) in this region have
    small farmland (Gulati et al., 2018; Rai et al., 2019). Nowadays, remote sensing
    satellite and machine learning approach-based crop mapping is growing and expanding
    from field to regional scale due to the free accessibility of high-resolution
    satellite dataset, which is a cost-effective solution for farm-level mapping (Chlingaryan
    et al., 2018; Griffiths et al., 2019; Htitiou et al., 2022; Pande, 2022). In this
    regard, several studies have been carried out for crop mapping using coarse to
    fine spatial resolution data based on MODIS, Landsat, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2
    at regional to global levels (Mondal et al., 2014; Peng et al., 2011). “Forecasting
    Agricultural output using Space, Agro-meteorology and Land-based observations
    (FASAL)” program is going on for crop forecasting, acreage estimation and yields
    prediction at the national level in India. In the FASAL program, various approaches
    such as “weather-yield models, crop simulation models and remote sensing-driven
    statistical models” have been used (Arumugam et al., 2021a; Latwal et al., 2019).
    But, remote sensing satellite and machine learning approach-based crop studies
    are very limited (Arumugam et al., 2021a). Therefore, remote sensing and machine
    learning approach has been employed for the estimation of maize crop in North
    Bihar in the present study. These days, combining satellite data from the multi-sensor
    source is a common approach to improve the accuracy of crop mapping (Costa et
    al., 2021; Mizuochi et al., 2021). Several studies have combined multi-sensors
    source satellite data such as “Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)”
    with Sentinel-2A/B (Zhu et al., 2018), Sentinel-1A/B with Sentinel-2A/B (Costa
    et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2022; Tavares et al., 2019) and Sentinel-1A/B, Sentinel-2A/B
    with Landsat to improve the accuracy of the classification and crop type mapping.
    Yan et al. (2021) have evaluated the performance of a combination of GaoFen-1
    and Sentinel-2A/B data for crop mapping. Recently, high-resolution satellite imagery
    of PlanetScope combine Sentinel-1 with Sentinel-2 for land cover classification
    of Central Brazil (Vizzari, 2022) and crop type mapping of Smallholder Farms using
    the SVM algorithm in eastern India (Rao et al., 2021). However, the integration
    of Sentinel-2A/B and PlanetScope data will significantly increase classification
    accuracy. But, it requires enormous volumes of computing space to combine multisource
    satellite data (data fusion), download, store and process the multisource satellite
    imagery for large-scale crop classification is a challenging task. Hence to overcome
    these problems, Google launched the efficient and advanced cloud computing platform
    “Google Earth Engine (GEE)” in 2010. It provides a high-performance computational
    cloud platform for big data analysis such as satellite imagery without the need
    for local storage (Gorelick et al., 2017; Kumar et al., 2022). Furthermore, this
    platform is offering up-to-date and ready-to-use remotely sensed (Landsat, Sentinel-1,
    Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope archives) geospatial and ancillary datasets for researchers
    and academicians. It also allows to share the developed JavaScript codes of various
    analyses within many users. The GEE platform is being widely used due to supporting
    some of the most popular machine learning classifiers; CART (Breiman et al., 1984;
    Mather & Tso, 2016) is a “binary decision tree classifiers that utilized a pre-determined
    thresholds, RF is an ensemble classifier that utilize multiple CART (Breiman,
    2001) and SVM is also an excellent classifier that uses input parameters as the
    kernel type” (Burges, 1998; Mountrakis et al., 2011). But, the RF algorithm of
    machine learning is being extensively used for the classification of remotely
    sensed datasets in the GEE Platform, due to its non-parametric nature (Amani et
    al., 2020; Praticò et al., 2021). Therefore, integrated Sentinel-2A/B and PlanetScope
    data and machine learning approach has been employed for the estimation of maize
    crop in North Bihar, India, and the performance of various machine learning algorithms
    are compared and analysed in the present study. Our overall objective was to develop
    a web-based IDE code by JavaScript API for robust mapping of crops using satellite
    imagery and machine learning algorithms. In addition, the performance of multiple
    classifiers of machine learning was to be assessed. This study will be helpful
    for crop cultivation management, crop insurance and for making a decision support
    system to prioritize the input subsidy to farmers. Our developed JavaScript code
    will also be helpful for the application of crop monitoring tools. Materials and
    Methods Study Area The present study is conducted in North Bihar, India, for the
    winter crop growing season of 2022. Which spans from early November to early April.
    This region is situated between 25° 02′ 57′′ to 27° 31′ 16′′ N latitude and 83°
    50′ 05′′ to 88° 17′ 53′′ E longitude as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Location map of
    the study area Full size image Where maize, wheat and rice are the major growing
    crops. The region has the most fertile land and 76 per cent of the population
    is dependent on agriculture (Kumar et al., 2022; Spera et al., 2016). Wherein,
    agricultural land is degrading and shrinking day by day due to rapid urbanization
    and the growing population (Singh et al., 2014). There are two main agricultural
    operations seasons in the region; viz. In the monsoon (Kharif) season mostly rice
    crops are grown, and in the winter (Rabi) season (November to April) mostly maize
    and wheat crops are grown. Because, there is a less uncertain climate in Rabi
    season as compared to Kharif. Hence, it is easier and less risky to grow maize
    crops in Rabi as compared to the Kharif season in Bihar (Bihar Study Report: 2016).
    Most of the farmers in this region are smallholder farms. Therefore, this region
    is ideal for investigating how well micro-satellites such as PlanetScope can be
    able to map the field levels (Jain et al., 2016). The present work consists of
    22 districts of Bihar state of India. Where maize, wheat and rice are the major
    growing crops. Data Used Datasets were used to perform the analysis in this study
    as shown in Table 1. Table 1 Data utilized in the work Full size table PLANET-NICFI
    (PlanetScope) Data Recently, the planet’s high-resolution ready-to-use basemaps/
    satellite imagery has become available in the world’s tropical regions through
    a collaboration with “Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI),
    Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT), and Planet (NICFI, 2022). It has a spatial
    resolution of 4.77 m and has 4 bands viz. (Blue, Green, Red and NIR) (Anonymous,
    2022). These datasets are available in deep time series (December 2015–August
    2020, Bi-Annual; September 2020 onward, Monthly). Planet’s NICFI Satellite (PlanetScope)
    data availability within the Google Earth Engine platform is an important step.
    This initiative will be helpful researchers for land use mapping and monitoring
    at field levels (https://www.planet.com, accessed on 24 July 2022; Vizzari, 2022).
    Now, users can access it by signing up and accepting the terms at planet.com/nicfi.
    In the present study, PlanetScope’s monthly mosaic basemaps from January to April
    2022 have been used. Sentinel-2A/B MSI The freely available Sentinel-2 satellite
    datasets are efficient in mapping and monitoring agricultural land on a real-time
    basis. The revisit frequency of this ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellite is ten days with
    every single satellite and five days with a combined/dual satellite (ESA, 2022).
    Its spatial resolution is 10 m (band: 2, 3, 4 and 8), 20 m (band: 5, 6, 7, 8a,
    11 and 12) and 60 m (band: band:1, 9 and 10). In this study, we have utilized
    bands: 2, 3, 4 and 8 of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery having the least cloud-covered
    (< 10%) from January to April 2022 with the help of available tools on the GEE
    platform. Moreover, the QA band of Sentinel-2A/B has been utilized to eliminate
    the cloud cover (2022). Ground Truth (GT) Data / Reference Data Collection Ground
    truth data were collected randomly via handheld GPS and smartphone-based applications
    for the identification of maize crops. About 1451 ground truth points (GT) were
    collected from the study area (Fig. 2). After the collection of GT data, these
    points (GT) were used to train machine learning algorithms and validate the data
    during classification/ identification and accuracy validation. About 30 percent
    of GT data has been used for accuracy assessment. Fig. 2 GT data collection Full
    size image Harmonization of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B MSI: Harmonization is
    necessary because these two satellite systems have different sensor characteristics,
    including spectral bands, spatial resolution and radiometric calibration. Aligning
    their data allows researchers for consistent analysis and to integrate and utilize
    the strengths of both satellite systems for various applications, such as land
    cover mapping, environmental monitoring and change detection. Therefore, the Sentinel-2
    imagery was harmonized and rescaled (resampled) to the exact resolution as PlanetScope
    (4.77 m) using the bicubic interpolation function (Keys, 1981) in the GEE cloud
    platform (Fig. 3). After each processing steps, Normalized Differential Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) was calculated from the harmonized imagery. Fig. 3 Harmonization,
    rescaling and fusion of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B MSI data Full size image
    NDVI Generation: NDVI is being widely used for vegetation index, crop mapping
    and monitoring (Rouse Jr et al., 1973), because the value of NDVI for each pixel
    varies with different stages of crop growth (Fig. 4). These values remain low
    at the time of sowing, rise by maturity and fall again at the time of harvesting.
    These variations help to discriminate the maize crop from other crops. Fig. 4
    NDVI profile presenting the growth profile of maize and wheat Full size image
    NDVI for four dates (January, February, March and April 2022) has been generated
    from each satellite data, i.e., Sentinel-2A/B and PlanetScope. So, a total of
    8 band images were generated. In North Bihar, maize and wheat are the major crops
    grown in the Rabi season (November to April). It’s growth profile is depicted
    in Fig. 4 using NDVI values. Methodology In the present study, an integrated Sentinel-2
    and PlanetScope data, machine learning approach and GEE cloud computing platform
    are employed to improve crop classification, prediction and mapping efficiency
    and accuracy of various ML models. CART, RF and SVM models have been used for
    the identification and mapping of maize crops using GT data as collected from
    the study area. Then, the performance of utilized approaches was compared and
    analysed in terms of overall classification accuracy. A flowchart/Procedure of
    the methodology is represented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Methodology of work Full size
    image Google Earth Engine (GEE) Satellite data processing is a challenging task
    due to the requirement of separate computational systems, storage and local space
    along with the software. To overcome this, Google launched the efficient and advanced
    cloud computing platform “Google Earth Engine” in 2010. It provides a unique cloud
    computing platform to process different types of big datasets through improved
    algorithms and JavaScript codes without requiring local storage or downloading
    raw imagery, especially on a nearly real-time basis (Kumar et al., 2022). It also
    allows to share the developed JavaScript codes of various analyses within many
    users. We have used the GEE cloud computing platform for the entire analysis work
    and JavaScript codes have been developed (https://code.earthengine.google.com/?scriptPath=users%2Fhimpria%2Fconference%3ACropland_Extent)
    for robust mapping and monitoring of maize crop (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 Google Earth
    Engine Interface Full size image Machine Learning Algorithm Used for Crop Mapping
    Random Forest The random forest (RF) algorithm of machine learning is a popular
    supervised classification classifier technique, which includes multiple decision
    trees and takes averages to improve the accuracy of predictions of any datasets
    (, 2001) (Fig. 7). This classifier can learn the characteristics of the target
    features based on the training dataset and identify these learned features in
    the unclassified data. (Belgiu & Drăguţ, 2016). So, it is commonly used by the
    remote sensing and GIS community (Shelestov et al., 2017a). Fig. 7 Example of
    Random Forest Classifier Full size image Hence, the random forest algorithm has
    been utilized in this study for maize identification and mapping using the GEE
    cloud-based geo-computing platform (Oliphant et al., 2019). Whereas, we found
    that the RF algorithm performed better with PlanetScope data and also with the
    integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. Their overall accuracy is 84.31%
    (kappa 0.79) with Sentinel-2 data, 90.17% (kappa 0.89) with PlanetScope data,
    and 95.53% (Kappa 0.91) with the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B
    data. In addition, it is observed that the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B
    data are increasing the accuracy of classification and prediction. In the GEE
    platform, this classifier is relatively fast and capable of handling big data
    such as the entire satellite data of the present study. Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) SVM classifier is popular a non-parametric supervised method to use for
    classification problems, regression problems and uniqueness detection (Shelestov
    et al., 2017a). Because it works on the concept of margin, this margin is the
    shortest distance between the decision boundary and the training dataset. It has
    also the capability to fit an optimal hyperplane to separate the dataset into
    a separate number of pre-defined classes using a training sample (Fig. 8), which
    helps in getting a good classification result from complex datasets. So, this
    algorithm is being widely used for crop type classification, mapping and monitoring.
    Fig. 8 Example of support vector machines classifier Full size image In the present
    study, we have used an SVM classifier for maize crop mapping using the GEE cloud
    computing platform. Whereas, we found that the SVM classifier performed well with
    big datasets. Their overall accuracy is 76.99% (kappa 0.69) with PlanetScope data,
    77.48% (kappa 0.69) with Sentinel-2 data, and 83.13% (Kappa 0.77) with the integration
    of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
    The classification and regression tree (CART) is a non-parametric decision tree
    (DT) classifier that employs a predetermined threshold (Breiman et al., 1984).
    This algorithm builds regression trees using Gini’s impurity index and “entropy”
    to obtain the information that can be expressed mathematically as $${\\text{Gini}}\\left(
    E \\right) = 1 - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{c} p_{i} 2$$ (1) $${\\text{Entropy}}:H\\left(
    x \\right) = 1 - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} p\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)
    \\log_{2} p\\left( {x_{i} } \\right)$$ (2) “At each internal node, the tree’s
    leaf nodes in corresponding division regions are decided by related splitting
    rules” (Luo et al., 2022), which is sorting down the tree from the root to leaf
    nodes, as depicted in Fig. 9. Fig. 9 Example of Classification and Regression
    Tree Classifier Full size image So, this classifier can be used for classification,
    regression and predictive modelling problems. In this study, the CART classifier
    was used for maize crop mapping using the GEE cloud computing platform. Whereas,
    we observed that the CART classifier performed well with big data such as time-series
    datasets of remote sensing. Their overall accuracy is 78.06% (kappa 0.71) with
    PlanetScope data, 88.59% (kappa 0.85) with Sentinel-2 data, and 90.54% (Kappa
    0.87) with the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. Results and
    Discussion Crop Identification In the present study, about 1016 GT data were used
    to train the ML algorithms (SVM, CART and RF) for classification and identification
    of maize crops using the GEE platform. In addition, training accuracy has been
    also assessed and observed that the training accuracy of CART, RF and SVM is 99%,
    98% and 83%, respectively (Fig. 10). Fig. 10 Training accuracy in the present
    study Full size image Then SVM, CART and RF algorithms are applied to each dataset
    such as Sentinel-2, PlanetScope and the combined satellite datasets (Sentinel-2
    and PlanetScope) to extract the pixels of the maize crop. The satellite data and
    ML algorithms wise extracted pixels/ patches of maize crop have been represented
    in the Fig. 11. The red polygons (Fig. 11) have been used on the classified images
    to identify differences in detection according to satellite data and ML algorithms.

    satellite imagery has been used for maize crop area estimation. The district-wise
    (Table 2) area was calculated based on the identified pixels of the maize crop
    using the JavaScript code (ee.Geometry.Polygon.area) in the GEE platform. The
    analysis shows that about 321,252 hectares of land are devoted to the cultivation
    of rabi maize in North Bihar, India. Finally, a maize crop map has been generated
    using the GEE platform and QGIS Software (Fig. 12). Table 2 District-wise acreage

    size table Fig. 12 Maize crop map of North Bihar, India Full size image Prediction
    Accuracy The GT dataset is randomly split into two sections, viz. 70% for classifier
    training and 30% for accuracy and validation purposes. In the GEE platform, the
    confusion matrix method (Stehman, 1997) is commonly used for accuracy assessment,
    which has also been used in the present study. Whereas, we found that RF outperforms
    CART and SVM algorithms in the GEE platform with PlanetScope data (OA = 90.17%,
    Kappa 0.89) and also with the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data
    (OA = 95.53%, Kappa 0.91). But, CART outperforms RF and SVM algorithms with Sentinel-2A/B
    data (OA = 88.59%, Kappa 0.85). In addition, it is observed that the integration
    of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data is increasing the accuracy of classification
    and prediction (Table 3). Table 3 Prediction accuracy of classifiers Full size
    table Performance of Machine Learning Classifiers with various datasets In the
    present study, the performance of ML classifiers has been evaluated within the
    GEE cloud computing platform with different datasets. Wherein, it is observed
    that RF outperforms CART and SVM algorithms in the GEE platform with PlanetScope
    data and also with the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data (Fig.
    13). With the integration of Sentinel-2A/B and PlanetScope data, the overall accuracy
    of crop mapping improved by about 6%, indicating that the integration of Sentinel-2A/B
    and PlanetScope data is more suitable for crop identification. Fig. 13 Performance
    of Classifiers in the GEE Cloud Computing Platform Full size image Although, CART
    outperforms RF and SVM algorithms with Sentinel-2A/B data. In the GEE platform,
    RF and CART classifiers are relatively overfitted, fast and capable of handling
    big data such as the entire satellite data of the present study. But, the performance
    of the SVM classifier in the GEE platform was not fast, well and adequate (Shelestov
    et al., 2017a). Validation Due to the unavailability of the latest data, a direct
    comparison between the estimated crop area and the latest data are not feasible
    (Hudait et al., 2022). However, we present the rabi maize acreage of different
    years from 2018–19 to 2020–21 (Table 3), as reported by the Directorate of Economics
    and Statistics, Government of Bihar. The analysis shows that some districts are
    relatively close match between the extracted area and the government data of 2020–21,
    such as Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Gopalganj, Kishanganj, Madhepura, Pashchim Champaran,
    Saharsa, Samastipur, Sheohar and Siwan (Tables 2, 3 and 4). However, a few districts
    show a difference between the extracted area and the government data. For example,
    Arariya, Begusarai, Katihar, Khagaria, Muzaffarpur, Purnia, Supaul and Vaishali
    have higher extracted areas (about 1–10%) compared to the government data of 2020–21.
    Furthermore, the obtained results have been validated with GT data, which is collected
    in the form of polygons of the plot of the study area. Table 4 Year-wise available
    acreage data of rabi/winter maize crop as per the report of Directorate of Economics
    and Statistics, Government of Bihar Full size table Discussion Recently, high-resolution
    PlanetScope data (4.77 m) has become available in the GEE platform in collaboration
    with the NICFI program, which can be used for crop identification, mapping and
    monitoring in tropical regions. But, ESA’s Sentinel-2 (10 m) data can be used
    on a global scale. Hence, this is an excellent opportunity for researchers and
    the scientific community to improve the accuracy of crop mapping and monitoring,
    which can be helpful in precision agriculture. Nowadays, some recent literature
    is suggesting that multisource satellite data are more reliable for crop mapping
    with state-of-art ML algorithms (Prins & Niekerk, 2021; Vizzari, 2022; Yan et
    al., 2021). Hence, the present study is conducted using multisource data, which
    demonstrated that maize crops can be accurately mapped using machine learning
    and a combination of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. In which, it is necessary
    to integrate multisource satellite data to accurately map the crop. Thus, it requires
    a powerful computing system, large storage and GIS software. To overcome this,
    we have used the freely available Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform
    to access and integrate multisource remote sensing satellite data. Because the
    GEE platform is offering powerful computing capabilities to handle big datasets
    of remote sensing that can be utilized for crop mapping from small to large scales.
    It can also deal with weather phenomena like clouds and shadows with the help
    of GEE’s tool ‘CLOUDY PIXEL PERCENTAGE’ (Kumar et al., 2022; Shelestov et al.,
    2017b). To integrate the satellite data, the Sentinel-2 imagery was re-projected,
    harmonized and rescaled to the same resolution with PlanetScope (4.77 m) using
    the bicubic interpolation function (Keys, 1981) in the GEE platform. Then, the
    PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data are integrated with the help of available tools
    in the GEE platform. This approach is a novel and cost-effective approach that
    can automatically demarcate maize crop extent using machine learning and integrated
    satellite data. Which can be applied anywhere for large-scale precision agriculture.
    In the present study, it is observed that the 10-m spatial resolution data from
    the Sentinel-2 satellite sensor makes it easier to depict large patches of maize
    crops. The PlanetScope sensor can more accurately extract the small patches of
    maize crops (≥ about 5 m2), which will be helpful for mapping small-holding farms
    as the size of land holdings is small in most areas of South Asia (< 2 ha) (Jain
    et al., 2016). In addition, we found that the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B
    data yielded better performance and helped in the accurate demarcation of maize
    crops from other crops (Fig. 11). Hence, the combination of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2
    data is a feasible and accurate approach for crop identification. Furthermore,
    this study also assessed the performance of machine classifiers for the precise
    mapping of maize crops. Whereas, it is observed that RF outperforms CART and SVM
    algorithms in the GEE platform with PlanetScope data and also with the integration
    of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. Although, CART outperforms RF and SVM algorithms
    with Sentinel-2A/B data. It is also observed that RF and CART algorithms are overfitted
    for accurate mapping of crops. Likewise, the performance of the SVM algorithm
    within the GEE platform was not good enough for crop mapping. After extensive
    analysis, we have extracted the acreage of each district of North Bihar. This
    is made possible through the use of a sophisticated JavaScript code, ML classifier
    and integrated dataset from PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B satellites. Conclusion
    In the present study, Integrated satellite imagery of Sentinel-2 and PlanetScope,
    and Machine learning approaches have been used for maize crop mapping in North
    Bihar, India. In addition, the Performance of CART, random forest and SVM algorithms
    of machine learning has been evaluated for crop mapping using the GEE Cloud Computing
    Platform. Whereas, we found that RF outperforms CART and SVM algorithms with PlanetScope
    data and also with the integration of PlanetScope and Sentinel-2A/B data. The
    use of integrated satellite imagery and RF algorithms improved the accuracy of
    crop mapping by about 6%. This shows that the integration of Sentinel-2A/B and
    PlanetScope imagery is more suitable for crop identification. But, CART outperforms
    RF and SVM algorithms with Sentinel-2A/B data. Hence, the CART algorithm can be
    implemented for accurately crop mapping with Sentinel-2 data. In this study, a
    maize crop map has been generated using the GEE platform and QGIS software, and
    their overall accuracy is 95.53%. It is also found that approximately 321,252
    hectares of land are devoted to maize cultivation in North Bihar, India. Our tested
    algorithms edited and developed web-based JavaScript code can be applied anywhere
    in the world for crop mapping. This study is expected to be helpful in making
    decision support systems for crop cultivation management, crop insurance and prioritizing
    input subsidies to farmers. Availability of Data and Material Data can be made

  description: Rapid and accurate estimation of plant phenotypes plays a vital role
    in effective breeding and management of maize crops. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)
    platforms are emerging as a valuable tool in the assessment of crop phenotypes,
    offering a promising avenue to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of phenotypic
    analysis. This study executed two UAV photography methods to acquire aerial images
    for the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass (AGB) in
    summer maize. Nadir photography was implemented to obtain data from three sources
    including multi-spectral (MS), RGB, and thermal infrared (TIR) sensors. Additionally,
    RGB imaging-based cross-circling oblique (CCO) photography was implemented to
    obtain accurate 3D point cloud data. The nadir photography data was processed
    to generate orthomosaic image and extract features including vegetation index,
    canopy cover, canopy height, canopy temperature, and textural information. Features
    including canopy occupation volume, plant area index, canopy cover, and canopy
    height were extracted from the CCO photography-derived point cloud data. Furthermore,
    a data augmentation method, called linear regression-based feature augmentation
    (LRFA), was proposed for augmenting features extracted from nadir and CCO photography.
    The results showed that the introduction of CCO photography improved the accuracy
    of LAI and AGB estimation during the big trumpet stage and LAI estimation during

    content Highlights • CCO photography is more accurate than nadir photography for
    canopy height estimation. • Maize phenotype estimation can be improved by combining
    two UAV photography methods. • The proposed LRFA algorithm outperforms the conventional
    method in data fusion. Abstract Rapid and accurate estimation of plant phenotypes
    plays a vital role in effective breeding and management of maize crops. Unmanned
    aerial vehicle (UAV) platforms are emerging as a valuable tool in the assessment
    of crop phenotypes, offering a promising avenue to enhance the accuracy and efficiency
    of phenotypic analysis. This study executed two UAV photography methods to acquire
    aerial images for the estimation of leaf area index (LAI) and above-ground biomass
    (AGB) in summer maize. Nadir photography was implemented to obtain data from three
    sources including multi-spectral (MS), RGB, and thermal infrared (TIR) sensors.
    Additionally, RGB imaging-based cross-circling oblique (CCO) photography was implemented
    to obtain accurate 3D point cloud data. The nadir photography data was processed
    to generate orthomosaic image and extract features including vegetation index,
    canopy cover, canopy height, canopy temperature, and textural information. Features
    including canopy occupation volume, plant area index, canopy cover, and canopy
    height were extracted from the CCO photography-derived point cloud data. Furthermore,
    a data augmentation method, called linear regression-based feature augmentation
    (LRFA), was proposed for augmenting features extracted from nadir and CCO photography.
    The results showed that the introduction of CCO photography improved the accuracy
    of LAI and AGB estimation during the big trumpet stage and LAI estimation during
    the milk stage compared to the integrated multi-source nadir photography data.
    Notably, the LRFA derived features outperformed raw features in the majority of
    modeling scenarios, with the random forest achieved an average accuracy (R2) improvement
    of 6.1% for LAI estimation and 3.7% for AGB estimation. This study highlights

    1. Introduction As one of the world''s most important cereal crops, ensuring the
    effectiveness and excellence of maize production is of vital significance (Tester
    and Langridge, 2010). Traditionally, researchers have used phenotyping methods
    to study maize and develop ways to improve its performance. However, traditional
    manual methods have often been slow, laborious, and limited in scale, making it
    difficult to collect the vast amounts of data needed for large-scale studies (Che
    et al., 2020, Fei et al., 2023a, Xiao et al., 2022). In addition, relying solely
    on manual measurements introduces subjectivity and increases the likelihood of
    errors, thereby compromising the accuracy and reliability of the data (Awika et
    al., 2019). The emergence of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and advanced sensors
    has revolutionized crop phenotyping. By using UAV equipped with advanced sensors,
    data can be collected from large maize fields without the need for manual labor,
    saving time and reducing costs. The data collected from UAV platforms can be used
    to estimate crop traits such as canopy height (Wu et al., 2022), above-ground
    biomass (AGB) (Shu et al., 2022a, Yue et al., 2023), and grain yield (Fei et al.,
    2021, Shao et al., 2023), allowing for more accurate analysis of maize growth
    and development. Before the large-scale application of UAV technology for plant
    phenotyping, satellites, and ground-based spectroradiometers are the main remote
    sensing devices, and they have some drawbacks in collecting field data. The limited
    spatial and temporal resolution of satellites makes it difficult to capture detailed
    information of individual plants (Aasen et al., 2015, Floreano and Wood, 2015).
    Furthermore, satellite images are often affected by cloud cover and atmospheric
    interference, resulting in incomplete or unreliable data (Pan et al., 2021). On
    the other hand, ground-based spectroradiometers require researchers to physically
    move to different locations to collect data, which can be time-consuming and impractical
    for large-scale studies (Xie and Yang, 2020). UAV remote sensing has several advantages
    in plant phenotyping over satellite and ground remote sensing (Sidike et al.,
    2018, Xie and Yang, 2020). These include the ability to capture high-resolution
    imagery of individual plants, flexibility in data acquisition, the ability to
    capture data under specific conditions, cost-effectiveness, and time efficiency.
    Typical sensors affixed to UAVs for plant phenotyping encompass multi-spectral
    (MS), RGB, thermal infrared (TIR), hyperspectral, and LiDAR (Chen et al., 2022,
    Li et al., 2020, Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). These sensors facilitate the gathering
    of a broad spectrum of data concerning plant growth and developmental aspects.
    Among them, RGB sensor can capture color imagery of plants, allowing researchers
    to analyze plant morphology and identify changes in plant health over time (Chang
    et al., 2021, Garza et al., 2020). The MS sensor can detect different wavelengths
    of light, providing information on vegetation indices, growing condition, photosynthetic
    activity, and stress levels (Jiang et al., 2022, Pipatsitee et al., 2023, Wan
    et al., 2021). The TIR sensor can measure temperature variations, which can be
    used to monitor plant stress (Hou et al., 2021, Qin et al., 2022). The combination
    of UAV sensors has been used to successfully evaluate various crop parameters.
    Multi-source data fusion can obtain higher accuracy in phenotype assessment than
    single sensor data since the spectral, structural, and thermal information of
    the canopy provides unique and complementary information that helps in the assessment
    of plant phenotypes (Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). Previous study demonstrated
    that predicting wheat yield by combining UAV RGB, MS, and TIR information can
    yield more accurate predictions than a single sensor (Fei et al., 2023b). The
    combination of these sensors has also been applied to estimate various parameters
    in other species, such as maize leaf area index (LAI) (Liu et al., 2021b), soybean
    phenotypes (Maimaitijiang et al., 2017), wheat nitrogen levels (Ding et al., 2022),
    and cotton yield (Feng et al., 2020). Fusion of hyperspectral data and other sensor
    data has also been reported to improve plant trait estimations such as potato
    biomass and wheat growth parameters (Li et al., 2020, Yue et al., 2018). In addition,
    LiDAR data were successfully combined with TIR and hyperspectral data for the
    sugar content assessment of sugar beets (Wang et al., 2022). For apple tree yield
    prediction, the combination of LiDAR and RGB, MS data also provided more accurate
    predictions (Chen et al., 2022). Significantly, the integration of structural
    data obtained through LiDAR with optical information can effectively address the
    saturation issue inherent in optical remote sensing (Chianucci et al., 2016, Wallace,
    2013). When choosing sensors for practical applications, the costs involved should
    be carefully considered. Hyperspectral and LiDAR sensors are generally more expensive
    than MS, RGB, and TIR sensors (Wang et al., 2022). Using low-cost MS sensors can
    help offset the lack of hyperspectral data to some extent. As an alternative to
    LiDAR, oblique photography, which is also capable of reconstructing the crop canopy
    structure from dense point clouds, has been successfully applied in crop plant
    height assessment (Che et al., 2020). Within this research, the approach of cross-circling
    oblique (CCO) photography was employed, involving the capture of multiple single-loop
    photographs from several meters above the canopy. This method was utilized to
    generate 3D models of the canopy and extract its structural attributes, which
    has shown good accuracy in calculation of organ-scale traits (Xiao et al., 2023)
    but has not yet been applied to population trait analysis. Previous research on
    the fusion of multi-source data has mostly involved directly using features extracted
    from different sensors as inputs to regression algorithms (Fei et al., 2023b,
    Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). Although this approach yielded promising outcomes,
    it may not represent the most efficient means of fully harnessing the information
    potential offered by multiple sensors. To comprehensively tap into the predictive
    capabilities of multi-source data, a feature augmentation method based on linear
    regression was introduced. This approach has the capacity to generate a substantial
    number of additional features that encompass information from diverse sensors.
    Based on the above, the overall goal of this study is to evaluate the combination
    of UAV nadir (MS, RGB, and TIR) and CCO (RGB) photography to monitor plant phenotypes
    under field conditions. The specific objectives are as follows: (a) To estimate
    maize LAI and AGB by combining spectral, temperature, and precise 3D structural
    information extracted from nadir and CCO photography using machine learning algorithm.
    (b) To compare the modeling accuracy of the proposed feature augmentation method
    with that of the conventional method. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Experimental
    design During the summer maize growing season of 2022, an experiment was conducted
    in Xinxiang City, Henan Province, China, with precise geographic coordinates of
    113°45′42″E and 35°08′05″N. On June 15, 2022, ten varieties (Table S1) of maize
    were planted and subjected to four different fertilizer treatments: N0 (no fertilizer
    application), N1 (80 kg/hm2), N2 (120 kg/hm2), and N3 (160 kg/hm2). Each maize
    variety was replicated three times in each treatment, resulting in a total of
    120 plots, each measuring 8 m2 (2 m by 4 m). The field was optimally managed and
    strictly compliant with the prevailing environmental and climatic conditions throughout
    the study. 2.2. Field data collection Phenotypic assessments in the field were
    executed during two critical growth stages: the big trumpet stage (or the 11-leaf
    stage) and the milk stage. Quantification of LAI was undertaken utilizing the
    SunScan canopy analyzer, a comprehensive system by Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge,
    UK, comprising a probe (SS1), a sensor (BF5), and a handheld terminal (RPDA2),
    which was furnished with Sundata software. The LAI measurements were taken from
    diverse directions at the base of each plot, and an average was computed to derive
    a representative LAI value. In order to ensure congruence of data, LAI measurements
    were obtained before the acquisition of UAV images. A visualization of LAI distribution
    across all plots is presented in Fig. 4. To ascertain AGB, two uniform maize plants
    were meticulously selected from each plot and subjected to drying at 85℃ in a
    dryer until their mass reached a consistent state. The AGB per unit area of maize
    was subsequently determined through the dry weight of the samples coupled with
    the population density. The distribution pattern of AGB is visually depicted in
    Fig. 4. The measurement of canopy height within each plot entailed the random
    selection of five plants, followed by the determination of the vertical distance
    from the ground to the tallest point on each plant using a ruler. The average
    height across these five plants was adopted as the representative canopy height
    for the respective plot. The distribution of canopy height is graphically represented
    in Fig. 4. 2.3. UAV nadir photography and image processing UAV was harnessed in
    the investigations to carry out nadir photography employing three distinct sensors:
    MS, RGB, and TIR. Image acquisition was orchestrated through the utilization of
    two drones: an M210 drone (SZ DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China) outfitted with
    a Red-Edge MX camera (MicaSense Inc., Seattle, USA) and a Zenmuse XT2 camera (SZ
    DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China) (Fig. 1) to facilitate MS and TIR imaging,
    along with a Phantom 4 RTK drone (SZ DJI Technology Co., Shenzhen, China) for
    RGB imaging. Notably, the Phantom 4 RTK drone incorporates DJI On-board D-RTK
    technology (Fig.1D), enabling meticulous positioning data with an impressive precision
    of up to a centimeter. This technology supplies raw satellite observations and
    exposure event records, essential for post-processing kinematic differential corrections.

    Fig. 1. UAV platforms and sensors. The Red-Edge MX camera encompasses five spectral
    lenses spanning blue (475 nm), green (560 nm), red (668 nm), red-edge (717 nm),
    and near-infrared (842 nm) wavelengths. It features a sunlight sensor that dynamically
    adjusts to mitigate inconsistencies in MS images (Hassan et al., 2019b). Within
    the camera, a monochrome sensor captures images at a resolution of 1280 × 960
    pixels, with distinct bandwidths for various bands: red and red-edge boast a 10
    nm bandwidth, blue and green possess a 20 nm bandwidth, and infrared maintains
    a 40 nm bandwidth. Rigorous radiometric calibration was undertaken both prior
    to and after each flight using a calibration board, effectuating the conversion
    of digital number values in the MS data to reflectance values. The Zenmuse XT2
    camera, on the other hand, records thermal observations within the 7.5–13.5 μm
    spectral range. With a thermal sensitivity of 5 °C and an imaging resolution of
    640 × 512 pixels. Meanwhile, the RGB camera that comes with the Phantom 4 RTK
    drone has a 20-megapixel (5,472 x 3,648) resolution. DJI Pilot software was deployed
    for flight route planning. The UAV flights were meticulously executed under clear
    sky conditions, scheduled between 11:00 and 13:00 on the day of the field measurements,
    and maintained at a consistent altitude of 30 m to capture high-quality images.
    Notably, both the TIR and RGB imagery encompassed an 85 % front and side overlap.
    The MS camera, due to variations in its field of view, exhibited a front overlap
    of 85 % and a side overlap of 90 %. Furthermore, to amplify the precision of image
    processing, 15 ground control points were evenly dispersed across the experimental
    area. These points were meticulously surveyed using a differential global navigation
    satellite system, serving to refine the accuracy of the overall process. We utilized
    the Pix4Dmapper software (Pix4D SA, Lausanne, Switzerland) to carry out the orthorectification
    and mosaicking of the UAV-captured RGB, MS and TIR images. The key stages of this
    process encompassed image geolocation, the incorporation of ground control points,
    image alignment, the creation of dense point cloud data, digital surface model
    (DSM), orthomosaics, and performing radiometric calibration (Han et al., 2019).
    2.4. UAV CCO photography The methodology of CCO photography involves capturing
    multiple single-circle photographs (Fig. 2), with a distinction made between intra-circle
    and inter-circle overlap (Xiao et al., 2023), has not yet been used in AGB and
    LAI estimation. Intra-circle overlap pertains to the coverage between images within
    a single-circle photograph and is dictated by factors like flight height, circle
    radius, and camera field of view. On the other hand, inter-circle overlap refers
    to the coverage between two consecutive single-circle photographs and is determined
    by their overlap. Fig. 2B provides a visual of the CCO photography containing
    four single circles, featuring a 50 % inter-circle overlap. The green section
    indicates the region amenable to reconstruction, while the purple area represents
    the inscribed square within the reconstruction region. Reconstruction necessitates
    a minimum inter-circle overlap of around 50 %, which is achieved when the inscribed
    squares of adjacent circular photographs are in contact. Download : Download high-res

    route consisting of two single circles with a 50% inter-circle overlap. (B) Top

    overlap. (C) Image taken by CCO photography. (D) The actual flight path of the
    CCO route. The CCO photography was conducted simultaneously using two DJI Phantom
    4 RTK drones. For the flights, the altitude was set at 4 m above the canopy (adjusted
    based on the canopy''s height), the circle radius was set to 4 m, and the camera
    was positioned at a 45° angle. To ensure comprehensive image acquisition, the
    narrow and curved maize leaves required approximately 90 % intra-circle overlap
    and 60 % inter-circle overlap. Flight speeds were maintained at 0.2 m/s, with
    images taken at 2-second intervals while the camera was focused on the circle''s
    center. 2.5. Reconstruction of 3D canopy structure from CCO photography images
    The sequences of UAV images underwent processing utilizing Agisoft Metashape Professional
    Edition v1.7.3. This software employs a conventional structure-from-motion and
    multi-view stereo (SfM-MVS) workflow to detect distinctive key points and descriptors
    within the Pixel coordinate system (CS). Notably, Metashape was able to establish
    consistent descriptors for key points across varying lighting conditions during
    image capture, ensuring stability under different perspectives and illumination.
    Subsequently, the software deduced camera parameters and positions by utilizing
    the identified key points and descriptors. This was followed by generating a sparse
    point cloud within the Camera CS. The transformation of the sparse point cloud
    into the Internal CS was achieved by employing internal and external camera orientation
    parameters. For enhancing point densities, the software executed dense point cloud
    reconstruction through MVS methods. The outcome, a dense point cloud, was exported
    within the UTM zone 49 N CS and subjected to denoising through the statistical
    outlier removal filter algorithm. Fig. 3 visually represents the distribution
    and height of 3D canopy of CCO-derived maize at the big trumpet stage. In order
    to systematically segment individual plots, a uniform division was applied based
    on their spatial arrangement within the experimental design. Each plot was then
    assigned a distinctive identifier based on its geographic location. This segmentation
    procedure encompassed two primary steps. Firstly, the manual identification of
    the four corners of each plot facilitated the establishment of spatial polygons,
    accomplished using the “Sf” and “Raster” package in R v4.2.2. Subsequently, the
    dense point cloud underwent sequential segmentation by employing the Whitebox
    Tools library in Python, version 3.5. Download : Download high-res image (561KB)

    2.6. Features extracted from nadir photography-based images Various types of features
    were extracted from the nadir photography-based images. These features including
    band reflectance and DN values, vegetation indices, temperature information, texture
    features, and structural features (Fig. 4), which are listed in Table S2. The
    number of features of MS, RGB, and TIR are 38, 37, and 9, respectively. 2.6.1.
    Background removal and canopy cover extraction The excess green minus excess red
    index (EXGR), derived from RGB band data, played a pivotal role in mitigating
    background noise and extracting canopy cover (CC). To pinpoint maize pixels within
    the UAV images, an initial binary mask was created using the EXGR values. Subsequently,
    this mask was utilized to partition the image into distinct segments: maize vegetation
    and background elements encompassing soil, shadows, and other ground features.
    Ultimately, the maize pixels identified within each plot were divided by the total
    pixel count of that plot, culminating in the calculation of the CC. Importantly,
    the masks generated through the EXGR method also proved effective in eliminating
    background interference from MS and TIR images. 2.6.2. Vegetation indices and
    canopy texture information The raw bands from MS and RGB orthomosaics were used
    as features to assess LAI and AGB. Furthermore, a selection was made from a variety
    of MS and RGB vegetation indices, previously employed for plant trait analysis.
    The pertinent equations for their computation, along with their respective sources,
    have been succinctly consolidated within Table S2. From the red-edge and NIR bands
    within the MS image, as well as each band within the RGB and TIR image, texture
    attributes were extracted. To accomplish this, the “GLCMTextures” package in R
    v4.2.2 was leveraged to compute texture characteristics rooted in gray level co-occurrence
    matrices (GLCM) (Haralick et al., 1973). 2.6.3. Canopy height The DSM generated
    from digital images provides elevation information for plants, soil, and other
    ground objects (Bendig et al., 2015). To obtain the canopy height model (CHM),
    the DSM was subtracted from a digital terrain model (DTM) on a pixel-by-pixel
    basis. However, settling of the topsoil due to rainfall, irrigation, and other
    factors can cause a decrease in the true elevation value of the surface (Shu et
    al., 2022b). To overcome this, a contemporaneous DTM was generated in Pix4Dmapper
    using images that were captured at the same time as the DSM. The process involved
    filtering and classifying terrain points in a point cloud, based on their elevation,
    slope, and curvature, and then interpolating these points to generate an elevation
    grid that represents the terrain surface. The intricate configuration of maize
    canopies introduces complexities, and the conventional method of computing canopy
    height by averaging pixel values across various leaves of multiple plants can
    lead to notable underestimations (Han et al., 2018). To circumvent this, the approach
    employed in this study involved the computation of canopy height through pixels
    captured from the upper leaves of multiple plants. Specifically, the 99 % quantile
    of pixel values within each plot, as depicted by the CHM, was utilized to accurately
    signify the canopy height. 2.6.4. Canopy temperature information The normalized
    relative canopy temperature (NRCT) was computed using UAV TIR imagery (Fig. 4).
    The formula is as follows: (1) where represents the canopy temperature of the
    ith pixel, is the lowest temperature across the field trial, and is the highest
    temperature across the field trial. 2.7. Features extracted from reconstructed
    3D canopy structure Canopy architectural traits were extracted from the 3D structure,
    including canopy occupation volume (COV), plant area index (PAI), CC, and canopy
    height. To calculate COV, the canopy model was voxelized, with each voxel having
    a thickness of 1 cm, and the occupied voxels were determined by those containing
    triangles from the canopy model. The COV was obtained by calculating the total
    volume of these occupied voxels. PAI was obtained by dividing the total plant
    area by the canopy occupation area, which was calculated from the meshed canopy
    using Heron''s formula. CC was calculated by dividing the occupied area by the
    total area of the horizontal plane. The canopy height was defined as the distance
    between the base point of the stem and the 99th percentile height. Additional
    details regarding the COV formulation can be found in Liu et al. (2021a), while
    information on Heron''s formula can be found in Kendig (2000). 2.8. Development
    of a feature augmentation technology To fully integrate the features extracted
    from different sources, a linear regression-based feature augmentation (LRFA)
    method was proposed in this study (Fig. 5). The steps of LRFA are as follows,
    using an example of combining all four sources of features (90 features in total):
    a. Initially, the dataset was partitioned into a training set and a test set using
    a predetermined ratio. b. On the training set, i features were randomly selected
    from the feature sets of MS, RGB, TIR, and 3D separately, resulting in a total
    of 4i features. The same features were also selected on the test set. c. These
    4i features on training set were combined with the plant trait values and denoted
    as D. The 10-fold cross-validation was then performed on D using multiple linear
    regression (MLR). The out-of-sample prediction generated during the cross-validation
    process was used as a new training feature. The MLR model was trained using all
    the data of D and tested on 4i features on the test set. The output prediction
    was used as a new test feature. d. Step c) was repeated for n times to generate
    n new features in both the training and test datasets. Since the 4i features selected
    in each iteration were different, the features generated between different iterations
    were independent of each other. These n new features were combined with all the
    original features in the training and testing datasets, forming a new training
    set and a new test set with a dimension of n + 90. e. Training a machine learning
    model using the new training set created in step d), and evaluating its accuracy

    augmentation method. MLR, multiple linear regression, MS multi-spectral, TIR thermal
    Infrared. The proposed LRFA (Fig. 5) method borrows a part of stacking regression,
    an ensemble learning method. In stacking regression, the out-of-sample prediction
    matrix generated by the levle-1 of each base learner is used as the input features
    for the level-2, which improves the final model prediction. Every sampling performed
    in LRFA is equivalent to adding a new learner in stacking regression, and in turn
    the out-of-sample predictions obtained through MLR training can be used as new
    features. A detailed steps of the generation of new features using out-of-sample
    predictions is shown in Fig. S1. Considering the number of features for each sensor,
    this study sets i to 5 and n to 200 to verify the data fusion effect of LRFA.
    Additionally, we compared the performance of LRFA with the conventional data fusion
    method where the different types of features are combined and used as direct inputs
    for machine learning model training. It''s worth mentioning that certain identical
    structural attributes (CC, CH, and CC × CH) were derived from both RGB and 3D
    data. To prevent redundant data, when incorporating both RGB and 3D features in
    the data combination, only the structural attributes within the 3D data are employed.
    2.9. Modeling method and accuracy evaluation The random forest algorithm (Breiman,
    2001) was employed to construct regression models in this research. To gauge the
    predictive precision of the regression models, the outer cross-validation was
    adopted (Montesinos-López et al., 2019). This encompassed partitioning the accessible
    data into 5 equivalent folds, employing 4 of these folds for model training, and
    reserving the fifth fold for performance evaluation. This sequence was reiterated
    5 times, with each fold assuming the role of the validation set once. The ultimate
    model performance was computed as the mean across all 5 folds. Within each outer
    cross-validation training set, the inner 5-fold cross-validation was employed
    to determine the optimal hyperparameters (Montesinos-López et al., 2019). The
    outcomes of each fold were averaged to approximate the model''s performance using
    a specific set of hyperparameters. Subsequently, the optimal hyperparameters were
    employed in the training set for outer cross-validation to train the model. The
    hyperparameters for random forest model were ascertained automatically through
    the “train” function in the “caret” package (R v4.2.2). The prediction performance
    was quantified using coefficient of determination (R2) and root mean square error
    (RMSE): (2) (3) where and are the measured and the predicted phenotype value,
    respectively. is the mean of measured phenotype value and n is the total number
    of samples. 3. Results 3.1. Canopy height estimation The correlations between
    UAV-extracted canopy height and measured canopy height are depicted in Fig. 6.
    The findings reveal that during both the big trumpet and milk stages, the canopy
    height calculated from the 3D model exhibited a stronger correlation with the
    measured canopy height compared to the CHM. Specifically, the R2 between CHM-derived
    canopy height and measured canopy height stood at 0.78 (RMSE = 0.22 m) during
    the big trumpet stage, and 0.52 (RMSE = 0.17 m) during the milk stage. Meanwhile,
    the R2 values between 3D model-derived canopy height and measured canopy height
    were 0.92 (RMSE = 0.13 m) and 0.71 (RMSE = 0.11 m) during the big trumpet and
    milk stages, respectively. The enhanced precision of the 3D model-derived canopy
    height can be attributed to the comprehensive depiction of plant shape and volume
    facilitated by COO photography, in contrast to the limitations of nadir photography.

    validation of LAI and AGB 3.2.1. Model performance for estimating LAI In the context
    of the big trumpet stage, the results show that MS features achieved a superior
    accuracy in LAI estimation (Table 1), with an R2 of 0.726 and an RMSE of 0.276.
    Notably, the R2 value was higher for 3D features compared to both RGB and TIR
    features. In the majority of cases, combining data from multiple sources led to
    significant enhancements in LAI estimation compared to using single-source data.
    Specifically, the combination (LRFA) of MS, RGB, and 3D data outperformed all
    others, yielding an impressive R2 of 0.791 and an RMSE of 0.235, which significantly
    surpassed the performance of the best single-source data (MS). During the milk
    stage, MS features continued to demonstrate superior performance, boasting an
    R2 value of 0.537 (RMSE = 0.180). The 3D features exhibited a lower accuracy than
    RGB but still outperformed TIR. It''s important to note that all combinations
    of multi-source data consistently yielded higher accuracy compared to using single-source
    data. The combination of MS, RGB and 3D features yielded the best estimation accuracy,
    with an R2 of 0.654 and an RMSE of 0.154. Table 1. Accuracy parameters for leaf

    for estimating AGB In big trumpet stage (Table 1), features from the MS sensor
    provide the most accurate estimation of AGB (R2 = 0.625, RMSE = 94.4 kg/ha), followed
    by RGB (R2 = 0.622, RMSE = 95.2 kg/ha), TIR (R2 = 0.618, RMSE = 97.3 kg/ha), and
    3D features (R2 = 0.570, RMSE = 101.3 kg/ha). As expected, the combination of
    multi-source data yielded higher accuracy in AGB estimation. Combining the features
    (LRFA) from RGB, TIR, and 3D produced the highest prediction accuracy (R2 = 0.679,
    RMSE = 87.5 kg/ha). In the milk stage, MS and RGB features outperformed the other
    two types of data for estimating AGB, with R2 values of 0.365 and 0.416, respectively.
    Thermal data ranked third with R2 value of 0.238, while 3D data performed the
    worst with R2 value of 0.117. Multi-source data fusion generally produced more
    accurate estimations compared to single-source data. When fusing MS, TIR, and
    3D features using the LRFA method, the highest prediction accuracy was achieved,
    with an R2 value of 0.480 and an RMSE of 347.9 kg/ha. 3.2.3. Comparison of the
    conventional method with LRFA According to Table 1, in most scenarios involving
    the integration of data from multiple sources, the LRFA method yielded more accurate
    phenotype estimations compared to the conventional approach. In addition, the
    comprehensive comparison of cross-validation accuracy between the LRFA method
    and the conventional one when combining multi-source data is presented in Fig.
    7. Each box plot represents the results of 100 validations conducted by the random
    forest during a 5-fold cross-validation process for LAI and AGB estimation at
    both stages. Out of these 100 cross-validation runs, the LRFA method outperformed
    the conventional method in 67 instances. The mean R2 value for the LRFA method
    was 0.619, surpassing the conventional method''s 0.589, underscoring the effectiveness
    of the proposed feature augmentation technique. Download : Download high-res image

    fusion effect, the performances of the random forest model for different cycle
    numbers were explored. As shown in Fig. 8, the results demonstrate that the model
    performance remains stable and increasing the number of cycles does not improve
    the random forest model. The model performed ideally for a cycle number of 100
    and also performed better than the conventional fusion method in most cases. Download

    and estimated LAI and AGB for both the two growth stages using the best-performing
    model are shown in Fig. 9. Visually, the maps of the estimated phenotypes showed
    good agreement with the measured phenotypes. The t-test was implemented to evaluate
    the differences between the estimated and measured phenotypes within each genotype
    and treatment. There was no significant difference (P > 0.05) between the estimated
    and measured plant phenotypes for each nitrogen treatment in both stages (Fig.
    10). Similarly, no significant difference (P > 0.05) was found between the estimated
    and measured plant phenotypes for each genotype (Fig. 10). The performance of
    each best-performing model to detect phenotypic differences across genotypes and
    nitrogen treatments was evaluated using combined ANOVA (Table 2). The measured
    AGB at milk stage was able to detect significant differences across genotypes
    and treatments. In the rest of cases, the measured phenotypic values were only
    able to detect differences across treatments. The estimated phenotypes had the
    same properties as measured phenotypes in detecting differences across genotypes
    and nitrogen treatments. Download : Download high-res image (647KB) Download :

    4. Discussion 4.1. Advantages of CCO photography technology Low-cost RGB nadir
    photography is capable of generating point cloud data to extract structural information,
    but the quality of the generated point clouds is often poor. This is due to its
    lack of involvement of plant side photographs in the 3D point cloud model construction
    process, which is crucial for establishing the target side detail texture and
    generating point clouds (Chen et al., 2022, Jurado et al., 2020). Oblique photography
    is a new technique for 3D modeling of urban areas and forestry, achieved by tilting
    the UAV-mounted RGB camera at a specific angle from the vertical to capture oblique
    images (Che et al., 2020). Compared to nadir photography (Hassan et al., 2019a),
    oblique photography provides more detailed information about the object''s sides
    and bottom, resulting in a denser point cloud and more effective 3D reconstruction.
    Although conventional oblique photography is a common method for extracting plant
    structural parameters, the results are not always satisfactory due to the lack
    of more angular plant images. For instance, when assessing the height of faba
    bean plants (Ji et al., 2022), it has been found to be less accurate than nadir
    photography. Oblique photography has also been used to assess maize plant height,
    with only 1.1 % improvement in accuracy compared to nadir photography (Che et
    al., 2020). The surround photography is well-suited for creating precise object
    models, but its practical use is often restricted to smaller-scale applications
    with ground-based cameras (Xiao et al., 2020), making it challenging to apply
    in field settings. The emerging technology of UAV CCO photography has overcome
    this limitation. In this study, CCO photography with the use of two drones yielded
    a net flight time of approximately one hour. Based on our previous research (Xiao
    et al., 2023), as image quality increases, the time required for CCO photography
    can be significantly reduced. In the future, it is worth exploring the use of
    higher pixel cameras to execute CCO photography tasks more efficiently. In recent
    study (Xiao et al., 2023), we compared the 3D reconstruction accuracy of CCO photography
    with the most commonly used oblique photography method for UAV, i.e., five-directional
    oblique (FDO) photography. The CCO photography-derived 3D canopy models provided
    higher accuracy than the FDO photography-derived 3D canopy models in the estimation
    of organ-scale traits, further demonstrating the effectiveness of the CCO approach
    in capturing crop traits. The CCO photography also has two other advantages over
    the FDO photography: (1) CCO is more efficient than FDO routes, with CCO photography
    requiring far fewer images at different altitudes than FDO photography, averaging
    only 38 % of FDO photography (Xiao et al., 2023). (2) CCO photography can image
    at ultra-low altitude without disturbing the canopy structure, whereas the conventional
    oblique method may disturb the canopy at this altitude. This is because the shooting
    area of CCO photography is located at the center of the circular route, away from
    the interference zone at the edge of the flight path. In contrast, conventional
    oblique photography methods face challenges when using the same ultra-low altitude
    method. If downdrafts from the rotor blades of the drone disturbed the canopy
    at the previous waypoint, problems could arise at the next waypoint (Xiao et al.,
    2023). Disturbances introduced in one area of the canopy can propagate to the
    next, affecting data quality and potentially compromising the accuracy of the
    assessment. 4.2. Multi-source data fusion for estimating plant phenotypes In the
    field of plant phenotyping, it is common to fuse data from RGB, MS, and TIR sensors.
    The characteristics of these three types of sensor data were described in numerous
    studies (Fei et al., 2023b, Maimaitijiang et al., 2020) and will not be discussed
    further in this section. The use of dense point cloud data (e.g., from LiDAR)
    in plant phenotyping is a relatively new approach that has the potential to provide
    valuable information on plant structure and architecture. For example, Chen et
    al. (2022) predicted individual apple tree yield by combining morphological features
    extracted from LiDAR data and MS information. The crown volume 1 derived from
    the LiDAR point cloud data contributed the most for the prediction model. In addition,
    when LiDAR-extracted data were combined with thermal data as predictors for Bayesian
    ridge regression and support vector regression algorithms, higher prediction accuracy
    was achieved compared to the combination of thermal, RGB, and MS data (Wang et
    al., 2022). The combination of nadir photography derived MS, RGB, and TIR data
    achieved the best accuracy for estimating maize LAI in previous report (Liu et
    al., 2021b). The same situations occurred in the phenotypic evaluation of other
    crops (Fei et al., 2023b, Maimaitijiang et al., 2020). However, results in this
    study showed that the highest maize LAI estimation accuracy was achieved using
    the combination of MS, RGB, and 3D features at both measured stages. Similarly,
    the most accurate AGB estimates can be obtained using a data combination (RGB
    + TIR + 3D) including 3D features in the big trumpet stage. These findings illustrate
    the limitations of nadir photography data to estimate plant traits and highlight
    the advantages of accurate morphological features extracted from 3D canopy model.
    Model performance is usually not optimal when data from all four sources are merged
    simultaneously. This may be attributed to the problem of redundancy of information
    due to the fusion of data from multiple sources (Pohl and Van Genderen, 1998),
    which has also been observed in Maimaitijiang et al. (2017). Therefore, the optimal
    combination of multi-source data for estimating crop phenotypes still needs to
    be further researched and explored in the future. 4.3. Characteristics of LRFA
    method The conventional data fusion method for plant phenotyping is to combine
    data from different sources (e.g., MS, RGB, TIR, and 3D data) into a single dataset
    for predictive modeling of target plant traits. In other industries, there were
    many other data fusion methods such as simple averaging, BatesGranger averaging
    (Bates and Granger, 1969), Granger-Ramanathan averaging (Granger and Ramanathan,
    1984), Bayesian model averaging (Xu et al., 2019) and bias-corrected eigenvector
    averaging (Hsiao and Wan, 2014). This diversity of approaches shows that researchers
    are always looking for innovative ways to improve the accuracy and efficiency
    of data fusion models. The LRFA proposed in this study aims to derive numerous
    new high-quality features that contain information from multiple sources of data.
    The idea of using cross-validation to generate new training features is drawn
    from the method used to generate the second level training set in stacking regression
    (Fei et al., 2021). Overall, the accuracy of the LRFA based data fusion method
    was higher than that of conventional method (Fig. 7). When employing the LRFA
    technique, the newly generated features, obtained by combining information from
    multiple sources through training, exhibit a higher correlation with phenotypes
    (Fig.S2). Through iterations, the hundreds of randomly generated and precise features
    produced by LRFA can enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of the overall features,
    thereby increasing the final accuracy of the model. In principle, the LFRA approach
    may render noise-sensitive regression algorithms more effective. In the future,
    the LRFA approach should be tested in data fusion applications of different domains,
    which can provide valuable insights into its potential strengths and limitations,
    and identify areas for further research and development. 4.4. Effect of developmental
    stage on the accuracy of phenotype estimation The accuracy of phenotype estimation
    at the big trumpet stage is higher than that at the milk stage, likely due to
    the following reasons. Firstly, at the big trumpet stage, the coefficients of
    variation for canopy height, LAI, and AGB were 25.9 %, 32.0 %, and 40.5 %, respectively.
    In comparison, at the milk stage, the coefficients of variation for each phenotype
    were 9.4 %, 15.6 %, and 35.7 %, respectively. The big trumpet stage exhibited
    greater phenotypic variability, resulting in increased data variability and improved
    predictive capabilities of the model (Ferrio et al., 2005). The big trumpet stage
    in maize, occurring about 45 days after sowing, represents a critical phase of
    growth and reproduction. In our study of ten different maize varieties, genetic
    differences in growth rate, plant size, disease resistance, and adaptability to
    climate result in significant variation in appearance at this stage. As time passes,
    maize varieties tend to reach similar growth states, reducing phenotypic differences.
    During later growth stages (milk stage), competition for limited resources like
    nutrients, water, and sunlight further narrows the differences among varieties.
    Additionally, common factors such as nutrient depletion, diseases, and pests have
    similar effects on all varieties, reducing variability. Secondly, during the milk
    stage, maize tassels become more visible in UAV images, obstructing the lower
    leaves and potentially leading to a loss of leaf information, which may reduce
    the accuracy of estimation models based on UAV images following maize tasseling
    (Liu et al., 2021b). Although AGB is a trait with 3D properties, the accuracy
    of AGB estimation using 3D features was much lower during the milk stage compared
    to that of MS and RGB features, possibly due to the influence of ears. Ears exhibit
    higher dry matter partitioning during the late growth stage of maize, and a study
    by Cai et al. (2022) found that ears can account for up to 44 % of AGB during
    the milk stage. However, it is difficult to assess the quality of ears using volumetric
    information obtained by CCO photography. This limitation may contribute to lower
    accuracy in the assessment of AGB using 3D features at the milk stage. As a result,
    CCO photography is more suitable for AGB estimation in the early growth stage
    of maize. 5. Summary and conclusions The utilization of UAV-based imaging for
    plant phenotyping is gaining increasing popularity due to its capacity to non-invasively
    capture high-resolution data over extensive areas. In this investigation, a novel
    strategy, LRFA, was introduced to augment features from UAV nadir and CCO photography
    for the estimation of maize phenotypes. The key findings can be summarized as
    follows: (a) CCO photography technology exhibited superior accuracy in extracting
    canopy height compared to nadir photography at both growth stages. (b) The incorporation
    of CCO photography-derived data improved LAI and AGB estimations at the big trumpet
    stage and LAI estimation at the milk stage when contrasted with the combination
    of multi-sensor nadir photography data. (c) In most instances, the LRFA method
    outperformed the conventional method for LAI and AGB estimation. The results offered
    in this study underscore that combining different photography techniques and applying
    the feature augmentation method can enhance the accuracy of phenotype estimation,
    thereby advancing our comprehension of plant growth and development. To assess
    the robustness of this approach, it is advisable to subject it to testing across
    various crop types, a broader range of genotypes, and under varying growth stages
    and environmental conditions. CRediT authorship contribution statement Shuaipeng

    Smart agriculture is a multimodal strategy that focuses on improving crop yield
    while simultaneously strengthening farmers over the consequences of climate change.
    Smart applications such as smart buildings, smart farming, and smart hospitals
    rely on the Internet of Things (IoT).1 Different attributes considered to improve
    agricultural production include productivity, water conservation, cost, labor,
    and knowledge. IoT connects all agrarian things to the Internet, providing a supportive
    hand to agriculture.2, 3 Agriculture is the most imperative division in numerous
    countries, it output food, raw materials, and business. However, IoT based agriculture
    is also subjected to various difficulties, including erratic precipitation, floods,
    drought, environmental change, and so forth. To address these challenges, an IoT
    based recommendation model is required to encourage the farmers to enhance the
    yield rate.4, 5 The profitability of farming not only depends on regular assets
    but also depends on the information provided in the framework. The framework takes
    input as soil type, water availability, fertilizer type, weather conditions, and
    crop type. These sources of information can increase or announce the profitability
    of any harvest.6, 7 Traditional crop selection is not precise and lacks examination
    gradations. To address such problems, information mining8, 9 and machine learning
    (ML)10, 11 techniques can be used.12 The long-term informational collection is
    available in the agriculture division. Information mining has been used to analyze
    such databases and provide better prediction results using large datasets.13,
    14 Information mining is a critical area of today''s research for handling, analyzing,
    and evaluating large datasets; distinguishing affiliations, arrangements, and
    grouping, among other things; and predicting the best outcomes with important
    examples.15, 16 Essentially, these techniques can be used in the sphere of agriculture
    and can provide exceptional vital advantages and fulfill the expectations aroused
    by business and logical goals.17 Since there is growth in population and agricultural
    sectors, there is also an exponential increase in the datasets collected through
    sensors.18 These data combine different attribute values that help the prediction
    systems to suggest suitable crops. Therefore, effective prediction systems are
    required to learn the attribute values and differentiate the input data into appropriate
    class labels.19 There are diverse crop recommendation systems in the literature
    that are formulated to suggest suitable crops for cultivation based on different
    parameters. Some ML models demand larger datasets to provide better accuracy and
    have some poor performance for large datasets. Therefore, a crop recommendation
    system is built, and the performance of the models is compared to identify the
    best model for crop recommendation. The major models considered are the decision
    tree (DT), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM). The ML models
    selected in this framework are flexible, easy to implement, and can provide low
    complexity for large datasets. Due to these merits, the proposed model has integrated
    these 3 models for crop recommendation by analyzing large sensor data. The sensor
    information included temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil pH values of 31
    crops. The data are collected from Maharashtra using sensors located in different
    regions. All these data are used in the prediction process, where the data are
    provided separately to the classifiers. The article aims to provide a feasible
    dataset for crop recommendation and identify a suitable classifier for prediction.
    The proposed model has introduced DT, RF, and SVM to reduce such issues for efficient
    crop recommendation. The major contributions of the work are as follows: To compare
    and analyze the performance of the three popular classifiers in predicting the
    suitable crop based on the provided input parametric values. The dataset is preprocessed
    and provided as input to the classifiers separately to identify the performance
    of each classifier in crop recommendation. To obtain a better ML model for performing
    crop recommendation over the large sensor collected dataset. To depict the efficiency
    of the proposed model over the other existing models. It also aims to implement
    the process with a less complex model with a high accuracy rate for large crop
    datasets. Extending the evaluations of the ML models in terms of precision, recall,
    f-measure, and accuracy for the constructed crop recommendation dataset. The remaining
    sections of the article are organized as follows: the literature survey of the
    article is presented in Section 2, Section 3 covers the methodology and ML models
    used for prediction, the performance analysis and evaluations are presented in
    Section 12 and finally, Section 17 concludes the article. 2 RELATED WORK Various
    recommendation systems in the literature suggest suitable crops for cultivation
    to improve the production rate and income of the farmers. Most of the techniques
    use ML for prediction, and some of the recent techniques based on data mining
    are discussed below: Basically, crops are recommended by considering the major
    parameters influencing crop growth. These parameters include rainfall, soil properties,
    fertilizer usage, climatic conditions and so forth. An approach for soil classification
    and crop suggestion was published in literature by Rahman et al.20 that considered
    the land types for cultivation. The soil''s chemical features were taken as the
    input parameters, and the approach utilized several ML models for predicting the
    soil type for crop suggestion. The ML models implemented were weighted k-nearest
    neighbor (k-NN), Gaussian kernel-based SVM and bagged trees. These models classified
    the soil types that helped the farmers to identify the appropriate crop for cultivation.
    A similar approach for soil fertility prediction by suggesting suitable crops
    for cultivation was introduced by Kumar et al.21 In that approach, soil grading
    was utilized that graded the soil types based on the nutrient contents. Soil grading
    helped the farmers to understand the quality and fertility of the soil, and ML
    models were implemented for that purpose. Several ML models were utilized, and
    the approach found that the RF provided optimal results. Sensor information is
    useful for obtaining accurate information from the field, and it helps to build
    reliable real-time models that satisfy the plant''s needs. An approach for predicting
    the irrigation recommendation of agronomists based on sensor information was proposed
    by Goldstein et al.22 A total of 22 soil sensors were utilized to collect soil,
    weather, and plot information for irrigation recommendation. The constructed dataset
    was tested using several regression and classification algorithms, and the results
    suggested that unique models for different plots yield useful results. Unlike
    other approaches, the level of soil fertility was analyzed, and an advanced decision
    tree (ADT) model was implemented by Rajeswari and Suthendran23 for crop recommendation.
    A mobile application called the smart information system (DSIS) design was also
    developed that captures the user location for crop recommendation. Big data analytics
    helps to handle large datasets efficiently using different computerized tools.
    Since the agricultural sector is one of the most important sectors, the huge amount
    of information collected from the crop fields can be effectively handled using
    these tools. By integrating big data analytics and ML, Doshi et al.24 formulated
    an intelligent crop recommendation system named agroconsultant concerning soil
    and climatic conditions. The results on different classifiers suggested that the
    models were suitable for real-time scenarios. Using the ensemble technique, Kulkarni
    et al.25 introduced another crop recommendation system to achieve higher accuracy.
    The prediction considers the physical and chemical properties of the soil as well
    as the climatic conditions. The ensemble models combine SVM, RF, and naïve Bayes
    to obtain efficient classification accuracy. Finally, the majority voting technique
    was followed to achieve the class labels accurately. The production rate of the
    crops is also affected by the pests and diseases in the field. To recover from
    this issue, Kumar et al.26 developed a system that predicted the suitable crop
    for cultivation, detected the pests causing damage, and suggested appropriate
    pest control techniques. The predictions were performed using the SVM, DT and
    logistic regression, and the outcomes suggested that the SVM model was suitable
    for predictions. Recently, precision agriculture has played a role in this sector
    as it uses GPS technology to gather site-specific data. One approach for crop
    recommendation using geospatial clustering was introduced by Suchithra and Pai,27
    where a large amount of geospatial data were processed. The density-based spatial
    clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method integrated with the ball
    tree algorithm was utilized to gather the field data. Using the data, a rank generator
    was created that suggested five suitable crops that can be cultivated for a particular
    land. For the past few decades, agriculture has been considered the major profession
    for most Indian livelihoods. Even though India is considered the major producing
    country for agriculture, the farmers still have not gained sufficient benefits
    from agriculture. The combination of technology with agriculture can improve productivity
    and get the finest results on each criterion. The predictive crop yield depends
    on different climatic conditions: soil temperature, soil moisture, humidity, and
    air temperature. However, in previous decades, farmers used manual harvesting
    experience and self-monitoring, but such analyzes are not very accurate. Therefore,
    to overcome that, an automatic model based crop recommendation process is analyzed
    in the proposed model. Making the right decisions for farming, marketing, and
    storage would be easier for policymakers and farmers if they could predict the
    crop choice and yield before it was harvested.28 Different deep learning models
    have recently been developed29-31 for image and information mining processes.
    However, such techniques are not flexible for learning large data as few important
    data get lost during the learning process. Further, the complexity of implementing
    the deep learning model over the real-time collected sensor data is high. The
    conducted literature survey provided knowledge about the different techniques
    utilized in literature for crop recommendation and the benefits of each technique.
    Most available techniques utilize ML algorithms for prediction because they are
    more accurate than others. But the available ML models are affected by different
    problems, such as computational complexities, low accuracy and so forth. Therefore,
    this article presents a performance analysis of the popular ML models to identify
    the most accurate model for crop recommendation using data mining. 3 MATERIALS
    AND METHODOLOGY The use of sensor networks is increasing day by day to gather
    crucial information for diverse applications. In this work, crop recommendation
    models based on the information gathered from the sensors are developed. The sensor
    information is fed to the ML models for predicting the crops accurately based
    on diverse parameters. The entire state of Maharashtra was chosen as the study
    area. The geographical extents of the study area are north latitude and east longitude
    with an overall area of about 15,642 sq. km. The different land areas in Maharashtra
    are affected by different climatic conditions and soil properties. Therefore,
    farmers suffer in accurately predicting the appropriate crop for cultivation to
    increase profit and yield. The land area chosen for experimentation is shown in
    Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint The land area chosen for experimentation
    The data from the land areas is collected by placing a total of 250 sensors each
    with a distance of 25 m. Each sensor is capable of obtaining a particular parameter
    from the land area. In this work, four major parameters are considered, such as
    temperature, humidity, soil pH, and rainfall data. These data are collected by
    the sensors situated in the land area, and the data collected are stored in the
    cloud systems. The sink node used in the proposed scheme is the gateway node with
    Raspberry Pi, Zigbee series 2. The collected real time data are then extracted
    through the wi-fi connectivity. The sensor node used in the proposed scheme is
    presented in Figure 2. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Sensor node used
    for data collection A total of 31 crops are considered for crop recommendation.
    These crops include cotton, lentil, maize, millet, moong bean, moth bean, apple,
    azuki beans, banana, black gram, chickpea, coconut, coffee, grapes, groundnut,
    jute, kidney bean, mango, muskmelon, orange, papaya, peas, pigeon pea, pomegranate,
    rice, rubber, sugarcane, tea, tomato, watermelon, and wheat. These crops are widely
    distributed in different areas of the study region, and based on the climatic
    conditions and soil properties, the crops are recommended. The temperature variations
    in the study area during January and April are as follows: The minimum temperature
    in January is , and the maximum temperature in the same month is . At times in
    April, the minimum temperature range is , and the maximum temperature range is
    . Also, the annual rainfall rate of the study region is 76.3 cm. The overall block
    diagram of the article is presented in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Block diagram of the current study 3.1 Preprocessing Preprocessing
    is the initial phase of the proposed framework, where the data obtained through
    the sensors in the field are cleaned and reduced for prediction. The preprocessing
    phase involves three major steps: data cleaning, sorting, and filling up redundant
    data. Since the dataset collected comprises only the required parameters (i.e.,
    temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall), all the data are treated for preprocessing.
    3.1.1 Data cleaning Initially, the data is cleaned to remove the bad or irrelevant
    data from the dataset caused due to the presence of noise. The noise in the data
    occurs due the errors in data collection, problems in transmission, rapid environmental
    changes and so forth. For data cleaning, the binning strategy32 is followed, in
    which the collected data is filled into bins and then smoothing is performed to
    remove the erroneous data. The bin boundaries are considered in the smoothing
    process, and the data values within this bin boundary are cleaned. Four bins are
    considered and based on the four attribute values, and the samples are binned
    for cleaning. 3.1.2 Filling up of missing values The dataset comprises missing
    values that must be either filled or removed. Instead of removing these values,
    missing value imputation is performed to fill these values with some reasonable
    values. In the dataset, the missing values are represented as dots, and the imputation
    method updates the null values with some huge negative values, which are treated
    as outliers. These values are then used along with the existing dataset values
    for prediction. 3.1.3 Removal of duplicate values Removal of duplicate values
    is one of the most important steps in the data preprocessing phase. The duplicate
    values are the values that are repeated throughout the dataset. These values degrade
    the training performance, and the time complexity in training increases, resulting
    in poor performance. The duplicate values are removed through the data de-duplication33
    technique to end this. The de-duplication technique only enriches the data with
    the needed values, thereby improving the training efficiency as well as the storage
    capability of the cloud systems. 3.2 Prediction After preprocessing, the data
    are directly subjected to the prediction phase, where the appropriate crops are
    predicted for planting based on the values of input parameters. For predicting
    the suitable seed for cultivation, the temperature range of the area, soil pH,
    amount of rainfall in that area and the humidity value are considered. In this
    work, the prediction is put forth using three different classifiers such as the
    DT classifier, the RF classifier, and the SVM. The performance of these classifiers
    is analyzed for crop recommendation, and the best classifier is identified based
    on the implementation outcomes. 3.2.1 Decision tree classifier The DT classifier26
    is an ML model that constructs a tree structure to make predictions based on the
    input attributes. This model is faster in computations and can provide accurate
    results for databases of any size. The DT classifier model for crop recommendation
    is depicted in Figure 4. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A DT classifier
    model for crop recommendation DT is a classifier in the form of a tree structure
    which performs purity classification by providing results either in 0 or 1. It
    is a classic data mining algorithm that performs decision-making and classification
    in tree format. It is a simple, highly interpretable and intuitive model. During
    decision making process, the root node splits into leaf nodes based on the available
    attributes. The judgment related to the quality of leaf nodes is confirmed by
    determining the Gini index. It evaluates the probability for each node, and if
    the identified values are small, then the sample is wrongly classified, and the
    large Gini index probability samples are correctly classified. The mathematical
    formulation for evaluation of the probability is defined in Equation (1) (1) The
    probability of a randomly selected sample from a category n is represented as
    a. The conditions for the input attributes are constructed as leaf nodes, and
    the destination nodes represent the class labels for the input data. The conditions
    for the input values are set for modeling a decision tree for crop recommendation.
    The data values obeying the conditions are categorized into one label, and the
    other is categorized under the next label. This model traverses the tree from
    the top node to the bottom node, and the input data are labeled based on the conditions
    defined. After preprocessing, the collected sensor information is provided to
    the DT classifier for crop recommendation. The instances or the records are arranged
    in the tree from root to leaf, and the final leaf nodes assign the class label
    to the input record. The model in Figure 4 shows the construction of DT to identify
    the suitable crop for cultivation. The conditions are set based on the values
    of the input parameters and the types of crops. The crops that yield maximum profit
    with a temperature range greater than 30 are chosen in the above-constructed tree.
    The appropriate pH and humidity values are analyzed to make better predictions.
    Based on the chosen values, the crop labels are assigned. Therefore, the farmer
    can input the temperature, pH, humidity, and rainfall values to identify the crop
    that can be cultivated to improve production. 3.2.2 Random forest classifier RF21
    is a popular ML-based classification algorithm that constructs several DTs to
    decide on the appropriate class label for the input data. The decision trees constructed
    are finally merged, and the best output is determined with higher accuracy. Since
    the RF classifier combines several DTs, the computation is slow but more accurate
    than the DT. This ensemble classification model constructs the training subsets
    using the bootstrap bagging technique. For the training samples with values ,
    the bagging process is done repeatedly to identify the class labels for the data
    records based on the attribute values. The training process is repeated until
    the optimal outcome is obtained. Figure 5 depicts the RF tree construction for
    crop recommendation. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint RF tree construction
    for crop recommendation The overall predictions resulting from the RF classifier
    can be given as follows: (2) where indicates the number of bagging done, is the
    maximum number of bagging, indicates the unseen sample and indicates the prediction
    done on the sample. Since many trees are constructed in RF, and all trees are
    merged finally, the influence of noise and other distortions in a particular tree
    might degrade the performance of other trees. Therefore, the standard deviation
    in prediction for all the individual trees is computed to obtain an accurate result.
    The computation for standard deviation can be demonstrated as follows: (3) The
    number of trees depends on the number of data records that are to be labeled,
    and based on the depth of the tree, the accuracy in classification is improved.
    A majority voting technique is used to identify the appropriate class label for
    the given input parameters. The final class labels of RF suggest a suitable crop
    for cultivation by satisfying all the attribute values. 3.2.3 Support vector machine
    One of the most efficient kernel based classifications that work based on statistical
    learning theory is SVM. It utilizes the kernel function to project the data from
    input space to high dimensional space, where the data can be separated into different
    classes. It is a supervised algorithm which simultaneously reduces the model complexity
    and estimation error. The preprocessed sensor information is also provided to
    the SVM classifier to predict the suitable crop. The SVM6 is an ML algorithm that
    classifies the samples based on the attributes with high accuracy. This is one
    of the most popular classifiers chosen for various classification problems. The
    block diagram for SVM is represented in Figure 6. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Basic diagram of SVM The working principle behind this classifier is
    the model constructs a decision boundary known as hyperplane to separate the positive
    from the negative examples. The hyperplane can be defined as where, x indicates
    the input sample, indicates the weight value, and b indicates the bias value.
    The SVM prediction can be formulated as a constrained optimization problem given
    as follows: (4) where indicates the Euclidean norm, the first term indicates the
    objective for the inverse measure of the margin, the second term indicates the
    training error, and the parameter indicates the trade-off between those two terms.
    The problem can be transformed into the following: (5) When the value of becomes
    optimal, a decision function is obtained for a new input vector d as given below:
    (6) The above-mentioned formula is suitable only for linear data. Therefore, to
    deal with the nonlinear data, a kernel trick is adopted to form the nonlinear
    decision boundary. The Gaussian kernel is used to generate the kernel function
    and is defined as follows: (7) where indicates the Gaussian function and indicates
    the bandwidth and . Based on the all-together approach, the SVM classifier is
    extended to classify problems with multiple classes. The three classifiers are
    trained with the collected sensor information individually to identify the best
    performing classifier in crop recommendation. Each classifier provides a single
    class label as output based on the input parameters. All four attributes are inputted
    into the classifier to identify the crop accurately for cultivation. The classifiers
    are affected by some extent of error that is reduced with the help of gradient
    computation. The Adam optimization34 is chosen to reduce the prediction error
    rate and to improve the classification accuracy. The gradient update computation
    can be defined using the following formula: (8) where denotes the parameter that
    is required to be optimized to achieve better accuracy in prediction, denotes
    the step size and it depends on the number of iterations, are the moving averages,
    and is the number chosen at random. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION This section covers
    the simulation results of the three classifiers in crop recommendation based on
    sensor information. The DT, RF, and SVM classifiers are simulated using Python
    programming, and the results are compared to identify the optimal classifier for
    prediction. The metrics chosen for evaluation and the performance analysis are
    detailed in the upcoming sections. 4.1 Dataset description The dataset is generated
    manually by collecting Maharashtra''s data and attribute values. To generate the
    dataset, 250 sensors are placed at a distance of 25 m each on the land area of
    Maharashtra. The constructed dataset provided sample data for 31 crops with four
    attributes: temperature, humidity, rainfall, and soil potential of hydrogen (pH).
    The collected dataset comprises 12,400 data samples where each crop consists of
    values on all four attributes. All the data samples in the dataset are labeled
    based on the attributes. Overall, the dataset comprises 31 samples such as cotton,
    lentil, maize, millet, moong bean, moth bean, apple, azuki beans, banana, black
    gram, chickpea, coconut, coffee, grapes, groundnut, jute, kidney bean, mango,
    muskmelon, orange, papaya, peas, pigeon pea, pomegranate, rice, rubber, sugarcane,
    tea, tomato, watermelon, and wheat. The evaluations have been performed by partitioning
    the dataset into 80–20 patterns, where 80% of the data are considered for training,
    and the remaining 20% are considered for testing. The evaluations are performed
    in a device with a 3.30 GHz Intel core processor installed with 8 GB RAM and with
    64-bit Windows operating system. The hyper-parameter tuning for the classifiers
    is presented in Table 1. TABLE 1. Hyper-parameter settings for the classifiers

    The performance of the classifiers is analyzed in terms of precision, recall,
    f1-score, and accuracy to identify the best performing classifier. The mathematical
    formulations for the performance metrics are as follows: (9) (10) (11) (12) where
    Tp indicates true positives, Tn indicates true negatives, Fp indicates false positives,
    and Fn indicates false negatives. 4.3 Performance evaluation This section presents
    the performance evaluation of the classifiers for crop recommendation. The DT,
    RF, and SVM algorithms are compared using different metrics. The DT algorithm
    can offer effective results in prediction and are faster than many other classifiers.
    But this algorithm is not suited for larger datasets and may result in computational
    complexity and inefficiencies. The RF is more suited for predictions as it can
    traverse larger datasets, but the problem identified is that the algorithm takes
    more time to yield appropriate results. The dataset samples are initially preprocessed
    to remove the duplicate and missing values and to improve the data quality. This
    step helps achieve a higher accuracy rate and improves training efficiency. After
    the preprocessing stage, the data samples are subjected to prediction, where the
    class labels are assigned to the samples based on the values of the input attributes.
    The major attributes chosen for computations are temperature, humidity, soil pH,
    and rainfall. The comparison and analysis are interpreted below: The code screenshots
    for the DT and SVM classifiers for crop recommendation are provided in Figures
    7-9. The simulated crop recommendation system is provided in Figure 10. The system
    is modeled in a way to get the input parametric values. The farmer has to enter
    these attribute values, and the prediction system suggests a suitable crop that
    can be cultivated to improve the production rate. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer

    recommendation FIGURE 9 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Crop screenshot of the
    SVM classifier for crop recommendation FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Simulated crop recommendation system The confusion matrix for the DT classifier
    is presented in Figure 11. From the figure, it is clear that the DT classifier
    provided optimal performance in predicting the suitable crop for cultivation.
    The true positive rates offered by the DT classifier are higher than the false
    positives. There are some misclassifications seen in the matrix. This is due to
    the higher number of samples present in the dataset. The DT classifier is more
    optimal with a smaller number of samples than with larger datasets. The tree structure
    in the DT classifier can accumulate a particular number of samples, and when the
    depth of the tree is increased, the accuracy of the classifier is degraded. The
    overall accuracy attained by the DT classifier in crop recommendation is 91%.
    FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint DT confusion The performance measures
    obtained through simulating the DT classifier are presented in Table 2. It can
    be seen from the values that the DT performs better and can predict the appropriate
    crop for cultivation. The classifier achieved maximum performance in predicting
    jute and pomegranate and a higher rate of precision, recall and f1-score for most
    crops. Since the input parameters of the tea crop correlated with the other crops,
    this crop has a certain range of misclassifications. For predicting the tea crop
    seed, the DT classifier provided 67% precision, 36% recall, and 47% f-measure.
    The classifier also provided optimal results in predicting the grapes and groundnut
    crops. TABLE 2. Performance values for DT classifier Crops Precision (%) Recall

    0.89 0.90 The DT classifier can read the input parameters well for most crops
    and has proven to be the best optimal performance in crop recommendation. Some
    crops can be grown in different climatic conditions and soil properties. These
    crops are difficult to be identified by the classifier as the attribute values
    are the same. The experiments showed higher similarities between tea and coffee
    as both these crops are suitable for growing in temperature. Therefore, the DT
    classifier provided various misclassifications among these crops. Similarly, black
    gram and chickpea have almost similar attribute values, and there are certain
    misclassifications among these two labels. The training and validation score comparison
    for the proposed DT classifier for crop recommendation is graphically depicted
    in Figure 12. From the graph, it is seen that the proposed model provided optimal
    classification results. The training samples obtained almost similar results compared
    to the validation samples. The gap between the two lines indicates the error rate
    in prediction. There is a certain range of error between the training and validation
    scores for the DT classifier. FIGURE 12 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Training
    and validation comparison for the DT classifier The confusion matrix for the RF
    classifier for crop recommendation is presented in Figure 13. The figure shows
    that the RF classifier is more suitable for prediction with the highest percentage
    of accuracy. Compared to the DT classifier, the RF has shown very minimum misclassifications
    and can predict the crops more accurately. The experimental results of the RF
    classifier provided an overall accuracy of 95%. The predicted true positives are
    higher than the false positives, and the classifier computed the appropriate class
    labels for the inputs. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint RF confusion
    The performance measures such as precision, recall, and f1-score values of the
    RF classifier are provided in Table 3. From the table values, it is identified
    that the RF classifier is more optimal for crop recommendation, and it is able
    to suggest a suitable crop based on the input parameters. This is due to the training
    efficiency of the classifier and the discriminative nature that helped to differentiate
    between different classes. The RF classifier uses the decision tree structure
    for prediction, and the leaf nodes in the tree structure help to decide on the
    class labels. Based on the classifier depth, the accuracy in prediction is also
    improved. When the depth of RF is increased, the classifier''s training is also
    enhanced as the classifier can learn more features for a particular class. TABLE

    values of precision (100%), recall (100%), and f1-score (100%) are obtained by
    the jute, grapes and pomegranate crops, whereas minimum values (precision = 60%,
    recall = 35%, and f1-score = 45%) are obtained by the tea crop. The classifier
    accurately identifies the crops with a certain level of uniqueness, such as the
    azuki bean, mango, tomato, groundnut and so forth. Though the classifier provided
    a better accuracy rate, some misclassifications were found in the experimentations
    when the testing samples were increased. The RF classifier can traverse the dataset
    effectively, providing optimal results on many samples. Compared to the DT classifier,
    the training time of the RF classifier is high because more trees are constructed
    in RF for classification. Also, when the data samples are increased, the RF takes
    more time for classification. The tree size is increased based on the classifier''s
    input. The training and validation score comparison for the proposed RF classifier
    for crop recommendation is graphically depicted in Figure 14. From the graph,
    it is clear that the proposed model provided optimal results in crop recommendation.
    The training and validation scores secured by the RF classifier are almost similar.
    Compared to the DT classifier, the RF model provided better values in prediction.

    for the RF classifier The confusion matrix for the SVM classifier for crop recommendation
    is presented in Figure 15. It is seen that more misclassifications among different
    crops. This is because the SVM classifier cannot differentiate the input attribute
    values for the crops. The overall accuracy in predicting suitable crops by the
    SVM classifier is only 74%. When the number of samples is increased, prediction
    accuracy is further reduced. Compared to the DT and RF classifiers, the SVM provided
    lower accuracy in prediction. Moreover, the SVM included computational complexities
    in the training time. FIGURE 15 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint SVM confusion
    The performance measures of SVM in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score are
    provided in Table 4. From the table, the maximized values of precision (99%),

    values are obtained by the moth bean crop (precision = 40%, recall = 54%, and
    f1-sore = 46%). There are several misclassifications between the wheat, moth bean,
    watermelon and tea crops, as these crops show similarities in either one of the
    four attributes. The crops classified well by the RF and DT classifiers also resulted
    in poor outcomes. TABLE 4. Performance values for the SVM classifier Crops Precision

    classifier for crop recommendation is depicted in Figure 16. For a larger sample
    size, the model provided optimal results in prediction. Though the model reduced
    the over-fitting problems for larger datasets, many misclassifications exist among
    different classes. Since the sample sizes are large, the boundaries are also huge,
    and the model cannot predict the optimal class label in some predictions. Therefore,
    the SVM classifier is found to be unsuitable for crop recommendation based on
    data mining. FIGURE 16 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Training and validation
    comparison for the SVM classifier 4.4 Discussion The overall experimentations
    suggest that the ML models are able to handle the huge number of data samples
    more efficiently than the other algorithms. The RF classifier is more effective
    in the recommendation among the implemented ML models. Though the running time
    of the RF is high, the classification accuracy is better than the other considered
    ML models. Among the crops, jute, pomegranate, and grapes achieved the maximum
    classification rate compared to the other crops. The experiments suggest that
    if the input data are discriminative, the results in prediction are high, and
    if more than 2 attributes are similar, there are some misclassifications. More
    experimental studies still need to be performed with huge datasets or big data
    to identify the most effective classifier. The experiments performed with the
    DT classifier provided maximized accuracy in classifying the jute, pomegranate
    and grapes crops, whereas minimum performance is provided for the classification
    of tea and coffee crops. The overall accuracy of the DT classifier is 91%, whereas
    the RF and SVM classification accuracy is 95% and 74%, respectively. Based on
    the sensor information collected from the state of Maharashtra, it is seen that
    the crops like jute, pomegranate and grapes are mostly suggested for cultivation.
    Almost all three classifiers provided optimal results for these three crops. Therefore,
    it can be suggested that these crops can be chosen for cultivation and can be
    given more importance than the other crops. The wheat crop is the major food crop
    in Maharashtra, but there are slight misclassifications in predicting the optimal
    attribute values for this crop. Therefore, using the classifier to start wheat
    cultivation is better for attaining high profits and production rates. 5 CONCLUSION
    Recommending suitable crops to the farmers concerning different factors affecting
    crop growth helps improve the production rate and the country''s economy. Several
    ML models are also available to predict the appropriate crop, but the most optimal
    one needs to be identified. Therefore, the performance of three popular ML models
    is tested with the dataset collected using sensors. Totally, 250 sensors are used
    in this work to collect the different attribute values of 31 common crops in Maharashtra.
    All the samples after preprocessing are provided as inputs to the three classifiers
    separately to evaluate the performance. The experimental outcomes proved that
    the RF classifier is the most optimal for predicting the suitable crop based on
    the input parameters. The limitations identified in the other models are that
    both models are unsuitable for larger datasets. The tree structure of DT can accommodate
    only a particular number of samples for better predictions. Also, more evaluations
    are required to effectively interpret the outcomes of SVM. Other than just predicting
    the suitable crop for cultivation, the prediction model can also be applied to
    suggest pest control techniques to the farmer to improve the yield rate. In the
    future, we aim to build a reliable crop recommendation model that integrates ML
    and data mining to suggest suitable crops for cultivation based on different parameters.
    Also, we aim to evaluate the model in all aspects to provide detailed interpretations.

  description: Agriculture is the cultivation of the soil, the growth of crops and
    the raising of livestock. Agriculture is critical to the economic development
    of a country. Farming generates nearly 58% of a country's primary income. Previously,
    cultivators had accepted conventional farming practices. Because these methods
    were imprecise, they produced less and took longer time. Precise farming boosts
    productivity by precisely determining which steps must be completed at what time.
    Precision farming entails forecasting the weather, analyzing soil, recommending
    crops for cultivation and calculating the amount of fertilizer and pesticides
    that must be used. Precise farming uses advanced technologies such as IoT, data
    mining, data analytics, and machine learning (ML) to collect data, train systems
    and predict outcomes. Precision farming employs technology to reduce manual labor
    and boost productivity. Farmers have recently faced several difficulties, such
    as crop failure due to insufficient rainfall, soil infertility and so on. The
    proposed work in determining the soil, managing crops and harvesting efficiently
    can solve the problems caused by environmental changes. It guides a person's farming
    strategy to produce better results through a proper prediction process. The goal
    of this research is to assist an individual in efficiently cultivating crops,
    resulting in high productivity at a low cost. It also assists in estimating the
    total cost of cultivation and forecasting the likely economic barriers. This would
    help a person plan activities prior to cultivation, resulting in an integrated
    farming solution.

  description: 'The evaluation and modeling of the water infiltration rate into the
    soil are important to all aspects of water resources management and the design

    water infiltration needs to be created to estimate water depth under different
    tillage practices. Thus, the present research investigated the impacts of different
    tillage practices, including plow type (three tillage systems: moldboard, disk,
    and rotary plows), tillage depth (100 and 200 mm) and four soil compactions levels
    (0, 1, 3, and 5 tractor wheel passes), on cumulative infiltration behavior in
    a clay soil under a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring
    infiltration experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research
    was conducted in three different stages. The first stage was performed through
    a field test to obtain infiltration data, the second stage involved using a Kostiakov
    empirical equation (Z = q × tb) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting
    parameters of “q” and “b”, and in the last stage, we predicted the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil
    compaction levels by applying regression data mining approaches in Weka 3.8 software.
    The results show that the effects of relevant factors on the cumulative water
    infiltration depth of the soil could be statistically significant (p < 0.05).
    The Kostiakov model, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.939, had
    a good fitting effect on the cumulative water infiltration depth process of the
    investigated soil. The average, lowest, and maximum values of the “q” parameter
    were 2.7073, 2.2724, and 3.1277 mm/minb, respectively, while for the “b” parameter,
    they were 0.5523, 0.5424, and 0.5647, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation
    of several regression data mining approaches determined that the KStar (K*) data
    mining approach, with a root mean square error of 0.0228 mm/minb, a mean absolute
    error of 0.0179 mm/minb, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997, was the most
    accurate method for fitting parameter “q” using the testing dataset. The most
    accurate method for fitting the parameter “b” estimation was determined to be
    the Multilayer Perceptron method, with a root mean square error of 0.0026, a mean
    absolute error of 0.0013, and a correlation coefficient of 0.962, using the testing
    dataset. Therefore, this research, which consisted of in situ field observation
    experiments and infiltration modeling of the infiltration process in a clay soil,
    provides an essential theoretical basis for improving models of the rate of cumulative
    infiltration. Moreover, the proposed methodology could be employed for simulation
    of the fitting parameters “q” and “b” for soil water cumulative infiltration processes,
    not only for irrigation management purposes under regular crop production conditions,
    but also for the selection of the most suitable tillage practices to modify the
    soil during the agriculture season to conserve water and prevent yield declines.
    The results support the understanding of the infiltration processes in a clay
    soil and demonstrate that tillage practices could reduce the water infiltration
    rate into the soil.'

    The evaluation and modeling of the water infiltration rate into the soil are important
    to all aspects of water resources management and the design of irrigation systems
    for agricultural purposes. However, research focused on experimental studies of
    infiltration rates in clay soils under different tillage practices remains minimal.
    Therefore, an empirical prediction model for cumulative water infiltration needs
    to be created to estimate water depth under different tillage practices. Thus,
    the present research investigated the impacts of different tillage practices,
    including plow type (three tillage systems: moldboard, disk, and rotary plows),
    tillage depth (100 and 200 mm) and four soil compactions levels (0, 1, 3, and
    5 tractor wheel passes), on cumulative infiltration behavior in a clay soil under
    a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring infiltration
    experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research was conducted
    in three different stages. The first stage was performed through a field test
    to obtain infiltration data, the second stage involved using a Kostiakov empirical
    equation (Z = q × tb) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b”, and in the last stage, we predicted the fitting parameters of
    “q” and “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil compaction
    levels by applying regression data mining approaches in Weka 3.8 software. The
    results show that the effects of relevant factors on the cumulative water infiltration
    depth of the soil could be statistically significant (p < 0.05). The Kostiakov
    model, with an average coefficient of determination of 0.939, had a good fitting
    effect on the cumulative water infiltration depth process of the investigated
    soil. The average, lowest, and maximum values of the “q” parameter were 2.7073,
    2.2724, and 3.1277 mm/minb, respectively, while for the “b” parameter, they were
    0.5523, 0.5424, and 0.5647, respectively. Furthermore, the evaluation of several
    regression data mining approaches determined that the KStar (K*) data mining approach,
    with a root mean square error of 0.0228 mm/minb, a mean absolute error of 0.0179
    mm/minb, and a correlation coefficient of 0.997, was the most accurate method
    for fitting parameter “q” using the testing dataset. The most accurate method
    for fitting the parameter “b” estimation was determined to be the Multilayer Perceptron
    method, with a root mean square error of 0.0026, a mean absolute error of 0.0013,
    and a correlation coefficient of 0.962, using the testing dataset. Therefore,
    this research, which consisted of in situ field observation experiments and infiltration
    modeling of the infiltration process in a clay soil, provides an essential theoretical
    basis for improving models of the rate of cumulative infiltration. Moreover, the
    proposed methodology could be employed for simulation of the fitting parameters
    “q” and “b” for soil water cumulative infiltration processes, not only for irrigation
    management purposes under regular crop production conditions, but also for the
    selection of the most suitable tillage practices to modify the soil during the
    agriculture season to conserve water and prevent yield declines. The results support
    the understanding of the infiltration processes in a clay soil and demonstrate
    that tillage practices could reduce the water infiltration rate into the soil.

    1. Introduction The infiltration process, which is crucial for designing irrigation
    and drainage systems, evaluating groundwater recharge and contamination, managing
    floods and droughts, etc., is frequently influenced by a number of variables,
    with soil use, soil cover, and soil physical characteristics being the main ones
    [1]. Hydrologists and water managers face a major challenge because of the considerable
    spatial variability that these factors cause in the infiltration process. Therefore,
    the soil infiltration water characteristics under various tillage practices for
    soil preparation for crop output must be defined. These characteristics are crucial
    for the construction of irrigation systems [2]. Due to the impact of soil use
    variation on the spatial changeability of infiltration parameters, numerous trials
    and theoretical investigations have been performed that aim to understand the
    links between infiltration processes and various agricultural management practices,
    in particular tillage operations [3] as they alter soil structure by creating
    macrospores that significantly affect the water infiltration rate into soil [4,5,6,7].
    The most serious environmental challenge resulting from modern agriculture is
    thought to be soil compaction. Wheeled farm equipment handles the majority of
    the typical tasks involved in conventional agriculture. The weight of the tractor
    and the attached machinery compacts the soil during these activities [5]. Numerous
    research papers have examined the impacts of soil management procedures like soil
    compaction and tillage on the characteristics of water infiltration into soil
    [3,8]. Soil compaction reduces pore space, creating a dense soil with poor internal
    drainage and decreased aeration, which increases soil strength and impedes root
    development in particular [5]. Furthermore, increasing tillage depth from 150
    to 450 mm showed increases in cumulative infiltration, indicating that tillage
    depth has an observable impact on the water cumulative infiltration in a soil
    [7]. The rate of water infiltration into the soil also rises as tillage depth
    increases [9]. Furthermore, the effects of diverse soil use and agricultural management
    procedures on the water infiltration into the soil have been examined, showing
    the substantial influence of soil use modification [10]. The effectiveness of
    irrigation methods and water use efficiency is directly impacted by estimations
    of the infiltration characteristics of the soil. The most suitable approach for
    calculating experimental infiltration models parameters can change in the same
    soil owing to the difficulty in determining parameters without in situ experiments
    [11,12]. To determine water infiltration into the soil, a number of empirical
    models have been developed. The water infiltration into the soil can be given
    as a function of infiltration time and other empirical constants. Kostiakov, modified
    Kostiakov, and Horton [13] are the empirical models most commonly used in infiltration
    data analysis. However, due to its variability within the field, predicting water
    infiltration into the soil is a major challenge. A suitable empirical model is
    required to establish the model’s parameters created on the properties of a limited
    soil [14]. Thus, an innovative model needs to be developed to make better decisions
    and allow irrigation engineers to study the different impacts of tillage practices
    on accumulated water depth in the field. Additionally, determining the amount
    of infiltration is essential for estimating the extra water required for irrigation
    and determining whether water is available for crop development [15]. Additionally,
    the water infiltration rate into soil is a crucial measure of irrigation and drainage
    effectiveness, improved plant water accessibility, increased yields, decreased
    erosion, and water wastage [16]. As a result, irrigation researchers have given
    the study of the infiltration process much focus [17,18]. Equally, numerous approaches
    have been developed to identify model parameters for various soil situations [14].
    For instance, the water cumulative infiltration (Z, mm) and infiltration time
    values (t) were subjected to a nonlinear regression examination ( Z=q× t b ) to
    identify parameters “q” and “b” in the Kostiakov model [14]. According to convention,
    the parameter of “b” is higher than zero but less than one [19], “b” indicates
    the constancy of the soil’s structure, and “q” is a measure of the soil’s initial
    rate of water infiltration and soil structural conditions [20]. Additionally,
    Elmarazky et al. [21] established a model with R2 values of 0.902 and 0.765 to
    obtain the “k” and “u” parameters, respectively, of the Kostiakov equation (I=k×
    t u ) for infiltration rate (I) in units of mm/h, employing the multiple linear
    regression (MLR) method. In their model, the soil mean weight diameter, the number
    of tractor wheel passes on the surface of the plowed soil, and the tillage depth
    were used as inputs. Hossne García et al. [22] conducted field experiments to
    study the effects of wetness, soil depth, and compaction on infiltration rate
    (mm/h) and employed the Kostiakov equation (I=k× t u ) for infiltration rate (I)
    in units of mm/h to acquire the Kostiakov fitting parameters “k” and “u”. They
    then employed the MLR method to model these two fitting parameters. Al-Sulaiman
    et al. [23] employed MLR to formulate the Kostiakov parameters “q” and “b” for
    water cumulative infiltration of the Kostiakov model. In their MLR model, the
    water electric conductivity, soil texture index, initial soil bulk density, soil
    sodium adsorption ratio, initial soil moisture content, soil electric conductivity,
    water sodium adsorption ratio, and organic matter percentage in the soil were
    used as inputs. Although some prior research on cumulative infiltration modeling
    using data mining algorithms has been conducted [24,25], no research has focused
    on developing models for infiltration model parameters, despite the fact that
    these parameters are crucial for appraising the performance behavior of soil water
    infiltration models [26]. Artificial neural networks have been used (ANN) to predict
    water infiltration [13,24,25,27,28]. Some researchers applied machine-learning
    tools to predict infiltration rates [24,25,28,29,30,31,32,33]. Others employed
    the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) to model soil water infiltration
    [24,28,34]. In order to estimate the amount of infiltrated water in the furrow
    irrigation method, Sayari et al. [35] proposed five common artificial intelligence
    models, including ANN, ANFIS, MLR, Group Method of Data Handling, and Support
    Vector Regression. Data for evaluating these artificial intelligence models were
    collected from field tests and the available literature. The advance time at the
    end of the furrow, inflow rate, furrow length, cross-sectional area of inflow,
    and infiltration opportunity time were used as the input factors in the simulation.
    Evaluation and modeling of water infiltration rate into the soil are important
    to all aspects of water resources management and the design of irrigation systems
    for agricultural purposes. On the other hand, research focused on experimental
    studies of infiltration rates in clay soils under different tillage practices
    remains minimal. Therefore, this research was conducted in three stages. The goal
    of the first stage was to conduct an experimental study investigating the impacts
    of the number of tractor wheel passes on clay soil in three tillage systems (moldboard,
    chisel, and rotary plows) under two tillage depths on the cumulative infiltration
    depth. Additionally, in the second stage of the research, the infiltration parameters
    of the clay soil were determined and assessed using Kostiakov’s cumulative infiltration
    model ( Z=q× t b ). In addition, the aim of the third stage of the research was
    to test the efficacy of several data mining approaches for predicting the parameters
    of “q” and “b”, utilizing experimental field data for a clay soil. Accurate “q”
    and “b” predictions are crucial and would undoubtedly assist irrigation engineers
    to design irrigation and drainage systems, etc. The eight regression algorithms
    (M5Rules, Additive Regression, KStar (K*), SMOreg, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP),
    Linear Regression (LR), and Gaussian Processes) within the Waikato Environment
    for Knowledge Analysis (Weka) 3.8 software were employed to predict the parameters
    “q” and “b”. 2. Materials and Methods The present research investigated the impacts
    of different tillage practices, including plow type (three tillage systems, moldboard,
    disk, and rotary plows), tillage depth (100 and 200 mm), and four soil compactions
    levels (0, 1, 3, and 5 of tractor wheel passes) on cumulative infiltration behavior
    in a clay soil under a randomized complete design with three replications. Double-ring
    infiltration experiments were conducted to collect infiltration data. The research
    consisted of three different stages. The first stage was a field test to obtain
    infiltration data, the second involved the application of the Kostiakov empirical
    equation ( Z=q× t b ) for cumulative infiltration to acquire the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b”, where Z is cumulative infiltration (mm), and t is infiltration
    time. The last stage involved prediction of the fitting parameters of “q” and
    “b” based on soil mean weight diameter, tillage depth, and four soil compactions
    levels by applying regression data mining approaches in Weka 3.8 software. The
    procedures employed have been reported previously in [21,22]. However, the details
    of the procedures in this research are discussed below. 2.1. Procedures of the
    First Stage of the Research (the Experimental Work) The infiltration experiments
    were located at the Rice Mechanization Center’s Research Farm in Meet El Deeba,
    Kafr El-Sheikh, Egypt (longitude: 30°51′17.6″ E and latitude: 31°06′59.3″ N),
    and the soil water infiltration trials were carried out in a clay field. Four
    soil samples were collected from a nearby location and used to analyze the characteristics
    of the soil. The average percentage sand, silt, and clay contents at the experimental
    site for two soil depths can be seen in Figure 1. The soil bulk density was observed
    at two soil depths (0–150 mm and 150–300 mm), with values of 1.12 and 1.21 g/cm3,
    respectively. The experiments were conducted on an area of 0.405 ha. Water was
    applied to the test area, and it was then permitted to dry out until the soil
    moisture content was between 15% and 19% db. Figure 1. Average percentage of silt,
    clay, and sand content at the experimental location for two soil depths. In this
    research, various tillage practices were investigated. Three distinct tillage
    methods—moldboard, chisel, and rotary plows—were used for soil tillage. These
    were applied in order to obtain various levels of soil aggregation as indicated
    by the mean weight diameter (MWD) of the soil. Furthermore, two tillage depths
    were applied during soil tillage. The tractor wheels passed on the plowed soil
    surface to apply four levels of compaction (soil compaction level-0, soil compaction
    level-1, soil compaction level-3, and soil compaction level-5). The specifications
    of the tillage implement used in the experiments are provided by Elmarazky et
    al. [21]. However, the three treatments were established statistically in a randomized
    complete design with three replications. The levels of soil compaction were applied
    by driving an agricultural tractor with mass of 4840 kg (without any implement
    behind it) over the plowed soil surface with a forward speed of 4.5 km/h. Two
    tillage depths were applied in the range of 100–200 mm. The plots in the experimental
    site had an area of 30 m × 2.5 m. To avoid overlapping among treated plots, a
    1 m spacing between the treated plots was retained as a buffer. Five kg soil samples
    were collected along three arbitrarily chosen transects of each plot at different
    tillage depths, after both the tillage and traffic treatments. After air-drying
    of the samples, they were sieved with standard sieves to determine the defined
    size distribution of soil aggregates [36]. The product of the aggregate diameters
    in each sieve size and the proportionate weight of soil aggregate in that sieve
    size were added to define the soil mean weight diameter (MWD) [37] as follows:
    MWD= ∑ n i=1 X i × W i (1) where Xi is the average diameter of the aggregate class
    (mm), n is number of sieves, and Wi is the proportion of each aggregate class
    in relation to the total aggregate weight. 2.2. Double-Ring Infiltration Experiments
    Infiltration rates were observed using a cylindrical infiltrometer. The cylindrical
    infiltrometer (double-ring infiltrometer) had two rings with a length of 450 mm
    and the inner diameter was 300 mm for each ring. The two rings were inserted into
    the soil to a depth of around 70 mm using a rubber hammer with a weight which
    hit a wooden board attached to ring wall consistently without disturbing the soil
    surface. The two rings were filled with water to an equivalent depth, and the
    opening reading of the water level was observed. The experimental water used to
    measure the soil water infiltration rate was similar to that used for irrigating
    purposes in the site. A fixed 200 mm head of water was kept in each loop and the
    infiltration measurements were noted and documented for five minutes. Readings
    were made at regular time intervals for 3 h (180 min). The soil water infiltration
    rate was then calculated from the collected infiltration data and infiltration
    time to obtain the rate of infiltration in units of mm/h, and then the water cumulative
    infiltration depth (Z, mm) was calculated. 2.3. Determination of Kostiakov Equation
    Fitting Parameters for Cumulative Infiltration (the Second Stage of the Research)
    In most water infiltration experiments, the most generally employed empirical
    model is the Kostiakov model, which has a few simple calculations [17]. Kostiakov
    [38] presented his model early for determining the water cumulative infiltration
    depth as follows: Z= q×t b (2) where Z is the water cumulative infiltration depth
    (mm) at time interval t (minutes) and “q” is fitting constant called the soil
    infiltration coefficient (mm/minb), and “b” is the experimental fitting constant
    called the infiltration index constant (dimensionless). However, “q” and “b” are
    fitting parameters that are site-specific and depend on soil conditions such as
    soil bulk density, soil texture, soil moisture content, and other soil properties
    [39]. As the Kostiakov infiltration equation is empirical, no physical implications
    are involved in its related fitting parameters [40]. Using logarithmic transformation
    [41] and field experimental data, the Kostiakov equation’s linearized pattern
    was employed. Using this traditional method, which is called a graphical method,
    the fitting parameters of “q” and “b” in the Kostiakov model (Equation (2)) were
    determined by fitting a regression line to a plot curve of ln (Z) against ln (t).
    The intercept of the best-fit regression line on the ordinate axis then signifies
    the value of ln (q) and its slope is equivalent to “b” [26], where “q” and “b”
    are the Kostiakov model parameters such that “q” is greater than 0, while ”b”
    is greater than 0 and less than 1 [19]. In the present research, 42 observations
    for “q” and “b” were determined from the field experiment infiltration data with
    a high coefficient of determination (R2 was greater than 0.938). Figure 2 shows
    the steps in the research methodology for obtaining the fitting parameters “q”
    and “b”. Figure 2. Steps of the research methodology used to obtain the parameters
    “q” and “b” (adopted from [42]). 2.4. Statistical Analysis The effects of various
    tillage implements, levels of soil compaction, and tillage depth on MWD and fitting
    parameters “q” and “b” were assessed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) table in
    three ways, for a randomized complete design with three replicates using SAS [43].
    Mean values were compared using the least significant differences (LSD) at a significance
    level of 0.05. 2.5. Procedures of the Third Stage of the Research (Data Mining
    Algorithms) This research employs the open source tool Weka 3.8, software written
    in Java (3.6.14 version) [44], to develop different computational models, which
    apply diverse regression techniques. Weka 3.8 software [45] is a fit-maintained
    computational method that includes a set of well-organized regression or classification
    algorithms that produce good outcomes in several fields. In this research, the
    regression tools inside Weka 3.8 software were utilized to predict the Kostiakov
    model parameters for cumulative infiltration, “q” and “b” (Equation (2)). The
    inputs included: MWD, ranging from 9.2 to 80.2 mm; the amount of tractor wheel
    traffic on the plowed soil surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes;
    and the tillage depth, ranging from 97 to 204 mm. The outputs were “q” and “b”.
    Weka provides ready-to-use tools in a range of machine learning procedures suitable
    for solving numerous data mining tasks. To achieve our goal, we relied on the
    field results for “q” and “b”. Weka has a simple and free-to-use graphical window
    to compare the outcomes of the different regression algorithms [46]. In the learning
    stage, a regression equation is created from the learning cases nominated by Weka.
    Table 1 provides short explanations of each of the regression algorithms used,
    for different classes, as initially defined by Weka [47]. Figure 3 depicts a flowchart
    for modeling “q” and “b” using the Weka software. WEKA was directed to select
    66% of the data as the training dataset (28 points) and the remaining data were
    used for testing purposes (14 points). Figure 3. Flowchart for modeling of “q”
    and “b” in Equation (2) using Weka software. Table 1. Descriptions of Weka regression
    algorithms. The MLR method is employed to examine the linear relationship between
    one dependent factor and two or more independent factors [51]. However, this method
    in Weka is called linear regression (LR). In this research, the Kostiakov model
    parameters for water cumulative infiltration, “q” and “b”, as shown in Equation
    (2), were modeled using MLR based on MWD, tillage depth, and the number of tractor
    wheel passes on the plowed soil surface as inputs. MLR was completed using Weka
    software to obtain the regression constants ( ∝ 0 , ∝ 1 , ∝ 2 , and ∝ 3 ) in Equation
    (3) with the following relation: q or b= ∝ 0 + ∝ 1 × MWD+ ∝ 2 × NTT+ ∝ 3 × TD
    (3) where MWD is the soil weight mean diameter, NTT is the number of tractor wheel
    passes on the plowed soil surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes,
    and TD is the tillage depth. Weka implements ridge regression and utilizes the
    standard least-squares linear regression method to obtain regression constants
    [52]. However, ridge regression is employed to solve difficulties that are not
    well displayed, which is significant when they have a poor chance of being resolved
    by a stable algorithm [53]. During the application of Weka regression algorithms,
    no attribute selection measure is required to accomplish the linear regression.
    Furthermore, in Weka, an artificial neural network called Multilayer Perceptron
    (MLP) is utilized. MLP is one of the most well-known data-driven technologies
    and is stimulated by the operations of the nervous system and brain [54]. It is
    based on a feed-forward ANN. It consists of one input layer, one or more hidden
    layers, and one output layer. However, each layer is composed of several neurons
    and the likely connection between these layers denotes the link between the nodes.
    The input layer, which contains neurons equivalent to the total number of the
    input parameters, allocates the data displayed on the network and does not assist
    in the processing operation. This layer tracks one or more hidden layers that
    support data processing. The output layer is the final layer, which provides the
    final output. When the input layer is exposed to the value of inputs passing through
    the link between the neurons, these values are multiplied by the equivalent weight
    and aggregated to obtain the net output (Zj) of the unit as follows: Z j =∑ W
    ij × y i (4) where Wij is the weight of the link from unit i to j, yi is the input
    value at the input layer, and Zj is the output obtained by the transfer function
    to yield an output for unit j. Haykin [54] has provided a detailed discussion
    about ANN. In the current research, a three-layer feed-forward ANN based on the
    back propagation algorithm was employed, which is the default in Weka 3.8 software.
    2.6. Statistical Criteria for Evaluation of Regression Data Mining Algorithms
    A model trained on a training set can be assessed using multiple statistical approaches
    comparing the predictions with the real values in the testing dataset. The root
    mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are some of these statistical
    criteria. Since it measures how closely the data match the fits regression line,
    the correlation coefficient or coefficient of determination (R2) is also used
    to compare the predictions with the real values in the testing dataset. In addition,
    R2 is a statistical procedure that identifies the proportion of a component’s
    variability that can be caused or explained by its relationship to another factor.
    The chosen metrics are the most well-known and widely applied success metrics
    [55]. The statistical criteria are computed as follows: RMSE= ∑ N i=1 ( P i −
    O i ) 2 N − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ (5) MAE= ∑ N i=1 |( P i − O i )| N (6) In
    Equation (5), Pi and Oi are the predicted and calculated “q” or “b” values, respectively,
    and N is the total number of readings. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Data Analysis
    of the First Stage of the Research (the Experimental Work) for Soil Mean Weight
    Diameter Water infiltrates rapidly into granular soils but very slowly into massive
    and compact soils, suggesting that tillage practices can alter the soil structure
    and thereby alter the infiltration rate [56]. Moreover, soil with large particle
    sizes has a high infiltration rate [57,58]. Figure 4 shows how the typical MWD
    varied for rotary, moldboard, and chisel plows under different treatments. It
    was observed that MWD in the moldboard plow plots was in the range of 34.5 mm
    to 80.2 mm, and in the chisel plow plots, it was in the range of 19.6 mm to 45.7
    mm, while it was in the range of 9.2 mm to 21.5 mm for the rotary plow plots.
    A summary of the ANOVA analysis demonstrating the effects of tillage implements,
    number of wheel passes and tillage depth and their interactions on mean weight
    diameter is shown in Table 2. The tillage implements, soil compaction level (number
    of wheel traffic passes) and tillage depth had significant effects (p < 0.05)
    on MWD. The average MWD for the moldboard plow treatment had the greatest value
    at 57.86 mm, while the average MWD for the chisel and rotary plot treatments had
    lower values of 32.98 mm and 15.50 mm, respectively (Table 3). Compared with other
    plowing implements, the moldboard plow created larger clods; thus, it had a greater
    MWD value than the other tillage implements. However, moldboard plowing can destroy
    the pore permanency and aggregate constancy, causing remains mobilization, erosion,
    and surface strengthening [59]. Similarly, Khadr [60] showed that a significant
    effect on MWD was seen when using tillage implements. Their MWD values in a clay
    soil were 71.98, 44.49 and 23.97 mm for moldboard, chisel, and disk harrow plows,
    respectively. In addition, the MWD values were higher under a tillage system consisting
    of a moldboard plow plus disk plow than under a chisel plow plus disk plow system
    [61]. However, Çarman [62] claimed that a moldboard plow created a higher MWD
    than a rotary tiller plow, heavy globe disk plow, and stubble cultivator plow.
    Furthermore, a moldboard plow yielded the highest MWD (34.78 and 10.05 mm), whereas
    a chisel plow yielded the lowest MWD (17.16 and 6.08 mm) when the plowing process
    was conducting on a loam soil at different plowing speed and the tillage depth
    was 200 mm [63]. Carter [64] observed that chisel plow aggregates were larger
    than moldboard plow aggregates. Figure 4. Variation in average soil MWD under
    investigated tillage practices treatments for rotary, chisel, and moldboard plows
    (D1 represents a tillage depth of 100 mm and D2 represents a tillage depth of
    200 mm). Table 2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) table of the MWD (TI indicates
    tillage implement, NTT indicates the number of tractor wheel traffic passes on
    the plowed soil surface, and TD indicates the tillage depth). Table 3. Mean values
    and least significance difference (LSD) for the MWD as impacted by tillage implement,
    soil compaction level, and tillage depth (Means significantly different if they
    are followed by a distinct letter). Tillage depth significantly affected the soil
    aggregate mean weight diameter values. As seen in Table 3, tillage depth increased,
    and MWD decreased. Naseer et al. [65] reported that an increase in tillage depth
    from 100 mm to 200 mm, increased MWD by 9.01% after plowing by primary tillage
    implements. Similarly, increasing tillage depth from 100 to 150 and to 200 mm
    produced significant increases in MWD of 7.37% and 7.86%, respectively, after
    plowing with a chisel plow in a silty clay loam soil. In addition, increasing
    the tillage depth led to increased values of MWD [66]. Additionally, the maximum
    MWD was observed at tillage depths of 200–300 mm and the minimum at tillage depths
    of 100–200 mm [67]. As the compaction level increased, the MWD values decreased.
    With no compaction (soil compaction level-0), the MWD was 47.84 mm; for one pass
    of wheel traffic (soil compaction level-1), the MWD was 40.67 mm; for three passes
    (soil compaction level-3), the MWD was 30.52 mm; and for five passes (soil compaction
    level-5), the MWD was 22.76 mm (Table 3). These findings are in agreement with
    those of Ramezani et al. [67], who observed that the control treatment had the
    highest MWD and eight-wheel tractor traffic had the lowest MWD for loam, sandy
    and sandy loam soils. Higher traffic levels of agricultural machinery may lead
    to the creation of smaller aggregates, particularly under dry soil conditions
    [68]. Furthermore, after a single-pass tillage operation with a rotavator plow
    in a sandy loam soil, it was found to be 4.9 mm, and it was 14.54 mm for a moldboard
    plow [69]. 3.2. Data Analysis of the Second Stage of the Research (Water Cumulative
    Infiltration Depths) The observed cumulative infiltration depths versus time for
    the moldboard, chisel and rotary plows are presented in Figure 5, Figure 6 and
    Figure 7, respectively, under tillage practices with two tillage depths and under
    different soil compaction levels. Observing Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7, it
    is clear that the cumulative infiltration generally increases with increasing
    infiltration time, and it can be expressed as a power function. Figure 8, Figure
    9 and Figure 10 present the impact of tillage depth on final cumulative infiltration
    after 180 min at altered levels of wheel traffic for moldboard, chisel, and rotary
    plows as average values, respectively. It is noticeable that the water cumulative
    infiltration depth varied between 46.0 and 54.0 mm after 180 min for the moldboard
    plow. It varied between 37.9 and 48.0 mm after 180 min for the chisel plow, while
    for the rotary plow, the cumulative infiltration depth varied between 36.4 and
    44.5 mm after 180 min. Water infiltration into the soil is claimed to be directly
    affected by soil tillage methods [70], and the moldboard plow plot in this research
    had the ability to take in water at a faster rate than the chisel and rotary plowed
    plots. This could also be due to the porous nature of the moldboard plow plots
    and because the soil is coarser than in plots plowed by other tillage implements.
    The MWD in the moldboard plow plot ranged from 34.5 mm to 80.2 mm; for the chisel
    plow it ranged from 19.6 mm to 45.7 mm; and for the rotary plow, it ranged from
    9.2 mm to 21.5 mm. Generally, primary tillage tends to yield a rough surface finish
    [71,72]. Plowing processes conducted at different tilling depths and wheel-traffic
    compaction alter the pore structure of the clay soil [73], and these modifications
    affect solutes, water movement, and root growth. In a study conducted by Al-Ghazal
    [74], it was discovered that the chisel plow, followed by the moldboard plow and
    the rotavator, had the highest mean infiltration rate of soil at the highest rate
    of compaction (5 passes of the tractor). The additional soil disturbance caused
    by the chisel plow as compared to moldboard and rotavator plows may be the cause
    of the higher soil infiltration rate. Figure 5. Field measurements of cumulative
    infiltration depths for moldboard plow tillage with two tillage depths and under
    different soil compaction levels. Figure 6. Field measurements of cumulative infiltration
    depths for chisel plow tillage with two tillage depths and under different soil

    Kostiakov Fitting Parameters Table 4, Table 5 and Table 6 show the raw data of
    fitting parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2) as affected by the number of tractor
    wheel passes on the plowed soil surface and the tillage depth for the moldboard,
    chisel, and rotary plows, respectively. Both the estimated Kostiakov fitting parameters,
    “q” and “b”, obtained by the best fit of measured data differed significantly
    among the tillage implements (Table 7). Similar results were observed by Mbagwu
    [75], who reported that the predicted model parameters, “q” and “b”, of the Kostiakov
    model obtained by the best fit of measured data differed significantly among treatments
    that included tilled-unmulched, tilled-mulched, untilled-unmulched, untilled-mulched,
    and continuous pasture. Also, differences cause by wheel traffic were detected
    in “q” (Table 7). Conversely, there were no significant differences for tillage
    depth and wheel traffic in “b” and “q” (Table 7). Table 8 presents the mean fitting
    parameters (Equation (2) as affected by tillage implement, number of wheel traffic
    passes (soil compaction level), and tillage depth and their interactions. Table

    number of tractor wheel passes on the plowed soil surface and the tillage depth

    parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2) as affected by the number of tractor wheel
    passes on the plowed soil surface and the tillage depth for the rotary plow. Table
    7. Source of variation, degrees of freedom (DF) and probability (p-values) from
    ANOVA table for e fitting parameters “q” and “b” in Equation (2). Table 8. Mean
    fitting parameters (Equation (2)), as affected by tillage implements, number of
    wheel passes (soil compaction level) and tillage depths, and least significance
    difference (LSD) (Means are significantly different if they are followed by a
    distinct letter). In this research, the average, maximum and minimum values of
    “q” were 2.7073, 3.1277, and 2.2724 mm/minb, respectively for a clay soil, and
    these values were 0.5523, 0.5647, and 0.5424 (dimensionless), respectively, for
    the “b” parameter for the same clay soil. In another study in a plowed clay, soil
    “q” was 3.38 mm/minb and “b” was 0.53 (dimensionless) [26]. The infiltration parameters
    “q” and “b” varied strongly with respect to soil texture [76]. Thus, the Kostiakov
    model for predicting the water cumulative infiltration (Z, mm) for a clay soil
    for the present research was as follows: Z=2.7073× t 0.5523 (Average R 2 was0.939)
    (7) With an average R2 value of 0.939, only slight variations were reported between
    the measured and predicted Z. The test results indicate that the cumulative infiltration
    predicted using Equation (8) is reasonably accurate and can be used to estimate
    cumulative infiltration over a reasonable time for irrigation in a clay soil.
    There is a good agreement between the measured and estimated cumulative infiltration
    under all treatments. In previous research [11], the Kostiakov, Philips, and Horton
    infiltration models were evaluated and the Kostiakov model was identified as the
    better alternative for evaluating the infiltration rate. Additionally, the Kostiakov
    model was considered the most appropriate for the prediction of water infiltration
    rate into the soil compared with the Horton and Philip models [77]. Fok [78] derived
    the Kostiakov equation parameters and fitting them to a physically based infiltration
    equation, derived five different sets of values for “q” and “b”, depending on
    initial moisture content, time, and hydraulic conductivity. The power constant
    “b” has more physical sense than the other Kostiakov equation fitting parameters,
    as its scale depends on the relationships and interactions of several infiltration
    reduction or increasing factors [78]. According to Dixon [79], large “q” values
    are related to micro-rough and macro-porous soil surfaces, or to situations with
    a moderately large gravitational impact on infiltration. On the other hand, small
    “q” values are linked to smooth, micro-porous surfaces where capillarity is the
    major force driving infiltration. The constant “b” is just an infiltration curve
    fitting coefficient. For the empirical infiltration models, it is commonly implicit
    that, while infiltration is defined as a function of time, the residual parameters
    are calibration constants signifying the situations under which the test was directed,
    including the initial soil moisture content and any other factors that may induce
    differences in infiltration [80]. 3.4. Data Analysis of the Third Stage of the
    Research (Data Mining Algorithms) Recently, there have been improved research
    efforts offering alternate approaches for precisely predicting the quantity of
    soil water infiltration using altered types of models based on data mining models.
    Some benefits of these kinds of models are reported by Panahi et al. [31] as follows:
    strong estimation performance, strength in handling missing data, easy and stable
    to expand, and the ability to handle large quantities of data of diverse measures.
    The ability of the investigated regression algorithms is reliant upon the default
    parameters employed by Weka, and the values of the default parameters for the
    investigated regression algorithms are listed in Table 9. The time taken to build
    models for “q” and “b” is illustrated in Table 10. The least time is required
    with the KStar (K*) method. In this research, the input variables were the mean
    weight diameter, tillage depth and soil compaction level. Various performance
    measures were used to check the accuracy of the model. The values of “q” and “b”
    can be computed and compared with actual values of “q” and “b” using the proposed
    regression models. Table 9. Default WEKA information for investigated models.
    Table 10. Time taken (s) to build model in seconds for fitting parameters of “q”
    and “b”. The MLP (4-3-1) with three nodes in the hidden layer was formed by Weka.
    The MLP was trained for 500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.3 and a momentum
    of 0.2, the Weka defaults. The number of epochs determines how long the MLP will
    run, while the learning rate and momentum state how in tune the weights are [47].
    The Weka linear regression model outcome for “q” was calculated by Equation (8),
    with an R2 of 0.947, and for “b”, the Weka linear regression model result was
    calculated by Equation (9), with an R2 of 0.786. q=2.2696+0.00785×MWD−0.0171×NTT+0.0141×TD
    (8) b=0.5317+0.0004×MWD+0.0034×NTT−0.0002×TD (9) where “q” is in mm/mimb, “b”
    is dimensionless, MWD is in mm, NTT is soil compaction at 0, 1, 3 and 5 traffic
    levels, and TD is tillage depth in cm. Table 11 provides the statistical data
    of the evaluation criteria between the observed and predicted values of the fitting
    parameters in Equation (2) of “q” and “b” with the investigated regression algorithms.
    An evaluation of all the regression algorithms was completed to identify the most
    efficient regression algorithm. Using the testing dataset, the performance of
    KStar (K*) was better than the other regression algorithms, with the following
    performance evaluation criteria for “q” estimation: correlation coefficient =
    0.997, MAE = 0.0179 mm/minb, and RMSE = 0.0228 mm/minb. For “b” estimation, the
    performance of the MLP was better than the other regression algorithms, with performance
    evaluation criteria as follows: correlation coefficient = 0.962, MAE = 0.0013
    dimensionless, and RMSE = 0.0026 dimensionless. Table 11. The statistical data
    of evaluation criteria between actual and predicted values of the fitting parameters
    of “q” and “b” in Equation (2) using different regression algorithms using testing
    dataset. Figure 11 and Figure 12 provide bar graphs for the average values of
    the parameters of “q” and “b” using the investigated regression algorithms compared
    with actual values in the testing dataset. The average actual for “b” was 0.5576
    dimensionless in the testing dataset (14 points) and the closed average for the
    KStar (K*) method was 0.5573 dimensionless. The average actual value for “q” was
    2.8297 mm/minb in testing dataset (14 points), and the closed average for the
    K Star (K*) method was 2.8234 mm/minb. Figure 11. Bar graph for the average values
    of the parameter “q” using the investigated regression algorithms compared with
    actual values in testing dataset. Figure 12. Bar graph for the average values
    of the parameter “b” using the investigated regression algorithms compared with
    observed values in testing dataset. KStar (K*) was the best-performing regression
    algorithm for predicting the expected values of the parameters “q” and “b” in
    the used dataset within the studied range. In this case, the K* outcomes were
    the best for the present dataset, and it is important to note that it is tested
    here as a regression algorithm and its parameters were left as default in Weka
    3.8 software. Furthermore, the KStar algorithm is better than the other prediction
    regression algorithms, namely, Linear Regression, RBFNetwork, Decision Stump Simple,
    and Linear Regression in Weka for disorganized data [80]. For prediction of organic
    matter quantity and clay content in a soil, the Lazy KStar algorithm was shown
    to have more satisfactory performance when mining the data, with higher determination
    coefficients and smaller errors [81]. In prediction of rainfall based on metrological
    data, the KStar algorithm had the maximum correlation coefficient of 0.8901, and
    the minimum RMSE compared with other algorithms in Weka, including MLP, Bagging,
    IBk, Additive Regression, Decision Table, Random SubSpace, M5Rules, REPTre, M5P
    tree, Regression by Discretization, and User Classifier [82]. The efficiency of
    the deep learning of convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms, using three
    metaheuristic procedures for infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration prediction
    was evaluated. The results revealed that CNN had very good performance for both
    infiltration rate and cumulative infiltration and prediction [31]. The Kostiakov
    model, and ANN approach in Weka appeared to be good tools for predicting the infiltration
    rate of a soil, and time and soil moisture content were the most critical parameters
    in measurement of the infiltration rate of a soil [83]. In addition, the fitting
    accuracy of the data mining model is affected by agricultural practices or soil
    structure, organic matter content, porosity, and other factors [84]. Therefore,
    this research on the infiltration processes in a clay soil, performed by in situ
    field observation experiments and fitting a model of infiltration parameters,
    provides an essential theoretical basis for irrigation management purposes under
    regular crop production conditions. The research also assists with the selection
    of the best seedbed preparation method, tillage depth and soil compactions levels
    generated by tractor passes, enabling the modification of tillage practices during
    the season to conserve water and to prevent yield declines. 4. Conclusions To
    properly plan and manage irrigation systems, cumulative infiltration must be accurately
    determined. Although infiltration readings frequently only provide point information,
    they are indispensable for parameter and model validation. This research aimed
    to investigate in a field experiment the influence on cumulative infiltration
    of different tillage practices, which were characterized by conducting tillage
    on a clay soil using three tillage implements (moldboard, chisel, and rotary plows)
    under two tillage depths and under four levels of soil compaction created by tractor
    wheel traffic. The analyses indicated that the cumulative infiltration empirical
    model parameters “q” and “b” of the Kostiakov equation ( Z=q× t b ) depend on
    the experimental conditions. The logarithmic transformation (graphical method)
    performance in describing soil infiltration characteristics (Z=2.7073× t 0.5523
    ) under different tillage practices was tested, resulting in an R2 value of 0.939,
    and found to be highly acceptable. Defining the precise infiltration features
    leads to correct management and design of an irrigation system, as governed by
    the accurate behavior of model parameters. Thus, in this research, regression
    algorithms in the Weka software, namely, M5Rules, Additive Regression, KStar (K*),
    SMOreg, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Linear Regression (LR), and Gaussian Processes,
    were used to predict the Kostiakov model parameters of “q” and “b” for the cumulative
    infiltration equation using field infiltration data. The inputs were as follows:
    mean weight diameter of the clay soil, which depending on different treatments,
    ranged from 9.2 to 80.2 mm; the level of tractor wheel traffic on the plowed soil
    surface (dimensionless) with 0, 1, 3, and 5 passes; and the tillage depth, ranging
    from 97 to 204 mm. The outputs were “q” and “b”. The obtained results indicated
    that the KStar (K*) model was the most effective regression algorithm for predicting
    “q” with a correlation coefficient of 0.997 for the given clay soil texture, while
    for parameter “b” for the same clay soil texture, the MLP regression algorithm
    with a correlation coefficient of 0.962 was the most effective method. Finally,
    we encourage repeating the same procedure in order to answer related problems.
    This research is not without limitations. Using only the data based on a clay
    soil is one limitation, although its reliability is high. The second limitation
    relates to the graphical method for determination of “q” and “b” fitting parameters,
    as many other methods could have been used, for example, the volume-balance method.
    The third limitation relates to the non-use of other relevant data mining algorithms
    that are not offered in Weka software, which should be addressed in coming research
    on this subject. This research contributes to research in the irrigation field
    on new computational methods applied to the soil infiltration process. It should
    encourage the irrigation and soil research community to share their datasets and
    improve the prediction models. The results also indicate that the regression algorithms
    can be suitable for the estimation of fitting parameters of cumulative infiltration
    depth from the accessible data. The fitting parameters generated by the investigated
    regression algorithms can be used to simulate the cumulative infiltration depth
    in the investigated soil texture. Moreover, the water infiltration rate into the
    soil can be used as a tool for the purposes of designing irrigation systems, the
    characterization of different tillage practices, and providing a localized management
    of this variable. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.A.-S., R.S.A.-O.,

    System Based on Soil Classification Chapter © 2022 1 Introduction The majority
    of people in developing countries rely on agriculture for a living [1]. Regardless
    of the government’s annual announcements of new policies and adequate funding
    for agriculture, farmers face numerous problems, ranging from crop selection to
    marketing. Farming is reliant on diverse components such as weather, fertilizers,
    soil, etc. [2]. The traditional farming techniques being employed by cultivators
    are not yielding effective outcomes. India, for example, has a wealth of natural
    resources, including enormous farm fields that allow for efficient farming. However,
    in contrast to developed nations, which have fewer natural resources and smaller
    farming areas, the yield per hectare of crops like maize and wheat is significantly
    lower [3]. It has been demonstrated that using information technology advancements
    in agriculture boosts production and yields higher annual returns [3, 4]. The
    ever-increasing population of emerging countries forces them to produce more food
    than previously. In computer technology, there are a variety of techniques for
    resolving categorization issues. Machine Learning (ML) is a popular field for
    addressing such issues. The techniques of ML can be utilised in the different
    phases of farming to deliver significant outcomes. During the study of different
    works, it was observed that there were a couple of efforts where enhancements
    of information technology were employed to address farming concerns [4, 5]. Several
    works focus on the use of devices to collect farming data about “crops, soil,
    and weather,” as well as the “market” value of harvests.This data was subsequently
    disseminated to other stakeholders. It has been observed that the usage of ML
    inventions in the farming sector is limited. Using sophisticated data, farmers
    can make better decisions to increase their return on investment [4]. Although
    there has been significant research in ML during recent years, limited efforts
    exist to resolve farming problems utilising ML. This work is an effort to automate
    the process of soil classification using ML. 1.1 Motivation The texture of the
    soil has a significant impact on agriculture. It has an impact on the movement
    of soil components and water, , and crop yield [6]. In the test centres, soil
    texture is used to determine the types of soil. The “United States Department
    of Agriculture (USDA)” triangle is now used to measure soil texture, however it
    is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies [7]. The quantity of “sand,” “silt,”
    and “clay” present in the soil determines the twelve texture classes offered by
    “USDA”. The two vital attributes of soil are its texture and chemical properties,
    which are employed for soil classification [10]. The texture of the soil has a
    considerable impact on crop growth. It also aids in the selection of fertiliser
    type and quantity [11]. Crop output is improved by using the right fertilisers
    at the optimum amounts [12]. It is critical to provide soil categorization services
    to farming stakeholders in a timely and correct manner. The amount of farming
    data is rapidly growing, necessitating the development of a scalable application.
    In countries that are still in the development stage, like India, some prominent
    cloud applications [13] offer current knowledge on climate, harvest categories,
    and rates of crops without employing analytics. The application of analytics aids
    in the extraction of usable information from vast amounts of data. The cloud enables
    ML applications to be easily scalable and accessible 24 hours a day, 7 days a
    week from any internet-enabled device. For its forecasts, the analytics component
    relies on past data. Based on the preceding observations, we have identified the
    following key issues: Categorizing the soil based on its texture and chemical
    properties helps the farming stakeholders choose the appropriate crop to be sown.
    Additionally, it supports them in choosing the suitable quantity and kind of manure
    that can be utilised to guarantee the healthful development of the crop. The existing
    techniques for categorising soil are time consuming and erroneous. Soil experts
    can perform soil classification precisely and efficiently using the outcomes given
    by the ML algorithms. As farming information is rising; an application that can
    be scaled effectively is required. A cloud-based agriculture framework with soil
    classification capability will benefit farming stakeholders by delivering knowledge
    in an efficient and timely manner. Keeping these considerations in mind, a parameter-based
    soil classifier known as was developed in this work. This classifier was able
    to classify the soil into different classes based on the soil’s texture and chemical
    properties. The application was deployed on a cloud platform. 1.2 Soil chemical
    properties Soil chemical features have a strong influence on the crop yield. These
    properties are described in Table 1 [9]: Table 1 Soil chemical properties Full
    size table 1.3 Contribution Following points highlight the contribution of this
    work: Designed and developed a parameter-based soil classifier called customized
    Decision Tree ( ) by considering its texture and chemical parameters Designed
    a “cloud-based” application for delivering soil classification as a service to
    the stakeholders Multiple performance measures, including , , , , and , were used
    to evaluate the classifiers Performed comprehensive trials on 8 “real-world” and
    3 “benchmark” farming datasets to reach the desired outcomes The proposed classifier
    delivered superior outcomes than , , , , , , and from previous works with respect
    to , , , , and The novelty of this work is that a customized decision tree ( )
    technique has been developed for soil classification by considering vital texture
    and chemical properties of soil. The technique was developed by computing 2 Gini
    index values based on threshold. Then, the ratio of these Gini indices was taken
    to reduce the bias caused by large-valued attributes. The paper is structured
    as follows. Section 2 examines important works in the fields of soil classification
    using the ML techniques, and agricultural cloud computing. The proposed customised
    decision tree ( ) algorithm for soil classification is presented in Sect. 3. Section
    4 describes the design of our farming cloud framework. Section 5 examines the
    setup of experiments and outcomes. The conclusion and future work are presented
    at the end. 2 Related work This section includes an in-depth examination of the
    existing works in the domains of ML in soil classification and cloud framework
    in farming. Section 2.1 describes a few major efforts associated with categorising
    soil utilising ML methods. Section 2.2 discusses the works performed in the domain
    of the cloud framework in farming. 2.1 Related work on soil classification utilizing
    ML Soil classification utilising ML is a fascinating research domain. As per this
    study, less work is done in the domain of soil classification utilising ML methods.
    Nonetheless, the study of the ML techniques applied to soil conveys a reasonable
    assessment for dealing with this issue effectively. They also focus on the difficulties
    embedded in soil classification utilising ML. Ensuing paragraphs discuss certain
    significant works. In [7] authors demonstrated categorization of soil texture
    in China using terrain attributes. They employed three ML techniques. Their aim
    was to ascertain the impact of landscape on the texture alterations of soil. They
    observed that having function (multinomial in nature) surpassed the and Decision
    Tree ( ) techniques. Their effort was constrained to categorizing soil centred
    on just 3 texture categories “sand”, “clay”, and “loam”. In work [14], rapid classification
    of soil for compressed earth chunks was performed using . Despite the fact that
    A NN requires a large amount of data for training, the authors used less data
    in their trials. Authors used A NN to classify soil data based on texture in [15,
    16]. In [17], fuzzy and hard k-means were utilised to categorise soil particles
    into seven texture categories. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) demonstrated enhanced performance.
    The authors, Bhargavi and Jyothi [18], classified soil particles based on seven
    parameters into ten texture categories. They perceived that FCM performed better
    than genetic algorithm and fuzzy rules. In [19], the authors did soil categorization
    on thirteen chemical properties utilizing , and a combined classifier ( + ). The
    research [20] revealed the superior performance of over for categorizing soil
    information of ten features (chemical properties) into three categories (low,
    mid and high fertile). In [21], 700 plus soil records were categorized using as
    the parameter by employing , Bayes, and techniques existing in “WEKA tool”. The
    researchers found that the performed better. However certain vital soil chemical
    features such as , , P, K were not taken into account during the process of soil
    categorization. Utilizing clustering techniques, the categorization of twenty
    soil records with seven chemical features was performed in [22]. The data samples
    considered in the experiments were too small to draw any meaningful deductions.
    Furthermore, prevailing techniques in the “WEKA tool” were employed. In [23],
    150+ soil records were classified into eight soil classes using . According to
    the authors, with linear and gaussian kernels outperformed and . Three ML techniques
    were employed in [24] for performing binary and multi class (3-class and 7-class)
    soil categorization. Researchers found that performed better than , and . Around
    2000 soil records were categorized into six classes of fertility in [12]. Around
    ten chemical parameters were considered. Authors concluded that performed better
    than and techniques. The k-means method for categorizing 100+ soil instances on
    5 chemical features was performed [25]. Three groups were formed. The linear kernel
    of exhibited higher recall and than , , and methods for categorizing soil objects
    comprising of ten features and 10 plus classes. was observed to perform better
    than on 90 plus soil records with 8 chemical parameters by [27]. Existing techniques
    from RMiner tool was employed. Multi-Layer Perceptron performed better than ,
    Bayes Network among others on 80 plus soil objects with 5 categories [28]. Two
    thousand plus instances of soil were clustered into 4 groups employing k-means
    technique. In [30], self-organizing-map method exhibited higher than k-means for
    categorizing soil records into 4 groups using 4 input features. Researchers in
    [31] found that the combination of k-means and performed accurately than the integration
    of k-means with on soil dataset with 6 categories. was not taken into account
    for comparison. outperformed technique for categorizing 2000 soil records with
    9 chemical parameters [32]. In [34], performed better than , , and for categorizing
    the soil on chemical parameters. However, the work did not take into account categorization
    of soil using texture. In [35] authors found that fuzzy DT performed accurately
    than and FURIA methods on soil records comprising of 20+ features into three categories.
    In [36], Antminer+ performed more accurately than Antminer for the categorization
    of 120+ soil records with 4 features into 2 categories. Only 2 methods were compared.
    A detailed look at the literature on soil classification using ML, however, exposes
    numerous disparities and flaws. These shortcomings, along with how they have been
    overcome in our work, are discussed below. Reasonably large datasets are required
    for proper training of classification models. If classifiers are trained on datasets
    of small size, they tend to overfit [33]. Several works [11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23,
    25, 26, 28, 29, 31, 36] took into account small sized datasets from which knowledgeable
    inferences could not be inferred. In our effort, large data sets for experimentation
    were considered, which reduced overfitting. The essential soil chemical properties
    for soil classification are , , , P, K, S, , and B [9]. However, in several of
    the works that focus on soil classification using chemical properties [11, 20,21,22,23,24,
    26, 27, 30, 33], they have only taken a subgroup of these properties. Furthermore,
    information about the adequacy and inadequacy of soil contents that aid the development
    of crops was not offered. In our work, the best possible features for the categorization
    of soil were taken into account in discussion with domain specialists. Our devised
    classification technique delivers information about the adequacy and inadequacy
    of soil contents. As per “USDA”, the texture of soil is categorised into 12 soil
    texture classes centred on the ratios of “sand, clay, and silt” [34]. As per “USDA”,
    the soil texture classification was achieved by using amounts of “silt, clay,
    and sand”. Based on the quantities of “silt, sand, and clay”, there are twelve
    categories of texture of soil, which are “sandy soil, loamy sand, sandy loam,
    loam, silt loam, silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay,
    silty clay, and clay” [34]. However, the works [7, 15, 24] on soil texture classification
    did not take into account all of these categories.We have conducted a classification
    of the texture of soil by taking into account all these 12 categories. Several
    efforts [22,23,24] have employed already prevailing techniques installed in the
    “WEKA tool”. We have designed customized decision tree ( ) for soil classification.
    Multiple performance metrics provide better insight into a classifier’s performance
    [37]. However, in each of the efforts, classifier evaluation was performed by
    utilising a specific performance measure like , without considering additional
    metrics. Multiple performance metrics like , , , , and were employed in our effort
    to evaluate the classifiers. For an accurate evaluation of the classifier’s performance,
    they must be tested on benchmark datasets [38]. However, in many of the efforts,
    standard farming datasets were not taken for experimentation. Thorough trials
    were performed on eight actual and 4 standard farming data to achieve the desired
    outcomes. 2.2 Related work on agricultural cloud framework This section explains
    certain significant efforts made in the area of constructing a farming cloud.
    Problems associated with cloud computing were reviewed in [39] along with the
    associated developments. Certain efforts in the development of cloud computing
    for agriculture, such as “MAD” and “WSAN cloud,” were examined.The paper was survey
    based without any real cloud implementation for the farming sector. In [40], authors
    performed research on “Geofarmer” that represents a periodic yield checking instrument
    utilised in South Africa. No ML was utilised in the Geofarmer tool to facilitate
    data analysis. In [41], authors have implemented an information system which is
    autonomic and centred on the cloud at “CLOUD Lab, Australia”. A user interface
    was provided where consumers could access harvest data of four crops, climate
    statistics, and soil data. The researchers categorised the crops based on production
    using the algorithm. In [3], researchers examined in what way technology is improving
    Indian agriculture. They discuss agriculture-related services such as “ITC’s e-Choupal,
    mKRISHI mobile app, Agnext,” etc. Although several helpful facilities are offered
    by the products, soil classification facilities were not offered. A farming cloud
    was suggested by [42] for delivering farming information dynamically through SMS
    to agriculturalists. It was intended to preserve information associated with crops,
    markets, and production. In [43], researchers established an agriculture management
    package on the cloud. The package offered harvest requirements, illness warnings,
    and existing marketplace costs of yields to growers. The authors [44] proposed
    an agri-assistant for assisting farmers through SMS messages in response to farmers’
    queries. In [45], the researchers proposed an agriculture cloud to identify illnesses
    related to crops and recommend fertilizers to farmers. Their effort was a recommendation
    and was not applied in the real world. In [46], the authors built “IFarm,” which
    signified a cultivation management on cloud. In [47], researchers established
    “Agro Mobile” that delivers services to cultivators via cell phones. They detected
    foliage infections from leaf images by employing image processing techniques.
    Work by [48] recommended a farming network solution to offer specialist guidance
    on crop farming, rating, and manures. The key farming service (soil classification)
    was not delivered. The effort [49] examines the traits that must exist in future
    farming models. As per the work, certain traits that may prevail are tools to
    gather information specific to locations, and advanced mechanisms for developing
    user interfaces. Authors in [50] have developed a “cloud-based decision support
    system” for plantations. It employs a frontend that aids information to be gathering
    from diverse sources and an extensible package design for decision components.
    Researchers devised a structure for doing analytics of information centred on
    the cloud to offer improved costs for cultivators [51]. It was a recommendation
    and was not applied in a real-world scenario. Only one service related to the
    selling rate of crops via the cloud architecture was delivered. Vital farming
    services like soil categorization were not offered. An architecture for farming
    was recommended for Kenya in [52]. In [53], an IoT based cloud architecture for
    precision farming was developed. Pricing updates for crops were delivered via
    cell phones to cultivators [54]. Authors [55] recommended the cloud for delivering
    expert decisions. The scheme was intended to deliver a computerised answer to
    growers’ inquiries from the information gathered in an expert databank. Analytics
    were not implemented in the system. The constraints of the above-mentioned works
    and the way it was resolved in our effort are summarised below: Several efforts
    [3, 18, 19, 21, 23, 24, 27, 49, 52] are limited to studies or propositions, not
    including real-time applications of the farming cloud. In our effort, a farming
    cloud architecture was devised, utilising Hk for application deployment and AS3
    for storing farming information. In several efforts [39, 40, 42, 43, 46,47,48,
    53, 54, 61], ML techniques were not integrated into farming cloud structures to
    perform analytics. In this effort, ML classification techniques were incorporated
    into farming cloud design to analyse the gathered data. Certain efforts [43, 51,
    54] delivered marketplace cost information concerning farming goods to consumers.
    However, key farming facilities like the categorization of soil were not delivered
    to the consumers. These critical services were included in the framework we created.
    Several cloud systems in developing countries like India are still in the conceptual
    phase. A cloud-based system for farming utilising ML was developed in this work,
    with a primary focus on the Indian scenario. The summary of the related work is
    given in Table 2. Table 2 Comparison of existing works with the proposed work
    Full size table 3 Proposed work This section describes in detail the developed
    framework for “soil” classification. Although farming is the main livelihood around
    the world, modern technology is not being utilised. In this effort, a “cloud-based
    system” was developed for agriculturists that delivered soil classification as
    a service. The devised was employed in the “cloud-based system” to deliver this
    service. The AS3 cloud was employed for storing the farming information. The information
    was stored as objects. The Hk cloud was employed for the deployment of the application.
    Different information, like soil records gathered from [59] that are needed for
    “soil” classification, was inserted into the databank. A few organisations offered
    this information at a reasonable rate [60]. Prior to inserting this information
    into the databank, the data was converted into a format suitable for processing
    by removing missing, duplicate, and incompatible records. The consumer is able
    to use our product via net-aided devices, which will assist the stakeholders in
    taking important agriculture-related decisions. For instance, when the consumer
    intends to pick a specific crop to grow, this expert system can be employed to
    determine the category of soil. The crop can be chosen based on this. Understanding
    soil types is also beneficial when applying manures.This soil expert system can
    be valuable for environmental scientists who perform soil analysis and cultivators
    who are involved in farming. 3.1 Proposed customized decision tree ( ) classifier
    In this section, we explain the customised decision tree ( ) algorithm developed
    by us. In the present effort, the classification of agricultural datasets [9,
    59, 62,63,64,65] was achieved by utilising the technique. We realise that this
    effort may assist in advising appropriate crops for farmers. We also observed
    that the conventional soil classification procedures pursued in developing countries
    consume more time and are less effective. Our work offers a programmed soil classifier
    which will greatly reduce the load generated on agronomical organisations that
    still employ conventional soil classification procedures. The main problem with
    the classifier is that it generates large decision trees along with misclassification
    inaccuracies. This shortcoming is because of the usage of information gain (IG)
    as the “splitting measure” that is biased in the direction of attributes possessing
    bigger values. The major constraint of technique is that it generates classification
    errors once the range of the dependent feature is large. The algorithm generates
    several unstable trees even for slight tuning in the “training dataset”. These
    drawbacks are caused by the usage of gini index ( ) as the splitting measure which
    faces problems for target features with large domains [5]. In view of these drawbacks,
    we developed a technique for classification of soil. Initially, we computed the
    for the attribute values using Eq. 1. (1) where Tr represents the data to be trained,
    v is the number of classes, is the comparative rate of recurrence of class j in
    Tr. gives the portion of samples fitting to a particular class. It is meant to
    favour larger partitions [5]. The ratios were then calculated using Eq. 2 to eliminate
    the bias introduced by the IG of the technique.The ratio was developed using the
    devised method, as shown in Eq. 2: (2) where denotes the ratio, a is the feature
    of the information that was trained, is the value calculated from first value
    to the threshold of feature a. is the value computed from the (threshold+1) to
    the final value of feature a. The technique is demonstrated in Fig. 1. Fig. 1
    Illustration of Gini Ratio calculation Full size image In Fig. 1, is a soil feature
    comprising ten values ranging between 4.3 and 7.9. The middle value (5.9) was
    selected as the threshold. It is estimated as (index-of-first value + index-of-last-value)/2.
    In this case, 2 values are calculated for feature. Using Eq. 2, the first value
    was calculated from 4.3 to the threshold (5.9). Likewise, the second value was
    computed from 6.2 to the final value (7.9). was computed using Eq. 2 for each
    attribute of the “training information”. Feature with the least was chosen for
    splitting by the . Computation of from reduced the bias of large-valued features
    over smaller ones. Figure 2 presents the devised technique. Fig. 2 Design flow
    of the Proposed Full size image The initial phase in the formulated technique
    included pre-processing the original information by standardizing it in the range
    of 0 to 1. The standardized value of for feature B in the jth row is calculated
    as presented in Eq. 3 [66]: (3) Where, and characterize the least and highest
    values of feature B. After pre-processing, the records were divided into “training”
    and “test data”. The iterated till all the “training examples” were categorized
    using the . After the training was finished, the “test” records were fed to the
    trained model to forecast the soil classes. was evaluated by comparing the actual
    with the predicted classes. Algorithm 1 demonstrates the pseudocode of the proposed
    for soil classification. The Nrmlz() procedure standardised the information from
    0 to 1 at line 2. In line 3, the Divide () module divided the information into
    “training” ( ) and “test” ( ) information. The first set ( and ) hold the input
    attributes respectively. The second set , and hold the training class and the
    test class respectively. In line 4, the PrdCls variable which holds the predicted
    class, is initialized. The “for” loop at line 5 iterates for each attribute a
    of the “training data”. At line 6, the Locate-Middle () function finds the midpoint
    value (threshold) for each attribute a. The Calculate-GI () function at line 7,
    computes the first (G1) using Eq. 7 from 1st value of attribute a ( ) to the threshold.
    The variable G1(a) holds the 1st value. Similarly, the Calculate-GI () function
    at line 8, computes the second (G2) value using Eq. 7 from (threshold + 1) to
    last the value of attribute a ( ). stores the second value. The Calculate-GR ()
    function at line 9, assesses the of and using Eq. 8. The trait with the smallest
    is chosen and divided at line 12. In line 13, if the “Node” (Nd) is having all
    records from the same class (“Pure Node”) then it is converted into “leaf node”
    at line 14, Else the control moves to line 16. In line 16, the Generate-Chld-Nd
    () module constructs descendant nodes and associates them with the parent node.
    The Delete () function at line 18, deletes the feature chosen for partitioning
    so that the rest of the features are taken for partitioning. The “trained model”
    ( ) is constructed by the Trn-CDT-Mdl() function in line 20. At line 21, the “for”
    loop iterates for every example of the “test data”. The Forecast () function at
    line 22 predicts the class label of each “test sample” by using the “trained”
    model ( ). The model is assessed by the Compare () function at line 24. 3.2 Cloud
    framework This section discusses the design of cloud framework for soil classification.
    The task of soil classification requires the parameters , , , P, K, S, , B. which
    vary from region to region. Hence, the data required for soil classification is
    dynamic in nature. Also, the agriculture stakeholders need to have knowledge about
    soil parameters that vary dynamically. A cloud service is required to resolve
    the aforementioned concerns. Hence, an expert system based on the cloud is designed
    in this work for the delivery of soil classification as a service to the farming
    stakeholders such as farming organizations, cultivators, etc. For soil classification,
    the proposed was utilized. AS3 was employed for storing the farming information.
    Hk was utilised for deploying the SC. Our expert system delivers trustworthy and
    precise farming service. The consumers of this expert system will be the farming
    organisations and cultivators. Figure 3 illustrates the design of the framework.
    Fig. 3 Agricultural cloud framework for soil classification Full size image The
    process of distribution is comprised of two stages. In the first stage, AS3 was
    employed to store the soil information. Soil samples containing information about
    the chemical attributes were collected from [59] and texture information from
    [9]. In the second stage, soil classifiers were distributed on the Hk cloud. The
    user interface (UI) of the expert system comprised of parameters of soil viz.
    , , , P, B, K, , , and . A choice for importing soil files in Excel or text formats
    was also provided. The proposed was used to perform soil classification. During
    the build stage, the SC application, which included the programme and dependencies,
    was built with the help of the build pack. Hk initiates the source application
    after receiving the application. The construct method remains mostly restricted
    to languages. It gathers the dependencies and creates the resources [67, 68].
    During the build stage, the SC application employs “Maven” to handle the dualistic
    library dependencies. The program for the SC plus the dependences, the outcome
    of the construct stage alongside the structure and language is accumulated in
    a slug. In the implementation stage, a slug is produced. They signify tiny reproductions
    of products that are distributed to the dyno manager [69]. The publish stage attaches
    the config, slug, and add-ons. 3.2.1 Development of the cloud based soil classification
    system The development of an expert system based on the cloud is different from
    creating individual products. Certain critical factors considered while developing
    the farming cloud product are listed below [70, 71]: Selection of programming
    language: Deciding the appropriate language for coding is essential for creating
    a product built on the cloud. As per several studies [72], “Java” is positioned
    third amongst the widely utilised languages for products based on the cloud. Therefore,
    “Java” was employed in this work. Originally, the SC application was built utilising
    “Matlab”. The code was adapted to “Java” since it is more effective for cloud
    software. The “Vaadin 8.1” structure was employed for building the SC software
    as it is appropriate for authoring collaborative and receptive web software, permitting
    rapid development with an exhaustive set of modules and information binding techniques
    [73]. Deciding the cloud space: The subsequent crucial element for developing
    an expert system was picking a suitable storage facility. AS3 was selected for
    storing the farming information since it is robust, sustainable, adaptable, protected,
    and stable. Additionally, it permits analytics on the accumulated information.
    “Java” support was also offered by AS3 [74]. Determining the appropriate platform
    for deployment: The Hk cloud was selected for deployment since it is free, adaptable
    and scales to large amounts of data [67]. 3.2.2 Distribution of farming cloud
    software to Hk The following actions describe the method we followed for deploying
    the SC application to the Hk cloud: Action-1: Primarily, the SC software was developed
    in the “Java Vaadin 8.1 Framework” utilising the “Eclipse Oxygen IDE”. Action-2:
    Later, the “pom.xml” file was established by combining suitable dependencies.
    In this effort, the Hk “Maven Plugin” and “Amazon Java SDK dependencies” were
    used. The soil classifier application was distributed to Hk directly. We used
    this technique as it is beneficial when priorly constructed “war” or “jar” files
    need to be deployed [67]. Action-3: Finally, the software was distributed to the
    Hk cloud utilising the “Heroku Maven Plugin” from “Eclipse.” This technique involved
    distributing priorly developed stand-alone software to Hk in a flexible fashion.
    We selected this technique as it is more suitable for software that takes a long
    time to compile. The configuration added to the plugin for the SC application
    is shown below: <configuration><appName> soilclassification</appName></configuration>
    Where “soilclassification” is the label for the SC software. We packaged the SC
    application as “WAR” (Web Application Resource) files, which was adequate [69].
    The ensuing action was to construct the “slug” and distribute it to Hk. This can
    be achieved by employing the command “mvn clean heroku:deploy-war” or via “Eclipse”.
    The 2nd option employing “Eclipse” was utilised in our effort. The “pom.xml” file
    was executed as “maven build”. The SC software was distributed to Hk by using
    the command “heroku:deploy-war”. The SC application was deployed on 1 web “dyno”
    of the Hk. The complete approach followed in creating the farming framework included
    two phases. The first phase involved building and distributing the SC software.
    The 2nd phase constituted the Hk process during runtime after distribution of
    the software. The following points outline these two phases: (i) Distribute the
    Application: The SC application consists of the program and a depiction of certain
    dependencies in the “pom.xml” file. The distribution of SC applications comprises
    of moving the software to Hk by means of “Git” or “API”. In this effort, the software
    was distributed by employing the “Heroku Maven Plugin”. A “Slug” was generated
    by compiling the dependencies and “language runtime” of the SC software. Lastly,
    a “release” integrated the “slug” and “configuration variables”. Hk kept an “append-only-log”
    to hold the releases. (ii) Runtime: The “dynos” ascertain the atmosphere that
    is necessary to operate the SC software. They are insulated “UNIX” crates, which
    are virtual in nature. With regards to the SC, 1 dyno was executed. The dyno manager
    managed dynos running across the soil classifier application. Products that use
    open-source dynos are prone to becoming inactive after thirty minutes of inactivity.This
    work made use of open-source dynos. 3.2.3 Farming information storage in AS3 cloud
    For safety purposes, the cloud applications are not given access to the local
    drives of consumers. Only information stored in the cloud can be accessed by these
    products. Therefore, AS3 was employed for storing farming information related
    to climate, crops, soil, and manures. In AS3, information gets stored in the shape
    of components inside “buckets”. These “buckets” are basically used for containing
    files or components. Every “bucket” is referred to using a non-duplicate “key”
    (name). There are options available to remove, scan, and put “objects” into these
    “buckets”. Five TB is the upper limit of an “object” [74]. In our work, we created
    a bucket named “nmit-soilclassificationdata”. The “nmit-soilclassificationdata
    bucket” was for accumulating information needed for the SC. In this “bucket”,
    the information files comprising the chemical and texture parameters of soil were
    put as “objects”. The “buckets” are aligned by areas. We aligned the “bucket”
    for the USA region. The ensuing actions explain the approach employed in our effort
    aimed at retrieving the information deposited in AS3 from the SC application:
    Action-1: The “keys” were generated for every one of the files deposited in the
    “buckets”. “Keys” are required to distinctively detect files deposited in the
    “buckets”. For the SC application, “pH-tr-key” was the “key name” provided to
    distinctively determine the training information on “soil pH” that is deposited
    as an entity in the “nmit-soilclassificationdata bucket”. Action-2: A service
    client entity is needed to handle queries to AS3. The suggested approach is to
    make use of the builder of service client builder [74]. The statement to build
    an AS3 client is: “final AmazonS3 s3Client = AmazonS3ClientBuilder.standard ().
    with Region (Regions.US-EAST-1)”. Action-3: Once the AS3 client is built, the
    entities stored in the “buckets” need to be accessed. To achieve this, “getObject()”
    function was used. The ensuing statement gives the way of scanning the entity
    “soil pH” using the “key” name “pH-tr-key” from the “nmit-soilclassificationdata
    bucket” where it was deposited. “S3Object s3object-AvB = s3Client.getObject(new
    GetObjectRequest (“nmitsoilclassificationdata”, pH-tr-key))”. Security of stored
    information was ensured because the “keys” are private. They are accessible only
    by those who have created the “keys”. 3.3 Performance metrics This section explains
    the different performance metrics utilized to assess the efficiency of the classifiers.
    Confusion matrix (CM) was employed to evaluate the classifiers. CM gives the amount
    of correctly and erroneously categorized records. Table 3 depicts CM for a “binary
    classification problem” having 2 categories “positive” (+) and “negative” (–)
    [37]. Table 3 Confusion matrix Full size table Where: : It signifies the number
    of examples that essentially fit into the “- class” but are inaccurately assigned
    to the “+ class” by the technique. : It denotes the number of samples that essentially
    fit into the “+ class”; but are erroneously allocated to the “-class” by the technique.
    : It signifies the number of records that fit into the “+ class” and are fit into
    the “+ class” correctly by the technique. : It signifies the number of instances
    that fit the “-class” and are fit into the “- class” precisely by the technique.
    Here, the subsequent assessment measures [37, 76] were employed to evaluate the
    correctness of , , , , , , , and the devised classifier. i. : This metric measures
    the percentage of precise projections accomplished by the classifiers. It is the
    “per-class” efficiency of a classifier for the classification of multiple classes,
    as shown in Eq. 4. (4) Here, is accuracy, is the amount of for the “ith” class,
    is the total of for the “ith” class, “fni” is the total of for the “ith” class,
    is the count for the “ith” class, and “v” is the number of classes. Higher accuracy
    of classifiers suggests that the majority of predicted classes forecast by the
    classifiers match the actual categories. ii. : It gives the as described before.
    With respect to “multiclass” classification, it provides the mean indication of
    the effectiveness of “single class” classification. It facilitates determining
    the categories as represented in Eq. 5. (5) The higher “sensitivity” of classifiers
    demonstrates that they can detect the accurately. iii. :It signifies the ratio
    of examples fitting into the “- class” that are correctly forecasted as “- class”.
    Eq. 6 indicates the “specificity” ( ) in case of classification of multiple classes.
    (6) A classifier having higher specificity can detect accurately. iv. : It determines
    the likelihood that a prediction that is “+” is accurate. For “multiclass” classification,
    precision offers a mean metric of how agreeable each category is for a specific
    category after comparison with the other categories. Eq. 7 denotes the scientific
    interpretation of . (7) The higher of the classifiers demonstrates their ability
    not to label a negative sample as positive. v. : It is a combination of and .
    For multiclass classification, the demonstrates the relationship between the actual
    “positive” classes and the predicted classes. The equation for is depicted in
    Eq. 8: (8) Where denotes “F-score” and is the weighted harmonic mean of and .
    A high value for the classifiers suggests that the classifiers are precise without
    missing a considerable number of instances. 4 Experimental results This section
    compares the findings between the proposed and other classifiers. The outcomes
    of the cloud framework are also discussed. 4.1 Experimental results for classification
    This section discusses the trial outcomes obtained for different classifiers for
    every agricultural dataset. The following classifiers from previous works were
    implemented on the “real-world” and “benchmark” agricultural datasets to compare
    the evaluation of our devised method with previous works. classifier from the
    works [11, 12, 19, 21, 23, 26,27,28, 31, 32]. The classifier was run with “gaussian”
    and “kernel” distributions. In our effort, as the farming information consisted
    of “continuous” distribution, the technique with “kernel” distribution gave effective
    results than the “gaussian” distribution [56, 57]. from the works [23, 34]. In
    our paper, the “multinomial logistic regression” was utilised for “multiclass”
    classification. from the works [7, 14, 15, 20, 26, 28]. For this purpose, we used
    with one hidden layer and ten neurons. from the works [11, 27, 34]. In our effort,
    “k” was changed from “1 to 46” for “real-world datasets” as the number of records
    in the dataset was “2148”. Likewise, it was altered from “1 to 14, 37, 80 and
    26” for “seeds” data with “210” objects, FCT data with “1400” records, LS data
    with “6435” instances, and “ULC” data with “677” examples, correspondingly. “k=10”
    gave good results on the majority of the datasets [56, 58]. algorithm from the
    papers [7, 19, 21, 24, 26]. Additionally, algorithm was compared from the efforts
    [11, 12, 32]. The metrics of impurity utilised in the and algorithms were IG and
    respectively. classifier from the works [31, 34]. In our paper, With the algorithm,
    the number of decision trees was varied from 10 to 100. On most of the datasets,
    classifier with 50 trees provided better results. Additionally, for each “benchmark”
    dataset, we have compared our proposed model with recent works done by authors
    on the same “benchmark” dataset. The details of which are provided below: For
    the “seeds” dataset, the proposed model was compared with the work [38]. This
    work was chosen as it had achieved higher accuracy when compared to other works
    [77,78,79,80] on the “seeds” dataset. For the FCT dataset, the designed classifier
    was compared with the work [63]. We selected this work for comparison as it attained
    higher performance than the other works [81,82,83,84,85,86] on the FCT dataset.
    For the LS dataset, the developed classifier was compared with the work [87].
    This work was selected as it achieved higher accuracy than the other works [80,
    85, 88,89,90,91,92,93,94] on the LS dataset. Finally, for the ULC dataset, we
    compared the findings of the proposed classifier with the results of [95]. This
    work was chosen for comparison as it performed better than the other works [96,97,98,99]
    on the ULC dataset. Table 4 demonstrates the detailed experimental findings of
    the different classifiers for the various performance metrics. Table 4 Detailed
    experimental results for crop yield prediction Full size table 4.2 Trial findings
    on soil texture data The “soil texture” information was gathered from [59]. The
    information was obtained from all the districts of “Karnataka, India”. The file
    is comprised of “2148” soil records with “3” parameters “sand, silt and clay”,
    with “soil texture” as the target category. The “soil texture” category is comprised
    of “12 classes”, namely “sandy soil, loamy sand, sandy loam, loam, silt loam,
    silt, sandy clay loam, clay loam, silty clay loam, sandy clay, silty clay, and
    clay\". For testing purposes, the entire dataset was separated into “70% (1503
    samples)” as “training” information and the rest of \"30% (645 samples)” as “test”
    data. The input parameters were real valued in nature. The target feature was
    categorical in nature signifying one of the “12 soil texture” categories. The
    job was to categorise the records into “12 texture classes” from “3” input parameters.
    Figure 4depicts the evaluation of various classifiers with respect to , , , ,
    and . Fig. 4 Classifier performance on soil texture dataset Full size image From
    Fig. 4, we can observe that the proposed classifier attained accuracy improvements
    of: 17.19% over with k=10 from works [11, 27, 34]. 16.12% over classifier with
    kernel distribution from works [11, 12, 19, 21, 23, 26,27,28, 31, 32]. 14.41%
    over from works [23, 34]. 14.63% over with 1 hidden layer and 10 neurons from
    works [7, 14, 15, 20, 26, 28]. 12.73% over from works [7, 11, 12, 19, 21, 24,
    26, 32]. 13.52% over algorithm from the works [7, 19, 21, 24, 26]. 11.64% over
    the classifier from works [31, 34]. The results show that the developed classifier
    outperformed the existing works in soil texture classification. 4.3 Laboratory
    findings on soil chemical properties This information was gathered from “International
    Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics” (ICRISAT) [9] for categorising
    “soil” using “7” chemical parameters: , , , S, P, , and B. “ICRISAT” had accumulated
    this “soil” information from all the “Karnataka Districts”. The data [9] is comprised
    of “2148” instances. For conducting experiments, the whole information was separated
    into “70% (1503 instances)” as “training” data and the left over “30% (645 instances)”
    as “test” records. The “8” input parameters were the “soil chemical properties”.
    Figure 5 depicts the results of the “classification” algorithms on the soil chemical
    properties datasets with respect to the accuracy metric. The results based on
    other metrics are given in the Table 4. Fig. 5 Classifier performance on soil
    chemical properties dataset Full size image The Table 5 displays the percentage
    improvements in terms of accuracy that were achieved by the proposed over the
    other algorithms on the soil chemical properties dataset. Table 5 Accuracy percentage
    improvements of over existing models on soil chemical properties dataset Full
    size table For the dataset, the purpose was to categorise the “soil” instances
    into “acidic” and “normal” categories with respect to the value. The classifier
    performed with accuracy improvements ranging from 4.1% to 39.62% over with k=2,
    classifier with kernel distribution, and other classifiers. In case of the data,
    the goal was to categorise the “soil” records into “OC deficient” and “OC-sufficient”
    categories based on the volume of existing in the “soil”. The with k=5 was used.
    The achieved accuracy improvements ranging from 8.21% to 20.76%. The “Boron” data
    is comprised of two categories: “boron-deficient” and “boron-sufficient” based
    on the boron content in the “soil”. The outperformed the with k=100 and other
    classifiers, with accuracy improvements ranging from 3.23% to 22.65%. The “Phosphorous”
    file is comprised of two categories, viz. “Phosphorous-deficient” and “Phosphorous-sufficient”
    based on the volume of P in “soil”. The performed with accuracy improvements of
    4.01% to 16.98% over with k=100 and other classifiers. In the case of the “potassium”
    file, the aim was to categorise information into two categories: “Potassium-Sufficient”
    and “Potassium-Deficient” categories based on the volume of K prevailing in the
    “soil”. The achieved significant accuracy improvements of 3.23% to 10.55% over
    the with k=100, and other classifiers. For the “EC dataset”, the intention was
    to categorize the soil samples into 2 classes viz. “normal” and “injurious” dependent
    on values of the soil samples. The attained accuracy improvements from 4.25% to
    14.33% over with k value of 10, and other classifiers. The “Sulphur” file is comprised
    of two categories, viz. “Sulphur-deficient” and “Sulphur-sufficient” categories,
    reliant on the “sulphur” substance in “soil”. The achieved accuracy improvements
    of 3.57% to 20.22% over with k=10, with kernel distribution, and other classifiers.
    Overall, the above-mentioned results show that the proposed classifier achieved
    more accurate classifications based on “soil chemical properties” than previous
    works. 4.4 Trial findings on standard farming data In this section, we explain
    the findings of trials that were performed on four standard farming datasets,
    viz. seeds [62], FCT [63], LS [64], and ULC [65]. 1. Trial findings of classification
    on seeds file: The “seeds” file was acquired from the UCI ML Database [62]. For
    conducting the experiments, 210 records of the seeds dataset were partitioned
    into two labelled set of “147” records, and “test” records with “63” instances.
    The input parameters constituted “7” numerical attributes of “wheat kernels” of
    type “real”. The target feature is comprised of 3 classes related to the “3” wheat
    categories (“Kama, Rosa, and Canadian”). For the “seeds” file, the aim was to
    categorise the information into “3” categories, denoting the wheat categories
    centred on the “7” input traits. Figure 6 demonstrates the performance assessment
    of the techniques using the different measures. From Fig. 6, we can deduce that
    the devised classifier was the superior classifier with high values of , , , ,
    and . The results show that the proposed classifier correctly classified the seed
    data into three wheat seed varieties more accurately than previous works. Additionally,
    we assessed the outcomes of our proposed classifiers on the seeds dataset with
    the experimental results of [38]. The reasons for choosing this work were mentioned
    at the start of Sect. 5.1.2. The authors used the complete gradient descent clustering
    algorithm (CGCA) to classify the seeds dataset. They found 92% accuracy by using
    the CGCA algorithm. Our proposed model achieved 99.65% accuracy which is significantly
    higher than the results obtained by the author. Figure 7 illustrates this comparison.
    The proposed classifier achieved significant accuracy improvements of 7.65% over
    the CGCA on the seeds dataset. These improvements can be credited to certain reasons.
    Firstly, CGCA can become stuck in local minima because of the gradient descent
    technique. Hence CGCA is not capable of ascertaining the global optimum as compared
    to . Secondly, since CGCA uses clustering, it is hard to choose the best possible
    number of groups [38]. 2. Experimental results of classification on forest cover
    type (FCT) file: The source of the FCT file was the “UCI” ML database [63]. To
    conduct experiments, the whole file comprised of “1400” records was separated
    into “974” records as a “training” set and the rest of “426” records as the “test”
    file. There were 54 real valued input parameters. The dependent feature is comprised
    of “7” categories, equivalent to “7” FCT. The task was to categorise the information
    into one of the “7” FCT classes from the “54” input attributes. Every category
    was coded with a numerical value. Figure 8 shows the implementation of numerous
    techniques on the FCT file. As demonstrated in the Fig. 8, the designed classifier
    achieved accuracy improvements ranging from 15.34% over classifier to 35.92% over
    the technique with k=2. The above findings show the dominance of the proposed
    classifier over the existing methods for classifying the FCT data into 7 classes.
    We have compared our proposed classifier with the work [100], which used linear
    discriminant analysis (LDA) and to classify the FCT dataset. The authors obtained
    accuracies of 58.38% using LDA and 70.58% using . Figure 9 illustrates the comparison
    of the authors work using LDA and with our proposed classifier for the FCT classification.
    The proposed model achieved significant accuracy improvements of 27.54% over LDA
    and 15.34% over respectively for FCT classification. LDA does not perform well
    on imbalanced datasets. The FCT dataset was imbalanced, and hence LDA performed
    poorly. The has the problem of getting stuck in local minima and tends to overfit.
    Hence performed poorly when compared to model on the FCT dataset. 3. Trial findings
    of classification on “satellite land image dataset” This file was obtained from
    “UCI ML database” [23]. It comprised of “6435” samples with “36” input features
    and 1 dependent feature comprising of “7” categories. The input attributes correspond
    to multispectral values of pixels of a satellite image. For the purpose of experiments,
    the entire information of “6435” samples were separated into “4435” samples as
    “training data” and the rest of “2000” records as the “test set”. The objective
    was to categorize soils into 7 classes based on 36 input attributes obtained from
    the values of pixel of a satellite image. As shown in fig.ref FCT-res, the designed
    classifier improved accuracy by 15.34% over the classifier and 35.92% over the
    technique with k=2.The above findings show the dominance of the proposed classifier
    over the existing methods for classifying the FCT data into 7 classes. We have
    compared our proposed classifier with the work [100], which used linear discriminant
    analysis (LDA) and to classify the FCT dataset. The authors obtained a 58.38 percent
    accuracy using LDA and a 70.58 percent accuracy using . Figure FCT-Paper-res compares
    the authors’ work using LDA and to our proposed classifier, , for FCT classification.
    The proposed method was compared with the work [151] as illustrated in Fig. 11.
    The author made use of the associative neural network technique. The explanation
    for choosing this work was already explained at the beginning of Sect. 5.1.2.
    The author achieved an accuracy of 92.2% for the associative neural network model
    on the land satellite image dataset. Our proposed model achieved accuracy of 95.56%.Hence,
    achieved significant improvement of 3.36% over the associative neural network
    developed by author Tetko. These improvements can be attributed to the fact that,
    the associative neural network tends to get stuck in a local minimum. The model
    was able to resolve the constraint of the associative neural network by obtaining
    a global optimum solution. 4. Experimental results of classification on ULC dataset:
    This information was gathered from “UCI ML repository” [65]. It consists of “677”
    records comprised of “147” input parameters and 9 categories. The information
    is taken from an image of high resolution. The “677” records were divided into
    a “training” data of “508” records and a “test set” of “169” records for conducting
    trials. The job was to categorize information into “9” forms of ULC based on “147”
    columns taken from the airborne picture. The trial findings of different classifiers
    on the ULC dataset are described in Fig. 12. As depicted in Fig. 12, the proposed
    classifier achieved accuracy improvements ranging from 4.61% over classifier to
    53.39% over with k=3. In comparison to previous works, the above findings clearly
    show that the proposed algorithm correctly classified the ULC dataset [65] into
    9 land cover types. We have also compared our proposed model with the work [95].
    The motivation for selecting this work was already explained at the start of Sect.
    5.1.2. The authors used classifier to classify the ULC dataset. Figure 13 gives
    the comparison of our developed model with the effort [95] on the ULC dataset.
    The authors in [95] achieved an accuracy of 84.42% on the ULC dataset by using
    the classifier. Our proposed model attained accuracy of 89.09% on the ULC dataset.
    Hence, was able to attain improvement of 4.67% over the authors classifier on
    the ULC dataset. These improvements can be because of classifier undergoing overfitting
    and requiring large datasets to train. Table 6 provides the accuracy improvements
    (in %) of the proposed classifier over existing classifiers on the benchmark datasets.
    As noticed from the Table 6, the devised attained with significant accuracy improvements
    ranging from 5.97% to 10.76% on “seeds” data, 15.34% to 35.92% on FCT dataset,
    4.57% to 13.71% on LS dataset, and 4.67% to 53.39% on the ULC dataset. Fig. 6

    the “computational overhead” in terms of the execution time taken by the different
    classifiers on “small-sized”, “moderate-sized”, and “large-sized” datasets is
    analysed. In case of the “small-sized” data, the “seeds” file [62] with “210”
    instances, for “moderate-sized” data, the FCT [63] having “1400” instances, and
    for the “large-sized” data, the LS file containing “6435” rows were considered.
    Figure 14 demonstrates the “time” in “seconds” taken by each of the classifiers
    for the datasets [62,63,64]. Table 6 Accuracy percentage improvements of over
    existing models on benchmark dataset Full size table Table 7 Descriptions of notations
    Full size table Fig. 14 Assessment of classifiers with regards to execution time
    Full size image In the case of the “small-sized seeds dataset”, the execution
    times of , , , proposed , , , and classifiers were 0.32, 0.47, 0.57, 0.60, 0.62,
    0.65, 0.74 and 0.83 “seconds”, correspondingly. With regards to the “moderate-sized
    FCT dataset”, the execution times of , , , proposed , , , and classifiers were
    0.44, 0.59, 0.62, 0.64, 0.66, 0.67, 1.54 and 6.692 “seconds”, correspondingly.
    With respect to the “reasonably large-sized land satellite image dataset” the
    execution time of , , , proposed , , , and classifiers were 0.54, 0.653, 0.79,
    0.82, 0.84, 0.88, 3.2 and 12.29 “seconds”, correspondingly. The procedure was
    slightly slower than and procedures because of the additional time required for
    computing . As comprises of calculating the proximity among every “test sample”
    and “training samples” it took more time than other techniques. Nevertheless,
    was observed to take more time since it included likelihood calculations. The
    key inference that can be drawn from this is that although the devised consumed
    more time than and the distinction was negligible. In farming sector, the correctness
    of SC is more crucial than the “time taken” to categorise the “soil” records.
    Also, the negligible computation overhead of can be disregarded since the “accuracy”
    of the classifier was significantly superior in comparison to other techniques.
    4.6 Experimental setup and results for proposed cloud framework for soil classification
    This section gives the trial setup of the farming cloud framework alongside the
    outcomes in the form of snapshots of the developed soil classifier application.
    Initially, the soil classifier application was executed using “Matlab R2016a”
    on “windows 10 environment”. However, as “Matlab” was not supportive of building
    “cloud-based applications”, the “Matlab” programs were transformed into “Java”
    program. The “Vaadin 8” framework was utilised in the “Eclipse JEE Oxygen” environment
    since “Eclipse” is user-friendly [103,104,105,106] and “Vaadin 8” provides rich
    support for developing “Java” web applications [73]. The soil classifier application
    was deployed on the Heroku cloud since it provides support for faster development
    of cloud-friendly Java applications [68]. The Amazon S3 was used as the cloud
    storage since it provides 99.9% durability, scalability, and availability [74].
    4.6.1 Experimental results Figure 15 illustrates the snapshot of the developed
    soil classifier. Fig. 15 Soil classification as a service in cloud environment-scenario1
    Full size image As presented in Fig. 15, the different text fields are given,
    which denote the different input soil features. As soon as the “Classify-chemical
    button” is clicked, the category of the soil related to the “input soil chemical
    parameters” is shown. Likewise, once the “Classify-texture button” is clicked,
    the equivalent class of soil texture is presented. On the other hand, consumers
    can select a “text/excel” file having the “soil input parameters”. The designed
    classifier is used to perform the soil classification. Figure 16 demonstrates
    the “scenario-1” once the consumer enters the “soil parameters” via the “text
    fields”. Fig. 16 Soil classifier outcomes in cloud environment-scenario1 Full
    size image Figure 16 describes the different “soil classes” found when the “soil
    parameters” are inserted. The picture clearly demonstrates the outputs obtained
    when the corresponding values for “soil chemical properties” and “soil texture”
    were entered. Figure 17 describes the 2nd scenario when the consumer selects a
    “text/excel” file comprising of the “soil parameters”. Fig. 17 Soil classifier
    outcomes in cloud environment-scenario1 Full size image From Fig. 17, it is clear
    that when the consumer selects a file comprising of the “soil chemical properties”,
    the “soil samples” get classified on attribute into “normal” and \"acidic” categories
    as per the values of the input. The values of , , , , and in percentage is also
    displayed. 5 Conclusion In this work, a soil classifier technique using ML was
    designed. To provide soil classification as a farming service, the soil classifier
    was deployed on the cloud. This effort deals with the task of classifying soil
    samples using their “texture” and “chemical properties” as inputs. The categorization
    of soil based on “texture” was performed using 3 parameters, viz. “sand”, “silt”,
    and “clay”. The soil samples were classified into twelve “texture classes” as
    given by “USDA”. We also performed classification of soil using its “chemical
    properties”, namely , , , P, B, , and K. Using the values entered for these “chemical
    properties”, the “soil” was classified into “sufficiency/deficiency” classes.
    The key objective was to design a “soil classifier” capable of categorising “soils”
    focused on their “texture” and “chemical properties” with superior precision.
    The proposed was designed for categorising the “soil”. With the intention of testing,
    several “real-world datasets” obtained from “NBSS, Karnataka, India” [59] for
    “soil texture” classification and “ICRISAT” [9] for “soil” classification based
    on “chemical properties”. Comprehensive tests on farming standard datasets viz.
    “seeds” [62], FCT [63], LS [64] and ULC [65] were additionally performed. The
    classifier techniques were assessed utilising different “performance metrics”,
    namely: , , , , and . The devised outperformed from [7, 11, 12, 19, 21, 24, 26,
    32], from [7, 19, 21, 24, 26], from [11, 27, 34], from [11, 12, 19, 21, 23, 26,27,28,
    31, 32], from [23, 34], from works [34,35,36, 41, 47, 49], and classifier from
    works [31, 34] with accuracy improvements ranging from 10% to 43%. For the benchmark
    datasets of seeds, FCT, LS, and ULC, our proposed soil classifier was compared
    with the works of Charytanowicz et al. [38], Blackard and Dean [100], Tetko [87],
    and Johnson and Xie [95], respectively.The results demonstrated considerable improvements
    in the performance of our proposed classifier over previous works on the same
    benchmark datasets. The proposed classifier performed with accuracy improvements
    ranging from 11.64% to 17.19% on the soil texture dataset; from 3.23% to 36.39%
    on the soil chemical properties dataset; from 5.97% to 10.76% on the seeds dataset’;
    from 15.34% to 35.92% on the FCT data; from 4.57% to 13.71% on the LS dataset;
    and from 4.67% to 53.39% on the ULC dataset. Our final work was the development
    of an agricultural cloud framework for delivering “soil classification as a service”
    to consumers, including farming agencies, cultivators (landowners). Our study
    showed that currently there are no systems providing “soil classification as a
    service” in India. The SC application was deployed on the Hk cloud. Major benefits
    comprise “ ” accessibility for accessing the SC application from anywhere at any
    time. Additionally, information loss is prevented as it is kept in cloud space,
    where it is protected. The SC application may be utilised by soil specialists,
    who then may offer useful recommendations to cultivators. The proposed was “deployed”
    on the Hk cloud. Information storing was performed in the AS3 cloud in which information
    was maintained in a kind of entity known as “blobs”. The farming framework was
    capable of delivering dependable and precise services to the consumers. 6 Future
    work Any scientific work can be enhanced and presents several opportunities for
    improvement. Likewise, this work can also be improved using some of the points
    mentioned below. Presently, this farming system is offering just one service,
    and that is “soil classification”. Extra facilities, like a forecast of the crop
    rate in shops, might be delivered. The correctness of the soil classifier module
    can be additionally boosted by designing advanced techniques. The developed software
    is not scalable as it becomes computationally more expensive as the information
    grows exponentially. Parallel soil classifier applications can be developed in
    the future to manage massive amounts of farming data.This will lower the overhead
    due to computation. Dynamic updating of information may be provided in the future
    by using an “application programming interface” (API). The API can be made available
    to farming organisations to update the information dynamically. The devised software
    is currently accessible as a network application in the Hk cloud. Mobile apps
    can be developed in the future to deliver farming services. Likewise, the designed
    soil classifier application is available in English. In the future, “Natural Language
    Processing” methods may be incorporated into the software to increase its accessibility
    in different local dialects. Extra factors of soil, like its “depth, colour, structure,
    temperature, and water content” that characterise the morphologic soil traits
    can be taken into account for soil classification. Currently, in our work, we
    have not handled the cloud related issues such as scaling, resource management,
    deployment, etc. while providing the cloud service to the end users. In the future,
    we can enhance the current application by taking these cloud issues into account.

  description: Crop prediction is a very difficult feature obtained by different characteristics
    like environment, genotype, and their associations. Policy and decision-makers
    depend on accurate crop yield predictions to ensure timely import and export recommendations
    to reinforce food security. In agriculture, boosting in machine learning (ML)
    is utilized to forecast crop yield. Many boosting ML approaches such as classification,
    prediction, and clustering predict agricultural production. Data mining techniques
    are a mandatory technique for achieving significant solutions for this issue.
    To perform the crop prediction based on different weathers in big data analytics
    is called as Margalef Kernel Perceptron and Winnow Brown Boosting Classification
    (MKP-WBBC) method. MKP-WBBC method for big data-based crop yield prediction is
    split into two sections, namely, feature selection and classification. First Margalef
    Kernel Perceptron-based feature selection is applied to the Crop Yield Prediction
    dataset to select computationally efficient features even in case of huge voluminous
    data. Second, with the unique features selected, Winnow Brown Boosting Classification
    is applied for accurate and precise crop yield prediction. The main contribution
    of the new crop yield prediction method is the potentiality to produce accurate
    predictions and reasonable insights in a simultaneous fashion. This was arrived
    at by the training and learning algorithm to choose the unique features and not
    only boosts the results other than enhance the cache hit rate to balance prediction
    accuracy for training data and generalizability to test data. A discussion of
    the results achieved reveals the productive performance of the MKP-WBBC method
    to predict crop yield accurately. Furthermore, results indicate the proposed MKP-WBBC
    can efficiently enhance crop yield prediction performance and analysis the existing
    methods in different parameters likes, feature selection accuracy, feature selection
    time, error rate, and air pollution prediction accuracy.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Kanjirapally, India SECTION I. Introduction
    In India, around 10% of human population are doing agriculture. The primary source
    of elevating Indian economy and cut-down poverty is agriculture. Thus, agriculture
    field is invaluable for everyone in the world. Many formers are not aware of which
    yield to produce based on the climatic conditions and choosing right pesticide
    to protect the crop from pests. Recent advancements in Information and Communication
    Technology (ICT) are useful for many fields in Customer Relationship Management
    (CRM), Medicine, Banking etc. ICT can also be incorporated in agriculture field
    for storing, retrieving and data processing for the purpose of effective decision
    making. This will boost the agriculture growth and improve economic viewpoint
    [11]. Detecting the associations, patterns, and making interpretation from agriculture
    data is a thought-provoking task. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel
    methodology and making use of the sets of state-of-the-art approaches and mechanism
    accessible for data analysis and the extraction of knowledge in databases. Recently,
    opinion mining is frequently used in business analytics to understand the subjective
    reasons why customers are or are not responding to something. i.e., what motivates
    customers to buy a product? What do they consider of the user experience? This
    field can also be used in the areas of psychology, political science, sociology
    and to analyse trends, opinions, measure reactions, etc. Sentiment analysis is
    one kind of Natural Language Processing (NLP), analytics on multimedia objects
    and statistics to retrieve and identify the opinion of text into positive, negative,
    or neutral categories. Basically, opinion mining is used to arrive a binary decision:
    product is good or bad, users like or dislike something. The essence of sentiment
    analysis or opinion mining is often applied to reviews, blogs and social media
    to assist marketing and consumer service teams recognize the feelings of consumers.
    This approach can be applied in agricultural field to classify the pesticides
    based on the farmers'' opinion. By using this kind of approach one can identify
    which pesticide is less harmful when compared to other pesticide products. The
    paper outlines its primary contributions as follows: Detailed reviews on the data
    mining in agriculture field are discussed. The novel model for opinion mining
    in agriculture is presented. Extensive experimental results are reported. The
    subsequent section of the article is organized in the following manner: Conventional
    research works pertaining to data analytics in agriculture are mentioned in the
    next section. Section 3 details the proposed NLP based approach. Section 4 discusses
    the experimental analysis and results with synthetic datasets. Conclusion of this
    research work is presented with a view of future works in Section 5. SECTION II.
    Related Work Sentiment analysis, a critical subfield of natural language processing,
    has gained significant attention across various industries for its potential in
    understanding and extracting valuable insights from textual data. In recent years,
    researchers have recognized the utility of sentiment analysis in the agricultural
    sector. This literature review delves into the existing research in this emerging
    field, discussing key findings, methodologies, and areas for future exploration.
    Cruz et al. [1] presented an approach to characterize the crops using Principal
    Components Analysis-Genetic Algorithms (PCA-GA). In this approach, PCA is employed
    during the pre-processing phase, while GA is utilized to improve the classifier''s
    performance. The PCA-GA method is primarily applied for the design of classification
    models and the establishment of meaningful correlations. The experimental assessments
    demonstrate enhanced classification rates and the generation of characterization
    models for crops in the agricultural domain. The result of this model may be beneficial
    to agricultural researchers and farmers. Weather and soil conditions are regarded
    as crucial factors in making informed decisions in agriculture. Predictions of
    soil state in an effective way can greatly enhance the decision-making process
    in agriculture area. Analysis of soil moisture and temperature is basically done
    by using a land-surface model (LSM). This approach intends to generate models
    heat transfer and moisture flow between the soil subsurface and atmosphere. Myers
    et al. [8] proposed a machine learning algorithm which uses a regression tree
    method (Cubist) to predict state of a soil based on current state of a soil and
    atmospheric conditions. In recent days, agriculture field are considered to be
    a contemporary business. To make effective agricultural decisions, advanced methods
    are used in this field [4]. A statistical approach is employed by a Miller et
    al. [7] to extract unseen information that makes use of data analytics and remote
    sensing. The results formed by this method leads to directs policies and standards
    that takes our country''s food needs from the farm quickly. Marinkovic et al [6]
    devised a method for the prediction of agricultural yields using M5P model. In
    this study, a dataset encompassing measurements of diverse environmental factors
    and annual yields for maize, soybean, and sugar beet was employed. To enhance
    the accuracy of the proposed model, a feature selection method based on genetic
    algorithms was implemented. When large-scale surveys (i.e., Census) conducted
    pertaining to the agriculture, bringing back the evenness of data regarding cultivation
    areas and sum of livestock is the major issue. To resolve this issue, balancing
    problem based on optimization is used [5]. Other models such as linear, quadratic
    and mixed integer are presented by Gianpierol et al. [5]. Mixed integer model
    is preferred and used for treating unbalanced data records which is illustrated
    from the experiments. Nowadays, the modern technologies turn their views towards
    agriculture. It is trying to minimize the intellectual distance between agriculture
    and technology. This leads to the rise of various tools to build a bridge between
    the gaps of agriculture and the modern world. So, there is an essential need for
    algorithms and data mining concepts to collect, store, organize, diagnose, define,
    describe and predict the problems entered by the farmers/agriculture-based department
    people. This can be only achieved by mining concepts like pattern matching, obtaining
    keyword etc. Hence thisacts as a first step for agriculture and modern world connectivity
    [10]. According to geographers, the agriculture is defined as the “THE GAMBLING
    OF MONSOON”. So there is a huge demand for right and exact decision making. In
    olden days, there is no advanced technologies like satellites, GPS etc. even though
    our ancestors do agriculture well and good because of exact sequence of monsoon
    but now due to illogical climatic change we need some tools and algorithms to
    make decisions. The distribution of agricultural products is a vital and foremost
    activity because the agricultural product cannot kept fresh for more days. For
    example, the cultivated sugarcane after twenty-four hours lose 80 percent of its
    sucrose content. So the exact decision and speed of distribution in agriculture
    is always essential [9]. The availability of seeds in market is enormous. Each
    type of seed satisfies some special purpose like low water consuming, low consuming
    of pesticide. So the farmers choose their appropriate seed based on many criteria
    like quality, quantity, price, colour etc. hence their no exact method to select
    their seed appropriately. Therefore, there arises an introduction of tools to
    classify the seeds under some categories like soil type, usage etc. This will
    help the farmers to distinguish the types of seeds [3]. The priority makes us
    more comfort because it prevent us from confusion in choosing and decision making.
    The priority can be set by using data analysis and mining. To achieve this we
    are need of machine learning algorithms. The implementation of algorithm inside
    a laboratory is not enough we have to apply it in outside real world. By doing
    so, we can initiate innovative ideas in agriculture [2]. The long term approach
    and short term approach is suitable and necessary for all activities especially
    for agriculture. The short term approaches like weather forecasting and long term
    approach like policies and plans. These approaches can be fixed by a proper analysis
    process. There is a need of predictive analysis. By predicting we can equip our
    self to face any natural or manmade consequences [13]. One of the primary applications
    of sentiment analysis in agriculture is the evaluation of agricultural products
    through after-sale reviews on the internet. Cao et al. [14] emphasizes the importance
    of addressing information asymmetry between consumers and producers in the digital
    age. This asymmetry often leads to misjudgment of the positioning of agricultural
    products in the market, potentially harming consumer interests and hindering the
    development of the agricultural market. To mitigate this issue, the study proposes
    a sentiment analysis algorithm based on an enhanced Bidirectional Encoder Representations
    from Transformers (BERT) model with a symmetrical structure. This advanced algorithm
    aims to capture complete semantic information in sentence-level feature vectors
    derived from agricultural product evaluations. Using this approach, the authors
    achieved a substantial increase in F1 value compared to the original BERT model,
    showcasing its potential to efficiently determine the emotional sentiment expressed
    in the text. Regman et al. [15] focuses on the opinions of agrarian experts and
    their role in enhancing crop productivity. The study, set in Punjab, Pakistan,
    collects textual data through questionnaires to understand the impact of various
    agricultural inputs on crop productivity, including seed quality, soil quality,
    climate changes, and more. By employing machine learning techniques for sentiment
    analysis, the research provides a descriptive analysis of experts'' opinions,
    which can be used to increase crop yields and raise awareness among farmers. This
    unique approach to gathering recommendations from agrarian experts through sentiment
    analysis is a notable innovation, particularly for the Pakistani agricultural
    sector. Ensuring the transformation and upgrading of agri-products is crucial
    for agricultural development. Li et al. [16] studied the challenge of matching
    the demanders and suppliers of creative agri-product schemes based on demand and
    expected implementation effectiveness. The proposed sentiment analysis-based method
    encompasses a structured process, which involves processing demand documents,
    forming matrices for demand and supply, measuring matching degrees, and constructing
    a multi-objective optimization model. This method is demonstrated through an empirical
    analysis for nut agri-products in XS village. The results illustrate how to generate
    optimized matching pairs for creative agri-product schemes between demanders and
    suppliers, thereby promoting the development of innovative agri -products. While
    sentiment analysis has seen extensive use in various industries, Novak et al.
    [17] points out that it remains relatively underutilized in the agrarian sector.
    This study takes a broader perspective by examining the scientific literature
    related to sentiment analysis in agriculture. The authors aim to provide an overview
    of its applications, common methodologies, and potential benefits within the agricultural
    domain. This review also identifies areas where sentiment analysis can be most
    beneficial and suggests directions for future research, indicating a growing interest
    in harnessing the power of sentiment analysis for agricultural purposes. This
    is a time to transform from agriculture to precision agriculture. This method
    already used in many activities and disciplines like military functionalities
    and geotechnical engineering. We can analyze both infra and inter environment
    for planting, seeding, watering and cultivation. The spatial data mining is a
    specification analysis for particular place. So it can give the most optimized
    solution for problems while facing in agriculture. SECTION III. Proposed Approach
    The primary objective of the research study is to design a machine learning model
    to effectively classify the pesticide product in an unstructured dataset. This
    work uses sentiment analysis based approach to perform classification. The novel
    model for pesticide classification is depicted in Figure 1. Figure 1. A model
    for Sentiment Analysis in Agriculture Show All This novel model includes three
    phases: Data Pre-Processing Generation of Machine Learning Model Evaluation A.
    Data Pre-Processing Data pre-processing step intends to prepare the data set to
    generate the machine learning model. This step include many sub-processes such
    as Tokenize Filter Tokens Filter Stop-Words Stemming Tokenization involves the
    process of breaking down a body of text into individual units, known as tokens,
    which can encompass words, phrases, symbols, or other meaningful elements. This
    set of tokens serves as input for subsequent processes like parsing or text mining.
    Filter Tokens the process of cleaning the text by using suitable methods (For
    example, Filtering the text by length). Filter stop words is used to filtering
    out common stop words in English like a, an etc. Because these words are not used
    for data analysis. Very familiar words such as “and” and “the” are habitually
    filtered out to improve algorithm performance. This method is referred to as stop
    word removal. Stemming is getting base form of a word, for instance if there are
    words respect, respected, respectfully, in all cases the base form respect will
    be extracted [12]. B. Generation of Machine Learning Model In this step, effective
    machine learning algorithms are used to perform effective classification of pesticide
    which aids farmers to make decision so as to save the agricultural land from harmful
    pesticides. C. Evaluation In this process, various machine learning algorithms
    are experimented and among these best algorithm is selected based on the set performance
    measures. The following table shows the list of algorithms used for experimentation.
    Table I. Set of algorithms utilized for experimentation SECTION IV. Experimental
    Results The Blog data is collected from the web which consist user opinions. Opinion
    mining techniques were employed to extract insights and sentiments regarding the
    use of pesticides in agriculture. The proposed work was experimented with blogpost
    data by using various classification algorithms and made a comparative study.
    The Table. 2 shows set of performance measure used for experimentation. Table
    II. Performance measure used for experimentation From Figure 2, it is observed
    that accuracy SVM-Evolutionary algorithm (78.68%) is better than when compared
    to other classification algorithms. Classification error of the SVM-Evolutionary
    approach is low when compared to other approaches. This can be observed in Figure
    3. From Figure 3 and 4, it is concluded that SVM-Evolutionary approach produces
    better precision and recall respectively. In terms of Root Mean Squared Error
    and Root Relative Squared Error also, it is clearly known that SVM-Evolutionary
    is suitable machine learning method for this scenario. Figure 2. Comparative Analysis
    of various algorithms against Accuracy Show All Figure 3. Comparative Analysis

    All A comprehensive comparative study is done by taking other performance measures
    into consideration (Table 3). From all, it is concluded that SVM-Evolutionary
    is best method for NLP-based approach to classify the pesticides using blog data.
    This approach has optimized model parameters and improves generalization. This
    method is also capable to handle imbalanced datasets, noisy data, and reduces
    computational complexity. Figure 6. Comparative Analysis of various algorithms
    against Root Mean Squared Error Show All Figure 7. Comparative Analysis of various
    algorithms against Root Relative Squared Error Show All Table III. Record of comparative
    analysis using various performance measures SECTION V. Conclusion The paper proposes
    a novel framework for applying opinion mining in blog for assisting the farmers
    to select good pesticides for crop cultivation. This approach aids the farmer
    to classify the pesticide whether it is good or bad based on the farmers comments.
    Agro agency also make use this approach to evaluate their products accordingly
    they take necessary action. In future, this work can be extended to perform multimodal
    sentiment analysis. Multimodal sentiment analysis deals with the analysis of sentiments,
    attitude, and opinion from audio-visual mode. Authors Figures References Keywords

    talent of the Aboriginal american tentative. In India, land yield substantially
    depends on rainfall atmospheres. Comestible grain civilization generally depends
    on mizzle. Current recommendation in the end the unborn crop yield and an interpretation
    follow be made because help the sloggers to inflate the crop result of crops.
    Yield conjecture is an main land question. Former drovers used to read their yield
    from earlier infirmity yield information. Consequently, for this vastly train
    dossier in crop conjecture, skillful are differing plans or algorithms, and circular
    those algorithms we can read crop yield. Helter-skelter nature full of factory
    and beast life cleverness is used. exercising all these algorithms and circular
    relation between quality, professed are growing range of requests and the act
    of Solid data study procedures in product. Beget the invention of new cultural
    VCRs and forms the husbandry field is kindly debasing. Because these, abundant

    instrument place skillful leads to an sick gests . Presently, new association
    do n’t have knowledge about the civilization of the crops at the sanctioned period
    of sphere and at the right place. Next to these conservation styles the flash
    of or in the atmosphere atmospheres are still being converted against the abecedarian
    point like soil, water and air that beget success anxiety of morsel. By analysing
    all these issues and questions like rainfall, heat and eclectic determinants,
    skillful is no applicable judgment and lores to overcome the position join by
    us. In India, skillful are eclectic practices to increase the business-related
    progress committed of product. Skillful are diversified practices to increase
    and help the crop yield and the point of the crops. train digging is farther profitable
    for prognosticating crop yield result. SECTION II. Literature Survey N. V Suresh
    Krishna et al. [1] The paper titled \"Machine Learning Algorithms for Crop Yield
    Prediction in Real-Time Scenarios\" presents a comprehensive review of the existing
    literature on crop yield prediction, particularly in real-time settings. The authors
    give special attention to vital soil parameters like nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium,
    as well as temperature and humidity, which are known to significantly influence
    crop yield. The study highlights the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms,
    specifically showcasing the Random Forest algorithm, which achieves an impressive
    91.2 percentage accuracy in predicting crop yield. Through a comparative analysis
    with other existing methods, the authors demonstrate the superiority of their
    data-driven approach for real-time crop yield prediction, offering promising prospects
    for advancements in agricultural practices. Malika Kulyal et al. [2] The research
    paper titled ml approaches for crop recommendations offers a comprehensive and
    original assessment of the literature , focusing on the implementation of ml techniques
    for accurate crop yield estimation. The study emphasizes the paramount significance
    of precise crop yield predictions in effective agricultural planning and management.Throughout
    the paper, the authors thoroughly investigate a variety of ml algorithms including
    , decision trees, SVM , random forests and deep learning methods Moreover, they
    extensively explore various data sources , such as weather , soil and crop management
    data aiming to enhance the predictive performance of the models. The research
    findings reveal the remarkable accuracy achieved by ml algorithms in predicting
    crop yields , with particular attention to the superior capabilities of DL techniques.
    However , the authors duly acknowledge that the optimal performance of DL algorithms
    necessitates substantial data and computational resources. To address the challenges
    in agricultural yield prediction , the study proposes potential future research
    directions , with an urgent emphasis on improving data quality and developing
    efficient and scalable algorithms in this domain. G R Kishore et al. [3] The paper’s
    literature survey explores previous research on context-aware recommendation systems,
    emphasizing deep learning approaches. Notably, Zhang et al. (2017) proposed a
    method using a CNN to learn latent features of users and items, complemented by
    matrix factorization for modeling user-item interactions. Similarly, Wang et al.
    (2018) presented a deep learning approach utilizing a CNN for latent feature learning
    and an RNN to capture temporal dynamics in user preferences. The proposed approach
    in this paper excels over these methods by incorporating a CNN to capture complex
    user-item representations, an RNN to model temporal dynamics, and demonstrating
    superior performance on real-world datasets. Raj Kumar et al. [4] The research
    introduces a unique context-aware deep learning system for rolling element bearing
    problem diagnostics. It performs better in accuracy and robustness than cutting-edge
    techniques. The framework combines a context-sensitive network with an attention
    mechanism. The study highlights the significance of early bearing fault identification
    and examines current approaches and difficulties. The framework’s developers intend
    to expand its application to other fault diagnosis issues and investigate various
    deep learning architectures. Anika Nyeki et al. [5] Crop Yield Prediction in precision
    agriculture utilizes artificial intelligence (AI), big data, and IoT to optimize
    crop production. A survey questionnaire collects data on factors like soil composition,
    weather conditions, and farming practices. Statistical techniques, such as regression
    analysis and factor analysis, analyze the data to identify key factors influencing
    crop yield. AI algorithms process real-time data from IoT sensors to provide accurate
    yield predictions. This approach enables data-driven decision-making, resource
    optimization, and sustainable farming practices. Yeshanbele Alebele et al. [6]
    Utilising Gaussian Kernel Regression to Predict Crop Yield From Optical and SAR
    Imagery.The article proposes a framework that combines optical and SAR (Synthetic
    Aperture Radar) imagery to estimate crop yield. The approach utilizes a Gaussian
    kernel regression model and was tested on maize and soybean crops in China. The
    results demonstrate enhanced accuracy compared to using only optical or SAR imagery
    individually. This integrated approach can improve crop yield prediction and provide
    valuable insights for agricultural decision-making. Abigail Bola Adetunjina et
    al. [7] The main goal of the study is to predict agricultural yield utilising
    machine learning techniques including CNN, ICC SVM, Hybridised ANN, and Multiple
    Linear Regression.It proposes the use of a survey questionnaire to collect customer
    data and statistical techniques like regression analysis and factor analysis for
    data analysis. Additionally, the study suggests utilizing synthetic reviews to
    extract and synthesize features, specifically for crop yield prediction (CYP).
    The objective is to create an accurate and efficient model for crop classification
    and estimation by incorporating deep learning (DL) techniques and CYP. Aparna
    Venugopal et al. [8] predicting crop yield using machine learning techniques.
    they created Data Gathering and Preprocessing: Compile data on the numerous elements
    that influence crop productivity. Model choice and instruction: To create a prediction
    model, choose the best machine learning algorithm and train it using the preprocessed
    and chosen data. Pallavi shankarrao et al. [9] crop yield forecast utilising several
    machine learning methods. The article includes. The conceptual framework entails
    employing machine learning techniques to forecast agricultural yield based on
    environmental conditions and giving farmers precise forecasts for well-informed
    decision-making. Sujatha et al. [10] To estimate crop yields based on weather
    characteristics and environmental elements, researchers explore diverse data mining
    techniques, including k-means, SVM, ANN, and regression analysis. The objective
    is to enhance crop output and provide valuable information to farmers. For this
    purpose, the proposed SML (Statistical Machine Learning) approach leverages historical
    data and employs the random forest algorithm. Ms kavita et al. [11] The study
    complicated accumulating a inclusive dataset encompassing differing determinants
    doing crop affair, to a degree rainfall dossier, soil characteristics, real yield
    records, and product practices. The dataset was cautiously preprocessed to guarantee
    dossier character and excludediscrepancies.Machine literacy algorithms were thus
    working to expand index models. These models were trained on the preprocessed
    dataset to capture the complex connections’ tween recommendation variables and
    crop yield. The models were created to statement well and produce accurate forecastings
    on retireddossier.The study displayed the influence of machine intelligence in
    crop yield estimation. The prognostic models shown forceful conduct, furnishing
    precious wit into the implicit productivity of colorful crops in India. This data
    can help policymakers, land experts, and directors in making conversant opinions
    had connection with crop election, means distribution, and yield growth. Gohar
    Ghazary et al. [12] The cooperative study by Gohar Ghazaryan, Olena Dubovyk, Simon
    König, Ehsan Eyshi Rezaei, and Sergii Skakun check the use ofmulti-origin subsidiary
    figure race and deep instruction for crop yield guess. The chemists engage tool
    wit styles for file group, preprocessing, point beginning, and yield cast. By
    going to affection conceits and superior deep knowledge models, they accomplish
    more appropriate crop yield estimations outstanding to settled patterns. The study
    focal points the aftereffect of affection conceits and engine brilliance in accessory
    favorite fancies for land preparation and beginning disposal. Overall, the investigation
    determines to the field of land dossier study, disclose the influence ofmulti-origin
    fastening metaphors and deep instruction styles in crop yieldguess.v Anil Suat
    Terliksiz et al. [13] In Lauderdale County, Alabama, the United States of America,
    the paper outlining beliefs examines the application of deep impacting animated
    whim-whams organ networks (DNNs) for predicting soybean yield.It addresses the
    disadvantages of usual crop yield guess procedures and focal points the benefits
    of DNNs in landing complex connections and patterns. The study resorts to a inclusive
    dataset, containing rainfall dossier, soil traits, and culture practices. The
    DNN model is trained to design recommendation appearance to soybean yield principles,
    and the results explain hopeful veracity. The paper emphasizes the significance
    of leading machine intelligence styles in reconstructing land executive and optimizing
    crop operation programs. Andrew craneDroesch et al. [14] To forecast crop production
    and evaluate the effects of climate change on agriculture, machine learning approaches
    such as ERL Parametric production Models, neural networks, and semiparametric
    neural networks are used.A hierarchical study of important features and data separation
    are made possible by the decision tree technique, which is used to predict crop
    yield. In the warmest places and scenarios, our method provides more nuanced projections
    and insights, offering a less dismal picture.By capturing intricate patterns and

    \"Crop Prediction System using Machine Learning,\" seeks to create an algorithmic
    system based on machine learning for accurate and efficient crop recommendations,
    as depicted in Fig. 1. It requires the simple three step approach to design it.
    As the crop related data like Soil (N,P,K )values, PH level, Rainfall level and
    location is uploaded into the system, and it will then generate the type of crop
    suitable to grow. 1. Data collection Gather historical data on crop yields, weather
    patterns, soil properties, and management practices for a specific region or farm.
    This data can be obtained from government agricultural agencies, research institutions,
    or your own records. 2. Data analysis Analyze the collected data to identify patterns
    and correlations between different variables. Look for trends in crop yields based
    on weather conditions, soil fertility, pest management, and other factors. Statistical
    analysis techniques, such as regression analysis or time series analysis, can
    be used to uncover relationships and make predictions. 3. Model selection To construct
    the system of crop recommendations, we will choose the most relevant machine learning
    algorithms. Using the Pre-processed data, we will train the models and then enhance
    their precision and effectiveness. Fig. 1. Intelligent Crop Prediction using Machine
    Learning Show All SECTION V. Methods A. Decision Trees Decision Trees are supervised
    learning models that are used for classification and regression applications.
    They have a tree-like structure, with decision nodes representing characteristics
    and leaf nodes reflecting outcomes. They create predictions by traversing the
    tree depending on the test conditions. Decision trees provide interpretability
    since each route in the tree indicates a collection of criteria that leads to
    a result. They handle category and numerical characteristics as well as complicated
    interactions. They can, however, overfit, and pruning or ensembling approaches
    such as Random Forests may reduce this. Overall, Decision Trees are adaptable,
    transparent models for identifying patterns and generating predictions in a variety
    of areas.The decision tree process will be executed, as depicted in Fig 3. Fig.
    2. Graphical representation of Decision Tree Show All B. Random Forest Search
    The Random Forest algorithm is a popular supervised learning approach. It is mostly
    used to solve regression problems. Random Forest is built on the idea of assembling
    decision trees. A huge number of decision trees collaborate as an ensemble in
    the Random Forest classifier. Each tree predicts a class separately, and the final
    prediction is selected by majority vote. This method enhances the model’s accuracy
    and resilience.The Random Forest method will be implemented as illustrated in
    Fig 2. Fig. 3. Random Forest Classification Show All C. Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) SVM is used in crop prediction by examining historical data on parameters
    such as weather and soil conditions. SVM can anticipate agricultural output for
    future seasons by establishing a decision boundary. This allows farmers to make
    more informed decisions about resource allocation and planning.The utilization
    of SVM’s capability to handle non-linear correlations and its robustness, rendering
    it a potent tool in crop prediction, will be demonstrated in Fig 4. Fig. 4. Linear

    wain( Categorization and Regression Tree) type of educational institution- nique
    uses the Gini indicator as a measure of pollution or innocence while construction
    decision saplings. An trait accompanying a reduced Gini indicator is favored to
    one accompanying a extreme Gini indicator. It alone produce double splits, that
    are yield for one wain algorithm exercising the Gini indicator. Gini index can
    be calculated using the below formula: Gini Index=1−∑jPj2 (1) View Source An trait
    accompanying a reduced Gini indicator is favored to one accompanying a extreme
    Gini indicator. It alone produce double splits, that are produce for one wain
    invention using the Gini indicator. SECTION VII. Result Agriculture depends on
    crop prediction, which is accomplished using machine learning methods like Decision
    Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and Random Forests. As seen in Table 1
    and Fig 5, Random Forests outperform other models, achieving a remarkable 99.31%
    accuracy. SVMs categorise crops based on characteristics, while decision trees
    classify crops based on aspects like weather and soil. An ensemble technique that
    excels is Random Forests. They can manage complex data. Farmers gain from high
    accuracy when planning, allocating resources, and practising precision farming.
    These models are integrated into agribusiness and agricultural management plans.
    Important factors include data reliability, model upkeep, and ethical considerations.
    In conclusion, the accuracy of Random Forests makes them a useful tool for enhancing
    crop output and agricultural decision-making. A. Acurray Comparision of different

    Decision Tree methods, Random Forest offers a better combination of accuracy,
    resilience, interpretability, and scalability for crop recommendation.Feature
    relevance analysis, robustness to noisy data, high accuracy, ability to handle
    complicated relationships, and interpretability make Random Forest a good choice
    for crop recommendation. In order to provide trustworthy recommendations for crop
    yield depending on different criteria, it aggregates estimates from numerous decision
    trees. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Student pass

  description: Soil features are important in agricultural production because they
    allow crops to develop more efficiently through root feeding while using less
    energy. Data mining is a new area of study in crop production analysis. In the
    agriculture industry, yield prediction is crucial. Crop fertility and crop output
    rise when fertiliser application, growth, and root growth rate are stable. Farmers
    must be equipped with technology in order to make the greatest use of the farm's
    limited resources. Analyse the different associated parameters such as location,
    alkalinity and pH value of the soil. Furthermore, third-party apps such as APIs
    for temperature and weather, nutrient value and type of soil in that place, soil
    composition, quantity of rainfall in that region are used to compute percentages
    of nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). All of these
    data properties will be examined, and the data will be processed using a variety
    of machine learning approaches to build a classification model. In a changing
    climate, the technique can help determine the best place to study crop adaptation
    under certain nutrient supply as well as provide insight into nutrient appropriate
    evaluations for specific crops.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Gorakhpur, India SECTION I. Introduction
    INDIA has long been considered to have agriculture as its core and main cultural
    practice. Agriculture practice includes raising crops, dairying, and other related
    activities. The majority of the population in India is employed in agriculture,
    which uses 60% of the nation''s land and provides for 1.2 billion people. Today,
    when conditions change, several factors-including meteorological, geographic,
    organic, and more have an impact on crop productivity [1]. Choosing which crops
    to sow and when based on the condition of the soil presents a challenge for farmers.
    Due to seasonal temperature variations and the scarcity of resources like soil,
    water, and air, the Use of various fertilizers is also unclear the crop yield
    rate is decreasing steadily in this scenario. Agricultural processes should be
    modernized for the benefit of farmers. Robots, electronics, sensors, and automation
    technology related to precision Agriculture are all part of contemporary farming
    practices. The goal of this technology is to lighten workloads and boost revenue
    [2]. Farmers need to be provided technological solutions in order to provide unbiased
    service and a decision support system to handle anomalies. Unexpected rainfall,
    poor crop selection, and lower yield keep farmers unprepared to deal with risks
    that results in loss. The most practical answer is to provide the farmer with
    the necessary assistance while remotely monitoring the growth of the crop. With
    a substantial advancement in image processing and satellite-based remote sensing,
    a novel solution can be created for the user [3]. Machine learning algorithms
    are utilized in categorization and recommendation system. The three stages of
    the machine learning process are data gathering, model construction, and generalization.
    Depending on the network architecture used, deep learning enhances machine learning
    by increasing model complexity and modifying the input with various functions
    that enable data representation through many layers of abstraction [4]. A significant
    benefit of Deep Learning is feature learning, or indeed the automatic extraction
    of features from original data. The ability to identify unknown things such as
    anomalies rather than just a collection of existing items is a key aspect of the
    Deep learning model, which uses the homogeneous properties of an agricultural
    field to discover faraway, badly obstructed, and unknown objects [5]. Fig. 1.
    Machine learning process Show All SECTION II. Related Work Hasan et al. [1] in
    this work the authors proposed the system that suggests the crop and fertilizers.
    They used input characters like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) and,
    temperature, humidity, and rainfall of the area to predict the specific crop to
    be cultivated as well as the fertilizers to be used. They estimate the most appropriate
    fertilizers using machine learning algorithms like Support vector Machine (SVM)
    and Random Forest (RF), k-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN). Kakaraparthi et al. [3] the
    proposed study offers machine learning algorithms for classifying land cover using
    remote sensing data and a dataset of satellite images. In order to predict two
    straightforward classes: Vegetation and Non-vegetation. They employed the RF,
    Minimum Distance (MD), Gradient Tree Boost (GTB), Naive Bayes (NB), and Classification
    and Regression Trees (CART) classifiers. Malyadri et al. [4] the system''s two
    objectives are to forecast crop yield and recommend the right fertilizers. The
    algorithms Ada-boost and RF were used to estimate agricultural yields and recommend
    fertilizers, respectively. Crop yield was predicted using six factors: State District,
    Season, Crop, and Region. In order to suggest fertilizers, temperature, humidity,
    moisture, soil type, of the area were taken into consideration. Ten widely cultivated
    crops were selected for this classification. Doshi et al. [5] Authors have suggested
    a model that focuses on Precipitation, Monthly Rainfall (in mm), Monthly Temperature
    (in °C), and Location. The farm''s latitude, longitude, elevation, and distance
    from the sea are all contained in the parameters. Algorithms for machine learning
    were used. Decision Tree (DT), K-NN, RF, and convolutional neural networks (CNN).
    Ray et al.[6] The approach combines the information from past predictions, current
    market rates, and the best crops to plant so that farmers can get an idea of what
    crops can be grown. They used DT for prediction. In turn, this provides price
    forecasts for that specific crop for the following 12 months. The suggested approach
    takes into account past, present, and projected rainfall totals as well as pricing
    from the prior year. The price of the crops is forecast based on these criteria,
    and more precise forecasts are generated using machine learning algorithms. Dhanya
    et al.[7] The system is designed to perform tasks like analyzing the quality of
    seeds, determining the type of soil, managing irrigation, analyzing plant health,
    controlling weeds, managing livestock, and estimating yield using unnamed aerial
    vehicle (UAV) imagery, sensor nodes, and imaging sensors. For image classification,
    convolution neural networks and object detection model for Image classification.
    For livestock management they have used the parameters like, individual identification
    of animal, behavioral recognition, disease identification and growth analysis.
    Srivastava et al. [8] this paper proposes a universal three-tiered architecture
    that is verified by effective application on crop recommendation. The first module
    comprises feature extraction utilizing Principal component analysis (PCA), Linear
    Discriminant Analysis (LDA) as well as noise removal, data reduction, label encoding,
    and feature extraction. Data analysis and classification is covered in the second
    module, which also covers the machine learning methods DT, RF, NB, and SVM. Testing
    for Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score is a part of the third module. Unal
    et al. [9] Smart Farming Becomes Even Smarter with DL. In this work authors performed
    the analysis regarding disease detection, crop classification, pest detection,
    fruit detection and smart agriculture. The datasets are collected with sensors
    and cameras where deep learning has been applied for improving the smart agriculture
    practices. Rahman et al. [10] the developers of this method used machine learning
    techniques to classify soils and suggest crops based on soil characteristics.
    Training phase and testing phase are the two steps of the approach. Chemical characteristics
    of soil are included in the soil dataset as classes. They used soil samples from
    six upazillas in the Khulna district of Bangladesh. Using a variety of chemical
    properties, machine learning approaches identify soil series, and suitable crops
    for those soil series are proposed using geographic attributes. Harlianto et al.
    [11] a comprehensive study of soil classification using computer vision and deep
    learning methods. The accuracy of the algorithms was compared in this study after
    the authors reviewed various algorithms. Chougule et al. [12] the authors of this
    study proposed an ontology knowledge base-based recommendation system that is
    created as an Android application that is connected to a server. To access the
    system, the user must first register an account and log into the android application.
    After that, he has two options: crop suggestions or fertilizer recommendation.
    The RF method is used to predict crops, and the k-means algorithm is used to prescribe
    fertilizers. Jeevaganesh et al.[13] this study aims to show how an CNN with multiple
    input and output layers strained with the back-propagation algorithm can be used
    to identify the fundamental soil nutrients, such as N, P, and K, and to determine
    the fertilizers and amendments required for pasture cultivation. Moreno et al.
    [14] in this paper, authors suggested utilizing machine learning to prescribe
    fertilizers. The goal of this work is to design a symbolic logic programme that
    can suggest plant food based on the time of year and the soil''s N, P, and K content.
    The worth of the N, P, and K and season is evaluated by the fuzzy system to compute
    the acceptable quantity of plant food. Narvaria et al. [16] the study makes use
    of information produced by a multispectral camera mounted on a lightweight UAV.
    In order to increase the model''s accuracy, different combinations of vegetation
    indices and textural aspects were researched and evaluated CNN. Preetha et al.
    [17] in this study, ML algorithms for classifying soil types are compared. The
    authors compared the various soil classification machine learning techniques,
    including DT, KNN, and RF. Modi et al. [18] the SVM machine learning technique
    and data visualization were employed by the authors in this work. The accuracy
    obtained for this work is 98.00%. Dhanapal et al. [19] agriculture is the key
    economic pillar of the economy and uses supervised machine learning algorithms
    to anticipate crop prices. The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the country is
    made up largely of the agricultural sector. More over half of the land is used
    for agriculture to meet the needs of the local population. Modernizing farming
    operations is necessary to satisfy the stringent criteria. To assure farmers''
    earnings, their research intends to more effectively address the issue of crop
    price forecast. It applies machine learning techniques on different data sets
    to get better results the investigation of crop price prediction is the primary
    subject of this paper. The suggested methodology, which employs the DT algorithm
    to accurately forecast the results, proves to be the best suitable for the research
    work. Ommeren et al. [20] this study''s main goal was to develop a precise classification
    system for the crops grown on Mali''s smallholder farms (cotton, maize, sorghum,
    peanuts and millet). They used K-NN Classifier and remote sensing with the aid
    of a UAV to accomplish their goal. A: Technologies Used in Soil Classification
    A big aspect of agriculture is soil, there are different features of soil, and
    various types of crops can grow on different type of soil, which can have a variety
    of characteristics. To understand which crops do better in which soil types, we
    need to be aware of their features and traits. In this situation, machine learning
    approaches can be useful. It has made significant progress in recent years. In
    the domain of agricultural data analysis, machine learning is still a novel and
    difficult study area. There are various algorithms which classify soil with the
    help of machine learning, which includes artificial intelligence (AI) techniques,
    including weighted k-NN, bagged trees, and Gaussian kernel-based SVM are used
    for soil classification. Table 1. Methodologies used for soil classification B:
    Technologies Used for Crop Recommendation One of the most important factors that
    directly influences the ultimate yield is crop selection. So, a farmer must take
    a critical decision while selecting a crop, taking environmental conditions into
    account. It might be challenging to select the ideal crop for a particular farm
    because there are so many various factors that could affect the production. Specialists
    are frequently consulted to help farmers to choose the crops, but many farmers
    cannot afford, this expensive and time-consuming alternative. Recent outcomes
    from the application of recommendation systems in agricultural management have
    produced some intriguing and encouraging outcomes. The table 2 shows the review
    research work related to the crop recommendation with the help of machine learning
    techniques Table 2. Methodologies used for crop recommendation C: Technologies
    Used for Weed Detection For the purpose of identifying and preventing plant diseases
    and reducing significant crop losses, the detection of weeds during the cultivation
    process is crucial. However, the traditional methods for carrying out this task
    are expensive, labor-intensive, and put workers at risk of exposure to hazardous
    chemicals. To overcome this problem, we can digital agriculture techniques with
    the help of machine learning algorithms, can be used. Table 3 recommends some
    methodologies used for weed detection. Table 3. Methodologies used for weed detection
    D: Technologies Used for Fertilizer Recommendation Even though soil is important
    in agriculture, the nutrients in the soil directly affect the quality of the crops
    that are grown there. Every crop needs a certain balance of nutrients to survive
    and grow well. While a lack of nutrients may make plants ill, For the use of best
    fertilizer first we have the study the soil type, and find out which nutrient
    soil need to improve the yield, but going through the laboratory procedure is
    very time consuming and costly. To overcome this problem researchers have found
    out alterative which is digital recommendation fertilizer system using various
    algorithm illustrated in table 4. Table 4. Methodologies used for fertilizer recommendation
    E: Technologies Used for Pesticides Recommendation Although certain insect species
    are economically useful, some can seriously destroy agricultural crops. To reduce
    the harm these harmful insects, often known as agricultural pests. They must be
    properly identified and handled in accordance with their species. The table 5
    elaborates the methodologies for the recommendation of pesticides. Table 5. Methodologies
    used for pesticides recommendation SECTION III. Existing System One drawback we
    found in all of these well-known works that have been published was that the authors
    of each study did not focus on all crucial elements that are essential for making
    agriculture digital (either weather or soil) for determining whether crop growth
    will be suitable. However, in our opinion, both of these criteria should be taken
    into account at the same time for the best and most accurate prediction because,
    even though a particular type of soil might be ideal for supporting a particular
    crop, the yield will suffer if the region''s weather conditions are unfavorable,
    the crops are not given the proper amount of fertilizers and pesticides, they
    are not protected from weeds, and others. SECTION IV. Methodology In the Proposed
    work we apply machine learning and Deep Learning to detect the quality of soil,
    and recommend the crop according the type of soil, fertilizers to improve the
    crop yield, weed detection and pesticide recommendation In the Proposed work we
    apply machine learning and Deep Learning to detect the quality of soil, and recommend
    the crop according the type of soil, fertilizers to improve the crop yield, weed
    detection. The increase in crop productivity will subsequently aid in supplying
    the nation''s food needs. The Five elements of the proposed approach include soil
    categorization, crop recommendation, fertilizer recommendation, weed identification,
    and pesticide recommendation. The model consists of five parts, including soil
    classification, crop suggestions, fertilizer recommendation, weed detection, and
    pesticide recommendation. Users are required to register with their basic information,
    including their name, address, country, state, pin code, phone number, username,
    and password, on the online application that is the subject of the proposed work.
    Users must login with a username and password after registration. The sections
    below give a detailed description of the modules. Fig 2 shows the GUI of proposed
    work, now we are working on the main modules of the proposed work, more information
    of modules of the work is given below. Fig. 2. Graphical user interface (GUI)
    of proposed work Show All Module 1. Soil Classification: Soil properties are crucial
    for evaluating, which has an effect on agriculture engineering. Determining the
    soil''s quality could offer more information for creating a more sensible and
    cautious management strategy and implementing it in farmland. We will classify
    the soil according to the color of soil, type of soil particles and the region
    of the soil, through image processing, using this method we will detect to which
    soil belongs which will help the farmer for further cultivation activities, we
    are using machine learning techniques like SVM and CNN for training the model
    Module 2. Crop suggestion: This module will recommend suitable crop to the farmer
    according to the soil type which is detected through the image processing crop
    suggestion is based on temperature, humidity, average rainfall, soil type, of
    the region, This method therefore it will help the farmer to find the most lucrative
    as well as novel crops that can be grown that the farmer has never grown before,
    resulting in better productivity. Module 3. Fertilizer Recommendation: To Predict
    the particular fertilizer to be used we will use the parameters like temperature,
    humidity, moisture and soil type of the region and also crop to be grown. To predict
    suitable fertilizer we are going to use RF Algorithm of Machine learning fertilizer
    prediction process being with the loading the external fertilizers datasets. Module
    4. Weed Identification: Plants that are grown in places where they are not needed
    are known as weeds. It contains plants that are not purposefully seeded. Crop
    yields are reduced by weeds'' they compete with agricultural plants for water,
    nutrients, light, and space. They decrease the quality of farm products, weeds
    can reduce the commercial value of agricultural regions. to remove weeds Module
    5. Pesticide Recommendation: It is not only identifying the pests using image
    processing, but the user would also benefit greatly from pesticide recommendations
    for the projected bug. Insects are treated with pesticides to kill them so they
    don''t ruin the crops and multiply in the fields. If the weather conditions of
    region are not suitable, proper amount of fertilizers and pesticides are not given
    to the crops, crop is not protected from weed, then the yield will suffer. Fig.
    3. System architecture Show All Conclusion Deep Learning and Machine Learning
    are bringing automation capabilities to farming practices. In this work, we discuss
    Deep Learning and Machine Learning for agricultural practice. Specifically, this
    work focuses on five different components which are necessary for farming and
    helps the farmers for getting good yield, knowing the type of the soil is most
    important for farmers; it helps the farmers for further cultivation process. System
    classifies the soil using SVM, CNN with the help of image processing. Some of
    the important soil properties used by the system are color of the soil, texture
    and geographic location of the soil. On the basis of soil type system will also
    recommend the best suitable crops for cultivation, it will also recommend the
    fertilizers which are necessary for improving the crop Weed and Pests also play
    a crucial rule in farming it destroys the crop and reduce the crop yield, to overcome
    this issue system also detects the pests and recommends pesticides, it also identify
    weed present in between the crop. Future Work In the future, the model suggested
    in this research can be expanded to include a component that forecasts crop rotations,
    crop demand and supply, and other economic indicators like retail pricing and
    harvest prices. We can even display government programs designed specifically
    for farmers. This would give a comprehensive forecast that took into account economic
    issues in addition to environmental and geographic ones. Authors Figures References

    Crop Yield Prediction Sugarcane Machine Learning 1 Introduction Agriculture has
    existed since ancient times. The primary source of supplies for meeting people''s
    basic requirements is thought to be agriculture. The Rigvedic elucidates various
    agricultural activities, such as ploughing, irrigation, and cultivation of fruits
    and vegetables. Not only Rigveda but also there are traces of cultivation during
    the Indus Valley civilization thriving period [1]. Crop yield improvement is one
    of the major activities of agriculture management. Soil parameters like Nitrogen
    (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), moisture of the soil, soil texture, etc.,
    and climate parameters such as rainfall, humidity, temperature, etc. play an important
    role for crop yield improvement [2]. Accurate yield estimation, improved productivity
    and improved decision-making are essential in agriculture. Indian farmers are
    facing several problems such as unpredictable climate, limited irrigation facilities,
    and quality of water and soil [3]. In this scenario to improve productivity, the
    role of the latest information technologies, like the Internet of Things (IoT),
    Data Mining, cloud computing, Machine Learning, etc. have been vital over the
    years. In crop yield prediction, machine learning plays an essential role [4,5,6,7,8,9].
    Ananthara et al. [10] have used the parameters like soil type, soil and water
    pH value, rainfall, and humidity and achieved an accuracy of 90%. Everingham et
    al. [11] developed a yield prediction model for sugarcane with the help of a random
    forest (RF) ML algorithm. The parameters used in this research are maximum and
    minimum temperature, rainfall, radiation, Southern Oscillation Index. The performance
    of the model is based on RMSE and R Squared. Natarajan et al.[12] developed a
    crop prediction model with the help of a machine learning technique using a hybrid
    approach. Researchers have used Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Driven Nonlinear Hebbian
    Learning (DDNHL) for the hybrid approach. The model''s performance was based on
    RMSE, MAE, and Classification Accuracy (CA). Kumar et al. [13] developed a crop
    yield prediction model using a ML technique and the parameters used in this research
    are rainfall, soil parameter like (PH, N, P, K, OC, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, & S). Charoen-Ung
    & Mittrapiyanuruk developed the sugarcane yield prediction model in the year 2018
    and 2019 using different parameters such as Soil type, plot area, groove width,
    water type and archived an accuracy of 71.83%. And Plot characteristics, Plot
    cultivation scheme, and rain volume and archived an accuracy of 71.88% [14, 15].
    Kale & Patil proposed a prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
    algorithms. The parameters used in this research are Cultivation area, crops,
    State, District, Season & The performance of the model is based on RMSE, MAE,
    MSE and achieved an accuracy of 90% [16]. Khaki & Wang used deep neural networks
    to predict crop yield in the United States and Canada based on genotype and environmental
    data. Authors have used Lasso, shallow neural networks (SNN), and regression tree
    (RT) for the comparison and the performance of the model- based RMSE and achieved
    12% accuracy [17]. Medar et al. [18] proposed the sugarcane yield prediction model
    with the help of a long-term time series and support vector Machine (SVM) ML algorithm.
    The parameters used in this research are temperature and soil temperature of the
    soil, evapotranspiration, humidity, moisture of the soil, sunshine duration, dew
    temperature, and precipitation. Saranya & Sathappan built an ensemble MME-DNN
    yield prediction model with the use of soil, weather and climate data [19]. Rale
    et al. [20] developed a prediction model for crop yield production by using machine-learning
    techniques and comparing the model performance of different linear and non-linear
    regression models using 5-fold cross-validation. Kang et al. [21] studied the
    effect of climatic and environmental variables on maize yield prediction. Researchers
    have used Long-short term memory (LSTM), Lasso, Support Vector Regressor, XGBoost,
    Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Random Forest for the comparison and the performance
    of the model-based on RMSE, MAE, R, MAPE. Prasad et al. [22] proposed a cotton
    crop yield prediction model using random forest (RF) machine learning algorithms
    with the help of climate data. The performance of the model is based on the coefficient
    of determination (R2) and achieved an accuracy of 0.83. Kanimozhi & Akila developed
    crop yield prediction model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm.
    The parameters used in the research are Location, Humidity, rainfall, Mintemp,
    Maxtemp. Wind_speed, Mean_temp. The performance of the model is based on RMSE
    & archived an accuracy of 80% [23]. Agarwal & Tarar developed a hybrid prediction
    model using the machine learning algorithm such as Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    and Deep learning algorithm such as Long-short term memory (LSTM). Researchers
    have used Random forest (RF) for the comparison. The performance of the model
    was based on precision, recall and achieved an accuracy of 97% [24]. Ansarifar
    et al. [25] presented a comparative analysis of linear regression, stepwise regression,
    Lasso regression, Ridge Random forest, XGBoost, Neural network, and Interaction
    regression for the prediction of the crop yield using different datasets of the
    crops. To calculate the performance of the model based on relative root mean square
    error (RRMSE). Interaction regression reached the minimum errors across the produced
    crop yield models. Dash et al. [26] proposed the yield prediction(YP) model using
    SVM and a decision tree ML algorithm. The parameters used in this research are
    rainfall, humidity, temperature, sunlight, and soil pH. Summary of literature

    Forest (RF), and decision tree regression machine learning algorithms are the
    most widely algorithms used for the sugarcane crop yield prediction. The review
    also confirms that the major parameters used for prediction are Rainfall, humidity,
    temperature, sunlight, soil (pH, N, P, K, OC, Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, & S), type of the
    soil. Main contributions of this work are: Analysing a correlation between sugarcane
    crop yield and various soil and climatic parameters. Prediction of sugarcane yield
    by utilizing regression machine-learning algorithms. Our work specifically focuses
    on the western regions of Satara district, Maharashtra, India, which is known
    for its diverse agro-climatic areas. Further we examined three regions within
    this area, including plain regions (PR), drought-prone regions (DPR), and sub-mountain
    regions (SMR), all of which are known for cultivating sugarcane as a major crop.
    2 Materials and Methods Figure 1 shows the methodology followed for this study.

    from the year 2000 to 2015. Table 2 shows the source description of the data collected
    for the study area for all the three regions. Table 2. Table 2 Full size table
    Soil moisture (soil_m), precipitation (ppt), vapor pressure (vap), actual evapotranspiration
    (aet), maximum temperature (tmax), and minimum temperature (tmin) these parameters
    were used in the current study for the sugarcane yield prediction (YP). 2.2 Data
    Pre-processing After data collection, the data cleaning was done by applying missing
    value processing methods like treatment of null values. The outliers were also
    removed to get the data ready for the analysis. 2.3 Pearson Correlation Coefficient
    (PCC) PCC was calculated on the datasets of every agro-climatic region to understand
    the effect of distinct parameters in the dataset, which affect the crop yield
    prediction (Eq. 1) [28]. $${r}_{xy }=\\frac{\\sum_{i}^{n}\\left({x}_{i}-{x}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)\\left({y}_{i}-{y}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)}{\\sqrt{{\\sum

    Yield Prediction Using Machine Learning (ML) Algorithm As the predicted value
    of yield will be Numerical, the category of algorithms selected will be regression
    type. The Gradient Boosting regression, Random forest, Decisiontrees Regression,
    Adaboost Regression machine learning (ML) algorithm is applied in current study
    for sugarcane yield prediction (YP). Gradient Boosting Regression: Gradient boosting
    regression is a ML algorithm that allows for the optimization of any differentiable
    loss functions by building an additive model in a forward stage-wise manner. The
    negative gradient of the supplied loss function is used to fit a regression tree
    at each stage [29]. Algorithm: Random Forest Regression: Random forest is an ensemble
    machine-learning algorithm that creates a regression tree using the subset of
    feature and bootstrap samples [8, 29]. The algorithm is as follows: we choose
    a bootstrap sample from Ts, where Ts(i) stands for the ith bootstrap, for each
    tree in the forest. Then, using a modified decision-tree learning algorithm, we
    learn a decision tree. The procedure is changed as follows: at each node of the
    tree, we randomly select a subset of the features f ⊆ F, where F is the set of
    features. Then, rather than splitting on F, the node splits on the best feature
    in f. After that, the node splits based on f''s best feature rather than F''s.
    F is significantly smaller in practice than f. Sometimes the most computationally
    expensive part of decision tree learning is choosing which feature to split. We
    significantly speed up the learning of the tree by reducing the collection of
    characteristics. Algorithm: Decision Tree Regression: Decision trees are supervised
    machine learning algorithms that are based on information. They have a tree structure
    comparable to a flow diagram, with each internal node indicating an attribute
    analysis, the branch depicting the test outcome, and each terminal node defining
    the class name [8, 29]. The decision tree has two stages: i. Build a Decision
    Tree ii. Pruning Decision Tree The training dataset is split recursively using
    the best criterion in the first stage until all or almost all of the data in each
    partition have the same class label. Consecutive branches are minimised during
    the pruning stage to build the tree in a way that effectively generalises the
    model. To improve specific criteria in the decision tree, pruning often entails
    traversing the decision tree from the bottom up or from the top down while deleting
    the noisy and outlier nodes. Algorithm: Adaboost Regression: The AdaBoost regression
    is a meta-estimator that starts by fitting a regression on the original dataset,
    then fits further copies of the regression on the same dataset, but with the weights
    of instances changed based on the current prediction’s error [29]. By adjusting
    the weight of the training set, the AdaBoost algorithm is started. The training
    set (x1, y1), (x2, y2)…, (xn, yn) where each xi corresponds to instance space
    X and each label yi is in the label set Y, which is identical to the set of {-1, + 1}.
    It designates Wm as the weight for the training example in round m as Wm(i). At
    the beginning (Wm(i) = 1/N, i = 1,…, N), the same weight will be set. Algorithm:
    2.5 Model Evaluation The efficiency of a machine-learning model is determined
    by comparing it to various performance criteria or utilizing various evaluation
    methods. Performance of above models is assessed using following evaluation metrics:
    Adjusted R 2 : The R-squared adjusted for the number of predictors in the model
    is known as adjusted R-squared (Eq. 2) [28]. $$\\mathrm{Adjusted }\\,{\\mathrm{R}}^{2}=\\left\\{1-\\left[\\frac{(1-{\\mathrm{R}}^{2})(\\mathrm{n}-1)}{(\\mathrm{n}-\\mathrm{k}-1)}\\right]\\right\\}$$
    (2) where, R2 = Sample R-square \\(k\\) = Number of predictors variables n = Total
    sample size Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Mean Absolute Error is the arithmetical
    mean of the absolute difference between the actual and predicted observations
    (Eq. 3) [4, 28]. $$\\mathrm{MAE }=1/\\mathrm{n}\\sum_{j=1}^{n}|{y}_{j}-{y}_{j}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}|$$
    (3) where, i  =  1, 2 …n observations \\({y}_{j}\\) = actual observation \\({y}_{J}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\)
    = predicted observation Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Root Mean Square Error
    is the measure of how well a regression line fits the data points (Eq. 4) [28].
    $$\\mathrm{RMSE}=\\sqrt{{\\sum }_{j=1}^{n}\\frac{{\\left({y}_{j}-{y}_{j}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\right)}^{2}}{n}}$$
    (4) where, \\({y}_{j}\\) = actual observation \\({y}_{J}^{\\mathrm{^{\\prime}}}\\)
    = predicted observation 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Pearson Correlation Coefficient
    (PCC) Pearson correlation coefficient of soil & climate parameters with a crop
    yield of agro-climatic regions is depicted in Table 3. The result shows that climate
    parameters such as tmax and tmin of this parameter are positively correlated in
    DPR and negatively correlated in PR and SMR. It indicates that climate parameters
    i.e. tmax & tmin are more effective parameters for DPR than PR and SMR. Soil parameters
    like soil moisture (soil_m) and climate parameters like precipitation (ppt) are
    positively correlated in PR, DPR and SMR. It indicates that these two parameters
    are more effective parameters of all three region. In the PR and DPR climate parameters
    such as vapor pressure (vap) and evapotranspiration (aet) are positively correlated
    and negatively correlated SMR. It indicates that vapor pressure and evapotranspiration
    more effective parameters of PR and DPR as compared to SMR. Table 3. Correlation
    between Soil & Climate Parameters with Crop Yield for the Study Area Full size
    table 3.2 Relationship Between Soil and Climate Parameters with Crop Yield for
    the Study Area The correlation of the parameters for the Plains, Drought Prone,
    and Sub-Mountain Agro-climatic regions. For plains regions (PR), it is observed
    that soil parameters like soil moisture (soil_m) and sugarcane yield is positively
    correlated. The climate parameters such as precipitation (ppt), vapor pressure
    (vap), and actual evapotranspiration (aet) are positively correlated with sugarcane
    yield, were as maximum temperature (tmax), and Minimum temperature (tmin) are
    negatively correlated. The negative correlation of temperature with crop yield
    indicates that as the temperature reduces the water holding capacity of the soil
    is retained and which is very useful for sugarcane yield prediction. For drought
    prone regions (DPR) the soil parameters like soil moisture(soil_m) and climate
    parameters such as precipitation (ppt), vapor pressure (vap), actual evapotranspiration
    (aet), maximum temperature (tmax), and minimum temperature (tmin) are equally
    important for the sugarcane crop production in the DPR. Due to water scarcity
    in the drought prone regions the smallest change in these parameters affect the
    crop yield.In correlation between sugarcane crop yield with soil and climate parameters
    of the sub mountain regions (SMR). Here it has been observed that soil parameters
    like soil moisture (soil_m) and climate parameters such as precipitation (ppt)
    are positively correlated with sugarcane yield. The other climate parameters such
    as vapor pressure (vap), and actual evapotranspiration (aet), maximum temperature
    (tmax), and minimum temperature (tmin) are negatively correlated with sugarcane
    yield. It indicates that soil moisture and precipitation are effective parameters
    for the sugarcane crop production as compared to the other climate parameter such
    as vap, aet, tmin & tmax in the sub mountain regions. 3.3 Evaluation of Machine
    Learning Models Table 4 shows the performance of the model of sugarcane yield
    prediction for Plain, Drought Prone, and Sub Mountain agro-climatic regions. Gradient
    Boosting regression showed accuracy scores of 85.33% for Plains, 69.62% for Drought
    Prone, and 61.68% for Sub-Mountains agro-climatic regions respectively and the
    lowest accuracy scores were of Random Forest regression having 38.19% for Sub
    Mountains, 74.68% for Plains, 62.47% for Drought Prone, and 38.19% for Sub Mountains.
    It is observed that the accuracy score of the Plains regions is highest as compared
    to the other regions such as Drought Prone and Sub-Mountain regions. Table 4.

    Full size table Figure 2 depicts Actual vs Predicted crop yield. It is observed
    that predicted yield values are influenced positively by sample number and the
    trend between actual and predicted values is directly related. It can be inferred
    from the figure that actual values show a significant drop for sample numbers
    ranging from 6 to 9. Actual and predicted crop yields converge almost at the same
    point for sample number 11. Fig. 2. Actual vs Predicted crop yield Full size image
    4 Conclusion This study highlights the significance of considering the diverse
    agro-climatic regions in predicting crop productivity. The Gradient Boosting algorithm
    was found to be more effective than other machine learning algorithms in predicting
    sugarcane yield in the plain, drought-prone, and sub-mountain regions, with accuracy
    scores of 85.33%, 69.62%, and 61.68%, respectively. Moreover, the study identified
    crucial soil and climate parameters, such as soil moisture, precipitation, vapor
    pressure, actual evapotranspiration, and temperature, that influence sugarcane
    yield. The results imply that farmers can use the prediction model developed in
    this study to enhance sugarcane productivity. However, the study has limitations,
    including its focus on only the western parts of Satara district in Maharashtra
    and limited consideration of soil and climate parameters. Future research should
    address these limitations by incorporating these parameters to develop a more
    comprehensive sugarcane yield prediction model. References Kale, S.S., Patil,

    Gradient boosting Machine learning 1 Introduction With agriculture employing more
    than half of our population and accounting for nearly one-fifth of our economy,
    crop and grain prices play an important role in our economy. Our economy is heavily
    reliant on agriculture and related professions (approximately 55% of working professionals
    are employed in this sector), but we are still not very advanced in terms of the
    numerous factors that affect production and producing ways that enable smart agriculture
    for improved yields. The research began with the concept of crop planning, which
    is now more important than ever for a sustainable, climate-resilient food system.
    Yield forecasting is a critical agricultural issue. Farmers are currently suffering
    from significant losses due to barren land, climate change, and a market glut.
    There are other unknowns to contend with. Predicting future pricing expectations
    is extremely critical for managing and selling things at the optimal time to maximize
    income and avoid loss. The volume of data in Indian agriculture is enormous, making
    it an ideal subject for data mining solutions. Machine learning is a useful technique
    for predicting agricultural yields and determining which crops to plant and what
    actions to perform during the crop growing season. Several machine learning algorithms
    have been employed to improve crop prediction studies. Machine learning techniques
    are used in a variety of industries, from anticipating customer phone usage to
    evaluating customer behavior in supermarkets. Agriculture has been applying machine
    learning techniques for a number of years. Crop prediction is a difficult problem
    in agriculture, and various models have been created and tested thus far. Because
    crop production is influenced by a variety of elements such as weather, fertilizer
    type, soil, and seed, its study demands the use of many datasets. This means that
    estimating agricultural output isn’t a straightforward task; rather, it’s a process
    that requires a lot of effort. Our paper assists in considering rainfall and temperature
    as one of the primary components, and on the basis of prior rainfall data and
    the historical soil data, it will assist us in predicting the optimum crop to
    grow. It’s a pastime for us to embrace technology and harness the power of algorithms
    to raise profits tremendously, by selecting the most profitable crop and planning
    sowing, harvesting, and storage of the crops based on accurate predictions. As
    a result, crops can be rotated and harvest storage can be arranged for the highest
    value intake. This also intends to assist people in agriculture and related professions
    in strategizing their raw material procurement. The study compares various supervised
    learning methods such as KNN, decision tree, random forest, and gradient boosting.
    The results show that the proposed machine learning technique, gradient boosting,
    outperforms the best accuracy in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score. 2 Related
    Work A variety of measures have been used to increase the financial output of
    agricultural products. In the creation of our system, we looked at and considered
    a few notable systems. The comparison of previous methods and techniques of data
    mining in agriculture is briefly explained, and several useful citations in the
    field along with applications and future directions of data mining in smart agriculture
    are listed [1, 2]. This paper analyzes and predicts coffee yield data for the
    next harvest period in Kota, Indonesia, with the use of historical data and previous
    trends using the least square method in time series forecasting. The results are
    very high in accuracy and can be used as a reference for some other crops as well
    [3]. Aims to estimate crop prices using historical data, and machine learning
    models are developed using this data as a dataset. Price prediction is done using
    algorithms like random forest regression and decision tree regression [4]. This
    paper helps in analyzing and predicting the environmental conditions such as temperature
    and humidity. This paper describes how the “K-nearest neighbor (KNN)” data mining
    technique is utilized to create a system that uses numeric historical data to
    estimate the climate of a certain region or city [5]. Price prediction of crop
    is similar to paper [3] but with the help of rainfall and WPI data, prediction
    and analysis is done using supervised machine learning algorithm known as decision
    tree regressor [6]. This study gives methods, results, and observations of Rabi
    crop prediction for 2018–20 in a particular region such as Madhya Pradesh. The
    predictions are made using regression methods like decision trees, and the result
    observed is that different methods are better for different crops [7]. This paper
    presents the data mining technique in the agricultural domain and does agricultural
    commodity price forecasting. The classification techniques utilized to classify
    the unknown samples include neural networks and support vector machines. To improve
    their effectiveness, artificial neural networks have been shown to be a potent
    tool for modeling and prediction [8]. This document provides a high-level overview
    of a few data mining approaches that have been used to model agricultural data.
    K-means, bi-clustering, K-closest neighbor, neural networks (NN), support vector
    machine (SVM), Naive Bayes classifier, and fuzzy K-means are just a few of the
    data mining techniques that have been used on agricultural data. In the field
    of agriculture, the report summarizes the use of data mining techniques and predictive
    modeling. Aruvansh Nigam, Saksham Garg, and Archit Agrawal [9] tested the random
    forest machine learning algorithm on an Indian government dataset and determined
    that it has the best yield forecast accuracy. A sequential model using a simple
    recurrent neural network performs better for rainfall prediction, whereas LSTM
    performs better for temperature prediction. The article takes into account factors
    including rainfall, temperature, season, and location when predicting yields.
    When all of the factors are combined, random forest emerges as the most effective
    classifier [10]. The crop selection method (CSM) was created to address the crop
    selection problem and maximize crop net yield rate over the season, resulting
    in maximum economic growth for the country. Crop net production rates could be
    increased using the proposed technique [11]. This research proposed and built
    an intelligent crop recommendation system that farmers across India could simply
    use. Based on a range of environmental and geographical parameters, this approach
    would let farmers make an informed decision on which crop to grow [12]. This research
    proposes a recommendation system for site-specific parameters that uses an ensemble
    model with majority voting technique, as well as random trees, CHAID, K-nearest
    neighbor, and Naive Bayes as learners to recommend a crop with high accuracy and
    efficiency. The boosting technique, which employs weak rules in an iterative process
    to improve accuracy, improved the 97% accuracy of Naive Bayes, a supervised learning
    system [13]. To anticipate the yield, the study used advanced regression techniques
    such as ENet, Kernel Ridge, and Lasso algorithms [14]. Stacking regression improves
    the three regression techniques for better prediction. The random forest technique
    has a high degree of accuracy, but the Naive Bayes classifier has a lower level
    of accuracy because it is dependent on probability [15]. A method for determining
    the best time to apply fertilizers is applied in another paper [16]. 3 Machine
    learning models We outline the use of a few machine learning models that we have
    utilized. 3.1 Decision Tree Classifier [17] It’s a supervised learning technique
    that can be used to solve classification and regression issues. The branches represent
    the decision rules, internal nodes as the features, and leaves of the tree as
    an outcome. Based on the specified conditions, it generates a graphical representation
    for finding all feasible solutions to a problem. 3.2 K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier
    [18] It is a supervised learning technique that draws similarity between the already
    present cases and puts new cases into already existing categories that the case
    might be the most similar to. It simply maintains this dataset throughout the
    training phase, and when it receives new data, it classifies it into a category
    based on its resemblance to the current data. 3.3 Random forest [19] It makes
    use of the construction of various decision trees in the training stage, and then
    takes a majority vote across all of them in the classification stage. The greater
    the number of trees, the higher the accuracy. The predictions from each tree should
    have very low correlations, and along with that, the model should also have some
    actual values in the feature variable so that accurate results can be obtained
    by the classifier. 3.4 Gradient Boosting [20] In the gradient boosting algorithm,
    the term “boosting” refers to the transformation of machine learning from weak
    to strong. Gradient boosting algorithms (GBA) are related to the AdaBoost model,
    in that they are progressive and sequential in nature, exactly like the AdaBoost
    model. In the process of determining the weak decision tree of an algorithm, the
    distinctions between GBA and AdaBoost models can be seen. GBA recognizes the weak
    learner, which is the loss function’s decision tree, using its gradient rather
    than its weight. The gradient boosting algorithm’s loss function is used to optimize
    crop parameters. 4 Proposed system methodology The proposed method is broken down
    into three parts, as shown below. Step 1: Download from the repository. Step 2:
    Implement techniques. Create machine learning models in Step 3. Step 4: Evaluation
    metrics. Figure 1 depicts the proposed methodology’s high-level architecture.
    Fig. 1 Proposed architecture Full size image 4.1 Data collection This step entails
    gathering data from various sources to create an overall that will be used for
    model training. We have used the crop recommendation from Kaggle [21] for this
    study. As given in the Table 1 captured data of seven parameters, viz., temperature
    (in degrees Celsius), potassium content ratio (K), humidity (in percentage), phosphorus
    content ratio (P), pH value, nitrogen content ratio (N), and rainfall (in millimeters)
    across 22 different crops. The environmental conditions and the optimal crop to
    grow in such conditions allows us to train models effectively to make predictions
    for future, unknown conditions. Table 1 Crop recommendation dataset Full size
    table 4.2 Data Preprocessing Figure 2 graph shows the data density distribution
    for temperature and pH values. As can be seen from the graph, the data resembles
    a normal distribution of values for both the parameters. The density distribution
    obtained from shows that ideal growth temperatures and pH values are around 25
    °C and 6.5, respectively. Rainfall affects soil moisture, which in turn affects
    soil pH. For most crops, a soil pH level of 6–7 is desirable. High nutrient crops
    typically have consistent potassium requirements. With heavy rainfall (> 150 mm),
    phosphorus levels are quite high. As seen while using the decision tree model,
    the most important condition in deciding the crop to be grown was rainfall, followed
    by humidity and then potassium levels. The least important attribute when deciding
    on a crop to be grown is temperature Fig. 3. Fig. 2 Data density distribution
    Full size image Fig. 3 Importance of features Full size image 4.3 Dataset Split
    For training the models and validating the model with unseen data, training dataset
    is split into a certain ratio—usually 80:20, 80% of the data is used for model
    training while 20% is used for testing. We also scaled some features using MinMaxScaler
    to remove Gaussian distributions from the features. 4.4 Model Training We considered
    several different models in order to achieve the highest level of accuracy possible.
    KNN, random forest, decision tree classifier, and gradient boosting were all fitted
    on the datasets. 4.5 Model Prediction A “prediction” refers to the information
    output that comes from entering some data and running an algorithm. We may predict
    the model using the predict() method and the test feature dataset. It returned
    an array of expected values as a result. 4.6 Confusion Matrix and Classification
    Report We considered several different models to allow for as high an accuracy
    as possible. KNN, random forest, decision tree classifier, and gradient boosting
    were all fitted on the datasets. Confusion matrix [22, 23] and classification
    report, which are imported from the metrics module in the scikit learn library,
    are created using the actual labels of test datasets and predicted values. The
    confusion matrix depicts the frequency of true negatives, false negatives, true
    positives, and false positives [24,25,26]. A classification report is a statistic
    for assessing the prediction ability of a classification algorithm. The three
    outputs are precision, recall, and the model’s F1-score. Precision [27] refers
    to a classifier’s ability to identify the number of reasonably correct positive
    predictions. For each class, it is determined as the ratio of true positives to
    the sum of true and false positives Eq. (1). $${\\text{Precision}} = {\\text{TP}}/{\\text{TP}}
    + {\\text{FP}}$$ (1) True positive is abbreviated as TP, whereas false positive
    is abbreviated as FP. The capacity of a classifier to locate all positive examples
    from a confusion matrix is referred to as recall. The ratio of true positives
    to the sum of true positives and false negatives for each class is used to compute
    it Eq. (2). $${\\text{Recall}} = {\\text{TP}}/{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}$$ (2)
    where FN stands for false negative and recall is the percentage of properly discovered
    positives. The F1 score is the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall,
    with 0.0 indicating the lowest and 1.0 indicating the best Eq. (3). $$F{1}\\,{\\text{score}}
    = {2} * {\\text{PR}}/(P + R)$$ (3) where P-precision; R-recall. Accuracy [28,
    29] is defined as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number
    of forecasts, Eq. (4). The accuracy of the model is calculated using the scikit
    learn metrics module’s accuracy score() method. $${\\text{Accuracy}} = {\\text{TP}}
    + {\\text{TN}}/{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}$$ (4)
    5 Result analysis Using the dataset as specified above, we have visualized and
    analyzed the various factors conducive to growing crops such as weather conditions
    and soil contents. The trained model can be used to predict the optimal crop over
    a wide range of soil variables, as shown in the training dataset. Further advancements
    to the accuracy of the model’s predictions can be made by including factors such
    as pesticide amount, weed growth percentage, and other soil parameters. Table
    2 and Figure 4 shows the evaluation metric of random forest, decision tree, KNN,
    and gradient boosting. Table 2 Classification report Full size table Fig. 4 Classification
    report Full size image 6 Conclusion and Future Scope We conclude that gradient
    boosting results in the most optimal result due to the fact that it is robust
    to overfitting, while using a sufficient number of weak learners (decision trees)
    to obtain the highest accuracy, precision, and F1-score.Gradient boosting generally
    outperforms random forest and decision tree classification, the other two algorithms
    used in our study. It results in a more optimal split compared with K-neighbors.
    The system we have implemented thus far allows for analyzing weather conditions,
    soil content, and atmospheric humidity in order to properly and accurately predict
    the crop to be grown. The novelty of our implementation is that although the backend
    logic may be difficult to understand, the results themselves are made such that
    a layman/farmer can interpret it. This implementation, although carried out via
    Collab notebook, can be expanded much further, where we can add a complete UI,
    complete with GUI functionalities, regional language support, and added complexity
    visualizations if chosen by user. The data attributes themselves can also be expanded
    to include soil fertilization levels, groundwater levels, and crop price trends
    for maximization of profit, while keeping failed crops to a minimum. Systems such
    as these will pave the way for a future of smart agriculture and technology-based
    industries. References Dasanayaka PM (2020) Data mining for smart agriculture.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chennai, India SECTION I. Introduction Crop
    disease prediction was considered as the important note to improve the crop yield
    and also to increase the economic benefit for farmers. To improve the rate of
    agriculture, the researcher has used data mining technique to solve the problem
    related with agriculture. The word crop disease was termed when the word agriculture
    comes into the dictionary. The history describes that how the peoples are affected
    by different crop diseases and also the main cause of crop disease was the insects
    which is in visible. In this work, crop diseases are predicted by applying different
    existing data mining approaches and also some hybrid approaches. It supports the
    farmer for taking the right decision about precaution measures to agriculture
    diseases. This work mainly focuses on the prediction of loss due to grass grub
    insect. Classification techniques are used to predict the diseases in the crop
    to detect grass grub insect. By analyzing the features, data analyst can get the
    information about the presence of disease and this information benefits the farmers
    to take necessary actions against the insects if there is anything needed. The
    preprocessing stage verifies the binary classes of the dataset as low and high
    based on the feature values The paper contains which explains the overall domain
    details, issues to be addressed, proposed system methodologies and outcome of
    the system. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.Section2 discusses the
    details about the related work. It also discuss about the existing techniques
    of predicting the crop diseases using various classification techniques. Section
    3 discusses the detailed architecture and working process of each module of the
    system. This section also discusses about how to implement the classification
    techniques. Section 4 discusses the implementation of modules and evaluationresults.Section5
    discusses conclusion on this work and future work planned. SECTION II. Literature
    Survey This section deals with the existing works in crop disease prediction using
    machine learning approaches. Kwetishe and Adenike [1] used the machine learning
    approaches for identifying Erythemato Squamous Disease (ESD). This approach used
    preprocessing approaches to remove unwanted data or missed value data. Different
    machine learning approaches are used by the authors and results explicitly expose
    that Naïve Bayes outperforms than other techniques. Ramesh and Vardhan [2] proposed
    the system for rainfall prediction using K-Means and linear regression techniques
    where MLR Technique performs better than using K-Means in accuracy. In [3] the
    economic benefits achieved based on the seasonal effects are analyzed with biological
    factors to decide the crop yield by applying machine learning techniques. Zhang
    [4] discusses about the crop disease prediction where different classifiers are
    applied to the dataset in different combination to enhance the performance of
    the ensemble classifiers. The supervised approaches are trained with the variety
    of features in various combination to obtain the high accuracy on disease detection.
    Patel [5] suggested to use classifiers based on the obtained dataset to get better
    result. On his view, all machine learning approaches not suitable for all types
    of data. Sometimes, we need fuzzy solution for new kind of problem where the previous
    solutions are applicable in any view. Hill et al [6] gives the view that decision
    tree was most suitable technique for classifying the numeric data when compared
    to neural networks where the it requires more time for classification. And also,
    accuracy wise both are achieved same output to represent the knowledge extraction.
    Ilic et al [7] describes their metrics for evaluate the performance of the systems.
    With that metrics, they said sensitivity and specificity may alter the accuracy
    to show the accurate positive accuracy and negative accuracy which also makes
    the user to get proper view on data. Watts and Worner [8] explain the Bayesian
    approach was most suitable for classification where the missing variables are
    considered which helps to achieve better accuracy without any negative accuracy
    or false positive results. In [9] and [10], IoT systems are installed to get the
    real time data and analyze the soil nutrients and moisture level to increase the
    crop yield. B. Limitations of Existing Systems The available techniques are used
    different classification for extracting the feature set which helps toe achieve
    better result with less error rate. In addition, ensemble models are introduced
    by some researchers are predicted the grass grub disease in efficient manner.
    The objectives of predicting crop diseases using classification techniques is
    to predict the loss in crops, due to disease or growth of grass grub insects.
    It also identify the best classification technique to predict the grass grub damages.
    SECTION III. System Design For Crop Disease Prediction This chapter describes
    about the system design and it consists of decision making method for crop disease
    prediction for agriculture development. The architecture for crop disease prediction
    is shown in Fig. 1,which integrates all modules. The pre-processing stage consists
    of three major process namely data scaling, data cleaning and missing data computation.
    Fig. 1. Architecture for Crop Disease Prediction Show All The architecture shows
    the data flow between the process modules which provides the results for accuracy
    prediction. In data preprocessing the missing values are filled and ensure that
    there will no null value rows are there. Meanwhile, the feature selection selects
    the required features for classification of crop disease which reduce the time
    consumption. A. Data Preprocessing The missing values can get propagated due to
    faulty sensors or lack of communication among the components in a data collection
    system. This can be done by representing the missing values by an approximated
    mean value. The missing values for parameters like zone, year are replaced with
    their corresponding averaged representatives. B. Feature Selection In this work,
    feature selection was carried out by Chi-square method. This will reduce the existing
    features in dataset and select the required features for identifying the disease
    in crops. The formula for chi-square method is given in (1) X= i Σ =1____ _ Ei
    2 n (Oi−Ei)2 (1) View Source After selected features dataset are splitted into
    training data andtesting data. Training data is used to recognizes patterns in
    the data. The training set contains a known output. Testing data used to verify
    the data. 80% of data split into training data and 20% of data split into testing
    data. C. Machine Learning Algorithm In recent days, data analytics plays a major
    role in prediction and recommendation system. This work uses different machine
    learning approaches to classify the data set and provide the predicted result
    by analyzing the dataset features. The types of classification algorithms in Machine
    Learning are as follows. Decision Tree (DT) Random Forest (RF) Gaussian Naive
    Bayes (GNB) Support Vector Machines (SVM) K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) D. Support
    Vector Machine Classifier Algorithm explains about the complete scenario of support
    vector machine. The support vector machine starts by importing the SVC to the
    local variable model. The scikit learn library is used to call the related functions
    to implement the SVM model. Algorithm Support Vector Machine The required features
    is extracted and splitted into training and testing data. 80% of the data is used
    for training and the rest 20% is used for testing. Now extract the features from
    the test data and predict the values. The predictions obtained and compared with
    the actual values and then the accuracy of the model is printed. The confusion
    matrix is tested and graph is plotted depending upon the accuracy and precision
    value. RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER The support vector machine starts by dropping
    the value of attributes in the dataset. The required features is extracted and
    splitted into training and testing data. Algorithm Random Forest Random forest
    considers the target votes and based on that vote for each feature the final decision
    was taken for disease prediction. Error estimation was also done for this and
    result was provided. K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS CLASSIFIER The K-Nearest Neighbors starts
    by initializing the k range values with the list of values. Then empty list variable
    score is initialized. If k value is equal to the k range then the classifier implements
    the k-nearest neighbors vote and assigns the value to KNN. Now, fit transform
    method to learn the model parameters and to get the transformed chi-squared dataset.
    Calculate prediction value on the tested data and classify the accuracy from the
    variable score. Algorithm K-Nearest Neighbors DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER The decision
    tree predicts the label for the row which starts from the root of the tree. It
    compares the attributes with the labelled attribute to find the label for new
    entry. Algorithm Decision Tree SECTION IV. Implementation And Results This section
    includes the implementation and results for crop diseaseprediction in agriculture
    data mining. Figure 2 shows the snapshot of the grass grub dataset. The dataset
    labelled as low, average, high and very high Fig. 2. Grass Grub Damaged Dataset
    Show All A. Feature Selection Using Chi-Square Method Using Chi-Square method,
    the features of the data set are reduced which gets high information gain. Figure
    3 shows the reduced features snapshot which benefit the machine learning techniques
    to evaluate the disease in less time with high accuracy. Fig. 3. Reduced Features
    using Chi-Square Method Show All B. Performance Analysis of Multiple Classifiers
    The performances of the classifiers are analyzed by applying parameters Accuracy,
    Mean _acc, Precision, Recall and F1-score. Fig. 4. Graphical Representation of
    Different Classifiers Show All Table 1 shows the performance values of different
    classifiers based on the mentioned parameters. From the values, random forest
    performs better than other approaches and that considered as the suitable for
    the given dataset. Table 1: Results for all Classifiers C. Ensemble Models This
    section shows the performance of different ensemble approaches for the parameter’s
    accuracy, precision, recall, mean accuracy and f1-score. From the results the
    ensemble approach which combines DT, RF and SVM shows better results as plotted
    in figure 5. Fig. 5. Graph for Different Ensemble Models Show All Based on the
    results, it shown that random forest achieves better results than other existing
    approaches. RF Classifier for Crop Disease Prediction Fig. 6 describes the graphical
    representation of Random Forest Classifier. It shows the accuracy, mean accuracy,
    precision, recall and F1-Score. Accuracy Score is 80%. Precision value is 80%.

    analysis of classifiers Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Support

    India SECTION I. Introduction Soil is a fundamental and valuable resource that
    provides a suitable environment for crop production. Soil texture is one of the
    most vital and important parameters for soil analysis. Soil texture significantly
    influences composition and biological properties with its chemical and physical
    conditions as well viz. the degree of nutrients, germination, water, susceptibility
    to erosion etc. For precise agriculture and soil management the identification
    of soil texture has been required. Agribusiness is the most reliable living source
    for Indians directly. It is historically and still is one of the main pillars
    of the Indian economy. Furthermore, it accounts for 20% of India’s GDP farmer,
    who serves as (Food Supplier). It is at the centre of the agricultural industry
    and is currently dealing with a number of challenges. Due to the wide variety
    of soil types in the nation, farmers frequently struggle to select the crop that
    is most profitable and suitable to their soil, their conditions, and their region,
    and as a result, farmers incur significant losses. Crop recommendations (CR) are
    crucial as it gives farmers knowledge and awareness about the best ways to grow
    crops, including the best types to plant, the best times to plant them, and the
    best methods for managing pests and diseases. The current agriculture business
    uses machine learning and artificial intelligence extensively. The general quality
    of the harvest, yield forecast, plant pest detection, and under-nutrition of farms
    can all be improved with the help of methods like precision agriculture and crop
    recommender systems. Some popular machine learning models for crop recommendation
    include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines. AI system
    implementation can provide the struggling agricultural industry a boost. In the
    first section an introduction is presented and followed by literature in the second
    section. The third section focuses on the recommendation of crop-based according
    to the fertility and temperature of the region. further the conclusion summaries
    the key findings and the provide recommendation for Farmers and looking to find
    out the type of crop according to the condition. SECTION II. Literature Review
    Crop recommendation systems (CRS) are computer-based tools that help farmers choose
    the crop or crop variety that is best suited to particular location, soil composition,
    climatic conditions, and other pertinent characteristics. By maximising crop yields,
    decreasing waste, and using less inputs like water, fertiliser, and pesticides,
    these systems can aid in raising agricultural production. Because of the expansion
    of data availability and improvements in machine learning techniques, CRS have
    become more and more popular in recent years. A summary of the state of CRS research
    as of the writing of this review of the literature will be provided. Data mining
    approaches were proposed by Pudumalar et al. [1] for a precision agricultural
    recommender system. The study data on their soil types, soil properties, and crop
    production were used to select crops. The Agricultural Production Systems Simulator
    (APSIM), created in the 1990s by a group of Australian researchers, was one of
    the first and most significant CRS. A crop simulation model called APSIM uses
    historical to forecast crop growth and production using weather data [2]. Several
    crops, including wheat, maize, rice, and cotton, have been managed using the concept
    with success in numerous nations throughout the world. To increase the accuracy
    and scalability of CRS, researchers have more recently started to add machine
    learning techniques into these systems. For instance, a study carried out in India
    by Kumar et al. (2019) created a crop recommendation system for rice farmers using
    a mix of satellite images, weather data, and soil data [3]. The system classified
    fields according to their soil characteristics using a decision tree algorithm
    and then suggested the best rice variety based on past yield statistics. Using
    deep learning, Zhang et al (2020).’s study a strategy to create a CRS for Chinese
    farmers of maize. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) were utilised by the system
    to extract information from satellite data and forecast maize yield. The researchers
    discovered that their model was highly accurate in forecasting production and
    that it could be used to pinpoint specific locations where fertiliser use might
    be improved. Hybrid models [4] that blend simulation models with machine learning
    strategies have been investigated by other researchers [5]. For instance, APSIM
    and machine learning algorithms were coupled to create a hybrid CRS for maize
    farmers in Nepal in a study by Shrestha et al. (2020). After simulating maize
    development and yield using APSIM, the system applied a support vector machine
    (SVM) technique to identify fields based on their soil characteristics and suggest
    the best suitable ones. Most of the literature points to CRS as having significant
    potential to raise sustainability and productivity in agriculture. To fully achieve
    this potential, however, several issues must be resolved. They include making
    CRS more accessible and user-friendly for farmers, enhancing data accessibility
    and quality, and creating models that can adjust to shifting environmental conditions.
    The agriculture industry has undergone extensive research and has seen the use
    of numerous machine learning algorithms [6]. Increasing farm output and providing
    it to consumers at the best price and quality is the largest issue in agriculture.
    Also, it has been noted that at least 50% of farm food is lost and never consumed.
    The suggested approach offers suggestions for reducing farm produce waste. S.
    Pavani et al. provided a model in one of the more recent publications where the
    crop yield is forecasted using KNN algorithms by creating clusters [7]. KNN clustering
    has been demonstrated to perform significantly better than SVM or regression.
    Researchers made a prediction on the agricultural yield [8] for a particular year
    using sophisticated regression methods such the Kernel Ridge, Lasso, and Enet
    algorithms. The algorithms’ precision was improved with the use of stacking regression.
    Lack of understanding of changing climatic changes [9] is the biggest problem
    facing the agriculture sector. Every crop has its own unique ideal climatic characteristics.
    With the aid of precise farming practises, this can be managed. Crop productivity
    [10] is maintained, and the yield rate of production is increased. SECTION III.
    Methodology A two-step machine learning-based model solution is described in this
    section. The user uploads the position and area of an image of soil, along with
    other details, to the arrangement. The result will be a list of suggested crops
    based on expected yield, worth, and unpolished income. A. Structure Description
    We process the user-provided photograph of the soil in the first stage and categorise
    it into one of the four classifications of soil—Red, Alluvial, Black, and Clay.
    A Convolutional Neural Network performs this; the specifics of its implementation
    are covered in the following subsections. B. Implementing algorithms and data
    pre-processing Since the photos in the dataset are different shapes and sizes,
    they must first be pre-processed and resized before being fed into the model.
    For our use case, the algorithm must read a coloured image, and every coloured
    image in RGB format includes three channels, one for colour. This may involve
    tasks such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. SECTION IV. Implementation
    Gather information on the features, growth conditions, soil needs, and weather
    conditions of diverse crops. Fig. 1. Imported Required Libraries Show All Fig.
    2. Head function for the record from dataset. Show All Prepare the data to weed
    out unnecessary or noisy information and format it for use. This could involve
    activities like data cleaning, normalization, and augmentation. NLP approaches
    can be used to analyse and extract information from text data, such as descriptions
    of crops, their growth patterns, and their projected yield. This could entail
    activities like sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.
    Model Development and Validation Develop a machine learning model utilizing the
    features that were extracted. Based on the input data, the model should be able
    to forecast the crop that will grow best in a certain area. Fig 1 – Shows We need
    necessary libraries to implement and train the model like pandas library to read
    and write SSV files. NumPy, it helps in dealing with numerical tasks. Matplotlib

    are becoming increasingly popular in agriculture, as they can provide farmers
    with personalized recommendations for the best crops to grow based on their specific
    location, soil type, climate, and other factors. One of the key components of
    a crop recommendation system is data collection. Farmers can collect data about
    their land, including soil composition, moisture levels, and temperature, using
    sensors and other technology. They can also provide information about their farming
    practices, such as crop rotation and fertilizer use, which can help the recommendation
    system make more accurate predictions. These algorithms can take into account
    a wide range of variables, including climate data, market demand, and historical
    crop yields, to provide personalized recommendations to farmers. One of the challenges
    of developing a crop recommendation system is ensuring that the recommendations
    are accurate and reliable. To do this, the system must be trained on a large dataset
    of historical crop yields and other relevant data, and the algorithms used must
    be regularly updated to reflect changes in the environment and other factors.
    This may involve developing user-friendly interfaces and providing training and
    support to help farmers understand how to use the system and interpret its recommendations.
    Overall, a well-designed and well-implemented crop recommendation system can provide
    significant benefits to farmers, helping them to improve their yields and optimize
    their use of resources while reducing waste and minimizing environmental impact.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion Crop recommendation process used for selecting the best
    crop to plant by evaluating a variety of characteristics, including soil type,
    climate, available resources, and market demand. In this analysis, the performance
    and traits of each crop may be assessed in relation to the objectives and limitations,
    considering elements like crop yields, pest and disease resistance, and nutrient
    needs. The optimal crop recommendation will ultimately depend on a thorough evaluation
    of the objectives, limitations, performance, potential advantages, and disadvantages
    of each choice, including elements like profitability, sustainability, and environmental
    effect. This proposed approach results in a promising way out for the precise
    identification and detection of soil texture. The results indicated that the proposed
    model has better performance. Overall, modern technology and data analysis methods
    are anticipated to be integrated into crop recommendation systems in the future,
    with a focus on giving farmers more precise, effective, and long-lasting information
    on Crop Recommendation. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

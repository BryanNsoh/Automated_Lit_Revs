    Since rural reform was implemented in 1978, farming advancement has made remarkable
    strides. However, our country''s farming has been plagued by issues including
    high resource usage and poor energy efficiency due to its wide expansion powered
    by component input for far too long. Agriculture has a crucial part in the global
    economy since it is the primary source of food for human beings. As the source
    of industrial raw materials for a diverse range of commercial activities, it also
    contributes significantly to the expansion of other areas of the global economy.1-4
    Because farming uses a lot of land and water, the availability of these resources
    is always affected by farming. Soil degradation and deterioration, air and water
    pollution, and so forth, are all potential unintended consequences of agriculture.5-7
    Agriculture has far-reaching effects on the global economy, society, and environment.
    Sustainable growth is a commercial approach that promotes the efficient use of
    natural resources and environmentally friendly practices.8 These measures stimulate
    internal changes to current policies that have a harmful impact on the environment,
    and they support responsible conduct on the part of the business sector.9, 10
    For the most part, agricultural goods from my nation are produced along the Yamuna
    Tributary Commercial Region. More than 40% of the country''s GDP comes from agriculture.
    But the widespread use of chemicals and automation in agriculture has caused serious
    problems with carbon emissions.5 A sustainable economy has emerged as a new model
    for the development of a low-carbon economy considering the present situation
    of ecosystem degradation and climate change causing global warming. Low-carbon
    green farming emphasizes environmentally beneficial practices by decreasing the
    amount of energy used to produce carbon emissions from farming. Leaking gasoline
    from tractors, crop dying, and other farm machines all contribute to the release
    of greenhouse gases. It is estimated that China''s agricultural sector contributed
    13.5% of the country''s total carbon emissions in 2010, and this figure is expected
    to rise to between 30% and 60% by 2030 if preventative measures are not implemented.4,
    11 Consequently, engaging in low-carbon agriculture operations is critical to
    achieving green commercial development. In Figure 1, we can see the percentage
    contributions of different industries to global carbon emissions. FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Different sector contributing to worldwide carbon
    emission. Forestry and farming are only two examples of the numerous natural resources
    and human activities that contribute to carbon emissions. Manometer, titrimetric,
    and infrared analysis are only a few of the tools available for gauging the carbon
    concentrations that contribute to warming on a global scale. A CO2 equivalent
    may be calculated by converting the global warming potential value into metric
    tons of CO2 emitted by agriculture. To this study, we use the ML index as a means
    of quantifying carbon emissions worldwide; this index has been shown to be a reliable
    indicator of the exponential expansion of carbon output. Carbon emissions from
    India''s agriculture sector in the Ganges Tributary Commercial Region are almost
    as high as those from the whole nation. At 44.6%, agricultural activities are
    now second only to the industrial sector as a contributor to global greenhouse
    gas emissions. The publication “Guiding Opinions” further elucidated the strategic
    objective of transforming the Ganges Commercial Region into a commercially effective
    and environmentally sensible commercial demo region. A rapid transition to low-carbon
    farming is urgently required now. As a result, the impact of low-carbon farming
    in the Ganges Tributary Region is thoroughly investigated, and sustainable growth
    is assessed from the vantage point of the green economy. The solutions in this
    article are an important step toward reaching the strategic goals of the Ganges
    Tributary Commercial Zone, which include making cities better for the environment
    and farming with less carbon. This article makes a useful contribution to the
    literature by highlighting the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone''s adoption of
    a low-carbon agricultural plan supported by a green economy. This research uses
    the econometric statistical software Eviews to conduct a regression study using
    panel data upon the primary factors involved in farm energy efficiency, with the
    goal of fostering the significant expansion of green resources and natural assets
    from a green commercial growth-based perspective. In this study, we employ a fixed-effect
    panel model to examine the farming value-added energy efficiency in 11 cities
    and regions along the Ganges tributary commercial region, focusing on both unstable
    and stable factors. The study helps mitigate the detrimental effects of industrialization
    and automation on agricultural output. This research method is especially important
    because it focuses on making agriculture more efficient and helping it grow in
    the long run. Section 2 of this article included a literature evaluation of the
    recent and relative research methods in this field. Methodologies are covered
    in Section 6, followed by results and evaluation in Section 12. The last section
    of the work contains conclusions and future work. 2 RELATED WORKS Energy efficiency
    has long been a hot topic in the classroom. Energy efficiency has been looked
    at by both domestic and international experts at the national, provincial, and
    industrial levels. A thorough look at the key factors that affect energy efficiency
    has led to a few important findings. 2.1 A review of the research on energy-efficient
    green technologies Solitary energy efficiency metrics were widely employed in
    early research on green technology''s impact on energy consumption. In this article,12
    grouped energy efficiency as being either commercial green innovation energy efficiency
    or physical energy efficiency, whereas Patterson classifies it as a thermodynamics
    index, physiological index, institutional index, or purely financial index. Furthermore,
    when electricity is the only input factor in commercial development, the replacement
    effect among factors also is not considered, as well as eco-friendly technology-based
    efficiency; this is due to the lack of a global policy for the description of
    power efficiency, making investigation outcomes incomparable. As a leader in the
    field, the author was the first to use a non-parametric technique (discrete-event
    analysis, or DEA) to build an energy efficiency index that considers all relevant
    factors. He also studied how the energy efficiency of my country''s green technologies
    has changed over time and how other APEC.13 These research have followed suit
    by using the DEA technique to examine our country''s overall factor energy savings
    from a variety of perspectives.14 In addition to determining the overall energy
    efficiency factor, Chu looked at the convergence issue of green technology15-17
    assessed the commercial sector''s efficient energy and savings potential using
    the DEA approach, then studied the variables that affect these metrics. As green
    industry and technology have advanced, researchers have begun using environmental
    DEA to quantify energy efficiency, looking at both the productivity boost and
    the pollution reduction in depth. 2.2 Research on agricultural carbon emissions
    Measurements of farming energy efficiency, variations across time and space, causal
    variables, and potential avenues for improvement make up the bulk of the literature
    on this topic. Between the years 2000 and 2012, In these studies, the ML index
    is used to conduct an analysis of the entire component productivity in agricultural
    production as well as the factors that constitute its breakdown. The results indicate
    that taking carbon-related environmental factors into consideration provides a
    more accurate reflection of the sincerity of agriculture''s contribution to ecological
    performance.18 SBM-Undesirable elongated model to examine the distribution patterns
    of government agricultural environmental effectiveness and the causes of ineffective
    driving, with farm carbon emissions and overall agricultural yield value serving
    as undesirable and anticipated output indicators, respectively.19 Agricultural
    expansion was responsible for roughly 13% of 2005''s total carbon gas emissions,
    according to research, which was on par with the transportation industry but lower
    than the electricity grid sector.20 China has adopted low-carbon emission agricultural
    practices, which maximize the benefits of high-input nitrogen fertilizers via
    increased crop and livestock outputs.21, 22 This paper23 says that it is still
    not clear how much of the greenhouse gases that are released by farms. 2.3 Related
    techniques According to research conducted by Iddio et al.24 4% of the permanent
    nitrogen intake might be lost as a result of the use of nitrogen fertilizer in
    the development of agro-biofuel.24 However,25 concluded that the same pattern
    was seen when looking back at the history of atmospheric gas emissions. The sluggish
    flow of tropical tributaries and the massive release of nitrogen from animal feces
    were also cited as reasons for the uncertainty in greenhouse gas emission estimates.26
    While emissions from industry and services are expected to rise in the future
    decades, research suggests that emissions from agriculture will decrease in the
    following decades.9, 27 When comparing industrialized and developing nations,
    the environmental harm caused by agricultural waste is far more noticeable in
    the former.1, 28, 29 Human health is negatively impacted by agricultural greenhouse
    gas emissions.30, 31 In this scenario,32, 33 the policy implications of the trend
    toward low-carbon agriculture are shown to be important for moving the green economy
    forward. Limitations of research works are listed below. Limited set of homogeneous
    analysis Conventional analysis techniques are used No real-time adaptive cases
    From these discussions, this article found the research problem as analyzing the
    agricultural carbon emission factors through recent reports and databases using
    multi-level data analysis techniques. Consequently, the successful analysis of
    IoT-based carbon emission supports for sustainable green environment. The novel
    aspects of proposed model are utilization of multi-level carbon emission analysis
    test cases and factor verifications. The results analyzed in this article are
    more helpful to control the agriculture-based carbon emission on the way of green
    computing technology. On this research problem, this paper contributes to new
    knowledge by approaching agricultural energy efficiency from a green economy perspective,
    conducting regression analyses of panel data on the most important influencing
    factors using the advanced statistical analysis tool EViews, and then drawing
    the conclusion from the evaluation of metrics that affect farming energy efficiency
    in our nation. Enhancing productivity while also fostering long-term growth in
    the agricultural ecosystem is crucial. 3 PROPOSED METHODS In the domain of agriculture,
    manufacturing, trade, research and engineering, and the arts, the Ganges Tributary
    Commercial Region is among the most advanced areas in the nation. It is a major
    hub for China''s expanding economy. Its strategic position and extensive hinterland
    make it a vital commercial hub in China. The Ganges Tributary Commercial Chain
    connects the high, middle, and lower sections of the Ganges Tributary Basin, as
    well as the three main regions of China that span its length from east to west.
    Based on the division of my country''s three major geographic regions into east,
    middle, and west, this study considers the parallels between the commercial growth
    levels and spatial supply chain characteristics of various regions and urban areas
    and needs to draw on the data analysis branches of existing researchers like.14,
    17 In between the upper and lower extremities, there are three distinct regions.
    This article focus is on34 provinces and cities spread over the high, medium,
    and lowest tiers of the province. 3.1 Setting limits on green technologies Traditional
    approaches to improving agricultural energy efficiency focus only on maximizing
    profit, ignoring the unintended consequences of increased carbon pollution. The
    effectiveness of agricultural output and ecological conditions cannot be accurately
    reflected. In their pursuit of environmental progress, Fare et al. establish a
    farm in a specific area input of any kind, calculating the likely results and
    benefits of the statement for ecological technology''s role, which includes this
    kind of undesirable result, looks like this Equation (1). (1) For the purposes
    of production planning and allocation, the 11 outlying areas and metropolises
    that comprise the Ganges Tributary commercial region are treated as a single commercial
    entity throughout this piece. If we assume that cities and provinces employ I
    inputs of different components to generate F outputs, then the production frontier
    may be constructed as C(c = 1,2,3…C) desired outcomes. The and S unwanted outputs
    (k1,k2,k3…kn) are shown below. Fx is the set of all production possibilities when
    poor disposability is combined with strong disposition, null combination, and
    unrestricted disposability. 2. Build the eco-friendly equipment using the formula
    in Equations (2.1) and (2.2). (2.1) (2.2) represents the relative importance of
    the dth provincial region, and denotes a constant rescaling. 3.2 Technical standpoint
    effectiveness and distance metric directionality Efficient measurement relies
    on environmental technologies. Setting the direction we can use Luenberger''s
    idea of the shortage function, as shown in Equation (3), to figure out the atmospheric
    directional Euclidean distance and the related technical effectiveness function.
    (3) A few of them are it is the largest feasible increase in anticipated production,
    or the largest possible drop in undesirable output, given the aforementioned constraints.
    Using a conventional distance function, the output choice point N with the highest
    possible output is O. In the case where Bi is the biggest, it also inspires the
    undesirable rise in bt, and the maximum throughput position achieved using the
    positional distance measure is D. Then N is modified to point D along the unit
    vg to maximize the undesirable output while minimizing b, thereby achieving point
    D of the production possibilities. It shows the pattern of agricultural efficiency
    within ecological limits more accurately than the traditional distance function.34
    Equation (3) demonstrates that D is not only dependent on , but also on d. The
    direction vector is calculated in this study using Chung, Fare, and GML approach,
    which is written as . Resulted in Equations (4) and (5) below illustrate the atmospheric
    directivity distance measure within the aforementioned framework . (4) (5) So,
    Equation (6) describes the efficiency and competitiveness of farming energy as
    the percentage of actual predicted production to the frontier productivity based
    on the environmental technique architecture. (6) It may take on values between
    0 and 1, with lower values indicating less efficiency and higher values indicating
    better efficiency. At the boundary, when the anticipated output maximizes benefit
    whereas the undesirable output is minimized, the optimum efficiency level is 1.
    When compared to standard measures of agronomic effectiveness, it more accurately
    depicts the extent to which agricultural resources, inputs, outputs, and environments
    are synchronized for sustained growth. 3.3 The productivity of ML The vector range
    measure, also known as stable agricultural efficiency, is most often used to estimate
    and evaluate both the efficacy of inputs and outcomes, as well as the stage of
    an outcome in advance of a specified time period. This is done by using a vector
    range. The conventional data envelopment analysis index is enhanced upon the basis
    of the ML production levels that may quantify unintended results in order to conduct
    a more in-depth analysis of the dynamic development of agronomic performance in
    light of global carbon limits. It is an appraisal of changing conditions. It is
    able to accurately depict the efficiency shifts and technical developments in
    each region and production boundaries. The ML farm dynamic production indicator
    from tm to tm + 1 may be written as Equation (7) using the approach of Chung et
    al. (7) A further decomposition of Equation (6) is presented in Equation (8).
    (8) Advances in methodology (METHOD or M) are defined as the pace of change in
    technical growth, as measured by the rate at which the production index shifts
    along the boundary. The impact of the deciding unit reducing the gap to the production
    possibility boundary is reflected in the effectiveness shift (EFFICIENT or E).
    Increasing productivity (declines), technical advances (regresses), and efficiency
    gains (losses) are indicated by L, M, and E, which have more than (or less) 1.
    3.4 Analysis of data The primary characteristics that impact the Ganges Tributary
    Commercial Zone''s agriculture''s ecological efficiency may be identified via
    research. The thesis does mathematical analysis on the primary influencing variables
    in the econometric analysis approach using panel data. Random effect models, fixed
    effect models, and hybrid estimate frameworks are the three broad categories of
    modeling panel data.35 There are fewer time periods in the dynamic panel used
    for the paper''s analysis than there are transverse sections. None of the three
    approaches are rejected by the randomized and blended models following the performance
    of regression procedures. This article employs a fixed effects model due to the
    underlying assumptions of a disparate system. Figure 2 shows architecture of proposed
    model. Using Equation (8) as just a guide, we set up the subsequent framework
    for analyzing panel data. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint System architecture.
    (9) SSD is an abbreviated for farm ecology efficiency, S for static term, and
    for coefficient of regression. The term of randomized errors represent . 3.5 Selection
    of index This article primarily selects the thresholds of geographical financial
    growth (X1), damage (X3), farm machinery (X4), institutional environment (X5),
    urbanization (X6), labor education (X7), and govt. commercial assistance for agricultural
    production (X8) as influences on the Yan economy. major determinants of ecologically
    sound agricultural productivity throughout the world''s commercial zones. The
    exponential growth of rural population net earnings is a measure of commercial
    progress. The EKCH, which states that protection of the ecosystem has had an inverted
    curve-shaped connection with commercial growth and that the square of the population''s
    net revenue is likewise positively correlated with environmental progress, needs
    to be tested. Insert it into the X2 parameter. 4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    4.1 An investigation into the effects of energy efficiency in agriculture This
    article examines the dynamic progression of agrarian green productivity and also
    the co-ordination between farming output and the eco-system in the Ganges Tributary
    Financial Zone in light of low-carbon restrictions, from the vantage point of
    a sustainable economy that views agricultural carbon pollution as an undesirable
    output. The integrated development of farming output and the green areas in the
    Ganges Tributary Region from 2016 to 2020 was analyzed using the DDF and ML index
    approaches. These models were employed at the general, regional, provincial, and
    community levels. Table 1 contains information on agricultural productivity improvement
    in 2016 and 2022, both regardless of the global carbon restriction taken into
    account. Figure 3 shows a visual depiction of agricultural performance for the
    period 2022. The most important things to learn from the in-depth look at the
    energy productivity of farming in the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone are: TABLE

    commercial region agriculture output as shown graphically. Although both the conventional
    farming capacity utilization ratio of the Ganges Tributary Financial Zone without
    CO2 emission limits and the agriculture green rate including global carbon restrictions
    are relatively high, the conventional farming production efficiency ratio of the
    Ganges Tributary Financial Zone has traditionally been greater than the agriculture
    eco-efficiency rate including carbon pollution restrictions. If compared to the
    median level of agricultural growth throughout the country, it scores above average
    at 0.6. The efficiency of both conventional agricultural output and agricultural
    ecological efficiency in the Ganges Tributary commercial region exhibited a modest
    fall at the outset before gradually increasing. In the latter part of the time
    period studied, ecological efficiency in agriculture has generally caught up to
    conventional agricultural production efficiency. Regionally speaking, low-carbon
    agriculture is progressing more rapidly in the downstream areas than in the upstream
    and intermediate ones. When looking at development throughout China''s provinces,
    Shanghai and Jiangsu stand out as having the most advanced infrastructure, whereas
    Yunnan and Guangzhou rank at the bottom. It is viewed through the lens of dynamic
    analysis, the overall combined agricultural output of the Ganges Tributary Financial
    Zone from 2010 to 2019 has been higher than 1, denoting that minimum-carbon farmland
    in the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone have been hugely enhanced and technical
    advancement has also improved annually, whereas the effectiveness of transformation
    is much less than 1 ratio. The data suggests a declining trend, suggesting that
    advances in technology are responsible for much of the increase in low-carbon
    agriculture output in the commercial zone.36-39 Compared to the upstream area,
    the downstream and intermediate reaches have a higher productivity index, and
    the development of low-carbon productivity is much faster. There are big differences
    in productivity growth across regions. For example, Shanghai''s index is growing
    at a rate of 7.33% per year on average, while Guizhou''s index is only growing
    at a rate of 0.1% per year. 4.2 Agricultural effective energy analysis in the
    Ganges Tributary Commercial Region Based on the regression findings, the product
    R2 is 0.89, the computed f-parameter is 74.6, and the overall quality of the model
    is excellent when considering the variables impacting the agricultural sustainability
    performance of the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone using Eviews macro commercial
    analysis techniques. You can see the outcomes in Table 2. Figure 4 provides a
    visual depiction of the mean, standard error, and T-value. TABLE 2. Parameters

    energy performance in the Ganges Tributary commercial zone are graphically shown.
    The following conclusions may be drawn from the information shown in Table 2 and
    Figure 4. The parameter values shown in Table 2 are observed from carbon emission
    such as rate of CO, greenhouse gas, quantity level density, and so forth. Table
    2 shows the observations from a multiple regression analysis of variables influencing
    farming energy savings in the Ganges Tributary Commercial Region. Although there
    is a significant positive correlation between the population''s net revenue and
    farming ecosystem efficiencies when measured as a square area, there is a significant
    negative correlation between the population''s net revenue and agricultural energy
    productivity. There is a clear quadratic link between the two, which manifests
    as an inverted curve-shaped pattern. Some environmental damage, varying degrees
    of contamination in agricultural productivity, and a decline in agricultural environmental
    efficiency have resulted from fast commercial and industrial expansion. When the
    economy reaches a tipping point, the quality of life, income, and outlook of farmers
    all improve, as does the degree of green technology used in farming. Carbon dioxide
    emissions, reducing carbon emissions as well as promoting low-carbon farming are
    all receiving more attention from both the government and individuals alike. Ecological
    productivity in agriculture has been steadily rising. Damage to agriculture seems
    to have a 1% negative association with agricultural energy efficiency. Ecological
    productivity in farming declines by 0.45% for each and every 1% rise in crop damage.
    Damage to plants is severe enough to significantly lower harvest quantities. As
    with the 2013 floods, many tributary side farms failed to produce a crop this
    year. If the unwanted output does not alter, efficiency will fall since the intended
    production will be lower. For example, with a mechanization level of only 1%,
    the environmental efficiency of farms is drastically reduced. Farming energy efficiency
    decreases by 0.26% for every 1% increase in automation levels. An ever-increasing
    number of contaminants and a decline in agricultural environmental efficiency
    have resulted from the widespread adoption of automation and the constant use
    of diesel and some other energy sources. In Figure 5, we can see the ecological
    safety index from 2016 to 2022 under both the baseline and low emissions scenario.
    Figure 5 shows that the ecological safety indicator follows the same path as the
    basic measure of quality, but it gets much better results in this area. FIGURE
    5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Quality of life index for the ecosystem (QI—Quality
    Index, LCE—Low Carbon Environment). To the tune of 5%, farming energy efficiency
    is severely hampered by the sector''s institutional make-up, according to a recent
    study. China has been developing its agricultural and industrial sectors along
    the Ganges Tributary commercial region. The central and southern parts of the
    area have traditionally been important agricultural provinces since prehistoric
    times. In most cases, farms are responsible for a significant share of total greenhouse
    gas emissions. Due to the increased concentration and size of farming in the central
    and southern plains, agricultural machinery is increasingly being put to use in
    these regions. Large amounts of carbon emissions are produced by agricultural
    practices, including plowing and the use of energy-intensive equipment, reducing
    the environmental and social performance of farming. In Figure 6, we see the Commercial
    Performance Index for three distinct scenarios: basic commercial growth, growth
    with and without the low emissions economy, and no commercial growth at all. FIGURE
    6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint A measure of commercial progress (EDI—Economic
    Development Index, DI—Development Index). As can be seen in Figure 6, the basic
    indicator tendency for a low-carbon economy had a negative impact on commercial
    growth from 2016 to 2022, but has since shown positive momentum, with a rising
    value from 2016 to 2022. The commercial growth indicator, however, shows a decline
    between 2016 and 2022. Because urbanization has such a financial awareness impact
    on crop manufacturing and because, on only financial terms, industrial growth
    has already decided to have a higher impact on the agriculture production ecosystem,
    it is possible that the evaluation outcomes of urbanization''s effect on agricultural
    efficiency are inconclusive. This is due to the fact that industrial growth has
    decided to have a higher impact on the agriculture production ecosystem. Whereas
    the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone has a relatively higher rate of urbanization
    generally, there is a concomitant escalation in pollution that has little effect
    on agricultural environmental efficiency. In agriculture, the cultural competence
    of the workforce has a 5% impact on energy efficiency. As the agricultural workforce
    becomes more culturally sophisticated, it will alter farmers'' long-held views
    on agricultural output, increase their knowledge of the need to preserve the environment,
    and drastically increase the pollution caused by practices like straw burning.
    It will be halted, which will aid in the transformation of the widespread use
    of farming areas. A greater cultural tier will help in the lessons of modern farming
    advancement methodologies and techniques, and also the consistent deepening of
    awareness of minimum-carbon emissions of the environment, which would then help
    in the improvement of farmland ecosystem performance. These two factors will work
    together to help improve agricultural ecosystem performance. The government''s
    monetary assistance of 5% of agricultural output has a notable impact on the energy
    efficiency of farms. The region studied in this study is a key component of China''s
    plan for commercial growth and a majority of center for the nation''s food production.
    In order to ensure the industry''s continued prosperity over the long term, it
    is imperative that the federal, state, and local governments collaborate in an
    effort to both import cutting-edge agricultural production techniques from elsewhere
    and encourage the development of less-carbon farming practices in the commercial
    territory. The future generation people will get benefits from the research-based
    carbon control schemes. The results shall be used in real-time conditions to take
    appropriate future decisions to control carbon quantity in atmosphere. 5 CONCLUSIONS
    In this article, the author gives a green commercial viewpoint by factoring in
    carbon emissions from agriculture to the final product. Conventional farming practices
    and agricultural environmental effectiveness are compared and analyzed across
    11 cities and provinces in the Ganges Tributary Commercial Zone using the directional
    distance matrix and the ML indicator, respectively, to account for both static
    and dynamic factors. The macro commercial analysis software Eviews is used to
    conduct a comprehensive study of energy efficiency in agriculture through the
    static effects panel data model. For the years 2016–2022, we also see the ecological
    quality indicator and commercial growth index, which together reflect the geographical
    economy''s growth and the perspective of agricultural efficiency via the use of
    the low-carbon economy. The study found that fast industrialization has significantly
    polluted agricultural output and lowered the energy efficiency of agriculture.
    The advancement of farming techniques is a hallmark of a mature economy. However,
    the societal scale of the working population and governmental financial assistance
    for farming have a large beneficial influence on AEE, whereas the extent of urbanization
    has no clear effect. The long-term goal of this effort is to gather and analyze
    data on agricultural output at the municipal level in order to learn more about
    the condition of low-carbon agricultural growth and environmental efficiency in
    every municipality. Understanding how low-carbon farming is growing in each area
    will help guide the next steps of this study and make it easier for people from
    different regions to talk to each other and work together. Open Research REFERENCES

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

  description: The world's population explosion and water scarcity has researchers
    looking for smart innovations to provide food for the world and save water. In
    recent years, smart technologies have received much attention in the areas of
    irrigation and agriculture research. The main objective of this paper is to design
    and implement of new smart hydroponic and aeroponic greenhouse system based on
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology for research studies in National Water Research
    Center. The greenhouse is connected to many various tools for controlling the
    weather conditions automatically inside the greenhouse consistent with the plant
    type and season. The indoor environment is equipped with a set of IoT sensors
    to measure various parameters such as temperature; Humidity, luminous intensity,
    and total dissolved solids. The pesticide spraying tank is also used to overcome
    pests within the greenhouse. The IoT platform was used to automate and store system
    parameters, as well as provide graphical interface remote access. With minimal
    user input, the constructed system can preserve healthy plant growing parameters.
    The current study evaluates the environmental and technical impacts of the developed
    smart system on the cultivation of Batavia lettuce with high economic value. It
    can conclude that improving water and energy use efficiency (saving them to about
    80%), in addition to doubling productivity per area and reducing the time yield
    to reach 45 days comparing 75 days with the traditional agriculture whatever the
    fertility of the soil. Moreover, save labor in agriculture, and reducing fertilizer
    and pesticide use. The resulted of Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Relative Humidity
    (RH), and Temperature (T) was analyzed and evaluated during the cultivation period
    with and without the developed smart system.

    world''s population explosion and water scarcity has researchers looking for smart
    innovations to provide food for the world and save water. In recent years, smart
    technologies have received much attention in the areas of irrigation and agriculture
    research. The main objective of this paper is to design and implement of new smart
    hydroponic and aeroponic greenhouse system based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for research studies in National Water Research Center. The greenhouse is connected
    to many various tools for controlling the weather conditions automatically inside
    the greenhouse consistent with the plant type and season. The indoor environment
    is equipped with a set of IoT sensors to measure various parameters such as temperature;
    Humidity, luminous intensity, and total dissolved solids. The pesticide spraying
    tank is also used to overcome pests within the greenhouse. The IoT platform was
    used to automate and store system parameters, as well as provide graphical interface
    remote access. With minimal user input, the constructed system can preserve healthy
    plant growing parameters. The current study evaluates the environmental and technical
    impacts of the developed smart system on the cultivation of Batavia lettuce with
    high economic value. It can conclude that improving water and energy use efficiency
    (saving them to about 80%), in addition to doubling productivity per area and
    reducing the time yield to reach 45 days comparing 75 days with the traditional
    agriculture whatever the fertility of the soil. Moreover, save labor in agriculture,
    and reducing fertilizer and pesticide use. The resulted of Total Dissolved Solids
    (TDS), Relative Humidity (RH), and Temperature (T) was analyzed and evaluated
    during the cultivation period with and without the developed smart system. Previous

    hunger and poverty while also ensuring the sustainability of agriculture and food
    systems. This can be accomplished by establishing integrated systems capable of
    achieving food security and sustainable development. Hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems are alternatives to traditiona1 agriculture that could be used effectively
    in Egypt to meet the country''s rapidly growing population. In comparison to conventional
    agriculture and other soilless methods, automation of hydroponic and aeroponic
    systems in smart greenhouses has demonstrated promising results in several countries
    and is advised as the most effective, economical, and suitable plant cultivation
    system. One of the most significant challenges facing protected agriculture is
    controlling the environment inside greenhouses. The traditional hydroponic and
    aeroponic agriculture systems are still waiting significant advancements in networking
    technology, especially in controlling the influencing factors inside the greenhouse.
    These challenges can be solved through continuous monitoring of the vital growth
    parameters, with a momentary measurement of all of these parameters. Intensive
    and extensive researches have been carried out to explore the development of smart
    technologies in agriculture field. Much effort has been expended to improve greenhouse
    systems: Sambo et al. [1] present a review of the literature on hydroponic greenhouse
    systems and smart technologies that can help them perform better. Fernandes et
    al. [2] developed a system to regulate the humidity and temperature of a greenhouse-based
    hydroponic system. However, the numerous plug-ins and software needed made system
    configuration challenging. Unfortunately, because it only offers cooling systems
    to control high temperatures, only summer crop production was intended to benefit
    from the system. Besides, the pH and nutrient solution concentration (EC) were
    not determined. As a result, the system will provide inaccurate information about
    pH and nutrient combination. Yamaguchi et al. [3] developed a closed, integrated
    hydroponic system that can support the growth of 10 heads of lettuce. They designed
    the system with adjustable lighting for use indoors or in a glasshouse. After
    28 days, the authors were ab1e to harvest the lettuce using the proposed system,
    but this system required manual intervention to work properly. A hydroponic greenhouse
    system was recently successfully constructed by Sihombing et al. [4], but this
    system has a disadvantage of measuring only the water level and the temperature
    of the nutrient solution. The authors of [5], [6] built a system that measures
    water leve1, pH, electrica1 conductivity, water temperature, and relative humidity.
    After the data was sent to a database, farmers were alerted to things like the
    imbalance of nutrients in the system. The sole purpose of the system is to observe
    the hydroponic setting. As a result, because the system lacks actuators, the farmer
    must control events. The prediction models type for lettuce quality from IoT-based
    hydroponic farms were created by Gartphol et al [7]. The authors built a smart
    hydroponic lettuce farm with real-time management of operations and environmental
    data collection. A large set of data was collected and regression models were
    created using machine learning algorithms. Due to errors like those found when
    measuring lettuce''s height due to variations brought on by blowing wind, the
    model was unable to produce a successful learning outcome. Also, an automated
    hydroponic system was created by Nalwade and Mote [8], that ensures the potential
    of hydrogen pH and EC of nutrients are measured automatically and maintained by
    the system before being transmitted to farmer via GSM. As there is no oversight
    of the nutrient level. This might result in the plant receiving a lot of nutrients.
    A Rasberry Pi3 and a Field Programmable Gate Array FPGA were used by the authors
    in [9], [10] to control and monitored water level, humidity, and temperature using
    a sizable model of IoT-based systems. The modularity of the system allows for
    simple maintenance. But the system relies on a server that might not always be
    reachable for communication. Furthermore, because growing plants have different
    requirements and consumption rates, a fixed might not be the best choice. Siregar
    et al. [11] suggested a closed greenhouse monitoring system with open garden shield
    and hydroponic system, Arduino Uno microcontroller, and different sensors as PH
    sensor, EC sensor, water and air temperature sensor, light sensor, and GSM/GPRS.
    The Arduino Uno receives the data from the sensors that the shie1d has collected
    and has sent it via I2C communication. Because the proposed system lacks actuators,
    it is reliant on the farmer to regulate the environment. According to Lakhiar
    et al. [12], the application of sophisticated monitoring technology tools in aeroponics
    may allow for remote monitoring and management of all system parameters. As a
    result, it may reduce system casualties caused by the time-consuming manual monitoring
    and regulating process. To better understand how various environmental and nutrient
    characteristics connect to plant growth, plant scientists may need a range of
    data that the approach provides. In contrast to conventional agriculture, aeroponics,
    hydroponics, and aquaponics systems reduce water loss and increase water usage
    efficiency, according to Ali Al Shrouf [13], who examined the key differences
    between three new agricultural systems and conventional farming methods. S.Ramakrishnam
    Raju et al. [14], implemented a smart hydroponics expert system that is based
    on artificial intelligence and operates in IoT environment to monitor and control
    various parameters. The results show that the proposed system performs better
    than expected in terms of accuracy. Doaa K. Hassan et al. [15], investigated the
    state of productive urban landscape practices used in gated communities. The hydroponic
    systems are as one of the main focus. Practitioners showed that Soilless/hydroponic
    culture could be a great value in such practices. Tarek Selim, Mohamed Galal Eltarabily
    [16], presented a study for decision-makers and small-scale farmers in Egypt.
    They discussed the sector of agriculture systems and the switch to smart irrigation
    systems in small farms. Charisma Aulia Jamhari, et al. [17], They created a hydroponic
    monitoring and automation system that can be observed using sensors linked to
    an Arduino microcontroller, a Wi-Fi module, and Mode1 B microcomputers operating
    as webservers. The results show that this method helps farmers increase the effectiveness
    and efficiency of monitoring and running hydroponic farms. Aeroponics did not
    use water as a growing medium, in contrast to hydroponics. The roots of the plant
    are submerged in water in a hydroponic system in order to collect nutrients and
    water for survival. When employing sprinklers or nozzles, aeroponics, on the other
    hand, delivers the nutrients to the plant''s roots in a mist spray [18]. A system
    for monitoring plant growth automatically has been installed. Rea1-time measured
    data are analysed and reviewed to maximise the benefits to water and land units.
    In this study, data from remote locations were monitored, gathered, and analysed
    using IoT technique. All facets of human life are significantly impacted by the
    Internet of Things. One option for effectively automating monitoring is to use
    Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensors [19]. It can be applied cooperatively to
    complete challenging tasks that call for high intelligence. IoT devices have integrated
    sensors, actuators, processors, transmitters, and receivers to support this intelligence
    and connectivity [20], [21]. The first layer in this study''s IoT architecture
    is the perception layer, which includes many sensors like those for temperature,
    humidity, illumination intensity, and TDS. The second layer is the transport layer,
    which uses wireless communication networks Wi-Fi was chosen for this study to
    transmit data from the perception layer to the processing layer and vice versa.
    While the processing layer is in charge of managing, storing, and processing vast
    amounts of data that are received from the transport layer. It''s important to
    note that the system was developed using cloud computing technology, which allows
    the system to monitor data on the internet and create a user-friendly web browser
    application. This could make the system quicker, more effective, real-time, affordable,
    and user-friendly. Thus, the developed system''s goal can be accomplished. The
    application layer, which sits at the bottom of the stack, houses an alert system
    and can inform the decision-maker of any systemic issues via alert messages. Delivering
    application-specific services is primarily the responsibility of the administrators
    who are allowed access to the developed website and mobile application. Hydroponic
    and aeroponics systems with smart IoT automated greenhouses were constructed in
    this study to support sustainable crop production development. The developed system''s
    ability to maximize the use of each unit of water, energy, and agricultural fertilizers
    to achieve the highest possible productivity from pesticide-free plants is what
    distinguishes it from competing systems. 2. Material and method 2.1. Deployment
    of smart greenhouse The system design and construction will be introduced in this
    section as shown in Fig. 1. The greenhouse was installed at 25 m2 greenhouse in
    Delta region, Egypt. It was constructed according to the system of interlocking
    arches. The metal skeleton is made of galvanized pipes. Arches and posts are 2
    in. in diameter and 1.8 mm in thickness. Arches and posts supporters are 1-inch
    diameter and 1.8 mm thickness. The Supporters carry 2D camera to be moved freely
    in both directions X and Y. The entire greenhouse was covered completely with
    plastic panels of 200 µm thickness which transmit the light highly. A fixed shading
    net has been installed on all lateral sides of the constructed greenhouse as shown
    in Fig. 1 (a). The smart greenhouse design (with hydroponic and aeroponic systems)
    is depicted in Fig. 1 (b). Furthermore, the aeroponic system tanks (1 and 2) and
    Pesticide and nutrient tanks shown in Fig. 1(c) and 1(d), respectively. Download

    Design and construction of smart greenhouse. 2.2. Deployment of hydroponic system
    greenhouse The constructed hydroponic system shown in Fig. 2 uses water nutrient-rich
    solution as a growing medium and offers vital nutrients for sustaining p1ant growth.
    It is carried out in the absence of any growing media. Two horizontally shaped
    hydroponic cultivation systems were built inside the greenhouse and installed
    on both sides of the greenhouse. PVC pipes with a diameter of 4 in. and a thickness
    of 4 mm were used in both systems. Each system is a network consisting of pipelines,
    timer, and nutrient solution and ends with a tank of 100 L capacity. Each tank
    is connected to a pump to transfer the nutrient solution to the pipelines to feed
    the plants. Then, the nutrient solution returns back to the tank to get benefit
    from it again. Details of each system are shown in Table 1. Download : Download

    and a tank for the nutrient solution. The tank is 500 L capacity and linked to
    a pump to transfer the nutrient solution to the irrigation network to supply the
    plants. As in a hydroponic system, the nutrient solution returns back to the tank
    using the drainage network. Table 2 indicates the details of constructed aeroponics

    control system IoT based smart greenhouse The goal of greenhouse automation, intelligence,
    and reliable data transmission can be accomplished by a smart control system for
    greenhouses based on IoT. This system can realize comprehensive perception, reliable
    transmission, and intelligent processing of greenhouse environmental parameters.
    The system''s primary components include sensors, microcontrollers, centralized
    computers, and actuators, as was already mentioned. The system parameters were
    intelligently automated, stored, and displayed via an IoT platform. A field control
    system is created by connecting sensors and actuators to a microcontroller. With
    only a small amount of user input, the built-in system can keep the plants'' growing
    conditions healthy. The greenhouse environment is controlled by a set of sensors
    and actuators that connected to real time measurement and alarm system. Temperature,
    humidity, lightening intensity and Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are measured through
    monitoring sensors. Fig. 4 shows the developed IoT based Smart Greenhouse, in
    which the perception layer is the core and fundamental element of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture and irrigation. It perceives the microclimate environment
    information of the greenhouse comprehensively, provides an accurate, scientific,
    and thorough basis for automatic control and intelligent decision-making. Fig.

    developed system. When the sensors provide context information, it is transferred
    to the microcontroller, which is utilized to integrate all of the deployed devices''
    data on a single platform. The structural design is based on three major components
    that are needed to carry out various tasks. The first component, known as the
    physica1 layer, is divided into three sub-components: Sensors, actuators, and
    microcontrollers. Sensors, such as light and TDS sensors are in greenhouse, humidity/temperature
    sensors are in and out greenhouse. All sensors p1ay an important role in gathering
    information about the optimum values for plant growth. These sensory devices send
    the collected data to a microcontroller, which then makes a decision by interacting
    with the user remote1y via the internet. Actuators for greenhouse as a nutrient
    tank, a water pump, lights, fan, cool panel and windows. They are used to carry
    out the user''s command. Monitoring, which includes plant and climate monitoring,
    is the second major component of smart greenhouse. The appropriate observation
    is made by the devices in climate monitoring to balance the environment that is
    required for the crop that is cultivated within. IoT data acquisition is divided
    into two parts: standard data acquisition and IoT-based data acquisition. Wi-Fi
    communication protocol is a standard type. HTTP protocol is used for IoT data
    acquisition. This protocol is used to communicate over long distances. Furthermore,
    IoT-based data acquisition is used to maintain greenhouse conditions in order
    to increase the production rate of quality crops efficiently. Wi-Fi connectivity
    within the cloud enables data transmission to the cloud via a microcontroller
    and storage in a cloud-based database. The data saved in the cloud is repeatedly
    transmitted to the user''s mobile device via the internet to initiate a remote
    check using developed application by authors as shown in Fig. 6, allowing the
    user to change the threshold for the greenhouse climate. Download : Download high-res
    image (263KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Developed application
    by authors to initiate a remote check (for alarm and control system). Depending
    on the threshold value for the temperature, the micro-controller activates the
    driver circuit of actuators for regulating the airflow and stabling the temperature.
    The temperature and humidity of the surrounding environment (out of the greenhouse)
    are measured to be periodically compared with the interior temperature and humidity
    of the greenhouse. Pesticides are sprayed inside the greenhouse using the pesticide
    spraying tank that connected to the fogging network. Furthermore, with the help
    of IoT environment and cloud computing, another facility to access data remotely
    from all over the world is provided. 3.1. Temperature The primary environmental
    factor that impacts how frequently plants grow and develop is temperature. The
    higher temperatures, the faster chemica1 processes proceed which deteriorate the
    enzyme activities. The cooling system inside the greenhouse operates using a cooling
    panel attached to a 0.5 HP pump. It pumps water from the cooling tank to the cooling
    panels to provide the required temperature inside the greenhouse. A heating system
    was set up in the greenhouse using oil heaters with a tota1 capacity of 3000 kW.
    The heating system keeps the greenhouse''s internal temperature suitable for cultivation
    during the winter or whenever the temperature decreases. A single fan has been
    installed to ensure uniform temperature distribution and air circulation within
    the greenhouse. The temperature and humidity sensor DHT11 and DHT22 in and out
    the greenhouse is a basic as shown in Fig. 7, low-cost, multipurpose digital sensor
    that monitors the temperature and relative humidity of the air around it using
    a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor and a capacitive sensor module.
    The sensor generates a digital signa1 at the output pin. It is suitab1e for readings
    with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and a sampling rate of no more than 0.5 Hz for temperatures
    between −40 and 125 °C (once every 2 s). Download : Download high-res image (163KB)

    and out the greenhouse. It was installed both inside and outside the greenhouse
    and measures the temperature on a regular basis. It is linked to the cooling pump,
    which sends signals to the cooling panel in Fig. 8 (a) to pump water, and the
    suction fan operates in parallel, as shown in Fig. 8(b). When the temperature
    falls, the sensor sends a signal to the heaters in Fig. 8(c) to raise the temperature
    to the desired level. Generally speaking, the growth environment''s temperature
    should range from 30 °C to 4 °C. However, the temperature in the greenhouse was
    adjusted between 20 and 35 °C. Download : Download high-res image (769KB) Download

    Humidity A sensor was installed to regularly maintain and contro1 the required
    humidity concentration inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. The high level
    of humidity is controlled by drying it using heaters and also, operating the suction
    fan to withdraw the air saturated with moisture particles. On the other hand,
    the decrement of the humidity levels is controlled by a fogging network. The fogging
    network consists of a tank as shown in Fig. 9 and a submersible pump with a power
    of 0.5 Hp to pump water to the network. The network also includes nine quadrilateral
    water sprinklers. Download : Download high-res image (272KB) Download : Download

    The illumination intensity 1000 LUX light-emitting diode LED headlamps are used
    to control the illumination intensity. Given that it promotes rapid photosynthesis
    and plant growth. In an aeroponics system, the LED is thought to be the best light
    source for plant growth. The NORP12 sensor is a photoconductive cell covered in
    a moisture-resistant coating and housed in a plastic casing. Its spectra1 response
    is similar to that of the human eye. Light sensor’s output vo1tage modification
    depends upon the intensity of light. It is worth mentioning that, the illumination
    intensity operate automatically as the plant needs the light absence at night.
    However, this was utilized in research to examine the dampening effect of illumination
    intensity on plant growth. 3.4. The Total dissolved solids (TDS) To ensure successful
    plant growth, the TDS value of the nutrient solution, where water and nutrient
    solution are repeatedly recycled, must be measured on a regular basis. A sensor
    placed in the nutrient tanks is used to regulate the TDS. TDS value is measured
    using TD1000-T sensor. It needs to be adjusted if the TDS are not at the right
    level. To increase the TDS in the Nutrient tank, the sensor sends a signal to
    a solenoid valve. The optimum pH of nutrients is 5.5–––6.5, which can be adjusted
    using pH up and pH down solutions, which are non-concentrated acids and bases.
    Total dissolved solids (TDS) recommendations range from 300 to 400 mg/l for seedlings
    and seeds, 500 to 600 mg/l for vegetative growth, and 700 to 900 mg/l for advanced
    vegetative growth [22], [23]. 4. Development of a dynamic website and mobile application
    The website that was created is dynamic as shown in Fig. 10. Web pages on dynamic
    websites are typically generated in rea1 time. When a user accesses a dynamic
    page, the data stored in the cloud is repeatedly transmitted to the developed
    PHP website and user''s mobile device through developed mobile application by
    authors via the internet to initiate a remote check as shown before in Fig. 6.
    Fig. 11 depicts the developed dynamic PHP website by authors. Fig. 12 shows the
    developed mobile application by authors using C sharp Xamarin, which it is a dot

    5.1. TDS comparative results Leafy Plants such as lettuce, Spanish, cabbage, and
    others were grown in the greenhouse''s developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems.
    The most significant influencing factor on the plantation is TDS. As mentioned,
    TDS is measured by a sensor connected to a control program. Besides, TDS in Nutrients
    tanks has been measured in the field periodically. The average resulting TDS from
    the control program and fie1d measurements are compared to the recommended levels
    of TDS during the different growth stages. This comparison ensures that the sensors
    accurately and efficiently send the correct signals to the rest of the control
    devices in the greenhouse to automatically provide the appropriate environment
    based on the growth stage. As mentioned before, the recommended TDS range between
    300 and 400 mg/1 during the seedlings and seeds stage, 500–600 mg/l during vegetative
    growth, and 700–900 mg/1 during advanced vegetative growth [22], [23]. As indicated
    in Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15, the field measured TDS range between 280 and 400
    mg/l, 485–628 mg/l, and 710–913 mg/l for the three stages, respectively. Meanwhile,
    the TDS recorded by the program are 290––420 mg/l, 482–611 mg/l and 683–907 mg/l,
    correspondingly. Thus, the measured and recorded TDS are properly close; in addition,
    they fall within the recommended range for TDS during the different stages. Preliminary
    experiments showed promising results, as; the nutrients are absorbed quicker,
    allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier. Generally, hydroponic and aeroponic
    are media for crop cultivation grown in a controlled environment without soil
    where water and nutrient solution are repeatedly recycled, which allows for optimal
    plant growth and development. They are fed with nutrient-rich water solutions
    that contain all the necessary nutrients (major and minor nutrients) required
    for different plant growth stages. This method of cultivation allows for faster
    growth and higher yields compared to traditional soil-based farming. However,
    the nutritional value of hydroponic and aeroponic crops may differ from those
    grown in normal soil. In nutritional solutions, all elements (used for plant nutrition)
    are in equilibrium and in available form for plant. But in agricultural soils,
    the antagonism between some elements could lead to the precipitation of these
    elements in unavailable forms where the plant couldn’t absorb it. The nutrient
    content of plants is influenced by various factors such as the quality of the
    growing medium, the type of fertilizer used, and the environmental conditions.

    of 80–90% compared to conventiona1 agriculture. For example, Batavia lettuce was
    produced within a month and a half. 5.2. Humidity comparative results Humidity
    control is regarded as an important parameter for effective lettuce growth. Extreme
    humidity reduces transpiration, resulting in reduced nutrient transport. Therefore,
    a relative humidity (RH) of 70 to 80 percent is commonly targeted during lettuce
    growth whi1e reduce from 70 percent during yield. Fig. 16 depicts the RH data
    collected inside and outside the greenhouse. This figure shows that the RH in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the RH outside the greenhouse because
    of the controlled system that allows the plants to evaporate enough water to allow
    the transport of minerals (like Ca) to growing plant cells. Fig. 17 explains how
    boxplots define data inside and outside the greenhouse. Download : Download high-res

    and Seeds Stage (controlling system). 5.3. Temperature comparative results One
    of the best qualities of this lettuce is its resistance to heat. Indeed, Batavia
    lettuce prefers warmth and germinates best at temperatures around 80°Fahrenheit
    as around 30 0c. Most other lettuces cannot germinate or survive in the temperatures
    that Batavia lettuce does. The only disadvantage is that you will have to plant
    these. Fig. 18, Fig. 19 show the temperature data record and boxplot inside and
    outside the greenhouse, respectively. This figure shows that the temperature in
    the greenhouse is optimal when compared to the temperature outside the greenhouse
    due to the controlled system that aids growth. Download : Download high-res image

    Water and energy consumption The amount of water and energy consumed must be monitored
    in order to reduce the overall operating costs of the developed system and to
    make the system power efficient and expandable on a large scale. In terms of water,
    the water consumption in developed system was monitored and recorded during the
    leafy seedling period and the vegetative growth period (45 days). 560 plants were
    used in the study period during April and May. The study period was divided into
    approximately 20 days as the leafy seedling period and 25 days as the vegetative
    growth period. For the leafy seedling period, it was found that the water needs
    per liter for 560 plants in 20 days was about 140 L/day approximately 3 m3, while
    the water needs during the vegetative growth period for 560 plants in 25 days
    was approximately 4 m3. So it was found that the total water consumed during the
    period of leafy seedling and vegetative growth is about 7 m3 for the total area
    (25 m2) in GH. Compared to traditional cultivation, the water use of lettuce was
    estimated at about 965 L per square meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency
    of the developed system. On the other hand, in terms of energy, the developed
    system''s power consumption should be monitored using a power meter, which is
    recommended as a future work. However, it should be noted that the use of IoT
    technology reduces the developed system''s power consumption. Since the actuators
    (such as pumps, oil heaters, etc.) on1y run for a short time when the microcontroller
    sends an alarm message, the overall power consumption for these actuators during
    the study period is very low. Taking into account the energy consumed by the oil
    heaters which are the most energy consuming system. They were not continuously
    worked on because the study period is in the summer, and thus their power consumption
    is negligible during the study period. 6. Challenges and limitations There are
    several challenges in the developed smart system such as high initial construction
    cost. Furthermore, the maintenance process of deve1oped system components. In
    addition to the need for qualified technicians to maintain any problem in the
    system, such as any defect in the drip irrigation system, blockage of sprinklers
    or defects in heaters or the cooling pane1, in order to avoid damage or low efficiency
    and productivity for yield. Hence these systems need frequently maintenance which
    requires a high cost. Also, the automation of harvesting in developed system with
    the help of IoT has not been explored. The manual harvesting method may lead to
    the infection of the younger crops with human beings as vectors. Furthermore,
    since the automated system can work tirelessly, it is more economical to use smart
    systems in the harvesting of the crops. In addition, there are some limitations
    that must be taken into account in the developed system, such as power outages,
    as the system will stop working immediately. Plants may quickly dry out and die,
    resulting in some crop loss. It''s crucial to have an alternative power source
    found automatically. Moreover, since the developed system is a closed, water-based
    system, diseases and pests can spread rapid1y as they share a single nutrient
    tank, requiring constant monitoring and treatment of pests. Growers a1so require
    skills and knowledge for commercia1 applications in order to maintain optimal
    production, also they need high marketing skills due to the high prices of system’s
    products. On the other hand, smart hydroponic and aeroponic farming methods are
    not currently feasible for growing strategic and staple crops as rice, wheat,
    and corn on a large scale. While these systems can be used to grow smaller grains
    such as barley, oats, and quinoa, the cost of implementing these systems for large-scale
    production of staple crops like rice, wheat, and corn is currently prohibitive.
    Rice, wheat, and corn are crops considered low value from the economical view
    point comparing to quinoa [25]. Therefore, such crops are planted in agricultural
    lands in Egypt, but in areas (all over the world) where the soil is in scarce,
    the smart aeroponic or hydroponic systems are recommended in such cases. Still,
    more advanced research needs to be conducted to answer the concerns of reduce
    the capital and operating costs for using these smart methods for this type of
    strategic and staple crops for Egypt. 7. Conclusion and future work This paper
    is aimed to introduce some possibilities for improvement of the hydroponic and
    aeroponics systems by utilization of IoT automated greenhouse. Smart architecture
    for the hydroponics and aeroponics greenhouse system was developed. The sensors
    were installed to regularly maintain and control the required humidity concentration
    and the temperature inside the greenhouse based on plant needs. This study evaluated
    the environmental and technical impacts of the developed smart system on the cultivation
    of Batavia lettuce with high economic value. Measured and recorded TDS were compared
    to the recommended values in the different growth stages. It gave accepted TDS
    ranges and approved the high efficiency and accuracy of the automated system.
    The nutrients are absorbed faster, allowing the plant to grow faster and healthier,
    according to preliminary experiments. In addition, when compared to conventional
    agriculture, the developed hydroponic and aeroponic systems using IoT saved 80–90
    percent of water and fertilizer. In addition to doubling productivity per area
    and reducing the time yield to reach 45 days comparing 75 days with the traditional
    agriculture whatever the fertility of the soil. Also, the resulted of Relative
    Humidity (RH), and Temperature (T) as in TDS was analyzed and evaluated during
    the cultivation period with and without the developed smart system, it can notice
    that the RH and T in greenhouse are optimum comparing with it out greenhouse as
    a result of smart controlled system. According to this system, it was found that
    the water use for 560 plants during the period of leafy seedling and vegetative
    growth period is about 7 m3 for total area in GH (25 m2). Compared to traditional
    cultivation, the water use of lettuce was estimated at about 965 L per square
    meter per crop [24], which indicates the efficiency of this system. In addition,
    it is considered the developed smart system are more efficient in terms of yield
    per area and water usage, normalized by yield, than conventional agriculture.
    Also, it can conclude that energy consumption can be mitigated by using cost-effective
    renewable energy sources as a future work. However, more experiments are needed
    and more characteristics of the hydroponics or aeroponics system should be considered.
    Regarding the developed system based on IoT where it provides automated monitoring
    and control of these systems. Also, it can be able to assess the environmental
    and technical effects of the advanced system thus improving water and energy efficiency,
    minimizing cost and saving labor, and reducing the use of fertilizers and pesticides.
    Overall, the cost comparison between smart hydroponic and aeroponic systems agriculture
    and traditional agriculture will depend on various factors such as the size of
    the farm, the type of crops grown, the local climate, labor costs, and market
    prices. It is important for farmers to carefully evaluate their options and consider
    all relevant factors before making a decision. In addition, future work will focus
    on finding alternative energy approaches such as a solar power system to power
    an automated greenhouse. As well, use desalinated water to feed hydroponics and
    aeroponics systems. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

  description: With the wide application of Internet of Things, big data and other
    technologies in smart agriculture, more and more agricultural data are collected
    and used. The current analysis and processing through IoT platforms and other
    centralised methods have more serious data security problems. Privacy computing
    is a technology that completes data security calculations under the premise that
    both parties do not disclose data, and the data of each participant participates
    in the calculation is in the form of cipher text to maximally reduce the risk
    of data leakage. Aiming at the small volume and high frequency scenario of agricultural
    data, this paper proposes a distributed privacy computing framework by integrating
    cryptography, edge computing and blockchain, and designs a privacy computing system
    called PCS-ADS for smart agricultural data. This paper focuses on describing the
    system model architecture and system function implementation, which includes key
    business processes, core modules, core algorithms and other parts. Finally, the
    security and performance evaluation of the system is carried out. The results
    show that, for sum and variance, the computation time for multi-party under the
    amount of 1w data of each party is no more than 0.1s, and for the high-frequency
    computation scenarios, the computation time under the amount of 100 data of each
    party is no more than 7s and 1.5s, respectively. Experimental results prove that
    PCS-ADS is effective and has a strong practicality.

    Comments ABSTRACT With the wide application of Internet of Things, big data and
    other technologies in smart agriculture, more and more agricultural data are collected
    and used. The current analysis and processing through IoT platforms and other
    centralised methods have more serious data security problems. Privacy computing
    is a technology that completes data security calculations under the premise that
    both parties do not disclose data, and the data of each participant participates
    in the calculation is in the form of cipher text to maximally reduce the risk
    of data leakage. Aiming at the small volume and high frequency scenario of agricultural
    data, this paper proposes a distributed privacy computing framework by integrating
    cryptography, edge computing and blockchain, and designs a privacy computing system
    called PCS-ADS for smart agricultural data. This paper focuses on describing the
    system model architecture and system function implementation, which includes key
    business processes, core modules, core algorithms and other parts. Finally, the
    security and performance evaluation of the system is carried out. The results
    show that, for sum and variance, the computation time for multi-party under the
    amount of 1w data of each party is no more than 0.1s, and for the high-frequency
    computation scenarios, the computation time under the amount of 100 data of each
    party is no more than 7s and 1.5s, respectively. Experimental results prove that
    PCS-ADS is effective and has a strong practicality. References Nikesh Gondchawar,

  description: Adopting and developing sustainable precision irrigation systems allows
    for improving productivity, reducing water and energy losses in agricultural fields.
    This paper deals with the development and real-time implementation of a smart
    precision irrigation system (SPIS). The proposed system combines two irrigation
    approaches, processed by a feedback fuzzy logic (FL) controller, and long-range
    data transmission and monitoring via the LoRa protocol. The combined approaches
    not only enhance overall performance but also address several limitations commonly
    associated with existing approaches. The proposed system uses the collected data
    from the sensors unit to provide the optimal irrigation decision and communicates
    it with the operator (farmer) via a developed IoT platform. Data from soil moisture,
    ambient temperature, solar irradiance, and rainfall sensors are processed through
    the FL controller to adjust the irrigation times. The inputs and outputs are fuzzified
    by trapezoidal and triangular membership functions. Mamdani's fuzzy inference
    is used to control the system through a set of linguistic control rules for a
    more accurate decision for each scenario. The field experimentation of the developed
    SPIS in the eastern region of Morocco shows high efficiency and reliability by
    saving water and energy compared to traditional irrigation control. The proposed
    system, with remote data monitoring, promotes better management of irrigation,
    water, and energy consumption, and it is suitable to be mounted with any type
    of irrigation installation in the field, without extensive modifications.

    saving 1. Introduction Agriculture is considered a key issue of national development
    due to the important economic, social, and territorial stakes of this sector (Knox
    et al., 2012). In Morocco, agriculture is the first contributor to the gross domestic
    product (GDP) with a variation of 11 % to 18 %, which is mainly influenced by
    climatic conditions. Moreover, Moroccan agriculture employs nearly half of the
    active population and provides 23 % of the nation''s exports1. In 2022–2023, water
    scarcity in Morocco is considered a major concern as water reserves have been
    reduced by 59 %, which exposes them to spatial and temporal irregularity issues.
    Fig. 1 (a) shows the rainfall deficit percentage and Fig. 1 (b) shows the drought
    index of January 2023 in Moroccan regions2. Given the enormous evolution of irrigated
    agricultural areas that consume huge amounts of water, the unpredictability of
    rainfall may lead to increasing and deepening the problem of water availability
    and the failure to meet the irrigation needs of crops, resulting in rising drought
    areas and a decline in agricultural productivity. One of the factors contributing
    to this is the use of permanent alimentation solenoids to activate irrigation
    systems and low performance irrigation approaches (Avşar et al., 2018, Le et al.,
    2020). These solenoids require a continuous power supply, leading to increased
    energy demands. The reliance on such solenoids is prevalent in various agricultural
    processes, including irrigation systems, crop harvesting machinery, and automated
    greenhouse controls. The constant power requirements of these solenoids contribute
    significantly to the overall energy consumption in the agricultural sector, further
    straining the already limited resources. Addressing this issue and exploring alternative
    energy-efficient solutions could mitigate the environmental impact and reduce
    the sector''s overall energy consumption. Download : Download high-res image (466KB)

    (%), (b) The drought index of January 2023 of Morocco. For the agricultural areas
    of eastern Morocco, irrigation water and energy losses are generally caused by
    two factors: the first factor is the manual control of the pump and valves in
    the pressurised irrigation system. According to Hamami and Nassereddine, 2020,
    Xie et al., 2022, the inefficiency of these irrigation systems extends beyond
    Morocco and has been observed in other regions as well. The studies highlight
    that these traditional irrigation systems, which rely on manual pump activation,
    contribute to significant losses in irrigation water and energy. These findings
    suggest that the low efficiency of such systems is not limited to a specific geographical
    area but is a widespread issue that affects multiple agricultural regions (Kumar
    et al., 2023). In those cases, farmers use their prior knowledge of crop response,
    or by observing leaf stress, to determine the duration of irrigation. This technique
    cannot be relied upon since it does not reflect the actual water needs of the
    plants, which are related to the growth stage and weather conditions (Jaafar et
    al., 2021). On the other hand, the second factor is the losses due to the process
    in which irrigation water is released into the atmosphere as vapor, caused mainly
    by the high temperature and solar irradiance rates. This factor can be solved
    by using drip irrigation methods, but it is also necessary to adopt advanced control
    techniques. The development and design of smart precision irrigation systems and
    mechanisms with the use of IoT technologies for the visualization and monitoring
    of different parameters of agriculture and irrigation is the key solution to managing
    irrigation water resources efficiently and sustainably by delivering the exact
    amount of water required by the crop (Capraro Fuentes et al., 2018). In addition,
    optimizing the energy supplied to operate the various actuators (Qaisar et al.,
    2021, Mellit et al., 2021). Irrigation systems are classified into two categories
    according to their control, open-loop and closed-loop control systems. Open-loop
    control, also called no-feedback control, is a type of controller that generates
    decisions based on the current state, i.e., it has no feedback to determine if
    the assessed input has achieved the desired objective, in our case satisfying
    the crop''s water needs with precision while considering climatic-soil conditions
    (Navarro-Hellín et al., 2016). Therefore, an open-loop irrigation system cannot
    be reliably used to deal with the challenges of precision irrigation. Programmable
    irrigation controller, also called irrigation timers are among the systems based
    on this control technique. The scheduling of the period and duration of the irrigation
    remains constant without knowing the real needs of irrigation in the crop. Closed-loop
    control systems are the most efficient and robust in terms of decision support
    and allow for precision irrigation (Bwambale et al., 2022). The action depends
    on the output provided by the system; the input varies according to the output,
    which produces a more accurate decision. The feedback loop also allows for automatic
    adjustments to be made in real time, which improve the accuracy, stability and
    performance of irrigation decisions. Sensor units are used to provide this feedback
    to the processing unit. According to agriculture experts and scientific research,
    three approaches are distinguished (Abioye et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020). The
    first approach is based on the measurement of soil moisture, which indicates the
    amounts of water consumed and absorbed by the crop during a period, and then decides
    on the scheduling of future irrigation times by setting a percentage of soil moisture,
    so the irrigation system works until it reaches the set value of moisture (Soulis
    et al., 2015). An intelligent urban irrigation system is discussed in (Mason et
    al., 2019) aiming at decreasing water use without reducing crop yield. The system
    includes a wireless soil moisture sensor network and controllable valves and tested
    in nine climatic regions of the contiguous United States. Tomatoes are chosen
    due to their sensitivity to water stress. The second approach is to control irrigation
    according to the evolution of the meteorological conditions (Kool et al., 2014).
    The measurement of environmental variables in real time such as: air temperature
    and humidity, solar irradiance and wind speed allows estimating the reference
    evapotranspiration level (ET0) (Chiew et al., 1995), which indicates the water
    losses suffered by the plant and the soil (J. Doorenbos et al., 1976). Weather
    stations or IoT-based sensor networks are used to provide such information. In
    (González-Briones et al., 2018), a monitoring system able to collect various data
    on its environment, by sensing temperature, solar irradiance, pH, humidity, and
    wind speed is presented. The objective of this research is to build virtual organizations
    of agents based on several master and slave nodes that are connected to ensure
    data exchange from sensors while monitoring the crops. The development of a platform
    (IoT) with a fibrous capillary irrigation system based on the climatic demand
    estimated by the weather condition was reported by (Abd Rahman et al., 2019).
    The experiment has been conducted using a Choy sum plant as a test crop in a greenhouse.
    Demand tracking, management of the irrigation system, and the use of weather information
    allowed for near real-time estimation of the crop''s water requirements, which
    also allowed the monitoring of the progress of water consumption by the plants.
    The last approach is the survey of the plant evolution parameters, such crop water
    stress index (CWSI), which determine the water needs of the plant, through the
    measurement of canopy temperature. Most irrigation systems are based on simple
    control techniques and algorithms (Davis, and Dukes, 2010; Singh et al., 2023),
    containing a single input or a threshold value to be set by the operator to decide
    on starting or ending the irrigation. The reliability and efficiency of those
    controls’ techniques are limited and unable to reliably schedule irrigation since
    precision irrigation involves the evaluation and processing of multiple inputs.
    Fuzzy logic (FL) is one of the intelligent control techniques that allow to manipulation
    of multiple input variables while taking account of the output action. So, it
    is more suitable for non-linear systems due to its flexibility in data processing
    and it is very effective for decision-making problems that require precision (Zadeh,
    1999). The operation of fuzzy logic has been thoroughly tested in a diverse and
    challenging field (Yahyaoui et al., 2017). It is structured with three main modules,
    a fuzzification module, an inference engine, and a defuzzification module. Mamdani
    and Sugeno are the two popular approaches in FL (Omomule et al., 2020, Shafaei
    et al., 2017), each with its own distinct characteristics. The key difference
    lies in how they handle the fuzzy rule’s consequences. In Mamdani-FL, the output
    membership function is a fuzzy set representing the degree of membership of the
    output variable. This allows for linguistic descriptions, where the output can
    be interpreted in terms of linguistic terms (Pourjavad et al., 2019). On the other
    hand, Sugeno-FL employs a more mathematical approach, where the output is represented
    as a crisp value or a mathematical function of the input variables. This enables
    precise numerical calculations and facilitates mathematical modelling. The advantage
    of the Mamdani-FL lies in its ability to incorporate linguistic rules and provide
    interpretable outputs. By using linguistic terms, the system''s behaviour becomes
    more understandable and intuitive to humans, making it suitable for applications
    where transparency and explainability are crucial. It allows experts to easily
    define rules using their domain knowledge and linguistic terms, making it a powerful
    tool in decision-making processes (Hamam et al., 2008). Additionally, Mamdani-FL
    supports a wide range of inference methods and can handle complex and nonlinear
    systems effectively. While Sugeno-FL has its own advantages, such as its computational
    efficiency and ability to handle mathematical modelling, the interpretability
    and linguistic-based nature of Mamdani-FL make it a preferred choice in agriculture
    applications (Urbieta Parrazales et al., 2021). A FL-based irrigation controller
    is designed and integrated into a field in India, to perform multi-criteria decision-making,
    this allows to select of the most efficient and adequate irrigation sub-system
    (Yilmaz and Harmancioglu et al., 2010). Another application of FL has been reported
    in (Krishnan et al., 2020). The objective is to automatically control the irrigation
    through the measurement of soil moisture to decide the necessary flow for irrigation.
    Six fuzzy rules have been implemented. DC motor is activated in cases where the
    soil moisture value is between medium and very low values, otherwise the contrary.
    The modelling and simulation of a fuzzy irrigation system have been presented
    in (Mushtaq et al., 2016). The approach is based on the calculation of ET by a
    fuzzy inference system. The input variables are temperature, humidity, wind, and
    solar radiation. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the fuzzy system
    in accurately determining and compensating the water loss due to ET. Another work
    (Kurniawan et al., 2017) presented the combination of a prediction algorithm and
    fuzzy control. The combination of fertilization and irrigation precisely to reduces
    the amount of irrigation water and the waste of chemical fertilizers. This results
    in further saving and reducing production costs and improving agricultural efficiency.
    In our previous work (Benzaouia et al., 2021) we developed an intelligent irrigation
    system based on FL controller for the automatic watering of agricultural areas
    (Oriental Morocco). The simulation results proved that the irrigation system allows
    to keep the soil moisture measurements higher than the value specified by the
    user and eliminates the under-irrigation risk. In the presented research works,
    the utilization of FL is primarily focused on simple applications. These applications
    involve employing fuzzy sets and membership functions to handle vague or uncertain
    data and make decisions based on fuzzy reasoning. Moreover, a noteworthy aspect
    of these works is the use of minimal control rules, implying that the number of
    rules employed in the fuzzy logic systems is kept to a minimum. In the realm of
    modern field management, it is crucial not only to adopt advanced control systems
    but also to incorporate communication IoT protocols to enable seamless data transmission
    and enhanced control. The integration of IoT offers numerous benefits, including
    real-time data acquisition, remote monitoring, and improved decision-making capabilities.
    Various communication technologies, such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and others,
    can be utilized to establish reliable connections in field management applications.
    Table 1 provides a summary of these technologies and their application for irrigation
    monitoring, outlining their respective ranges and power consumption. The common
    characteristic among these technologies is their low data transmission range.
    However, in the case of large agricultural areas, it becomes necessary to employ
    technologies that can cover vast distances with improved sending capabilities
    which makes them very limited. LoRa technology stands out as one of the promising
    solutions that has proven its effectiveness in various industrial applications
    (Kaur et al., 2022), additionally, in fields such as telemedicine (Ayat et al.,
    2023). It offers several advantages for IoT applications, its long-range capability
    allows for communication over large distances, while its low power consumption
    ensures minimizing energy consumption. The cost-effectiveness of LoRa, coupled
    with its scalability and secure communication features, also makes it suitable
    for large-scale deployments. The flexibility of LoRa enables its use in diverse
    environments, and its open standard promotes interoperability. Table 1. IoT technologies

    smart precision irrigation system with a combined weather-soil approach is proposed
    and designed, to efficiently schedule the irrigation of apple trees in fields
    located in the eastern region of Morocco. Soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar irradiance, and rainfall are the inputs of the FL controller. They are sensed
    through different sensors, and subsequently transmitted to apply the well-designed
    fuzzy rules for irrigation control, while the output is the duration and timing
    of irrigation which depends on the crop requirements in the field. This allows
    for optimizing the soil water content, enhancing plant health and product quality.
    The system also includes a long-range LoRa communication module for wireless transmission
    and a developed IoT platform for visualization and monitoring to enhance the mentioned
    drawbacks of discussed IoT techniques in irrigation. The techno-economic study
    between the proposed system in the literature and the one available on the commercial
    market, proved the reliability of the proposed SPIS to manage the irrigation process
    in a precise and intelligent manner with low-cost installation. This is the first
    research study reported on the design of an intelligent precision irrigation system
    adapted to the eastern climate of Morocco. The main contributions of the paper
    can be summarized as follows: • The design of an automated intelligent irrigation
    controller based on FL inference that evolves in real-time the weather-soil monitoring
    approach to decide the optimal irrigation time and impulse solenoid-valve opening.
    The system is highly efficient and tested in an agricultural field under real
    scenarios. • The development of a real-time visualization and monitoring IoT platform
    for irrigation and field data such as system status, soil moisture, air humidity,

    irrigation system. Section 3 describes the operating steps of the system. Section
    4 discusses the software and hardware implementation. The experimental performance
    evaluation and the techno-economic study are given in Section 5. Conclusion and

    system based on an effective strategy that combines both weather and soil approaches
    is given in Fig. 2. It consists of five essential sub-systems: (1) the sensors
    unit, (2) the controller unit, (3) the irrigation unit, (4) the IoT communication
    unit, and finally (5) the power unit. A detailed description of the methodology
    of the development of these subsystems is given in the following sections. Download

    The structure of the smart precision irrigation system. 2.1. Location and specification
    of the study field An agricultural field situated around the eastern region of
    Morocco has been selected to carry out the experimentation of the developed irrigation
    system (See Fig. 3). The location and global positioning are a latitude of 34.811835
    and a longitude of −1.967141 (34°48′42.6″N 1°58′01.7″W). Download : Download high-res

    the field of experimentation. The field is divided into three areas (A), (B) and
    (C). The focus is only on the A and B zones, the irrigation system in the first
    zone (A) is controlled by the proposed smart precision irrigation system and the
    second zone (B) temporised controller is used. Note that the area A and B are
    about 1300 m2 for each and contain about 140 apple trees, with an irrigated surface
    approximately 100 m2. The experiment region exhibits a unique semi-arid climate
    influenced by its geographical location and topography. Situated in the eastern
    part of the country, this region experiences distinct climatic conditions that
    have significant implications for agriculture and socio-economic activities. The
    climate can be classified as Mediterranean with semi-arid characteristics. It
    is characterized by hot and dry summers with limited rainfall and mild, wet winters.
    The region is known for its high temperatures during the summer months, often
    exceeding 40 °C (104°F). Additionally, the area experiences high ET rates due
    to the combination of high temperatures and limited rainfall, resulting in the
    loss of water from both the soil and vegetation. Precipitation is moderate, with
    most rainfall occurring between October and April. However, there is considerable
    variability in precipitation patterns, leading to occasional drought conditions.
    The unique semi-arid climate of the region plays a crucial role in shaping agricultural
    practices, water resource management, and overall livelihoods in the area. 2.2.
    Sensors unit The sensors unit consists of specific field sensors for soil moisture
    measurement, and climatic sensors for measuring ambient temperature, relative
    air humidity, solar irradiance, and rainfall. All the used sensors are calibrated
    to prevent any drift that could be generated during their operation. 2.2.1. Soil
    moisture sensing Soil moisture information is extremely important for the control
    and scheduling of irrigation periods. It allows to identify the characteristics
    of diffusion or storage of water in a defined soil, which is usually influenced
    by its composition and texture (sandy, clayey and silty soil). There are two main
    techniques for determining soil moisture, the direct method and the indirect method.
    The direct method, known as gravimetric, consists of drying a soil sample and
    then determining the weight of the water contained in the sample. This method
    is not adapted to real-time applications and remains expensive. Indirect methods
    consist in measuring the electrical conductivity or the dielectric permittivity
    of the soil and then converted to volumetric soil water content. For this application,
    a UM-MS-10 sensor is selected. This sensor is dedicated to precision irrigation
    applications while offering very accurate measurements, and a high sensitivity
    to amounts of water applied to the soil with a low error range (about ± 2 % and
    ± 4 % for a water content between 0 and 53 % and 53–100 % respectively), in addition
    to the possibility of calibration for specific soils. Determining the number of
    soil moisture sensors is based on several factors, including the size and nature
    of the area being monitored, the type of crops, the depth of the root zone, the
    soil properties, and the way that the area is exposed to weather variations. In
    our research focused on apple trees, a case study to examine soil moisture levels
    in zone A has been conducted firstly. Multiple sensors have been strategically
    placed at different locations within the zone to capture comprehensive data. The
    analysis revealed consistently low measurement errors, attributable to the soil''s
    homogeneity and absence of geographical irregularities. Consequently, a single
    sensor has been selected and positioned at a depth of 0.3 m. This depth is justified
    based on the relevant findings reported in our previous research (Benzaouia et
    al., 2021). To ensure the generalizability of our results across the entire field,
    further investigations are planned. These subsequent examinations will involve
    subdividing the field into smaller zones, allowing for the optimization of sensor
    placement, and determining the minimum number of sensors required for accurate
    soil moisture assessments. This approach enhances the scientific rigor of the
    study and provides valuable insights into the spatial variability of soil moisture.
    2.2.2. Ambient temperature sensing As temperatures increase toward limit values,
    the plants'' ET rates increase and the water balance of the soil decreases, therefore
    the scheduling of irrigation according to temperature variations is also crucial.
    The DHT-11 sensor is a reliable sensor for measuring ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, requiring no external calibration, and able to measure temperatures
    from −40 to + 125 °C with an accuracy of ± 0.5 °C and relative humidity ranges
    from 0 to 100 % with an accuracy of ± 2 %. 2.2.3. Solar irradiance sensing Solar
    irradiance is a source of energy that comes from a thermal process, which also
    contributes to the evaporation process. So, it is important to schedule irrigation
    during a period of minimal solar irradiance. Several devices are available to
    measure and quantify the intensity of solar irradiance, including pyrometer, LDR,
    photoristor and others. However, most of them are expensive and usually require
    an adapter to exploit the collected data. For economic and technical reasons,
    a BH1750 sensor has been selected to estimate solar irradiance intensity. It allows
    a measurement range from 1 lx to 100.000 lx, with an error of ± 3 % for low and
    high ranges, additionally to its robustness against IR radiation (Very small effect
    of IR radiation). 2.2.4. Rainfall sensing To save the water and energy consumption
    of the proposed irrigation system in the agricultural field in case of precipitation,
    a rain sensor or rain switch is integrated, allowing the detection of rainfall.
    Hence, if the feedback received from the sensor indicates the availability of
    high rates of rainfall, the system is turned off and the irrigation periods are
    rescheduled by referring to fuzzy logic rules. 2.3. Controller unit The controller
    is held responsible for intelligent data processing for irrigation scheduling,
    and the generation of the output control signal, namely the duration, time, and
    period of irrigation unit opening and activation which is decided by FL programmed
    and implemented in ATmega2560 microcontroller. In addition, this unit is responsible
    for receiving and transmitting time-series data from the sensor’s unit to the
    developed visualization and monitoring platform. 2.3.1. Mathematical modeling
    The proposed FL controller is composed of three key components, namely the fuzzification
    module, the inference engine, and the defuzzification module, as illustrated in
    Fig. 4. The system operates by developing a universe of discourse ( ) that entails
    a membership function and defining an interval of ( ) represented by . In this
    context, is characterized as a membership function that comprises a set of ordered
    pairs of elements and the probability that e belongs to ( ), as described by Pazouki
    et al., 2021. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Flow-chart of FL inference-based irrigation controller. The system
    requires three input parameters, namely soil moisture (SM), temperature (T), and
    solar irradiance (SR). Each of these parameters comprises three membership functions
    that are identified by a fuzzy subset of ( ). Specifically, variable represents
    soil moisture, variable represents temperature, and variable represents solar
    irradiance. The degree to which a given value of belongs to variables , , and
    is expressed by the membership functions , and . Equations (2), (3) respectively
    provide the fuzzy intersection and union set for the three variables. The purpose
    of the fuzzification step is to transform a digital input obtained from a sensor
    into a linguistic variable by means of membership functions. A membership function
    can be defined as a function that specifies the degree of membership of a numerical
    input to a linguistic variable. In this context, the membership function employed
    regulates a variety of parameters, including fluctuations in soil moisture, temperature,
    and solar irradiance. The proposed irrigation system commonly employs triangular
    and trapezoidal membership functions to make appropriate decisions. Equations
    (4), (5) depict the triangular and trapezoidal shapes, respectively, for a three-value
    fuzzification system. Fig. 5 illustrates the membership functions for both the
    inputs and outputs of the FL controller. (2) (3) (4) (5) Download : Download high-res
    image (340KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Inputs and output membership
    functions. The fuzzy inference process involves the interpretation of input values
    gathered from sensors, which are then utilized to determine output values based
    on sets of rules. To accomplish this, a set of if-then rules has been formulated
    to operate with the membership functions of each input. The literature describes
    two types of fuzzy inference systems that can be implemented: Mamdani type and
    Sugano type. The Mamdani type has been selected for the proposed irrigation system
    because it is well-suited for expert system applications. In each given scenario,
    the output of the controller is represented by the irrigation duration, time and
    periods which varies in accordance with the fuzzy rules grouped in Table 2, Table
    3, and Table 4. Table 2. Rules of the output (duration of irrigation in min) for
    dry soil. Temperature (°C) Solar irradiance (%) Dark Medium Light Cold Very Long

    Zero In the process of implementing an intelligent irrigation strategy, defuzzification
    serves as the final step. After fuzzification, the rules are applied to generate
    a fuzzy output which is subsequently transformed into a scalar quantity. The selection
    of the centroid defuzzification method has been based on its precision in producing
    reliable outputs. Equation (6) expresses the defuzzified output ( ). (6) 2.3.2.
    Simulation and validation of proposed system A preliminary simulation of the irrigation
    system has been carried out using the FL toolbox available in the Matlab/Simulink
    environment in order to build the fuzzy rules for each irrigation scenario and
    verify the system responses. The fuzzy rules are based on Mamdani''s “if-then”
    conditions. The 3D graphical representation of the temperature and soil moisture
    variables as a function of the irrigation time is given in Fig. 6. It is clear
    that the system allows the irrigation process with variable duration according
    to the parameters of the plants, the soil, and the weather conditions. Download

    3D Fuzzy logic graph of rules. 2.4. Irrigation unit The irrigation unit is composed
    of an impulse solenoid and diaphragm valve, distribution pipes, and emitters.
    The solenoid is controlled through the output signal provided by the controller
    unit. The opening time and duration can be adjusted according to the decision
    of the FL controller and vary depending on the conditions affecting the irrigation.
    The efficiency of the system is considered. For this purpose, a flow meter is
    located next to the valve to measure the water consumption in the distribution
    line. Moreover, the overall energy consumed during the operation under the adopted
    irrigation strategy is calculated from the installed voltage and current sensors.
    The obtained values are used to calculate the energy consumed per time unit. 2.5.
    LoRa based IoT communication unit In order to closely monitor the status of the
    irrigation system and to visualize the evolution of the parameters related to
    precision irrigation to fulfil the customer''s display requirements, ten parameters
    are displayed in a developed platform (See Fig. 7). This platform allows to follow
    in real-time the evolution of each parameter as well as the implementation of
    alerts (e-mail, telegram, and SMS) in case of failure (problems at the level of
    the sensors, condition on the irrigation parameters), moreover the transversal
    communication between the hardware and software part. The main page that is displayed
    contains an indication of the status of the system (on/off), the air temperature,
    the soil moisture, the soil temperature, the electrical conductivity, and the
    salinity. The irrigation duration provided by the FL controller, the evolution
    of the solar irradiance (the parameter is displayed as a percentage just to simplify
    the display) during each day is also displayed, and finally, the water flow rate
    distributed to the plant for each irrigation decision. An example of visualization

    frameworks, and a hardware environment containing boards with microcontrollers
    for processing as well as different communication shields for sending and receiving
    data, Fig. 9 represents the conception of each environment. Django is chosen given
    the multiple advantages that it presents, namely the robust development language
    Python, the ability to run with any client-side infrastructure, return data in
    any format namely HTML, RSS, JSON, XML, and provides robust security features
    that avoid common security errors (Srivastava et al., 2021). MySQL database is
    chosen as a manager owing to its many advantages in terms of rapidity, and ability
    to perform various operations using interfaces written in C, C++, Python, Java
    and PHP (Rao et al., 2014). The configuration of the manager is done at the Django
    framework level. Download : Download high-res image (247KB) Download : Download

    communication between the HTTP client and the platform is done through an API,
    which allows to interface and translate the requests received by the HTTP client
    to the server and return a response to the clients (when the Rest-API has what
    it needs, it sends back a response to the clients, typically be in JSON or XML
    format) (Ong et al., 2015). ATmega2560 programming is based on the Processing
    IDE and programmed with Arduino IDE software. The code is called a sketch and
    the assembly of several for functionalities are called libraries, which simplifies
    the user''s programming tasks by hiding the code in the libraries as a “black
    box”. The ATmega2560 can be programmed within the limits of 256 Kb of Flash memory
    with a clock rate of 16 MHz, moreover in this application of the smart precision
    irrigation system, it is autonomously working without being connected to an interface
    (computer) for control exchange. 2.6. Power unit The power consumption of the
    controller and sensor units, which represent a node in the proposed SPIS, is presented
    in Table 5. Specifically, the sensor unit consumes approximately 1.3 mA. Current
    investigations are being conducted to test the effectiveness of using small batteries
    to power this node. Based on initial estimations, two batteries of 6600 mAh associated
    in parallel could potentially provide a supply duration of around 1 year. This
    allows for reliable data collection with long-range capabilities and the ability
    to record hourly data. Table 5. Current consumption of the proposed system. Sensor

    the primary goal is to gather precise and comprehensive data. To achieve this,
    an integrated system that relies on a PV panel for power supply coupled with batteries.
    3. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system The operating steps of the
    proposed system are shown in Fig. 10. In the first step, the precipitation status
    is checked, if the sensor indicates that availability, the system is turned off,
    otherwise the system proceeds to the next step of sensing the values received
    by the sensor unit hourly (ambient temperature, solar irradiation and soil moisture).
    The time and duration of irrigation is given after applying the appropriately
    designed fuzzy rules by reasoning according to the information from these sensors.

    Fig. 10. Operating steps of the proposed irrigation system. In this study, the
    information generated by the soil moisture sensor indicates the requirement for
    irrigation. According to the expert of agriculture, the optimal threshold of soil
    moisture for apple tree’s is 30 %. Therefore, the measurement of this variable
    is taken into account in this study. For each situation and variation of the input
    variables of the FL controller, the result is determined by the rules summarized
    in tables 2,3 and 4. Some real scenarios examples are given as follow: • If the
    soil is wet, i.e. exceeds 30 %, and regardless of the values of solar irradiance
    and ambient temperature, the irrigation decision is given by a duration equal
    to zero. • If the soil moisture equals 30 %, and regardless the value of all input
    variables, the system remains turned off, with a null irrigation duration decision.
    • If the soil contains an average soil moisture value, with an average temperature
    and solar irradiance, then the irrigation duration is set to very short duration.
    • If the soil is dry with a high temperature and a minimum solar irradiance, the
    duration is set to zero, since the high temperatures generate an increase in evaporation
    and water loses. In the area where the experiment is conducted, the process of
    water aspiration through the soil has been estimated at 60 min. This duration
    is based on experimental measurements for a well-known soil constitution. The
    system is programmed to restart the same sequences, which justifies the frequency
    of sending data to the platform. 4. Software and hardware implementation The FL
    controller has been implemented in real-time through a code in C language adapted
    with ATmega2560 microcontroller, the structure of the code is given as follows:
    firstly, a declaration of the libraries to be used, namely that of the FL, the
    sensors used, the actuators (relay) that is used to control the impulse solenoid
    and the display. After acquiring the data, the processing by fuzzy controllers
    begins. The fuzzy logic code is devised in three parts, first is the design of
    the membership functions by using equations (4), (5) on each of the three inputs
    (soil moisture, ambient temperature, and solar irradiance) and defining the variation
    ranges. Secondly the design of the fuzzy rules, in our case 27 rules are implemented.
    The last part is the defuzzification, which consists in assigning the results
    to the output in the form of linguistic variable to be exploited afterwards. The
    output being the duration and the time of irrigation, this value is converted
    into control signal form to activate the relay that enables to activate the electro
    valve and pump to start the irrigation process. The controller is programmed to
    repeat the same sequences every hour, the program performs and schedule automatically
    the duration and times of irrigation periods without any human intervention. The
    communication between the control unit (ATmega2560), the sensors unit, the irrigation
    unit and the IoT platform is realized via the ESP32 development board by sending
    instructions. The SPIS prototype is shown in Fig. 11, and the irrigation unit
    is shown in Fig. 12. The control unit, which provides decisions, and the sensor
    unit are assembled in a case with an IP67 degree of protection. After receiving
    the decision from the FL controller, an electric control signal is sent back to
    the solenoid. It should be noted that the solenoid is impulse driven, i.e., for
    switching on and off states, it is sufficient to send only one impulse for micro-seconds.
    The operation of the solenoid according to the time decided by the proposed fuzzy
    controller, operates on the internal membrane of the valve. The component list
    used in its conception is summarized in Table 6. Download : Download high-res

    in the agricultural area (A), are presented in Fig. 14, Fig. 15, Fig. 16, Fig.
    17. The experimentation has been conducted over ten days of two different seasons,
    the summer of 2022 and the winter of 2023, this allowed to obtain an overview
    of the behaviour of the system as well as to perform a test under different meteorological
    variations in order to approve the efficiency of the adopted soil-weather approach.

    data for the summer period from 05/09/2022 to 14/09/2022 are presented in Fig.
    14 (a) The data are sensed hourly and consist of temperature (T) and solar irradiance
    (G) measurements. The highest and lowest temperatures are 37.72 °C and 15.32 °C
    respectively. The solar irradiance values vary from 0 to 1000 W/m2, indicating
    the intensity of solar radiation received during each hour. It can be observed
    that lower solar irradiance values occur during the night-time hours, indicating
    the absence of sunlight. As the day progresses, the solar irradiance values increase,
    reaching their peak at 1000 W/m2. The temperature fluctuations correlate with
    the solar irradiance values, as higher solar irradiance leads to higher temperatures.
    The collected data from the sensor unit of the SPIS have been cross validated
    with the measurements obtained from a trusted meteorological station. These validations
    have confirmed the accuracy of the collected data, with minimal margin of error.
    During the 10-day performance evaluation, it can be observed that the FL controller
    effectively avoids operating the system during periods of high temperatures and
    intense solar radiation, as depicted in Fig. 14 (b) and Fig. 14 (c) and decides
    on short durations when input variables are medium. This strategy significantly
    contributes to the reduction of ET losses throughout the day. Additionally, by
    referring to the well-designed fuzzy rules, the FL controller selects the appropriate
    timing and duration for system operation. Consequently, the actual soil moisture
    closely tracks the desired value of 30 % with smooth oscillations (See Fig. 14
    (d)), in contrast to traditional single input- single output (SISO) feedback systems
    that often result in low irrigation performance. This performance evaluation over
    the 10-day period demonstrates the effectiveness and improved performance of the
    FL in maintaining optimal soil moisture levels while minimizing water loss. An
    extensive performance analysis has been conducted on two specific days of summer
    period (13 and 14 September), to understand the overall operation of the SPIS
    (See Fig. 15). September 13th (13/09/2022) represents the operational conditions
    of the system that persist throughout the 10-day experimental period in September
    (summer). By observing the system''s performance on this day, valuable insights
    can be gained regarding its sustained operation throughout the experiment. In
    addition, September 14th (14/09/2022) has been chosen due to the presence of precipitation.
    This provides an opportunity to assess the system''s performance under the same
    conditions (high weather parameters variation), but with the added factor of precipitation.
    Analysing its behaviour on a day with precipitation allows for an evaluation of
    the system''s ability to cope with such weather conditions. Throughout the selected
    two-days observation period, it is evident that the FL-based irrigation system
    allowed for considerable irrigation durations during periods of minimal variation
    in meteorological conditions as seen in point A (See Fig. 15). However, it effectively
    avoided irrigation during high-temperature and solar radiation conditions, as
    observed in point B. Consequently, the system reprograms the irrigation decision
    until conditions reached minimal or intermediate values. These decisions have
    been automatically made by the system based on fuzzy rules summarized in Table
    2, Table 3 of section 2.3. Given the high hourly ET rate during the observed period
    in point B, it was apparent that the amount of water applied during irrigation
    would be lost to the air without benefiting the crops. This finding aligns with
    expert recommendations on irrigation practices. In the case of point C, where
    soil moisture is about 24 % and the solar irradiance variable is at a minimum
    value (G = 17 w/m2) while the temperature in a medium value (T = 29 °C), the irrigation
    duration is decided as medium. This approach effectively minimized losses in terms
    of ET. A similar decision was observed in point F, where G = 330 w/m2 and T =
    24 °C. The system consistently made the decision to withhold irrigation when soil
    moisture reached the pre-defined value set by the farmer. This is being observed
    in multiple points during the experimental days, particularly at points D. Additionally,
    the system maintained the same decision (null duration of irrigation) in the presence
    of precipitation, as observed in points E. The average applied amount of water
    for the first day was 529,6L, over the irrigated area which is approximately 100
    m2. It follows that the proposed FL-irrigation control system provides appropriate
    duration to the irrigation unit of the field to apply an average of 5.29L/day/m2,
    that is, 5.29 mm/day. This is similar to the daily estimated ET value using the
    Penman-Monteith FAO model, which is about 5.31 mm/day (according to data collected
    from the sensor unit). Similarly for the second day, the system permit applying
    an average of 471,4L/day/m2, while the ET value is about 4,73 mm/day. The proposed
    irrigation-based soil-weather approaches have been verified under summer period,
    the FL controller avoids applying water during periods when there are significant
    variations in weather conditions (See Fig. 16), this avoids the loss of water
    through evaporation processes, while keeping the plants in a better condition,
    i.e., no stress. In addition, as noted, the duration of irrigation varies depending
    on the conditions measured by the sensors, namely, soil moisture, ambient temperature,
    solar radiation, air humidity and rainfall. 5.2. Inter period Likewise, the obtained
    results during the winter period over 10 days (From 11/01/2023 to 20/01/2023)
    show that the irrigation system is operating in efficient mode and compensates
    the quantities of water required by the plants while considering the values of
    solar irradiance and temperature which are practically small and average during
    this period. A daily average of 1.98 mm/day, has been applied to the soil, which
    permits maintaining a soil moisture close to the predefined value of soil moisture
    30 % defined by the user (See Fig. 17). During this period, the system considers
    the presence of rainfall rates, to minimize the over-irrigation that influence
    the plants. The evolution of soil moisture is shown in Fig. 17 (d). It is remarkable
    that this variable reaches maximums of about 48 % since the precipitation rate
    are important. The duration and period of irrigation are always optimized during
    the variations of solar irradiance and temperature (See Fig. 17 (b) and Fig. 17
    (c)). The system avoids applying water to the plants during the night period,
    this is justified by the minimal ET rate during this period, and low irradiance
    and temperatures values therefore the irrigation durations are at mid-days. In
    summary, the aforementioned results indicate that the proposed irrigation system
    based on the soil-weather approach and fuzzy concept effectively compensates water
    losses in semi-arid regions where the experiment has been conducted, ensuring
    optimal hydration for well-watered and actively growing crops. The SPIS also has
    the capability to adjust water requirements according to weather conditions that
    influence the irrigation process, thereby facilitating improved irrigation management.
    Achieving a forecast of irrigation duration for several days would entail the
    creation of suitable artificial intelligence algorithms, such as artificial neural
    networks (ANN), long term short memory (LSTM), and support vector machines (SVM)
    which can be trained using extensive data collected through the SPIS. At present,
    our team is actively engaged in the development of these algorithms, as well as
    expanding the system to cover larger agricultural areas. 5.3. Water and energy
    consumption analysis The energy and water consumption at the level of the “irrigation
    unit” in the ‘A’ and ‘B’ areas of the experiment field have been carried out.
    It should be noted that the ''A'' area is furnished with drip irrigation pipes,
    along with the proposed SPIS and an impulse solenoid valve, and ‘B’ area is equipped
    only with a manual drip irrigation based commercial timer to preset the applied
    water flow and period which are performed according to the knowledge and visualisation
    of the water-stress on the leaves by the farmer. It is noted also that the ‘B’
    area contains a classical solenoid, which require a significant current to maintain
    the On state compared to the adopted impulse solenoid. During the summer period,
    the farmer refers to a commercial timer to regulate a fixed water flow rate of
    approximately 11 mm/day for ‘B’ area. This estimation was based solely on the
    observation of climatic conditions, neglecting the influence of irrigation quantities
    on plant growth and soil moisture dynamics. Conversely, the proposed irrigation
    system demonstrated its efficacy in area ‘A’ through the evaluation of climatic
    and soil variables. It effectively delivered a precise water supply while maintaining
    soil moisture levels near the optimal range for apple trees. By incorporating
    these variables, the proposed irrigation system proficiently optimized the water
    supply for apple trees, resulting in a notable water-saving of nearly 61 % (±2%)
    over a 10-day period. The farmer consciously decided to apply an average of 110
    mm of water, whereas the SPIS determined a more optimal irrigation amount of 51.6
    mm, equivalent to an approximate daily application rate of 5.16 mm/day. This demonstration
    underscores the system''s efficiency and significance in precise irrigation management,
    ensuring the health and optimal growth of plants. Similarly, the power consumption
    in area ‘B’ stands at approximately 620Wh. Nevertheless, by optimizing water usage
    levels using the proposed SPIS-based FL decision and impulse solenoids, a remarkable
    reduction of approximately 46 % in overall power consumption has been achieved.
    6. Conclusion In this paper, a feedback FL control and combined soil-weather approach
    were presented, to foster water conservation and better irrigation scheduling
    and management in the eastern agriculture fields of Morocco. The fuzzy controller,
    developed based on Mamdani fuzzification using trapezoidal and triangular membership
    functions, effectively determined the duration of irrigation for crops. This utilization
    of FL control played a crucial role in maintaining soil moisture levels above
    pre-defined thresholds, exhibiting slight oscillations to prevent excessive run-off,
    thus conserving water and energy resources. To facilitate real-time performance
    monitoring and the creation of a comprehensive database, LoRa protocol has been
    utilised to communicate with a developed IoT platform. This enabled data to be
    collected on key environmental and climatic variables, as well as precise information
    on irrigation duration and soil proprieties. Presently, this is significantly
    contributing to data analysis and enhancing system performance. Implementing the
    system is straightforward, and its economic viability. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Nepal, a lower-middle-income country in South Asia, predominantly features
    smallholder farming communities operating on modest land holdings. These smallholders
    often adhere to traditional farming methods, relying on familial labor, which
    has become increasingly inefficient in contemporary agricultural landscapes. To
    enhance their productivity and efficiency, smallholder farmers require affordable
    and accessible Internet of Things (IoT)-based systems. However, the prevailing
    IoT solutions in the market primarily cater to large-scale commercial enterprises,
    rendering them unsuitable for the specific needs and constraints faced by smallholder
    farmers. In response to this gap, we have introduced a cost-effective, customizable,
    scalable, and dependable IoT platform tailored expressly for smallholder farmers.
    This platform empowers them to visualize, monitor, and control real-time data
    pertaining to their crops, livestock, and other agricultural assets. To ascertain
    the efficacy and suitability of our proposed platform, we conducted a comparative
    analysis with existing counterparts such as Blynk IoT and ThingSpeak IoT, evaluating
    their respective features and application services against standard requirements.
    Additionally, we subjected our platform to rigorous server load testing, assessing
    crucial performance parameters including throughput, response time, user capacity,
    and data sampling rates. Over an observation period spanning an average of 339
    days, our platform successfully processed and stored a substantial volume of data,
    encompassing 817,633 sensor messages, averaging 2412 messages per day, with a
    cumulative storage size of 14,238.28 KB. Extrapolating from these results, it
    is noteworthy that an A0 instance with 20 GB of cloud space can adequately accommodate
    200 users at a rate of 100 MB per user, which is adequate for the smallholder
    needs. Furthermore, the purposed platform was deployed inside a polyhouse to perform
    off-season grafting of citrus plants. The achieved success rate of 84% closely
    approached the success rate of 90–95% observed during on-season grafting. These
    empirical findings, coupled with the extensive data gathered during our research,
    underscore the reliability and performance of our proposed IoT platform for smallholder
    farmers.

    keyboard_arrow_down     Browse Figures Versions Notes Abstract Nepal, a lower-middle-income
    country in South Asia, predominantly features smallholder farming communities
    operating on modest land holdings. These smallholders often adhere to traditional
    farming methods, relying on familial labor, which has become increasingly inefficient
    in contemporary agricultural landscapes. To enhance their productivity and efficiency,
    smallholder farmers require affordable and accessible Internet of Things (IoT)-based
    systems. However, the prevailing IoT solutions in the market primarily cater to
    large-scale commercial enterprises, rendering them unsuitable for the specific
    needs and constraints faced by smallholder farmers. In response to this gap, we
    have introduced a cost-effective, customizable, scalable, and dependable IoT platform
    tailored expressly for smallholder farmers. This platform empowers them to visualize,
    monitor, and control real-time data pertaining to their crops, livestock, and
    other agricultural assets. To ascertain the efficacy and suitability of our proposed
    platform, we conducted a comparative analysis with existing counterparts such
    as Blynk IoT and ThingSpeak IoT, evaluating their respective features and application
    services against standard requirements. Additionally, we subjected our platform
    to rigorous server load testing, assessing crucial performance parameters including
    throughput, response time, user capacity, and data sampling rates. Over an observation
    period spanning an average of 339 days, our platform successfully processed and
    stored a substantial volume of data, encompassing 817,633 sensor messages, averaging
    2412 messages per day, with a cumulative storage size of 14,238.28 KB. Extrapolating
    from these results, it is noteworthy that an A0 instance with 20 GB of cloud space
    can adequately accommodate 200 users at a rate of 100 MB per user, which is adequate
    for the smallholder needs. Furthermore, the purposed platform was deployed inside
    a polyhouse to perform off-season grafting of citrus plants. The achieved success
    rate of 84% closely approached the success rate of 90–95% observed during on-season
    grafting. These empirical findings, coupled with the extensive data gathered during
    our research, underscore the reliability and performance of our proposed IoT platform
    for smallholder farmers. Keywords: Internet of Things (IoT); custom IoT architecture;
    smart agriculture; smallholder; sensor and actuators; grafting 1. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging technology which has been significantly
    increasing recently in many application domains such as smart cities, industrial
    manufacturing, home automation, precision agriculture, the health industry, wearables,
    etc. The IoT-based system includes a network of different sensors and actuators
    that can be integrated into the cloud service using the internet. Cloud-based
    applications and services can be accessed using network-enabled devices like smartphones,
    laptops, and other digital devices anytime, anywhere. IoT-based systems in agriculture
    can assist farmers in streamlining their labor and managing their resources efficiently.
    The information about the weather, soil properties, fertilizer, pests, and other
    variables can be obtained in real time using an IoT-based system [1,2,3]. Smallholder
    farmers in many lower-middle-income countries play a crucial role in global food
    production [4]. However, limited technological resources and access to information
    are the most challenging issues they often face. With the rising number of industries
    utilizing IoT, the agriculture sector is also one potential industry that can
    benefit significantly from IoT. On the other hand, designing a reliable, affordable
    IoT platform suitable for agricultural farms for smallholder farmers of middle-
    and lower-income countries with limited resources is always challenging [4,5].
    The essential components of IoT-based systems in agriculture include sensor networks,
    edge computing, and cloud computing. The sensor network collects data on weather
    conditions, soil moisture, and crop growth and controls irrigation systems. Edge
    computing processes and analyses sensor data close to the field. Cloud computing
    can store and analyze data from sensor networks and other IoT-based systems. 1.1.
    Challenges and Opportunities of IoT in Agriculture for Smallholder Farmers: In
    Context of Nepal Most of the farmers in Nepal are smallholder farmers with modest
    land holdings [6]. Smallholder farmers are also most of the agricultural labor
    force, accounting for more than 80% of all farm production. Despite being an agrarian
    country, the majority of the agricultural products are imported. The traditional
    way of farming solely relying on manual labor has not been productive these days.
    The rising cost of production, on the other hand, the shortage of manpower severely
    affects overall agricultural production. This has not only demotivated them to
    preserve their farming tradition but also significantly impacted their socio-economic
    status. The departure of the youth for foreign employment, the concept of a lower
    mindset for agriculture business, and the lack of access to technology and information
    have led to un-cultivating acres of land. In this context, the IoT system could
    revolutionize how smallholder farmers manage their farms. There are, however,
    challenges to its implementation. One of the main challenges is the cost of deploying
    and maintaining IoT-based systems. Another challenge is the limited technical
    capacity of smallholder farmers, who may need more skills or resources to use
    IoT-based methods [7] effectively. Several factors can make IoT in agriculture
    for smallholder farmers in Nepal differ from other regions. Nepal’s geographical
    location, topography, and climate can make farming in Nepal challenging. Many
    smallholder farmers in Nepal may need more access to capital, credit, and technology,
    which can affect the adoption and use of IoT. The lack of infrastructure, such
    as reliable electricity and internet connectivity, can limit the potential benefits
    of IoT in agriculture for smallholder farmers in Nepal. The cost of implementation
    and deployment of IoT systems is another potential challenge. Technical expertise
    and know-how of IoT devices and their operation is also a significant challenge.
    The agricultural practices and crops grown in Nepal may differ from other regions.
    Despite these challenges, the potential benefits of IoT for smallholder farmers
    in Nepal are significant, including increased efficiency, improved yield, reduced
    costs, and access to markets. For many years, the Nepal government has been focusing
    on improving agricultural production and commercialization by introducing some
    key plans and strategies. The government’s recent initiative is the Prime Minister
    Agriculture Modernization Project, Agricultural Development Strategy (2015–2035),
    which aims to implement modern technology to enhance agricultural productivity
    and commercialization [8]. With these initiatives and motivation, smallholder
    farmers will gradually start using the technology, familiarizing themselves with
    its operation and benefits. However, close coordination with the Government, local
    bodies, and communities is needed to overcome the challenges of understanding
    their specific needs and to ensure that the system is relevant to their needs.
    1.2. Real Use Case Scenario from Smallholder’s Perspective The proposed IoT platform
    for smallholder farmers presents compelling real-world applications across various
    agricultural scenarios. These applications include: Mushroom Farming: Mushroom
    cultivation is a popular endeavor among smallholder farmers in Nepal due to its
    quick turnaround and profitability. The IoT platform can play a pivotal role in
    mushroom farming by enabling precise control of environmental factors such as
    darkness, temperature, and humidity, which are critical for successful mushroom
    growth. Polyhouse Tunnel Agriculture: The adoption of polyhouse tunnels for tomato
    cultivation is on the rise. Within these controlled environments, the IoT platform
    offers effective management of climatic conditions and irrigation, ultimately
    leading to increased productivity and higher profits for farmers. Nursery Operations
    (Fruit and Flower Plants): Grafting fruit and flower plants in a nursery demands
    meticulous internal microclimate control. The IoT platform provides an ideal solution
    for managing these conditions, ensuring optimal growth and development of plants.
    Poultry Farming: A significant number of smallholder farmers in Nepal operate
    small-scale poultry farms. The IoT platform facilitates real-time remote monitoring
    of crucial parameters within the poultry farm, including temperature, humidity,
    and air quality. It can also be employed to automate feed and water systems. Additionally,
    real-time heating, cooling, and lighting systems can be automated to optimize
    energy consumption. Farm Security and Access Control: Ensuring security and controlled
    access to a farmer’s premises is of paramount importance. The IoT platform can
    be harnessed for this purpose, integrating sensors and actuators such as motion
    sensors and alarms. These elements provide early intrusion detection and facilitate
    prompt responses to safeguard the farm. Incorporating the IoT platform into these
    agricultural contexts not only enhances the precision and efficiency of farming
    practices, but also empowers smallholder farmers in Nepal to achieve better yields,
    improved profitability, and enhanced security measures, ultimately contributing
    to the sustainable growth of their agricultural endeavors. In essence, this research
    not only identifies the unique demands and challenges faced by smallholder farmers
    in resource-constrained developing countries, but also offers a tangible solution
    in the form of a deployable, cost-efficient, and reliable IoT platform. By rigorously
    evaluating its features and performance, this study contributes to the advancement
    of agricultural technology, particularly in contexts where smallholder farmers
    play a pivotal role in sustaining local and national food production. The remainder
    of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the related work. Material
    and methods are discussed in Section 3. Section 4 discusses the results, and Section
    5 concludes the research with possible future directions. 2. Related Work Doshi

    [10]. Nigussie et al. propose an “IoT-based irrigation management for smallholder
    farmers in rural sub-Saharan Africa” and found that an IoT-based irrigation management
    system can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of irrigation
    for smallholder farmers in rural sub-Saharan Africa. The study conducted in Ethiopia
    showed that the system was able to reduce water use by 60% while maintaining or
    increasing crop yields. The design provided farmers with real-time information
    on soil moisture levels and weather conditions, allowing them to make informed

    a mobile application provided real-time data and feedback to farmers, reducing
    water consumption by up to 50% while maintaining or increasing crop yields. The
    authors suggest that IoT-based smart farming systems can significantly enhance
    irrigation efficiency but require careful attention to affordability, accessibility,
    local context, and collaboration between stakeholders [12]. Bayih et al. describe
    a case study in Ethiopia where an IoT and wireless sensor network (WSN)-based
    system was implemented for smallholder farmers to monitor and control their irrigation
    and fertilization practices. The system used low-cost sensors and a web-based
    platform to provide real-time data and feedback to farmers. The study found that
    the system could significantly improve crop yields, reduce water usage, and increase
    fertilizer efficiency while reducing labor costs and minimizing environmental
    impact [13]. Maraveas et al. review studies on IoT-based greenhouse monitoring
    and control systems which use sensors and actuators to collect and adjust environmental
    factors. These systems can improve crop growth and quality, energy efficiency,
    and resource management. The authors suggest that these systems can enhance the
    sustainability and profitability of greenhouse agriculture, but implementation
    requires careful attention to issues such as affordability, reliability, scalability,
    and collaboration between stakeholders [14]. Lufyagila et al. discuss using an
    IoT-powered system to monitor environmental conditions in a poultry house in Tanzania.

    in developing countries agricultural sectors [15]. Quayson et al. introduce a
    framework for technology for good social foundations in sustainable supply chains,
    emphasizing the importance of a supportive environment for smallholder farmers,
    including access to technology, training, and market incentives. The research
    highlights the potential for technology-based interventions to improve social
    and environmental outcomes and calls for future research to ensure inclusivity
    for smallholder farmers in developing countries [16]. Cheng et al. present a study
    on the development and implementation of an intelligent agriculture system that
    utilizes IoT technology in Taiwan. The system includes environmental monitoring
    sensors and a cloud-based data analysis platform. The study results showed that
    the system improved crop yields and resource management while being user friendly
    and accessible. The researchers suggest that the system has the potential to improve
    sustainability and profitability in agriculture by reducing resource use and increasing
    productivity. Further system development could include automated irrigation and
    fertilization [17]. Oliveira-Jr et al. discuss a case study on developing and
    deploying an IoT-based sensing platform for e-Agriculture in Mozambique. The platform
    included environmental monitoring sensors and a cloud-based data analysis platform.
    The study showed that the platform was effective in improving crop yields and
    resource management and being user friendly and accessible. The researchers suggest
    that the platform could be further developed to include weather forecasting and
    crop disease management, which could reduce crop losses. The study highlights
    the potential of IoT technology for e-Agriculture in Africa and provides insights
    for future research and development in other regions and for other crops [18].
    Sekaran et al. developed a smart agricultural management system using IoT. This
    method gathers agriculture data from sensors from the fields. It creates results
    for ranchers, is essential for observing harvest development, and diminishes their
    time and energy. The information gathered from the field is stored in the cloud
    and field control is achieved by using IoT gadgets. The idea introduced in the
    paper could expand the efficiency of the harvests by decreasing the wastage of
    assets used in agribusiness fields [19]. Agricultural IoT solutions can help the
    sector improve operational efficiency, save costs, minimize waste, and enhance
    product quality. Haque et al. developed secure IoT devices for the smart agriculture
    system. Smart agriculture based on the IoT is a system that uses sensors to monitor
    irrigation activities and automate crop production in the agricultural field.
    Farmers may monitor the state of their land from any location [20]. Bera et al.
    presented an intelligent precession Agriculture, where drones can be used to collect
    the sensor data and send to a ground server station. The data are secured using
    block chain-based authentication [21]. Jiang et al. described the deep learning
    approaches for apple fruit detection in agriculture. Deep learning, which demonstrates
    its ability in fruit handling and grouping, is utilized to arrange apples. The
    profound neural organization with various convolution layers and individual neurons
    is analyzed and assessed [22]. Bu et al. introduced a smart IoT agriculture system
    with deep learning reinforcement integrated in the cloud server for smart decisions,
    like how much water is required for the better growth of the crop [23]. Parvathi
    et al. proposed an intelligent agriculture management system to improve agricultural
    benefits and crop production. The goal is to use IoT and automate the task. It
    is intended to perform weeding, water system, detecting mugginess, endeavoring
    to alarm birds and animals, keeping up with reconnaissance, and so forth, to control
    the geolocation of gadgets from a distance [24]. Katanga et al. proposed an IoT-based,
    cost-effective hardware solution using voice-activated technology, centered around
    the ESP8266 NodeMCU micro-controller. It enables home automation via voice commands
    through Google Assistant and IFTTT integration and offers agricultural monitoring
    with soil moisture, temperature, and humidity analysis. The system efficiently
    manages water flow based on soil conditions and utilizes Wi-Fi for data transfer
    to cloud storage (Thingspeak) and the Blynk IoT platform [25,26]. Most of the
    work mentioned above has been concentrated on applications that either use more
    complicated systems or depend on third-party applications unsuitable for smallholder
    farmers. Smallholder farmers in low- and middle-income countries face multiple
    challenges in adopting the existing IoT architecture, including high costs, inadequate
    infrastructure, technical complexity, limited customization, and difficulties
    in maintenance and support. Consequently, a more affordable, user friendly, and
    customized IoT solution is required to cater to their unique needs and boost their
    productivity and livelihoods. 3. Materials and Methods The methodology for implementing
    IoT architecture in agriculture for smallholder farmers follows a systematic approach
    that encompasses the following steps: Comprehensive literature review: A thorough

    trained by involving them in the design and operation of the platform and by providing
    them with relevant and useful information that can help them improve their livelihoods.
    Data visualization: The platform should provide farmers with easy-to-use tools
    for accessing and interpreting the data, such as dashboards and visualizations,
    to help them make better-informed decisions about farming practices. Power efficiency:
    The platform should use low-power hardware to be power efficient, especially in
    remote and rural areas where farmers cannot access grid power and rely on solar
    or battery backup. 3.2. Description of the Proposed Customized IoT Architecture
    and Platform for Smallholder Farmers The essence of the custom IoT platform lies
    in its adaptability to the unique needs of individual smallholder farmers engaged
    in diverse forms of farming. This platform has been meticulously crafted to accommodate
    a broad spectrum of requirements within a single unified IoT framework. Key facets
    such as user-friendly application interfaces, concise training sessions for seamless
    operation, straightforward deployment procedures, and accessible local maintenance
    and support services have been prioritized to facilitate the widespread adoption
    of this IoT platform. The research outlined in this endeavor offers significant
    contributions to the field, which can be succinctly summarized as follows: Requirements
    and Challenge Identification: The study has effectively identified the multifaceted
    requirements and challenges associated with designing and implementing an IoT
    platform tailored for smallholder farmers in developing countries, especially
    considering resource constraints. By comprehensively understanding these needs

    Deployable, Cost-Efficient, and Reliable IoT Platform: The research has culminated
    in the creation of a practical, cost-effective, and dependable IoT platform specifically
    crafted for smallholder agricultural farms in a developing nation like Nepal.
    This platform’s design not only aligns with the limited resource capacities prevalent
    in such regions but also ensures its viability and efficacy in real-world agricultural
    settings. Evaluation of Features and Application Performance: A thorough evaluation
    of the proposed IoT platform has been conducted in comparison to existing systems.
    This assessment encompasses a detailed examination of its features and application
    performance, providing valuable insights into its capabilities and potential advantages
    over existing solutions. The proposed IoT architecture for smallholder agriculture
    incorporates a sensor network, edge computing, and cloud computing to collect
    and process field data. The architecture is designed to be low cost and user friendly,
    enabling smallholder farmers to access it with limited resources. Additionally,
    it is scalable to meet the changing needs of farmers. Figure 1 illustrates the
    customized IoT platform approach for smart agriculture. Figure 1. Customized IoT
    platform approach for smart agriculture. The proposed IoT system stands out for
    its customization capabilities, allowing users to select application services
    tailored to their specific needs. This flexibility extends to sensor and switch
    services, where users have the freedom to configure their system as per their
    preferences. For instance, one user might opt for three sensors and two switch
    services, while another may require two or three switch-based services. Furthermore,
    the architectural framework incorporates a discussion forum, serving as a valuable
    platform where experts can address general user inquiries and offer remote support
    and guidance. Overview of User Application and Services: The user-centric application
    and service structure of the proposed system can be summarized as follows: Role-Based
    Access: Administrators play a pivotal role by creating distinct roles for end
    users, encompassing smallholder farmers, custom users, scientists, and data analysts.
    Device Deployment: End users possess the capability to set up IoT sensor devices
    and controllers within their agricultural fields, ensuring seamless integration
    with their operations. Data Management: Data generated by diverse IoT sensors
    undergo meticulous collection, processing, and transmission to a cloud server.
    This data repository is accessible to data analysts, experts, and scientists who
    can offer valuable insights and feedback. Customized Service Applications: End
    users leverage customized service applications, empowering them with the tools
    needed for real-time monitoring and control of their systems. Key Features within
    the Proposed System: The architectural design of the proposed system prioritizes
    features identified as pivotal for smallholder farmers. These essential features
    encompass: Real-time Data Monitoring and Visualization: Farmers gain the ability
    to access and act upon real-time sensor data, enabling them to visually monitor
    field conditions at predetermined intervals. This capability facilitates real-time
    tracking and visualization for various agricultural parameters, including temperature,
    humidity, light intensity, pH levels, tank water levels, soil moisture, and more.
    I-Switch Control: The “i-Switch” application empowers farmers to remotely activate
    electrical and electronic devices and appliances through custom-designed web and
    mobile applications. This service is particularly advantageous for areas like
    greenhouses, polyhouses, and irrigation fields, where automation and control are
    essential. I-Switch ensures precise regulation of the internal microclimate by
    controlling exhaust fans, fogging systems, heating, and cooling, thereby maintaining
    the desired temperature, humidity, and moisture levels. GPS Tracking: This feature
    aids in tracking the movement of agricultural logistics and machinery through
    GPS sensors. The GPS sensor data are transmitted to the cloud, where they is mapped
    and displayed in a browser and mobile application, providing real-time visibility
    of agricultural assets. Alerts and Messaging: Users receive timely alerts and
    messages via email and SMS, notifying them of any events that surpass predefined
    thresholds. This feature ensures users stay well informed and up to date regarding
    their agricultural operations. Data Logging and Analytics: Sensor data are consistently
    logged and securely stored in both cloud-based databases and local storage, offering
    users the flexibility to export data to local computers. Additionally, data analysts,
    scientists, and researchers can access this repository for in-depth analysis and
    provide valuable feedback. The stored data are easily retrievable and amenable
    to customized analysis. Discussion Forum: Smallholder farmers benefit from a dedicated
    discussion forum, fostering connections and communication with peers, research
    scientists, data analysts, and other stakeholders. This service facilitates the
    exchange of text and image-based queries and suggestions, streamlining the sharing
    and acquisition of critical information. Onsite and Online Data Logging Architecture:
    To surmount the challenges posed by unreliable internet connections, the proposed
    architecture ingeniously combines onsite and online data logging. This hybrid
    approach, guarantees data availability on local storage devices complete with
    timestamps, even in the absence of a stable internet connection. Figure 2 shows
    the Onsite and online data log architecture. Figure 2. Onsite and online data
    log architecture. 3.3. Hardware and Application Design Components The proposed
    system incorporates various components to create an IoT architecture that can
    collect, analyze, and act on data from the smallholder. These components include
    a microcontroller unit, sensors, actuators, a gateway, network connectivity, data
    storage, a cloud platform, and a mobile/web application. The proposed architecture
    uses a low-cost, low-power, open-source microcontroller unit nodemcu esp8266 with
    a Wi-Fi module embedded in it. It consists of 17 general purpose input output
    pins. It supports digital and analog I/O with 11 pins and 1 pin, respectively.
    In addition to this, there are pins to support UART, I2C, and SPI interface. The
    wireless network connectivity has the ability to create its own network, a maximum
    clock speed of 160 MHz with 128 KB of RAM, and 4MB flash memory, which are good
    choices for the proposed system design. The gateway serves as the device that
    connects the sensors and actuators to the internet. The proposed architecture
    is based on Wi-Fi and mobile cellular network connectivity. The network topology
    is a star topology, where all the sensor nodes are connected to the central Wi-Fi
    router. This topology is more suitable for the proposed system as the smallholder
    farmers usually require 3–5 sensors and actuators in response to our research
    question. The range of Wi-Fi is 100 m in line of sight and if required can be
    extended by using another nodemcu as a relay module. Sensors such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, light, pH, and Global Positioning System (GPS) can be
    integrated into the architecture to collect environmental data. Actuators like
    motors, valves, or relays can control various aspects of the smallholder’s operation,
    such as irrigation or climate control systems. Data collected by the sensors are
    stored locally in a microSD card and sent to the cloud for reliable data storage.
    After comparing various cloud services and their associated cost and features,
    Microsoft Azure is chosen as the cloud platform to host the application and cloud
    storage. Both a web server-based application and android-based mobile application
    are developed to access the IoT platform. The reason for choosing Microsoft Azure
    cloud services is due to its cost effectiveness and scalability. Similarly, many
    local smallholder farmers use android-powered devices to access the internet.
    The proposed architecture provides services in both web-based applications as
    well as in mobile applications. Time-series data visualization and a graphical
    dashboard interface are integrated for analytics and visualization. All these
    components integrate together to enable the smallholder to make data-driven decisions
    about managing their operation. The client-side hardware set-up is depicted in
    Figure 3. Figure 3. Client-side IoT devices. Platform Application Design: Our
    system application has been thoughtfully designed to cater to both web and mobile
    platforms, using a robust client-server-based architecture. Within this framework,
    every user is allocated a personalized dashboard, granting them immediate access
    to real-time monitoring and control capabilities. Furthermore, users have the
    flexibility to extract time-series data for in-depth data analytics. User-Centric
    Architecture: The architectural blueprint of our user registration system application
    is visually represented in Figure 4, providing a comprehensive overview of how
    user interaction and data flow are seamlessly integrated. Figure 4. User registration
    and system application architecture. 3.4. Multi-Platform Application and User
    Interface Our system application has been meticulously crafted to seamlessly function
    on both web and mobile platforms, leveraging a robust client-server-based architecture.
    Each user is endowed with a bespoke dashboard, providing them with real-time access
    to viewing, monitoring, and controlling of their application. Furthermore, users
    have the capability to export time-series data for conducting in-depth data analytics.
    The implementation of our proposed IoT system unfolds in two distinct phases:
    user registration and system application. During the user registration phase,
    user profiles are established, and the requisite hardware, encompassing IoT devices
    and sensors, is precisely configured in alignment with their unique service prerequisites.
    In the subsequent system application phase, users are seamlessly directed to their
    dedicated user applications, meticulously tailored to their preferences. This
    empowers them to take action, monitor real-time data, and promptly engage in data
    analysis. Dynamic Data Visualization: The presentation of data visualization takes
    on various forms, exemplified in the following figures: Figure 5 showcases the
    web application dashboard, offering the user a comprehensive view of three essential
    sensor parameters: temperature, humidity, and water level. Additionally, it grants
    control over a pivotal switch service, the water pump. Figure 5. Web application
    and dashboard. Figure 6 exhibits the mobile application dashboard, ensuring that
    users can access critical data and control functions conveniently via their mobile
    devices. Figure 7 and Table 1 introduce the visualization of time-series data
    and the accompanying data export template. This facilitates users in exporting
    stored data on various time intervals, be it hourly, weekly, monthly, or within
    specified date ranges. Figure 6. Mobile application dashboard. Figure 7. Time-series
    data visualization. Table 1. Data export template in csv format. 3.5. Reliability
    and Performance Monitoring After developing the proposed architecture and system
    design, various custom application services were tested to evaluate their performance
    and reliability. To simulate real-world scenarios, users were created and assigned
    custom application services that are frequently required. Additionally, IoT devices
    were configured and installed by the users. The application services, update interval,
    and observed period are summarized in Table 2. Analysis of the observation data
    revealed that the system remained highly reliable throughout the observed period.
    Table 2. Reliability and performance monitoring. This work demonstrates the design
    and implementation of the potential of IoT platforms for enhancing agricultural
    operations among smallholder farmers in Nepal, where the utilization of IoT in
    agriculture currently needs to be improved. The proposed IoT architecture effectively
    provides smallholder farmers with real-time data, thereby improving the efficiency
    and productivity of their agricultural operations. This study offers a model for
    other smallholder farmers to adopt while also providing insights into the challenges
    and opportunities associated with implementing IoT in smallholder agriculture.
    In particular, the study highlights the proposed IoT platform’s affordability,
    reliability, scalability, data management, ease of operation, and localization
    benefits. These findings have important implications for the future development
    of IoT-based agricultural systems that cater to the unique needs of smallholder
    farmers in Nepal and other similar contexts. Our developed system is hosted on
    the website https://www.medhayantra.com (accessed on 25 July 2023) and is accessible
    to everyone. For the real-time implementation Medhayantra has been collaborating
    with renowned agriculture research stations, including the National Agriculture
    Research Center (NARC), Nepal, National Citrus Research Program (NCRP), Nepal,
    Regional Agriculture Research Center (RARS), and various others. This collaboration
    has allowed Medhayantra to acquire invaluable insights into the latest research
    and development within the agriculture industry, which have been effectively incorporated
    into the company’s range of products and services. Figure 8 depicts some of the
    implementation sites. Figure 8. Implementation site: National Citrus Research
    Program, Dhankuta, Nepal. Figure depicts the experimental set-up for offseason
    grafting of Citrus fruits inside a polyhouse. The proposed IoT platform is used
    to regulate internal microclimate in real time. 4. Results Discussion The performance
    and comparison section below highlights the proposed system’s important features,
    services, and performance. The cost analysis is performed for the proposed method
    based on the number of users and upgrade plan. The data storage analysis and server
    load test are performed to determine parameters like data file size, sample size,
    throughput, and response time. During this average observation period of 339 days
    a total of 817,633 messages were stored in the cloud by different devices. This
    provides an average of messages per day = 817,633/339, which is rounded to 2412
    messages/day. The total storage file size recorded is 14,238.28 kB. Azure A0 instance
    has a capacity of 20 GB, demonstrating that the capacity can be extended to 20
    GB/14,238.28 kB about 1473 times. This indicates that, if one user is allocated
    50 MB of storage, approximately 400 users can be accommodated. The server load
    test is performed to find the throughput for 120 users over the interval. The
    server load test is conducted using an Apache J meter version 5.5. The subsequent
    Section 4.1 to 4.3 discuss the server load test, and the performance comparison
    with the Blynk IoT platform and ThingSpeak platform and cost analysis, respectively.
    One of the real implementations of the platform was used to control the internal
    microclimate of the polyhouse for grafting Acid lime (Sunkagati-1) citrus fruit
    during the offseason (July–August). Citrus fruits are one of the major cultivated
    plants and have attracted many farmers in Nepal as it has a good return. Grafting
    of citrus plants is done only once a year due to the prevailing climate condition.
    However, the supply of grafted plants is not adequate to meet the demand [27].
    An off-season grafting controlling the internal microclimate can help to produce
    more grafted plants. The grafting parameters are shown in Table 3. The average
    grafting success rate is found to be nearly 84 percent which is close to on-season
    grafting (December–February) where the grafting success rate is reported to be
    around 90 to 95 percent. Table 3. Off-season grafting success rate. 4.1. Server
    Load Test We have conducted the server load test to check the performance of our
    system using Apache JMeter version 5.5 software. Table 4 shows the server load
    test for different numbers of users for the various parameters: response time,
    throughput, and the network sent and received. Overall, the load test results
    demonstrate that increasing the number of users leads to higher server load, longer
    response times, and reduced network traffic. Figure 9 shows the server load test
    data for the different numbers of users. Figure 9. Server load test data for the
    different number of users. Table 4. Server load test data for the different number
    of users. 4.2. Performance Comparisons We have taken two similar IoT platforms,
    Blynk [28] and Thingspeak [29], for comparative analysis. The comparative chart
    for the existing platforms, the proposed system features, and plans are shown
    in Figure 10, Figure 11, and Figure 12, respectively. The features of the proposed
    system are listed in Table 5. Figure 10. Blynk IoT platform comparison with different
    plan. Figure 11. Thingspeak IoT platform comparison with different plan. Figure
    12. Performance comparison of the proposed system with a different plan. Table
    5. Proposed IoT platform features and parameters. Figure 12 shows the performance
    comparison of the proposed system with different plans. For scalability and performance
    enhancement, the X5 plan is included, which support more users with enhanced features.
    The cost analysis for the X5 plan is derived based on the fact that the architecture
    is scalable; hence, the only change is to upgrade the cloud service instance from
    A0 to A2. The A2 instance has 2 processor cores with 3.5 GB RAM and 490 GB storage
    in contrast to the A0 instance, which runs in 1 processor core, 0.75 GB RAM, and
    20 GB storage. The Blynk Plan offers medium complexity with support for applications,
    widgets, and some data streaming capabilities. The ThingSpeak Plan is geared towards
    more complex projects with better scalability, advanced technical support, and
    data export options. The proposed system has a lower level of complexity but offers
    a range of features, including web and mobile app support, data storage, security,
    and customization options. 4.3. Cost Analysis We have taken the important features
    of both platforms for comparative analysis. The proposed IoT platform is hosted
    in Azure A0 instance to experiment. The pricing and parameters of Azure instances,
    which could be potential use for scalability for our platform, are shown in Table
    6. We have conducted a server load test to determine the throughput, latency,
    and reliability. Table 6. Feature of Azure cloud platform and their instances
    *. We have incorporated the essential features in our platform required for smallholder
    farmers’ applications. In addition to proposing an IoT system, we have conducted
    a cost analysis for its deployment based on the number of users who can utilize
    the shared platform. The associated costs, calculated using contemporary local
    pricing, are listed in Table 7. The number of users share the variable application
    development cost. Table 7. Cost analysis based on local market (in Nepali Rupees
    NPR *). The cost/user per annum is calculated as Cloud service cost + Connectivity
    cost + Application development cost + Support and update cost = NPR (Nepali Rupees)
    4000 + NPR 450 + NPR 2321 + NPR 2000 = NPR 8771 (USD 272.73). The average cost
    is estimated as the total application Development cost/Number of users, i.e.,
    1,880,000/270, approx. 6963, further spread over 36 months and results in NPR
    (Nepali Rupees) 193.4 per user. Considering the number of users as 100, the total
    estimated cost per user per annum for average service remains Cloud service cost
    + Connectivity cost + Application development cost + Support and update cost =
    NPR 500 + NPR 450 + NPR 2320 + NPR 2000 = NPR 5270 (USD 39.9). Based on Figure
    13, it can be observed that the cost of deploying IoT systems significantly decreases
    as the number of users increases. This reduction in cost makes it affordable for
    smallholder farmers to invest in such systems, enabling them to manage their farms
    effectively. The reliability and durability of the system are observed by deploying
    the IoT device using this platform. The comparative cost analysis for 100 users
    is tabulated in Table 8. It is found that the proposed system cost indicates approximately
    5 times and 18 times less compared to the Blynk and thing Speak platform. Figure
    13. Number of users and cost of deployment. Table 8. Comparative cost/annum with
    existing system. The system’s data export function allows users to download data
    from the cloud to their local device. Seven devices were deployed to calculate
    the cloud storage and file size of the sensor data over time. Each device logged
    sensor data to the cloud at regular intervals. The stored data are downloaded
    to the local machine. Table 9 represents the number of transactions, messages,
    and file size. Table 9. Number of transactions, messages, and file size. 4.4.
    Limitations of the Study The limitations of this study include the limited sample
    size. The study is conducted on a limited number of users, and the results may
    not be generalizable to all smallholder farmers. Another limitation is the cost
    of the proposed solution for a very limited service application that may be a
    barrier for some smallholder farmers to adopt the solution. 5. Conclusions This
    research aimed to identify the specific needs to design and implement an IoT platform
    in agriculture specifically tailored to the needs and resources of smallholder
    farmers of lower and middle incoming countries like Nepal. The proposed IoT architecture
    includes a combination of sensor networks, edge computing, and cloud computing
    and is designed to be low cost and easy to use. The research included a literature
    review, design of the IoT architecture, data collection, data analysis, and field
    testing. The developed system features and performances are evaluated with the
    existing system and found to be low cost, has inclusive features, and is reliable.
    Moreover, the proposed platform incorporates an offline data logging system in
    situations when internet connectivity is lost, which is an additional feature
    compared to the existing systems. In an observation for an average period of 339
    days a total of 817,633 sensor messages are stored in the cloud server which accounts
    for, on average, 2512 messages/day. The storage file size recorded for this period
    is 14,238.28 KB. We are using Azure Version 2022-11-02 as a cloud server. With
    the basic plan (A0 Instance), which has a storage of 20 GB, we can accommodate
    400 users if one user is allotted 50 MB of data, which is adequate for the smallholder
    farmers operation for more than a year. The data can be download from the server
    and can be analyzed for future reference. Furthermore, the proposed system was
    implemented to regulate the internal microclimate for offseason grafting of citrus
    fruit Acid-Lime (sunkagati-1) inside a polyhouse. The grafting success of 84 percent
    was achieved, which is near to the regular on-season grafting rate. The real-life
    implementation of the platform is now deployed and hosted at www.medhayantra.com.
    The implementation and results showed that the proposed IoT architecture is reliable
    and effective in providing smallholder farmers with real-time data and control
    to improve the efficiency and productivity of their agricultural operations. However,
    there are also challenges to its implementation, such as the willingness of the
    smallholder farmers to adopt the technology, community training and support, and
    further reduction in cost and technical capacity for proper operation. Author

  description: Farmers of the twentieth century are adopting the use of leading technical
    facilities in the field of agriculture to sustain the competitiveness of the global
    market economy. With the help of modern technology, they are trying to reduce
    production costs and improve crop yield with better product quality. A new era
    in which many traditional agricultural practices are replaced by cutting-edge
    technologies like Precision Farming (PF), which entails applying the agronomic
    variables in the right place, at the right time, has been ushered in by technological
    advancements made in monitoring, supervision, management, and control systems.
    One of the methods that will enable quick and non-destructive analysis of agricultural
    data will turn out to be an IoT integrated smart agriculture drone. This includes
    taking pictures to analyze crop behavior, finding out how much water the soil
    can contain, managing irrigation systems, etc. Numerous engineering disciplines,
    including aerodynamics, electronics, computer programming, and economics are integrated
    in the design, development, and implementation of drone-based agricultural systems.
    In considering the above thought, a problem taken into consideration is for a

    PDF TOOLS SHARE Summary Farmers of the twentieth century are adopting the use
    of leading technical facilities in the field of agriculture to sustain the competitiveness
    of the global market economy. With the help of modern technology, they are trying
    to reduce production costs and improve crop yield with better product quality.
    A new era in which many traditional agricultural practices are replaced by cutting-edge
    technologies like Precision Farming (PF), which entails applying the agronomic
    variables in the right place, at the right time, has been ushered in by technological
    advancements made in monitoring, supervision, management, and control systems.
    One of the methods that will enable quick and non-destructive analysis of agricultural
    data will turn out to be an IoT integrated smart agriculture drone. This includes
    taking pictures to analyze crop behavior, finding out how much water the soil
    can contain, managing irrigation systems, etc. Numerous engineering disciplines,
    including aerodynamics, electronics, computer programming, and economics are integrated
    in the design, development, and implementation of drone-based agricultural systems.
    In considering the above thought, a problem taken into consideration is for a
    grape field of approximately 10 acres located near Nashik (28 36''N, 77 12''E)
    in the state of Maharashtra to analyze the performance of IoT enabled agriculture
    drones for PF. Main objective is to spray the insecticide with an agriculture
    drone only on the detection of the green zone of the crop or canopy for effective
    spraying and hence to reduce the wastage and cost of spraying. Drone image sensor
    will capture the field images, atmospheric parameters like, temperature, humidity
    in the field and analyze it on the cloud platform for analyzing the crop health
    and related parameters. An agriculture drone of 16 L capacity is proposed for
    spraying 1 acre of land. It could take 7–10 minutes of flight time of the drone
    to spray the insecticide which can lead to reducing the labor cost by 65%, spraying
    time by 85% and amount of insecticide by 50%. Drone camera and spraying mechanism
    is to be synchronized to achieve the objective through IoT platform. For effective
    spraying from the bottom and the top of the leaf, synchronized UGV and UAV spraying

    Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Climate change has reduced the availability
    of good quality water for agriculture, while favoring the proliferation of harmful
    insects, especially in Mediterranean areas. Deploying IoT-based systems can help
    optimize water-use efficiency in agriculture and address problems caused by extreme

    soil moisture, soil electrical conductivity, soil temperature and meteorological
    data useful in irrigation management and pest control. The proposed system was
    implemented and evaluated for olive parcels located both at coastal and inland
    areas of the eastern part of Crete; these areas face severe issues with water

    remote sensing 1. Introduction Irrigated agriculture is the sector that contributes
    the most to total water withdrawals in the main olive oil producing Mediterranean
    countries, with a share of about 75% of total water withdrawals on average [1].
    However, increased water demand from other sectors such as tourism and climate
    change will limit the available water resources for agriculture in the coming
    decades and affect water quantity and quality. Efficient use of irrigation water
    is a key factor in resolving water scarcity issues, but it is also important for
    optimizing crop yields. The limited availability of water increases the interest
    of growers to save water by improved irrigation scheduling, as the cost of water
    rises. Thus, accurate irrigation scheduling remains a major challenge for growers
    [2,3]. To mitigate climate-water impacts on agricultural production, proper and
    sustainable agricultural practices related to water, soil and crops should be
    adopted by growers. Especially growers in arid and semi-arid orchard environments,
    who face significant problems with water availability, water salinity due to saltwater
    intrusion into coastal aquifers as well as occasional outbreaks of pest infestation.
    Thus, irrigation and pest/disease control require accurate management for optimizing
    crop productivity, water-use efficiency and diminishing environmental impacts
    [4]. In such environments, there is a potential to improve water-use efficiency
    through smart irrigation systems, especially with the advent of wireless communication
    technologies, monitoring systems and advanced control strategies for optimal irrigation
    scheduling [5]. Adopting irrigation management strategies to increase water-use
    efficiency such as deficit irrigation [6] or smart irrigation systems [7] requires
    several sensors to monitor soil water availability. The assessment of the water
    status of plants is usually performed with soil moisture sensors that provide
    data on the volumetric content of water in the soil [8]. Depending on their technology,
    these sensors provide an analog or digital signal and have the ability to communicate
    with recorders. In recent years, in addition to moisture sensors, smart sensors
    have been developed that simultaneously measure electrical conductivity and soil
    temperature in addition to moisture [9]. The rapid development of wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs) has led to the use of sensors with minimal need for wiring and
    great improvements in their installation and maintenance [10,11,12]. A wireless
    sensor network consists of several spatially distributed measurement points, called
    nodes, that communicate wirelessly with each other. The data received from each
    of them is stored in a central hub and processed for irrigation management. The
    weakness of such systems is that they use a central communication structure (gateway)
    to communicate with the end user, which can lead to the collapse of the entire
    system if this device has limited connectivity [13]. Generally, the Internet of
    Things (IoT) refers as a cluster of physical objects that are integrated with
    multiple sensors, processing capability, software and other technologies that
    facilitate communication with other devices and the cloud. IoT-based systems exchange
    data without having physical interaction with the user and suppliers through different
    modern wireless technologies and network solutions [14]. The evolution of mobile
    networks and the development of the IoT has made mobile Internet communications
    (GSM/GPRS, LTE, and NB) inexpensive. This enabled more flexibility in the deployment
    of nodes in a wireless network as each node contains a mobile communication unit.
    In this way, the topology of the network is changed from centralized to distributed,
    resulting in minimal impact on the operation of the network in the case of a single-node
    connection failure. The disadvantage of the mobile network is the increased energy
    requirements for the transmission of the signals from the nodes, so careful planning
    should be adopted to ensure the lowest possible energy consumption [15]. The use
    of sophisticated soil moisture and environmental sensors combined with appropriate
    recorders allows the application of algorithms to automatically estimate the amount
    of water needed and apply it at the right time [16]. They also enable agricultural
    alerts to be automatically sent when weather conditions favor the development
    of diseases or pests, so that farmers can take appropriate protective measures.
    As we move towards enhancing decision-making to support farmers and growers, the
    analysis of sensor data and exploiting intelligent scheduling of processes within
    a unified platform and framework is crucial [17,18]. Today, a large number of
    companies offering platforms for sensor data visualization are available in the
    market [19,20,21,22]. However, they require skilled farmers who know how to interpret
    the data and implement the appropriate management strategy. Most of these platforms
    are basically commercial and often have high costs, which prevents the farmer
    from adopting them [23]. Previous researchers developed open IoT platforms for
    agriculture [24,25] but none of them combines scalability, multi-tenancy, cartographic
    background environment and creation of alerts when the value of a measurement
    passes a predetermined threshold. The novelty of this work is that it combines
    a decision support system for irrigation and plant protection with the above features
    connected with energy efficient low-cost end devices. Within this context, this
    work presents the design and implementation of a decision support system (DSS)
    through a low-cost IoT-based platform that provides irrigation management and
    plant protection advice to Mediterranean olive farmers. For this purpose, a network
    of reliable sensors was created to measure important soil and climate parameters
    in the areas of interest. Sensor data being stored in a database of an open-source
    IoT platform installed on the premises. Irrigation dose is estimated through a
    real-time computation, based on soil information, while weather information assists
    decision-making regarding plant protection. The proposed platform, through its
    capabilities, can effectively support the use of irrigation water towards increasing
    water productivity (ratio between the actual yield of the crop and the total water
    involved in crop production). In addition, based on the olive fly alerts provided
    by the platform, the user can act at the right time to minimize the risk of pest
    infestation that could affect production and reduce environmental impact through
    the correct use of pesticides. This manuscript is organized into the following
    two major sections. The section “Materials and methods”, which includes information
    about the study area, the IoT platform, the irrigation model and the irrigation
    strategies–olive fruit fly alarm rules. The section “Implementation and discussion”,
    which includes information about the device implementation (IoT-based monitoring
    system), the user interface-scheduled alarms for irrigation/pest control and benefits
    of the proposed system as well as steps for further improvements. 2. Materials
    and Methods 2.1. Study Area In this study, an IoT platform system supporting optimal
    irrigation and decision-making approaches in olive growing regions was developed
    in two nearby pilot areas at the eastern part of the Island of Crete, as part
    of the AgriCapture CO2 HORIZON project. The first area is located on the coastal
    side and the other on the inland side (Figure 1). In general, in the study areas,
    more than 82% of the total water used is consumed for irrigation purposes, while
    over 92% of the total water supply comes from groundwater [26]. Considering that
    the agricultural sector is the primary consumer of water in Crete and the study
    areas face the most acute issues with water availability and saltwater intrusion,
    developing an easy-to-use and low-cost smart irrigation and decision-making system
    for ensuring water-use efficiency is a great task. Figure 1. Spatial distribution
    of the study areas, the soil sensors (S 1–S 8) as well as the meteorological stations
    (M1 and M2). Since olives are the dominant crop in the eastern part of Crete,
    and thus in both studied areas, four experimental drip irrigated olive groves
    were selected for each area to develop the proposed smart irrigation and decision-making
    system (Figure 1). These experimental sites were selected based on different criteria
    such as (a) soil and geomorphological characteristics, (b) climatic conditions,
    (c) water availability, (d) the existence of water salinity due to saltwater intrusion,
    (e) the agricultural practices already applied in the parcels and (f) the small
    size of each experimental parcel (area of about 0.2 ha) to ensure, within the
    same parcel, the lowest possible variability of the soil or/and geomorphology
    characteristics. The aim of this selection was to capture the typical range of
    olive grove characteristics in eastern Crete, including the heterogeneity of climate,
    soil, topography and cropping systems. In January 2021 a sampling campaign took
    place at the 8 studied parcels. The soil samples were collected from a representative
    olive grove soil depth of 20–40 cm and analyzed in the laboratory. Table 1 describes
    the main soil properties as well as the climatological/geomorphological conditions
    of the 8 experimental parcels. Table 1. The main soil properties and climatological/geomorphological
    conditions of the 8 experimental parcels. Based on this table, 4 out of the 8
    experimental parcels are classified in the medium texture class, 2 are classified
    in the medium–fine soil texture class, and the remaining 2 experimental parcels
    are classified in the coarse texture class. Additionally, values of organic matter,
    bulk density, rocks, and Ca+2 percentages as well as values of pH are noted in
    Table 1. In the coastal area the soil is alkaline with a higher percentage of
    carbonates. Regarding the inland studied area, the majority of the soil is considered
    light alkaline with a minimal presence of carbonates. Also noted on Table 1, the
    percentage of rocks at the experimental parcels has an extensive range between
    3.31 and 32.52%. All these values correspond to the typical values of soil where
    the eastern Cretan olive groves are located [4]. Considering the climate conditions,
    one weather station was installed in each area covering and monitoring all the
    different climatological conditions between the coastal and inland sites (Figure
    1). Generally, the olive parcels located in both areas are characterized by mild
    winters and dry summers with mean daily temperatures around 19.4 °C for the coastal
    area and 18.1 °C for the inland area, while the mean annual precipitation is around
    435.6 in the coastal area and 680.2 mm in the inland area (Table 1). Additionally,
    of high importance is that the parcels (A, B, C and D) located on the coastal
    studied area face the problem of saline water as an effect of seawater intrusion
    in the coastal aquifers, which leads to the decrease in the available freshwater
    storage volume and the simultaneous pollution of extracted irrigation wells. Table
    1 depicts the levels of ECw in the irrigation water. Thus, in these sites a proper
    saltwater irrigation management plan based on soil electrical conductivity monitoring
    levels is also proposed within the context of the developed IoT platform. For
    all the studied parcels “traditional” cultivation practices are used as a common
    production system in eastern Crete. Specifically, in all the selected farms (Figure
    1), regenerative agriculture practices such as no-tillage, suitable pruning, proper
    weed management (weed mowing) and appropriate plant protection are applied. In
    all parcels, the olive trees were of the same variety (the dominant variety in
    Crete, named Koroneiki) and about 40 years old. The same drip irrigation system
    was applied in all olive groves using local irrigation networks supplied from
    groundwater sources. The dripper flow was 8 L per hour while drip spacing was
    1 m. For all the studied parcels, one irrigation line was placed per tree row.
    The irrigation line is located about 75 cm from the tree row. Additionally, soil
    sensors, one per parcel (Sensor node 1 to 8, Table 1), were strategically installed
    between drippers and one meter away from the trunk of a representative olive tree
    of the studied parcel for capturing the dynamics of soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity and soil temperature within the parcel. 2.2. IoT platform 2.2.1.
    General Architecture The system architecture is divided into three layers that
    are independent of each other (Figure 2). The layers are interconnected through
    the Internet or local area network and interface with each other through a set
    of APIs. An essential component of the platform is the Mosquitto broker, which
    is responsible for connecting the different services through messaging. The Node-RED
    programming tool was used to connect online services. Figure 2. Platform Architecture.
    2.2.2. Layer 1 (IoT Devices) The first level consisted of energy-efficient smart
    devices to which sensors were connected for soil measurement as well as weather
    stations for obtaining climate parameters. The smart devices were installed at
    scattered locations in the plots and communicated with layer 2 through the global
    system for mobile (GSM). To measure the different agronomic parameters affecting
    irrigation, the SDI-12 (Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud) protocol was used
    [27]. It is also possible to connect other types of sensors that support different
    protocols such as I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
    as well as analog sensors. A weather station (Davis Weather Station, Wireless
    Vantage Pro2™—Davis Instruments Corporation, 3465 Diablo Ave, Hayward, CA 94545,
    USA) was installed in each study area. The exact location for the installation
    of WS was selected based on proximity to the study area and Internet access availability.
    Data from the stations is sent to a host computer using FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
    The smart devices were programmed using the Arduino IDE development environment.
    The main component of each device is an ESP32 microcontroller board which is responsible
    for receiving data from the sensors at regular intervals and sending them to layer
    2 via mobile telephony. More specifically, each device consists of: An ESP32-based
    development board (DEVKIT V1). Four parallel connected 2600 mAh, 3.7 V, rechargeable
    18,650 lithium-ion batteries, which are charged by a 3.5 Watt/6 V solar panel.
    A charging module with step up boost converter (3.7 V/9 V/5 V—2 A) controls the
    battery charge and supplies the microcontroller and SDI sensor with 5 V/2 A power.
    A power switch using a logic level Mosfet for cutting off the power supply to
    the SDI-12 sensor during the sleep period. A voltage divider for measuring the
    battery level by ESP32. A SIM800L GPRS module equipped with a sim card (1nce IoT)
    which is controlled by the microcontroller unit and supplied with power from 3.7
    V lithium batteries. This module establishes communication with the mobile network
    by means of a GSM/GPRS protocol, sending the data to layer 2. A 171 × 121 × 55
    mm project box (G313MF, GAINTA). The wiring of the boards is shown in the diagram
    below (Figure 3). Figure 3. Device Schematic. 2.2.3. Layer 2 (IoT Backend) Information
    from the sensors connected to the devices is periodically sent to the Eclipse
    Mosquitto message broker that implements the MQTT protocol, establishing a TCP
    communication through the GSM/GPRS module. Files with data from the Davis weather
    stations are sent periodically to an FTP server using an Internet connection available
    near the location of the stations and are finally stored in a relational database
    using a periodically executed shell script. Data from the sensor node and weather
    stations are transferred to the Things Board IoT platform using the Node-RED programming
    tool. The Things Board community edition IoT platform uses the PostgreSQL database
    for storing data (Figure 2, Layer 2). The components of the backend include a
    virtual machine which is running the following open-source software: Ubuntu server
    (a version of the Ubuntu operating system designed and engineered to run on servers);
    MySQL relational database system; Eclipse Mosquitto™ MQTT broker; Node-RED, a
    visual programming tool that allows you to connect different web services and
    devices; Things Board community edition, an open-source IoT platform for data
    collection, processing, visualization and device management. 2.2.4. Layer 3 (Things
    Board frontend) The last level includes web design and development technologies
    (Dashboards) that allow the user to interact with the backend. The Things Board
    frontend consists of a user interface that displays information and facilitates
    interaction between the user and the platform. The frontend is structured in customers,
    assets, devices and dashboards. Each customer can own one or more assets, devices
    and dashboards. There are different entities for districts, olive plots (parcels)
    and devices which can be private or public depending on their data use (Figure
    4). Each customer (farmer) can have one or more parcels in the same or different
    areas. Meteorological data are collected based on the corresponding weather station
    located in each studied area (coastal and inland region). For each parcel entity
    there is information on agronomic factors such as soil type, plant density, area,
    tree age and irrigation system. Farm owners (customers in the platform) can manage
    the entities they have created and add or delete other users who will have access
    to the same entities. Figure 4. Structure of entities. In order to visualize the
    data from the devices, different dashboards have been created for each parcel
    with olive trees, which are visible to the farmer who owns the parcel. 2.3. Irrigation
    Model Irrigation needs per tree of each parcel were determined based on the meteorological
    data (recorded by the nearby weather station) using the Penman equation (FAO56
    version). In addition, as a parallel and more accurate process, the soil moisture
    data were used to confirm or reduce/postpone the need for the applied irrigation
    dose per tree proposed by the Penman equation. Specifically, the irrigation model
    is responsible for calculating the weekly amount of water that olive trees need
    to reach the desired soil moisture level. It can be used for any irrigation method,
    but in this case, it concerns drip irrigation as it is the dominant irrigation
    method for the specific areas. Specifically, each node (soil sensor) every week
    automatically calculates the amount of water needed to reach the desired soil
    moisture level for the corresponding studied parcel, in turn the system sends
    a mail alarm notification to the farmer to irrigate. A schematical representation
    of the different components of the incorporated IoT platform irrigation model
    is depicted in Figure 5. Figure 5. A flow chart of the incorporated irrigation
    model. To effectively incorporate soil moisture data into the proposed irrigation
    model, the estimation of the van Genuchten water retention curve is a task of
    high importance. A common addressed scientific practice to predict soil hydraulic
    parameters (unsaturated soils) is the use of the Rosetta pedotransfer model. This
    model allows the estimation of van Genuchten water retention parameters using
    limited input data such as the soil texture [28]. Nevertheless, for more robust
    and accurate results, it is highly suggested to measure and test all the hydraulic
    soil parameters through laboratory analysis [29]. Thus, using the soil hydraulic
    parameters calculated by Rosetta or by laboratory analysis, the van Genuchten
    equation can be used to determine the soil water retention curve [30,31]: 𝜃(ℎ)=
    𝜃 𝑟 + 𝜃 𝑠 − 𝜃 𝑟 [1+ (𝛼ℎ) 𝑛 ] (𝑚) where θ(h) is the soil water content (L3L−3)
    at a matric potential h, θs is the saturated water content (L3L−3), θr is the
    residual water content (L3L−3), α is related to the inverse of the air entry suction
    (L−1) and m and n are empirical parameters determining the shape of the soil water
    retention curve where m = 1 − 1/n. In turn, with the calculated water retention
    curve, the total available soil water (TAW) can be assessed as the difference
    between the volumetric soil water content of filed capacity (FC) and permanent
    wilting point (PWP) multiplied by the effective root depth. The FC and the PWP
    were estimated according to the Saxton equation [32]. Moreover, another important
    term is the fraction of TAW that a crop can extract from the root zone without
    suffering water stress, named as readily available soil water (RAW). Considering
    that irrigated olive trees have a relatively shallow root system, it is essential
    to apply water at the effective root zone, reducing the deep percolation. Depending
    on the soil type, the olive grove’s effective root zone is usually up to 30 cm
    in soil depth [33]. At that depth, there is a minimum threshold of critical matric
    potential, the lower limit of the readily available water (RAWLLim), which needs
    to be maintained. The typical threshold for olive trees ranges from—30 to −100
    kpa depending on the phenological stage [34,35]. Another benefit of the proposed
    irrigation model is that it issues differentiated recommendations for saline water
    irrigation. For olive cultivation, irrigation water is considered to be of low
    quality when the ECw is greater than 3 dS/m. The main negative effects of irrigation
    with saline water are (a) clogging of drippers, (b) making the soil water osmotic
    potential more negative so that the roots cannot absorb water efficiently, (c)
    causing root and plant toxicity, as well as (d) destruction of the soil structure
    (reduction of soil water holding capacity). In cases when there is not enough
    rainfall during consecutive years, salts will gradually accumulate from year to
    year leading to the destruction of soil texture and desertification [36,37,38].
    According to [39] the olive yield is reduced by about 10% when the electrical
    conductivity of the soil saturation extract (ECe) ranges from 4 to6 dS/m. The
    authors of [40] proposed a mathematical approach which correlates the ECe and
    the soil electrical conductivity (ECa) with various soil properties. Thus, based
    on this approach, the ECe threshold of 4–6 dS/m for olive trees was converted
    to the corresponding threshold values of ECa in our study parcels. These ECa values
    were estimated to be within 5–7 dS/m. Considering the above, when the ECa, at
    a soil depth of 30 cm, is greater than 5 dS/m, the proposed IoT system recommends
    the use of irrigation water only at critical stages of olive growing. Thus, 1–2
    irrigations are recommended before and after flowering—during spring (the irrigation
    water quality is usually better)—so that flowering, fruit set and shoot growth
    are promoted. In addition, drip irrigation is recommended to be applied at less
    frequent intervals using a higher dosage of water each time, so that salts from
    the previous irrigation events are removed to the boundaries of the wetted soil
    and consequently the main volume of water in the soil remains close to the ECw
    values [41,42]. 2.4. Irrigation Strategies and Olive Fruit Fly Alarm Rules Based
    on the proposed system and in cases of dry periods or low water availability,
    a deficit irrigation strategy could be applied (irrigation only at critical periods
    of plant growth). Thus, the crucial parameters that are incorporated for determining
    the amount of irrigation for each parcel and defining the proper irrigation strategy
    are the climatic conditions, the soil parameters/soil moisture dynamics as well
    as crop parameters, phenological stages and the water availability for each parcel.
    In addition, the system may send notifications to users when weather conditions
    favor the development of an increased population of the olive fruit fly (Bactrocera
    oleae), a key pest for olive groves of Crete. Alerts are triggered based on data
    from weather stations. The model followed trigger alerts when daytime air temperature
    was between 15 °C and 26 °C and air relative humidity was > 65% for three consecutive
    days. Alerts were deactivated when, even for one day, the air temperature during
    the daytime increased above 32 °C with a simultaneous drop in air relative humidity
    below 65% [43,44]. 3. Implementation and Discussion 3.1. Device Implementation
    (IoT-Based Monitoring System) The prototype service described in the previous
    sections was deployed in eight plots in two regions. Specifically, during 2021
    and 2022, the proposed IoT-based monitoring system for obtaining soil moisture
    and meteorological data useful in irrigation management was developed. The system
    includes the monitoring of soil moisture and atmospheric sensors, with the aim
    of providing information to farmers for decision-making. The climate conditions
    of the two studied areas were obtained by two weather stations (M1 and M2); one
    located in each area. These stations could adequately capture the meteorological
    conditions in the study areas. Both provided the IoT platform with real-time meteorological
    parameters (rainfall, max-min-average temperature, solar radiation, wind speed
    and direction, air humidity, and ET, with a time interval of 10 min), informing
    and supporting an effective irrigation schedule and pest control warning system
    for the farmers ensuring water saving as well as olive productivity. A node with
    a smart soil sensor was installed in each plot of olive trees to take measurements
    of soil moisture, electrical conductivity and temperature in real time placed
    at a soil depth of 30 cm. Maintaining water content in the soil at a constant
    level indicates that irrigation is applied at the rate of water intake from the
    crop. As mentioned above, experiments have found that a representative depth to
    monitor soil moisture for mature olive trees is at 30 cm [26]. Thus, the soil
    moisture sensors were installed at 30 cm soil depth for each irrigated olive grove.
    In the literature there are studies that propose the installation of soil moisture
    sensors at more than one soil depth. This approach has some pros (such as better
    monitoring of the soil profile) but also several cons, such as cost, risks of
    damage during fieldwork, the practical management and the inherent complexity
    of integrating data from different soil depths into a final and clear suggestion/decision
    for the user [26,45]. Additionally, for some crops such as olives, which have
    a relatively shallow root system and the effective root zone is usually up to
    30 cm soil depth, the selection of a representative soil depth for monitoring
    purposes could be considered sufficient [30]. It should be noted that the functionality
    of soil moisture data loggers in the field have already been validated and customised
    to the farmer’s needs. Detailed information about the sensor types, main characteristics
    (Table 2) and the coordinates of the sensors installed as well as photographic
    material are given below. Table 2. Main characteristics of TEROS 12 digital sensor.
    The TEROS 12 sensor by METER Group, Inc. USA, determines volumetric water content
    (VWC) using capacitance/frequency-domain technology. The sensor uses a 70 MHz
    frequency, which minimizes textural and salinity effects, making the TEROS 12
    accurate in most mineral soils. Additionally, it includes a thermistor in the
    center needle to measure temperature and electrical conductivity using a stainless-steel
    electrode array [46]. The coordinates of the sensors installed in the olive groves
    are as follows: Node1 (Sensor 1)  teros12  35°17′31.0″ N 25°30′18.9″ E Node2 (Sensor

    8)  teros12  35°14′15.1″ N 25°37′30.8″ E Data were collected, transferred and
    analyzed based on the following steps: First, data acquisition was conducted through
    smart sensors connected to a microcontroller. In turn, signals were transmitted
    over the mobile network using the MQTT protocol. Data were received at a portal
    and made available on the cloud where they could be monitored in real-time through
    an open-source IoT platform. Analyzing the data through the irrigation model,
    an e-mail notification could also be sent to the farmer when soil moisture was
    lower than a threshold value specific to the soil type. The platform informed
    the farmers of the volume of irrigation water requirements of their crops in order
    to restore soil moisture to a predefined optimal level. Corresponding information
    was also provided when the weather conditions were favorable for an outbreak (significant
    increase) of olive fruit fly population. Farmers could access the online platform
    through relevant apps for the PC, or android smart phone. During the non-irrigation
    period, the data were received from the sensors every 6 h (conserving energy used
    by the system), while during the irrigation period the data were received every
    2 h. Figure 6 depicts the installation of the node with smart soil sensors. Figure
    6. Installation of the soil moisture sensors as well as the IoT enabled device
    in the field. The reliability of the IoT-based monitoring system has been tested
    throughout the full operational use of it, during both the winter period (2021–2022)
    as well as during the irrigation season of 2022 (April to October). The IoT-based
    monitoring system integrates real-time soil moisture data from the soil sensors,
    and meteorological stations could be used as a support service tool offering an
    efficient irrigation and pest control service. 3.2. User Interface and Scheduled
    Alarms for Irrigation and Pest Control The user in the environment of this system
    can see the network of sensors located on specific farms and in turn can select
    a specific sensor/node, and they can see the plots straight away as depicted in
    Figure 7. Specifically, the owners of each farm have access to a number of dashboards
    corresponding to the farm’s plots as well as a public dashboard where the data,
    from the weather station of the area in which the farm is located, are displayed.
    Additionally, at the same dashboard, plant protection alarms based on the data
    from the weather stations are available. Analytically, the dashboards corresponding
    to the olive plots of the farm show data from the node located in the specific
    plot and include: Figure 7. The public dashboard depicts soil moisture (VWC),
    electrical conductivity (ECa), soil temperature (°C) and irrigation needs/alarms
    (upper part). On the lower part of this figure, the basic weather data, as well
    as olive fruit fly alarms are displayed. The latest telemetry for soil volumetric
    water content, electrical conductivity and temperature; Historical elements of
    the data from the node located in the specific plot; The characteristics of the
    plot (soil type, irrigation system, area, tree density and tree age); The boundaries
    of the plot on a map with a satellite background; A table with the irrigation
    alarms; The lowest soil moisture threshold value with the option to be modified
    by the user; The recommended amount of irrigation water per tree at a given moment.
    Summarizing the above information, in the case where soil moisture is below specific
    thresholds, an alarm message is sent to the farmer to inform them about the need
    of irrigation and the specific dosage that could be applied per tree. Additionally,
    the farmers have a full monitoring view of the climate conditions of their farm
    and based on this, in cases of favorable climate conditions for the olive fruit
    fly, an alarm message is also sent to inform the farmer that they should take
    action. Of course, for all of these instances, the farmer can fully control the
    needs of their parcels through their smart phone (Figure 8). Figure 8. IoT-based
    platform screenshot from mobile phone. 3.3. Benefits of the Proposed System—Steps
    for Further Improvements Considering that Mediterranean islands such as Crete
    include significant rural and touristic areas, water strategy approaches based
    on smart technological tools may ensure the balanced development between cultivated
    and touristic activities, especially on islands suffering from water shortage.
    The proposed easy-to-use IoT system can offer farmers and local authorities the
    ability to support proper irrigation and pest control management at the parcel
    scale. It is also of high importance to note that the proposed system is a low-cost
    IoT solution as it is based on an open-source software and the hardware on edge
    devices consists of widespread economical modules. The recommendations for farmers
    proposed by this system can contribute to achieving increased water-use efficiency.
    Based on the soil properties data and the climatic data of a parcel/region, the
    IoT platform could assist the user to identify the appropriate irrigation dose.
    The achievements of this IoT system can be summarized to the following points:
    (a) the reduction of irrigation water losses by implementing modern and accurate
    irrigation techniques, both for areas with high concentrations of salts in irrigation
    water and for non-saltwater affected areas; (b) the optimization of irrigation
    based on soil properties, crop type, phenological stage as well as climatic conditions;
    (c) the recommendation of a deficit irrigation strategy which can enhance irrigation
    efficiency, especially in areas with limited water availability, giving water
    only during drought-sensitive crop stages; and (d) supporting alarms for pest
    control using climate parameters, an extra useful service to the farmers, ensuring
    their crop productivity. These decision-making alarms are of high importance considering
    the more frequent insect outbreaks as an effect of changing weather conditions,
    especially in Mediterranean agro-ecosystems. To ensure the functionality and trustworthiness
    of the proposed IoT system, the eight selected parcels in eastern Crete capture
    a wide range of olive, Mediterranean agro-ecosystems including the heterogeneity
    of climatic, soil, topography and cropping systems. Moreover, for each studied
    parcel the recommended weekly irrigation dose as well as the alarms for pest control
    were compared with the corresponding, manually calculated irrigation values (obtained
    by the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith equation) and fruit fly alarms (obtained by the
    rules of favoring weather conditions), respectively. The above comparison was
    accomplished during the irrigation period of 2022. These comparisons indicate
    that the irrigation dose as well as the alarms for pest control proposed by the
    IoT system and the manual approaches for all the studied parcels was entirely
    the same. The above confirms the reliability of the outputs recommended by the
    IoT system. The limitations of the proposed IoT system as well as actions for
    further improvements can be considered in the following points. So far, preliminary
    user testing has been complemented by the team of the project as well as a few
    farmers that had practical familiarity with the proposed IoT system during project
    dissemination actions. The feedback concerning the usability of the system that
    was obtained by these actions was fairly satisfactory. Nevertheless, for further
    improvement of user interaction and platform usability, a systematic user test
    should be conducted. In addition, as future steps, the proposed decision-making
    IoT system must expand its application to additional cropping systems including
    (a) more crop types of the island (for local use), or even crops from other Mediterranean
    countries, (b) different irrigation methods and agricultural practices, (c) different
    soil types, as well as (d) different climate zones and modelling for more pest/disease
    outbreaks. Finally, it should be noted that during the following irrigation period
    another capability of this monitoring IoT system to automatically regulate irrigation
    (by controlling electric valves of the irrigation system) based on soil moisture
    levels will be tested and incorporated; a fact that can further improve the efficiency
    of irrigation and save time and effort for the farmer. 4. Conclusions The Mediterranean
    is considered a climate change hotspot. Many Mediterranean areas face or will
    face the heat of climate change more than other places in Europe, with the largest
    increase in temperature and reduction in rainfall. Mediterranean agriculture,
    including olive cultivation, has to adapt to new challenges that affect local
    water, energy and ecosystems. On the island of Crete in Greece, agriculture is
    already the largest user of water. The aim of this paper is to propose an advanced
    and easy-to-use technological system as an extra component of an already applied
    regenerative agriculture approach to cultivating olives, protecting production
    and ensuring efficient use of water. Specifically, this paper introduces a low-cost
    IoT monitoring system that has been tested in all the different olive cultivation
    characteristics in the extended area of eastern Crete for proper irrigation and
    pest control management at parcel scale. The proposed system provides useful information
    in areas that face issues with water availability, saltwater intrusion and pest
    infestation. The Implementation of the IoT-based monitoring system took place
    at eight parcels in the eastern part of Crete, where, through the proposed system,
    smart irrigation and pest control alert approaches for every parcel were offered
    to the farmers. The proposed system includes state-of-the-art technologies incorporating
    soil and atmospheric monitoring sensors and microcontrollers for transmitting
    information using the MQTT protocol. Data are received at a portal and made accessible
    on the cloud where they can be observed in real-time over an open-source IoT system
    offering the farmers services concerning proper irrigation and pest control. The
    advanced open access decision-making system implemented in olive parcels offers
    users the capability: (a) to know the weekly irrigation dose per tree at the studied
    parcel, (b) to know the proper irrigation needs in case of applied saline irrigation,
    (c) to suggest deficit irrigation in areas with low water availability as an adaptation
    strategy measure to climate change, (d) to send alarm messages to the farmers
    concerning the danger of pest infestation aiming at protecting production, and
    (e) to install an affordable field monitoring system as it is based on an open-source
    software and the hardware consists of widespread economic modules. The above capabilities
    offered by the proposed easy-to-use IoT system can increase farmers’ and policy
    makers’ awareness of optimal irrigation and pest control management issues critical
    to crop sustainability. Author Contributions Conceptualization, N.N.K.; methodology,

  description: Every aspect of the 21st century has undergone a revolution because
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart computing technologies. These technologies
    are applied in many different ways, from monitoring the state of crops and the
    moisture level of the soil in real-time to using drones to help with chores such
    as spraying pesticides. The extensive integration of both recent IT and conventional
    agriculture has brought in the phase of agriculture 4.0, often known as smart
    agriculture. Agriculture intelligence and automation are addressed by smart agriculture.
    However, with the advancement of agriculture brought about by recent digital technology,
    information security challenges cannot be overlooked. The article begins by providing
    an overview of the development of agriculture 4.0 with pros and cons. This study
    focused on layered architectural design, identified security issues, and presented
    security demands and upcoming prospects. In addition to that, we propose a security
    architectural framework for agriculture 4.0 that combines blockchain technology,
    fog computing, and software-defined networking. The suggested framework combines
    Ethereum blockchain and software-defined networking technologies on an open-source
    IoT platform. It is then tested with three different cases under a DDoS attack.
    The results of the performance analysis show that overall, the proposed security
    framework has performed well.

    Farming is the main source of food and contributes significantly to the economy.
    According to the FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations),
    by 2050, the demand for producing food must be increased by 70% to satisfy the
    world’s demand. In recent studies, 550 million people of the world’s population
    are in nutrition deficiencies; every day, around 820 million people are still
    not obtaining food. The study says that the world’s population will increase to
    more than two billion, and most of the population will live in cities. It has
    also been observed that the population in India and Nigeria will increase to around
    482 million between 2019 and 2050 [1]. The biggest challenging situation arises
    with this population growth to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
    of zero hunger [2]. These projections for the near future have an impact on overall
    food demand. Because of the scarcity of water today, it is difficult to meet only
    40% of the water supply by 2030, and the unavailability of farming land will lead
    to a reduction in the food supply. As a result, the agriculture sector needs sufficient
    resources than are presently available, as well as more self-sustaining systems
    to boost cultivation percentages while reducing environmental resource use [3].
    Though it might be appropriate to reach rising demand, it is unclear how to do
    so in an equitable and resilient manner. Again, there is a vital need to accelerate
    and scale up the agricultural production transformation [4]. Agriculture 4.0 can
    provide a way to increase agricultural efficiency with the available crop area.
    It also optimizes irrigation to use limited water and energy and allocate resources
    to protect crops effectively. Those would be possible through the integration
    of environmental monitoring, forecasting, and smart devices [5]. Smart farming’s
    new technologies can enhance agricultural mechanisms, allowing cultivation to
    increase while using natural resources efficiently. Agricultural sector innovations
    are referred to as the ‘‘digital agricultural revolution”, which turns most factors
    of agriculture, ensuing in more effective, efficient, self-sustaining, integrated,
    truthful, and self-reliant agriculture. Cellular devices, sensors, data analysis,
    fog computing, information security, and intelligent systems influence how technologies
    are integrated into the agricultural sector [6]. Nowadays, agriculture is changing
    quickly as it enters a new age known as Agriculture 4.0. Agriculture 4.0 seeks
    to employ new technology and approaches to address the issues facing modern agriculture
    (such as climatic alteration, illnesses, extreme application of resources, etc.)
    and to lower risks while enhancing production efficiency and safety [7]. To do
    this, it makes extensive use of cutting-edge ICTs. In addition to this evolution,
    there is a rising trend in food needs. Given the continual evolution and the rising
    need for food, it is anticipated that the market for agriculture 4.0 will expand
    greatly in the years to come. Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) and Internet of
    Things (IoT) technologies are widely utilized in Agriculture 4.0 and provide farmers
    with a number of advantages, including observing numerous environmental factors
    connected to crops, spotting crop illnesses, predicting yield, and lowering labor
    costs [8]. However, the Sensor and network connectivity and communications in
    farming might act as a base factor for many types of attacks since these devices
    frequently have obsolete or unpatched firmware or software [9]. Security is a
    top priority in agriculture, and any interruption or distortion may present difficult
    problems and have disastrous outcomes. Monitoring and categorization of network
    traffic, which have attracted a lot of attention since the earliest beginnings
    of the Internet, can be crucial to preventing network assaults [10]. Scientific
    research on network traffic categorization for IoT system security has been extensive.
    It is an essential part of intrusion detection systems (IDS) and aids in the identification
    and detection of harmful network activity. This revolution in agricultural technology
    is built on having access to all the data produced by every sensor used on a farm,
    centralized via the internet, and analyzed for the best possible decision-making
    [11]. Any sensor employed generates a significant amount of data that can be extensively
    examined and provides useful information to enhance crop quality or lessen environmental
    impact. Cloud computing, physical hardware, and the IoT are the three key components
    that enable the automation and data sharing needed by this new smart agriculture
    [12]. With the help of technical improvements (drones, sensors, software, etc.),
    we can complete agricultural jobs faster and more effectively than humans. Agriculture
    4.0 must make sure that an appropriate security mechanism is implemented to avert
    an attack to build scalable and secure systems. The integrity of data is important
    for the effective functioning of information technological advances such as data
    analysis and intelligent devices [13]. Because agriculture 4.0 incorporates elements
    from conventional Internet, cellular, and wireless technologies, which may include
    all of the security risks that advancements present situation. It also addresses
    current security risks such as data and device integrity, consistency, and accessibility.
    Devices in agriculture 4.0 are implemented in outdoor spaces where they are subjected
    to external factors such as animals, human beings, or farming equipment. Unknowingly,
    these factors remove or damage sensors. Since the 6th century B.C., there has
    been a threat known as Agro terrorism [5]. This type of terrorism could have a
    variety of goals, including causing financial harm, fear, and social unrest [6,7].
    Terrorists could incite community disturbance and lack of credibility in administration
    by exploiting agricultural and food corporate crises, which can lead to undivided
    attention in the world. Cyber-agro-terrorism in agriculture 4.0 is an electronic
    system in agricultural settings to harm crops and animals while causing economic
    loss. Cyber-agro-terrorists can operate attacks on fields and through the internet,
    using cyber resources [8]. 2. Overview of Agriculture 4.0 Agriculture has gone
    through many revolutionary movements, all of which have increased the agriculture
    industry’s performance and effectiveness. Plant cultivation “in 10,000 BC” resulted
    in the birth of the world’s first societies and civilizations. Machines were used
    in the farming sector to execute work, which increased production from 1900 to
    1930. Farmers were able to use newly discovered crops and agrochemicals during
    the Green Revolution (from around the 1960s). Biotechnology facilitated the production
    of plants with previously selected attributes, with increased yield and pest resistance,
    desertification, and herbicide, from 1990 to 2000. Now, in the 21st century, digitalization
    has the potential to help humanity survive and flourish for a long time [4]. The
    world’s largest industry, agriculture, contributes significantly to both social
    stability and economic growth [13]. A growing number of studies on smart agriculture
    are driven by the task of resolving the conflict between the population increase
    and the constrained food output. The advancement of science and technology fuels
    the revolution in agriculture, which is based on both the rise in output and the
    limitations of the time [14]. Figure 1 is used to explain the features of agriculture
    development to readers (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture 4.0). Figure 1. The
    uprising of Agriculture 1.0 to agriculture 4.0. Figure 1 is used to explain the
    features of agriculture development to readers (from Agriculture 1.0 to Agriculture
    4.0). Agriculture 1.0: During the conventional agricultural age (1784–1870), which
    was dominated by animal and human resources, the fundamental problem with agriculture
    was its lack of operational efficiency. Agriculture 2.0: During the automated
    agricultural period of the 20th century, resource waste was the major problem.
    Agriculture 3.0: During the period of rapid advancement of automated agriculture
    (1992–2017), the key problem was the lack of intelligence. Agriculture 4.0: the
    age of smart agriculture (which began in 2017 and is defined by unmanned operations)
    is primarily characterized by the application of contemporary information technology
    to both support and intelligently improve agriculture. The term “smart agriculture”
    [15] refers to a new approach to agriculture that personalized service through
    the integration of contemporary information technologies such as the internet,
    big data, IoT, and many more [16]. In a nutshell, the new mode is an intelligent
    agricultural solution that fuses current information technology with agriculture.
    Although recent information technology opens up new possibilities for the progress
    of agricultural output, it also places heavy demands on security and privacy in
    the context of smart agriculture and poses significant obstacles therein [17].
    More than a movement, agriculture 4.0 represents the next development in the sector’s
    transition to a more intelligent, effective, and environmentally responsible one.
    The supply chain’s daily operations produce a tremendous amount of data [18].
    Most of the time, this information went unused, but thanks to big data and new
    technology, it can now be used to boost any crop’s performance and productivity.
    2.1. Advantages of Agriculture 4.0 The effects of smart agriculture are covered
    in the following sections. Production volume: The use of smart technology in agriculture
    can significantly boost the number of products produced on the farm. This will
    contribute to feeding a growing population. Production quality: The wellness and
    nutrition of people from all socioeconomic strata in the nation can be significantly
    impacted by the quality of food produced. A country’s population will live longer
    and in better health with better food, which will improve its citizens’ economic
    contribution. Effectiveness of farming practices and resource use: The application
    of smart technologies to conventional agricultural operations can increase their
    effectiveness. In turn, this encourages more efficient use of agricultural resources.
    Ideal cost of cultivation: It is achieved when there is a balance between quantity,
    quality, and efficiency in the procedures used. This results in a higher price
    for the agricultural output that is produced. Reducing wastage: The farming industry,
    one of the main economic sectors, is in great part to blame for the massive quantities
    of food and other secondary resources that are wasted. Smart technology could
    be employed to track and cut down on this waste. Ecologically sustainable: The
    reduced agricultural waste and improved agricultural process efficiency directly
    reduce the environmental and ecological footprint. Effective use of Time: Timely
    delivery of the necessary insecticides, fertilizers, and other chemicals can provide
    timely and high-quality agricultural output with fewer losses thanks to smart
    agriculture. The farming industry may be at threat by the following while deploying
    agricultural 4.0 technology: Theft of business and customer data. Taking resources
    under the control of sensors and gadgets. Destroying the objects that devices
    control. Damage to reputation if a data breach is disclosed. Agriculture 4.0 may
    be at risk from infrastructure damage, sensor failures may affect poultry and
    cattle breeding, and control system hacks may affect greenhouse farming. All of
    these could cause problems or malfunction in agricultural operations by harming
    the IoT architecture’s hardware and software. In addition, data-collecting technologies
    face challenges from malicious assaults, unauthorized access, privacy breaches,
    and other issues. The landscape has shifted, with AI and ML research concentrating
    on agro-based contexts, water management, livestock, and farmlands. Monitoring,
    control, and decision-making alternatives in the irrigation field repeatedly tried
    to save water and enhance productivity [8,9,10,11,12,13]. Some research concentrated
    on plant leaf disease [14], horticulture [15], vineyards [16], hydroponic [17],
    alert facilities [18], integration of IoT technological innovations [19], tracking
    resources [20], and cloud control [21]. 2.2. IoT in Agriculture 4.0 Table 1 lists
    several well-known uses of IoT integration and utilization in agriculture. Table
    1. Use of IoT in agriculture and corresponding studies. Intelligent soil cultivation
    system: This system would plow, weed, prepare the seedbed, and sow the field soil
    in order to prepare it for harvest. Efficient irrigation mechanisms: This technology
    would automate the controlled artificial supply of water needed for plant growth.
    Smart fertilizer systems: These automate the application of fertilizer to a field
    while allowing for precise control over the kind, amount, and timing of fertilizer.
    Intelligent pest detection and treatment systems: These systems keep an eye out
    for pest infestations, analyze agricultural damage, and incorporate methods to
    manage the infestation. Intelligent livestock agriculture: This involves employing
    cutting-edge technologies to breed animals and uses precision agriculture to enhance
    the quantity and quality of the produce. Smart harvesting system: This system
    harvests a field effectively by using IoT-based methods. Smart farm management
    system: This kind of technology would aim to offer analytics on data to increase
    field productivity and yield. Intelligent groundwater quality management system:
    The final product is greatly influenced by the quantity and quality of the groundwater.
    As a result, this system uses IoT approaches to maintain appropriate groundwater
    levels. Though there are many smart agriculture alternatives, they are still underdeveloped
    and offer a low degree of intellect. Many initiatives are limited in their automated
    systems, with the internet of things sending data to the base station [53]. There
    is also no implementation with the Internet in several cases, except that in a
    few cases, data is stored in the cloud by the local systems. The multi-layer architecture
    of IoT used in agriculture 4.0 consists of four layers, which are the physical
    layer, network layer, edge layer, and application layer. Table 2 below gives a
    detailed description of Resources used in the multi-layered architecture of IoT
    in Agriculture 4.0 [54]. Table 2. Resources used in the multi-layered architecture
    of IoT in Agriculture 4.0. The RFID, cameras, actuators, GPS, and all these devices
    are all implemented in the physical layer, which collects data from the farming
    field and digitizes them using an Analog to Digital converter (ADC). As the equipment
    at the physical layer does not compute and store the data, this needs to connect
    with the edge layer through the network layer. The edge layer includes various
    resources such as decision-making, gateway, data filters, data security, and interfaces
    [55]. The advancement of devices and technological developments will allow for
    the incorporation of more computer capabilities into systems. This type of integration
    aims to meet the various needs of agricultural mechanization, farming techniques,
    and sustainable agriculture [56,57]. A further issue is data security. This is
    very important to focus on data privacy, the trustworthiness of data, and the
    correctness of data from generation to decision-making. 2.3. Research Motivation
    Three factors serve as inspiration for this article: Smart agriculture is a new
    paradigm that integrates information technology with conventional farming as a
    result of the low productivity of traditional agriculture and the extensive usage
    of information technology. It has the potential to become the next big thing in
    agricultural development. Consequently, it is crucial to outline the current manufacturing
    model and particular studies [58]. Despite substantial research on smart agriculture,
    less has been conducted in comparison to industrial security solutions to analyze
    security problems. It is crucial to examine the features of security concerns
    in relation to situations involving smart agriculture [59]. This article attempts
    to give a review of the security challenges raised by smart agriculture in light
    of the aforementioned variables, which inevitably results in a significant number
    of open research questions. 2.4. Research Contributions The research contributions
    of the paper are as follows: We go over the advantages of using IoT in the farming
    sector and outline some of the potential uses. We provide a layered approach for
    smart agriculture that can be applied to any precision agriculture application.
    We suggest an agricultural sensor data management system that can gather, analyze,
    visualize, and manage sensing data in real-time. We present a blockchain-based
    authenticity monitoring technique to prevent erroneous control and information
    delivery. To improve network management, we proposed a simulated switch that supports
    SDN technologies. We present experimental results with different case studies
    from an open-source IoT platform integrating Ethereum blockchain and SDN technologies,
    demonstrating the efficacy of the suggested security architecture. 2.5. Paper

    4.0 in Section 2. Section 3 provides important security risks from a multi-layer
    perspective. Section 4 describes the current state of security research in Agriculture
    4.0. Section 5 presents the current scenario of security challenges in Agriculture
    4.0. Section 6 describes the proposed agricultural security framework. The experimental
    setup configuration and architecture along with the experimental results presented
    in Section 7. The use of 5G technology in the scenario of smart agriculture is
    described in Section 8. Finally, Section 8 concludes with future challenges in
    Agriculture 4.0. 2.6. Analytical Distribution of Referred Articles The referenced
    articles are compared in Figure 2 based on the place of publication. The distribution
    of cited articles by publication type is shown in Figure 2. Out of the total number
    of referred papers, 88 are original research articles from reputable journals,
    while 25 are from conferences. Figure 2. Types of Article distribution. The frequency
    of papers discussing the agriculture 4.0 system is depicted in Figure 3. Due to
    our interest in current technologies, we have assessed 20 papers that were published
    in 2018, out of which five articles are based on agricultural security issues.
    In contrast to the 19 research papers on the agriculture sector and security aspects
    from the year 2020 that we have cited, we have cited 18 publications from the
    year 2019. With the papers becoming publicly available from various reputable
    journals for reference, we studied 46 modern technology-based quality papers in
    smart agriculture along with articles on security challenges in 2021 and 2022.
    In order to be updated regarding the current tools and technologies in this era,
    we also referred few articles to be published in 2023. Figure 3. The total number
    of Related Research articles studied on Agriculture 4.0 and security challenges
    in Agriculture 4.0 from 2018 to 2023. 3. Agriculture 4.0 Security Threats in Multi-Layered
    Paradigm There are several security issues in agriculture 4.0, starting from Storing
    data, processing data, and transmitting it through Internet connectivity. Figure
    4 shows security risks in the intelligent agricultural system in a multi-layered
    paradigm. Security issues can be either unintentional or sometimes known. Animals,
    farm laborers, and machine tools can all easily gain access to agricultural environments
    and cause problems [55]. Most of the security threats are very common, but there
    some are unique to others who function in harsh-field environments, such as Intelligent
    Agriculture. Figure 4. Security Risks at the multi-layered paradigm of IoT in
    agriculture 4.0. 3.1. Security Risks at the Physical Layer This is primarily concerned
    with physical equipment such as sensors and actuators. Physical devices can fail
    due to unintentional or intentional human behavior, viruses, spyware, or cyber-attacks.
    Smart farming applications use a wide range of sensors and technologies, and this
    diversity opens up several security risks, including the following: Random device
    incidents: This is the unintended alteration of physical equipment that causes
    it to deviate from its normal performance. The physical equipment may be damaged
    by farm machinery, causing short- or long-term physical damage, as a result, generates
    false data and affects data accessibility. Mobile node hijacking: It is the theft
    of farm equipment such as tractors, drones, and sowing robots. Drones can indeed
    be pesticides, fertilizers sprinkling could be performed by Drone, and robots
    could do weeding detecting disease. The intruder may access and use the farm equipment
    remotely without having access permission. Fake node: An intruder introduces imitation
    or harmful nodes into the automated agriculture field to disturb the smooth functioning
    of the system [55]. This attack could be triggered by capturing a node and making
    a replica of it. This type of attack typically aims to either alter or modify
    data-shuttered devices and applications. Abnormal Measurement: It senses unusual
    observations due to data falsification, energy exhaustion, radio radiation, detection
    of various connections, extreme storms, malfunctions, or wrong inputs. Incorrect
    data can jeopardize making decisions that result in the analysis of data will
    be inaccurate, which minimizes system correctness. Sleeplessness attack: The sleeplessness
    attack sends a series of seemingly legitimate requests in order to keep the devices
    awake for prolonged life. As a result, the device’s battery runs out, and the
    device stops working [56,57]. When the devices are turned off, the observed information
    is not properly sent, jeopardizing decision-making and system efficiency. 3.2.
    Security Risks at Network Layer The objective of this layer is to send the generated
    data by the sensors from the physical layer to the most trustable computational
    unit, which is the cloud. The most common attacks, which affect the resources
    used in the network layer, are focused on [58,59]. The security risks in network
    layers are: Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): It attempts to affect access
    to service providers by overburdening the communication link or manipulating protocol
    flaws, which cause resources, such as CPU and memory collapse [60]. Due to resource
    exhaustion brought on by a DDoS attack, the victim server is forced to block connections
    from new reliable clients. The victim server’s buffer capacity or bandwidth may
    have reached its limit of resources. The overall probability of resource scarcity
    at the target end is provided by Equation (1) [15]. 𝑃 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑘 =1−(1− 𝑃 𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ
    )(1− 𝑃 𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑦 ) (1) where, 𝑃 𝐴𝑡𝑡𝑎𝑐𝑘 : Probability of total attack, 𝑃 𝐵𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑤𝑖𝑑𝑡ℎ
    : Probability of Consumption of bandwidth 𝑃 𝑚𝑒𝑚𝑜𝑟𝑦 : Probability of Consumption
    of memory Attacks on Data Transit: These types of attacks aim to retrieve information
    shared between network devices in order to obtain confidential information [61].
    An adversary could intercept traffic via malicious routers or man-in-the-middle
    attacks [62]. Interception of traffic reveals confidential data such as private
    keys, access credentials, or digital signatures. Attacks on Routers: They plan
    to change network routes in order to gain traffic control. Inimical nodes in IoT
    networks might attempt to reroute communicating paths during the process of transmission.
    As a result of attacks, the receiver might receive information lately, partially,
    or incorrectly, or not at all [63,64]. Malware Injection Attacks: The malware
    injection attack [34], in which malware is injected by an attacker into a connected
    computing device. This is a very common attack on smart farming. Malware is a
    very significant threat in distributed projects because it automatically spreads
    through the system, making it an appealing target for intruders. Malware damage
    comes in multiple varieties of sizes. Malware can steal data about farm material
    usage, buying information for fruits, vegetables, and farm animals, data about
    farm equipment, and so on. It could hire automated devices to form a botnet that
    would be used to commit harmful attacks under the influence of an intruder. Botnet:
    At each architectural layer of the precision farming system, there are numerous
    IoT devices. These machines are vulnerable to attack and could be taken over by
    a centralized malicious system. This results in a ‘Botnet of Things’ (BoT) [35].
    A mutant farm workforce IoT equipment that is already infected [36] is easily
    used to infect other networks via various communication links, and thus automated
    farming could become an internet of destructibility for cyber illegitimates. The
    security features are not added in many of the Precision agriculture devices,
    but still, they are used frequently for establishing adequate data security defensive
    system frameworks. 3.3. Security Risks at Edge Layer The edge contains important
    aspects that monitor, and control modules communicate with all layers and access
    resources. The physical layer’s large volumes of data can be processed locally
    rather than centralized in the cloud. The following are major edge security issues.
    Actuator control Forge: It introduces false measures of data into the system in
    order to manipulate it. Typically, the data is received by the gateway in plain
    text. Corrupted data will lead to poor decision-making. An opponent, for example,
    could inject incorrect soil moisture measurements into a smart irrigation system
    to manipulate it. Booting Attacks: Devices are vulnerable to attacks due to a
    lack of security processes during boot [37]. Memory cards and flash drive sticks,
    for example, may detect dangerous codes which run at startup [38]. Suspicious
    booting practices could launch numerous attacks on the edge with insufficient
    protection. Signature wrapping: The attacker modulates the cipher text by inserting
    a bogus element that allows you to perform a random Web Application requisition
    while identifying as an authenticated user [39]. Measure infusion Forgery: It
    is the injection of wrong specifications into a system in order to modify it.
    An attacker sends known data patterns through actuators to the cloud storage,
    which is then injected into the system through computational units. Corrupted
    data could lead to poor decision-making. Unauthorized access: The process of validating
    is a critical security component. The authentication process is a technology that
    ensures security and privacy, honesty, and accessibility [40]. Several agricultural
    practices, however, use gateways with insufficient or no access controls. Gateway-cloud
    fabrication: The cloud and the gateway are linked by ISPs or wireless connections.
    A network attacker could fabricate cloud requests by interrogating a gateway.
    The attacker could use these requests to change parameters in precision agriculture,
    control queries for sensitive services, or interpret system equipment. The cloud
    can implement security services as it has computational power. In order to ensure
    maximum system reliability, these strategies must be incorporated into the system.
    3.4. Security Risks at Application Layer This layer provides end-user assistance
    and data to process and make system decisions. This layer’s security concerns
    are application-specific, focusing on preventing data theft and ensuring privacy.
    Some of the attacks that might affect cloud services and applications are listed
    below in terms of security. Malicious scripts: Malicious scripts can deceive clients,
    infuse malicious data, access confidential material, and compromise security features.
    This type of attack is frequently carried out by cybercriminals for specific,
    economic, or political reasons. They can damage or destabilize operational processes
    by using malicious scripts, presenting unnecessary ad campaigns, and stealing
    money [41]. Phishing: It is an attack that attempts to obtain highly classified
    personal information, such as an Identity and password, fraudulently. Phishing
    typically targets end-users through fraud and sites [42]. The attacker also affects
    decision-making and internal operations in many cases. The most effective protection
    would be for users to remain vigilant while surfing the web [43]. Denial of Service
    (DoS): This threat disrupts service by overburdening traffic on the network or
    flooding the provider with repeated attempts [44]. Because of flaws in security
    setup, an attacker can launch this attack from the Web or a sub-system. 4. Security
    Threats in Modern Agriculture Farmers typically carry out the developed smart
    system initiatives in physical fields or green fields. In Agriculture 4.0, most
    efforts are focused on water processes, disease monitoring, seed production, and
    record keeping. It can be either automatically controlled or manually controlled.
    In both cases, the system monitors the environment with sensors and changes it
    with actuators. Some initiatives only digitize farms, whereas others incorporate
    industry 4.0 or IoT technologies. As an immature industry, open-field agriculture
    is the focus of this work, with security issues restricted to access control and
    web-encrypted communications. It is too difficult to execute different security
    measures in rural areas since there is a shortage of modern technical infrastructure
    and advanced technology. Many difficulties can arise if security measures are
    attempted in rural agriculture. Table 3 lists a few of the security challenges
    that are prevalent in rural locations. Table 3. Rural-Agriculture Security Issues.
    Recently most of the agriculture 4.0 projects have implemented IoT, but the security
    features in that have become disabled by default. It has been introduced that
    a server controls and manages these devices remotely via a web application. Opportunistic
    opponents did not know details about security resources. They gain unauthorized
    access to the system, insert fabricated measures, fabricate actuator controls,
    or report earlier attacks to divert the system from its normal functioning [45,46,47,48,49,50,51,52,53,54,55,56,57,58,59,60,61,62,63,64].
    The author proposed a smart watering system that remotely controls and observes
    the flow of water in the farm but is not focused on security risks to detect malicious
    attacks and unallowed access that manipulate the monitored data. To monitor the
    growing environment, ref. [65] introduce a Hydroponic Farming Ecosystem (HFE).
    It is automatically controlled, and the client can monitor the farming via a web
    interface. These automated systems require high-security concerns to detect or
    avoid random sensor incidents, weak sensors, wrong data injection, and other attacks,
    which could corrupt data and affect system reliability. Similarly, in [66], the
    author focused on creating a system for monitoring fields based on humidity, soil
    moisture, light levels, and temperature. Irrigation can be controlled manually
    or automatically via web or mobile systems. An intelligent solution for detecting
    diseases in leaves focused in [67]. By using sensor data and camera images, the
    system identifies leaf diseases. A mobile or web application is used by the end-user
    to interact with the system. This paper does not go into detail about the implementation
    of security. Similarly, ref. [68] proposed an intelligent agricultural system
    for information interchange among farm equipment. The article discusses the system’s
    construction but makes no mention of manual intervention or remote control, nor
    does it concern any security challenges. As this is a data exchange system, the
    DoS attack can affect the network layer. Ref. [69] provides NETPIE, a solution
    that gives agricultural product information. The growing environment can be controlled
    and monitored with a set of physical devices. The generated data is analyzed saved
    in a QR code, and which is then available to the customer. NETPIE does not discuss
    security resources. Ref. [51] Introduced monitoring of crop fields and watering
    using IoT, which measures data and controls data to avoid unauthorized access
    to these data but could not protect the other devices, which leads to weak security,
    which might result in a major loss. Ref. [52] Proposed a system known as SEnviro,
    which observes the crop field and detects diseases remotely. This system does
    not focus on the prediction of disease, but unauthorized access is controlled
    here. According to the relevant literature, from a security standpoint, farming
    equipment is used without security features. Furthermore, the gateway contains
    no security information. Transmission privacy or device authentication is not
    presented in any of the above-discussed systems. Access control and management
    and encryption of data need to add security technologies to Information dissemination.
    Smart agriculture is currently a convenient target for cyber criminals’ agents.
    Attacks can be motivated by a variety of factors, including an advertisement,
    intellectual, or even terrorist reasons. Terrorist groups, for example, can cause
    ecological loss to a country, economic chancers may take part in market manipulation,
    and workers can attack a range of factors [53]. 4.1. Data and Device Security
    Issues and Threats in Agriculture 4.0 As was previously mentioned, harsh environmental
    factors that can seriously harm electromechanical equipment, such as extreme heat,
    moisture, moisture, shocks, and other anomalies, have a direct impact on the agricultural
    sector [70]. The majority of these sensors are prone to failure, making it feasible
    for them to produce inaccurate data and instructions that could cause a manufacturing
    disaster [71]. Additionally, sensors and network equipment are predominance reachable.
    This poses a serious risk to farmlands since anybody with bad intentions can access
    them and corrupt or harm them to cause them to malfunction [72]. Another potential
    security concern is the online transfer of the information gathered by IoT sensors
    and other agricultural machines. Major security concern in the agriculture industry
    is security, privacy, and control [73], as farmers may incur a significant financial
    and personal loss in the event of a data breach. Ref. [74] Divides the threats
    to confidentiality into four distinct categories: Intentional data theft through
    smart platforms and applications that do not adhere to security and privacy standards;
    Internal information thefts from a stakeholder in the supply chain intended to
    harm an agri-business or a farmer; Unethical data sales intended to reduce profits
    for farmers or to harm them; and other threats. Unsupervised foreign access to
    private and sensitive information using drones, sensors, and cameras with the
    intention of utilizing them to harm farmers or jeopardize public safety [64,75].
    Every application of modern technology, IoT in agriculture, carries the aforementioned
    dangers, weaknesses, and threats. A more thorough and complex explanation of the
    risks and their sources in aspects of cyberattacks in the agro sector is provided
    in the following paragraph, which is primarily focused on illegal behavior and
    exploited vulnerabilities in ICT systems. 4.2. Cybercrime and Cybersecurity in
    Agriculture A cyber-attack on an agribusiness or food industry is increasingly
    likely today thanks to automation and the widespread use of internet-connected
    equipment, which give potential (cyber) criminals greater chances in fields that
    were previously too remote or difficult to physically access [61]. Consequently,
    a potential cyber-attack or security problem in an agricultural organization could
    have serious human or financial repercussions. This implies that pertinent security
    concerns brought about by the widespread and ongoing usage of IoT, as well as
    the emergence of agro-terrorism, require adequate attention, better equipment,
    and solutions [62]. The bulk of system operations in the agriculture sector are
    network-based, and frequently these systems are not protected from cyber threats,
    which can have substantial financial and security ramifications [76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86].
    Five important elements, as identified in [87], strengthen these risks in the
    agricultural sector: Increasing the farm consolidation highly depends on technology;
    The joint ventures of the food supply chains, allow manufacturers to conduct processes
    and trade products directly; Food-related technologies in intelligent markets
    depend on more components, which increases their vulnerability to errors and malfunctions.
    Effective monitoring of food-related systems, social networks, and industries
    in a safe, dynamic, and almost real-time manner is lacking, making it difficult
    to identify serious digital and security vulnerabilities that could be the root
    of significant data breaches and system defects. Due to the heightened risk of
    cybercrime, the agriculture sector may be impacted by such threats in a number
    of ways. Categorize these methods as in [84]. Threats of tampering include delivery
    disruption, confidential information interception, formula modification, and delivery
    disruption. These risks are undoubtedly closely related to the adoption and application
    of technological advancements in the agriculture and food sectors. Cooper et al.
    and Bogaardt et al. identify the following as the primary technical advancement
    areas that are commonly used in the agri-sector and contain vulnerable places
    for harmful cyber-attacks [86,87,88]: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID); wireless
    communications (such as Wi-Fi); Sensors for the infrastructure, soil, and crops;
    Drones and other unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs); PA-specific automation solutions
    (such Real Time Kinematic Technology); Portable electronics (such as laptops,
    smartphones, and GPS trackers); Smart agriculture and vertical agriculture; The
    use of AI in conjunction with biotech and nanotech (AI). Table 4 provides a summary
    of the study performed on different attacks in agricultural 4.0 due to cyber security
    concerns. Table 4. Summary of the study performed on attacks in agricultural 4.0.
    4.3. IoT Vulnerabilities, Risks, and Threats in Agriculture IoT is made up of
    four main systems that make it possible to communicate between nodes. Sensing
    technology, IoT gateways, cloud servers, data storage, and mobile applications
    for remote control make up an IoT system. The architectures of IoT systems in
    agriculture come with current and new threats and vulnerabilities. These flaws
    can be linked to IoT device hardware and software problems, communication protocols,
    and also data processing and storage solutions (found, for example, in cloud infrastructures,
    data centers, and smartphones) [2,11]. According to [99,100,101], the following
    is a concise but accurate classification of the primary causes of low security
    in the IoT: Firmware that is not patched and/or default passwords that have been
    used for a long time allow for device compromise in an IoT network. Because of
    the limited computing power of smart devices and vendors’ efforts to keep their
    prices low in a cutthroat market, it is difficult to incorporate complicated cryptographic
    algorithms. Flaws in the routing protocols used by smart devices (such as Bluetooth
    and ZigBee); The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) protocol’s outdated, low-security
    version, which is frequently still in use; Conducting passive vulnerability detection
    using search engines; The risk of assembling millions of smart devices into a
    potent botnet (such as Mirai), given how simple it is to find vulnerabilities
    via internet scanning; A general disregard for the security of smart gadgets Finally,
    a variety of criteria can be used to categorize IoT vulnerabilities, hazards,
    and threats. These risks apply to all IoT applications, including those in the
    agricultural sector. First, internal vs. external risks and passive vs. active
    risks are the two basic classification groups of security concerns in IoT systems
    in the agriculture sector [79]. IoT hazards are categorized in another intriguing
    way using a layer-based system. According to [22], each of the levels below integrates
    many technologies that could lead to a variety of security threats, vulnerabilities,
    and/or breaches. The application layer, middleware layer, internet layer, access
    gateway layer, and edge technology layer are the five main layers that make up
    the IoT architecture. 5. Existing Research on Security in Agriculture 4.0 In [54],
    the author states that The United States Department of Homeland Security issued
    a report emphasizing the significance of agriculture 4.0 and the associated internet
    security threat and possible attacks. The report emphasizes the information security
    model of confidential information, credibility, and accessibility in farming.
    The researchers of [55] suggested a new access control solution that combines
    session keys and public keys to speed up the encrypted communications tasks. It
    yields quick and lightweight appropriate control measures that are ideal for precision
    agriculture communication. Ref. [56] Proposed a framework for understanding vulnerabilities
    in emerging technologies and their application in an intelligent farming environment.
    The goal of the approach is to determine the level to which intelligent farming
    emerging innovations are prone to cyber. It assesses the threat prediction model
    using the common vulnerability scoring system (CVSS). Nowadays, The Blockchain
    is not only used in cryptocurrency but also utilized in other fields and different
    applications such as in the medical sector, agriculture sector, etc. [57,58,59].
    This article concentrated on the application of blockchain technology to food
    safety. For tracking and monitoring the food items and stages of production, such
    as cultivation/breeding, raw resources, processing, transporting, warehousing,
    and selling, the author developed a system [60]. In addition, the system employs
    a variety of sensor-based equipment to adopt sustainable recording and confirmation
    with sensor-based verification. Ref. [61] Proposed a blockchain-based easy and
    simple security framework for smart Greenfield farming. Each IoT node can nominate
    the cluster member’s leader, which helps to avoid a hot spot problem if an intruder
    focuses on the leader node. Furthermore, the authors discussed the security risks
    of their suggested scheme, which adhered to the traditional confidentiality, integrity,
    and availability principles. Ref. [62] proposed a cost-effective IoT-based security
    monitoring system. The physical layer is the primary concern of this system of
    precision agriculture, where data are collected from sensors. These data are sent
    to a controller, which analyses it to take action, such as activating the actuators
    for water sprinklers on farms. Table 5 describes some of the recent research which
    has already been performed on security issues related to smart farming. Gupta,
    M et al. explained [102] the necessity of clouds applied in vehicles in this time-
    and location-sensitive context and present an extended access control oriented
    (E-ACO) architecture that is pertinent to IoV. Here, they describe using scenarios
    to highlight access control needs in our vision of cloud-assisted connected automobiles
    and vehicular IoT, as well as approaches to various access control models that
    may be applied at different tiers of the E-ACO architecture and in the authorization
    framework. Gupta, M et al. [103], in their work, describe an edge infrastructure-based
    solution to V2V and V2I communication that is safe and trustworthy in place of
    direct peer-to-peer connection. To approve, check, and verify the authenticity,
    integrity, and anonymity of communications sent in the system, they add trusted
    cloudlets in this section. Along with a proof of concept implementation of the
    suggested approach on the AWS IoT platform, they also describe a formal attribute-based
    model for V2V and V2I communication, known as AB-ITS. This cloudlet-supported
    architecture supports crucial use cases such as an accident or ice-threat warning
    and other safety applications. It supplements direct V2V or V2I communication.
    Sontowski, S. et al. [104] presented a DoS attack that can impair a smart farm’s
    operation by interfering with the functioning of installed on-field sensors. They
    specifically covered a Wi-Fi de-authentication attack that makes use of flaws
    in IEEE 802.11, where the management packets are not encrypted. A development
    board for the ESP8266 maker focus When a Raspberry Pi is attached, WiFi Deauther
    Monster is used to disconnect it from the network and stop sensor data from being
    transferred to a distant cloud. The notion of Activity-Centric Access Control
    (ACAC) for smart and connected ecosystems was first proposed by Gupta, M. et al.
    in [105] and discussed in this article as a first step. Here, they examined the
    idea of activity with regard to cooperative and dispersed yet interconnected systems,
    identifying the many parties involved as well as the crucial elements to consider
    when making an activity control choice. They provide an initial framework for
    developing activity control expressions that may be used by various smart objects
    in the system. The biggest obstacle to the growth of cloud computing is security
    worries. Information security continues to have an impact on the market even though
    it raises inconveniences related to information security. The threat of security
    breaches in the cloud infrastructure must be understood by clients. Cloud-computing
    capacity, networking, and computing powers are brought to the edge by fog computing.
    One of the most critical challenges with fog computing platforms is safety and
    security. Lightweight devices have benefited greatly from edge computing’s ability
    to complete difficult tasks quickly, but the technology’s hasty development has
    led to a general disregard for safety risks in edge computing stages and the applications
    they allow. In our proposed framework we have focused on the threats in fog computing-based
    IoT environment via blockchain for the application in agriculture 4.0. Table 5.

    Proposed Security Framework The proposed security framework for agriculture 4.0
    is described in this section. The block diagram of the proposed security framework
    is illustrated in Figure 5. Figure 5. Proposed Security Framework. 6.1. Sensor
    Layer in Agriculture 4.0 This layer’s major function is to acquire meaningful
    information from the external environment via sensors to take required action
    against it. This sensor layer has a variety of Sensor nodes of various forms and
    sizes. As a result, they all use the same basic components, such as input and
    output components, information handling units, communication segments, and many
    more units for the management of power sections. To analyze and store all detected
    data, it is sent to the relevant fog nodes. Furthermore, Sensor nodes receive
    instructions to undertake agricultural operations. 6.2. Fog Computing Layer This
    layer is made up of multiple fog nodes, which are insubstantial equipment that
    carry out processing, communication, and storing tools to do operations that an
    end device cannot perform. Not every piece of data that is gathered becomes processed
    on the cloud. Rather, this layer hosts all authentic analysis and latency-sensitive
    applications. Virtualization: Recognizing that configuring several devices, in
    the same manner, might be time-consuming, the nodes can be contained inside a
    Virtualized environment for a more pleasant setup for all subsequent fog nodes.
    Agricultural Sensor data monitoring: This node is going to collect real-time sensing
    data, analyze it, visualize it, manage devices, and store some of it locally.
    The user can obtain information from the fog layer while smoothly synchronizing
    cloud-directed data. Block-chain Client software: This consists of a piece of
    programs that is installed on the fog node. Its primary goal is to sync authentic
    sensitive Sensor data to the Blockchain. It is in charge of producing transactions,
    batching them, and sending them to the validator so that they can be aggregated
    into blocks and recorded to the Blockchain. Simulated Switch: Additionally, this
    node is used as a transmitting device with the support of virtual switch software,
    which provides NFV and SDN technologies to enhance network services by establishing
    the routing features for computational extension and control. Some network virtual
    functions include security, quality of service (QoS), and automated control. The
    main objective is to create switching layers for virtual machine environments
    while continuing to support the OpenFlow protocol [107], which allows this node
    to interact directly with the SDN Controller; an outstanding demonstration of
    such implementation is Open vSwitch, an interactive multilayered software switch.
    6.3. Distributed Network Using SDN This network is made up of numerous geologically
    dispersed and SDN controllers linked to it that operates as a common Networking
    Operating System (NOS), combining nominally autonomous operations with centralized
    control [108]. The main component of an SDN network is the SDN controller. This
    can help with network monitoring by managing all transactions among network and
    application devices, allowing it to manage and adjust network flows more efficiently
    in response to new requirements [109]. It maintains a consistent glimpse of the
    network from afar, delivering data to fog nodes via one APIs and application via
    other APIs (MQTT, CoAP...) [109]. In addition, the SDN controller employs a Block-chain
    contractor to properly secure flow tables of SDN in the Block-chain, hence avoiding
    rule counterfeit. 6.4. Block-Chain Based Network To keep all the nodes up to date,
    all Blockchain modules are interconnected and constantly exchange the most updated
    information in the Blockchain among themselves. Smart contracts will trigger and
    enforce relevant actions based on the data provided, allowing for verifiable transactions
    in the Blockchain when such circumstances are met without the requirement for
    third-party involvement [110,111]. The Ethereum Blockchain platform serves as
    the foundation for the blockchain network architecture because it provides a highly
    flexible and modular design that separates the runtime environment as per the
    application domain, permitting agreements to define the business rules for the
    application that are not necessary for the core system’s fundamental design. The
    Blockchain complete node is made up of the following components: Node for Validation:
    This is a key component that verifies batches of transactions before combining
    them into blocks. It also ensures that candidate blocks are added to the Blockchain
    version for each node. Blockchain Software: it determines which transactions or
    operations are permitted on the block-chain and contains the following: Database
    model: it defines relevant operations and the description of the transaction’s
    payload. Transaction Processor: defines the business logic for different applications,
    validates batches of transactions, and modifies the blockchain system based on
    the application’s rules. Client: it specifies the service client functionality,
    which the client develops and delivers to the validator. The client also shows
    blockchain information. REST API: This protocol is used to communicate within
    the clients and the transactions processing system. Digital Signature: To ensure
    transaction integrity, the data used in the transactions is hashed using SHA-256
    and then encrypted using the sender’s secret key to produce a signature. The processor
    then validates the transaction by verifying this signature. 7. Case Studies and
    Experimental Results To test the security framework, we allowed DDoS attacks against
    the Blockchain Network. A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack targets
    websites and servers by disrupting network services. A DDoS attack attempts to
    exhaust an application’s resources. We provide an experimental setup configuration
    shown in Table 6, as well as the simulation architecture is shown in Figure 6.
    Figure 6. Experimental Setup Architecture. Table 6. Experimental Setup Configuration.
    Host Machine (HM): Here we have installed an open-source based IoT framework called
    ThingsBoard, which make it possible to construct fog layers while seamlessly syncing
    with the cloud, on the host system and constructed a scenario of a smart farm
    with two silos, each with a different number of IoT devices. Every second, each
    gadget reports a pseudo-random value. We utilized a code to simulate a Blockchain
    client, which accepts the provided values and generates transactions. Mininet
    network emulation tool is then used to commit the transaction onto the Blockchain
    via the Open vSwitch module. We also connected the ONOS SDN controller and sFlow4
    collector to the Mininet virtual network. Virtual Machine (VM): We have installed
    the Ethereum Blockchain network and its Supply Chain AssetTrack application in
    the Virtual Machine. To keep records of their updated information, we formed a
    user for the host system (fog node) and various assets. Every reported value will
    be used by the blockchain client to update the specified asset in the Ethereum
    blockchain. To put our framework architecture to the test, we conducted three
    case studies. Case 1: We examined the platform’s usual workflow, which means we
    did not conduct any attacks on the Ethereum blockchain. Case 2: Using the Hping
    programme on the host PC, we launched a DDoS assault on the Blockchain network.
    We implemented a DDoS mitigation programme on the SDN controller. Case 3: We launched
    a DDoS attack against the Blockchain network, by turning off the DDoS mitigation
    programme in the SDN controller. During the simulation, we noticed two crucial
    metrics in each case: The number of network packets received by the Blockchain
    per minute. The number of transactions published in the Blockchain network. The
    results are shown in Figure 7 and Figure 8, respectively. Taking the case 1 findings
    as ideal, with 120 published transactions in 10 min at an average of 100 Kbps;
    the third scenario revealed a really dismal performance with about 45 published
    transactions, representing a loss of more than 60% compared to the 1st case, and
    an unreliable Blockchain network. To understand the outcomes of the second scenario,
    we must first recognize what took place in the network during the test. The Open
    vSwitch sends all network traffic data to the sFlow forecast system, a real-time
    reporting system that gives real-time notice of network assaults, involving attackers
    and target information, to the SDN controller security framework via commands.
    The SDN controller interacts with the switch to discard DDoS traffic while allowing
    valid traffic to continue through. The attack is stopped fast enough to prevent
    it from rapidly growing and resulting in 95 blocks published, which is approximately
    40% more than the 3rd case. Figure 7. Number of packets received by Blockchain
    per minute. Figure 8. Number of transactions published in Blockchain per minute.
    8. Smart Agriculture 5.0 With 100 times faster upload and download speeds than
    “fourth generation of mobile technology (4G)” and “fourth-generation long-term
    evolution (4GLTE)” technologies and latencies as low as 1 ms, the “5th generation
    mobile network (5G)” is a new technology for wireless that can connect a million
    gadgets per square kilometer. In order to exchange data effectively, the millions
    of smart gadgets that make up the precision agricultural networks must be connected
    to one another over a given piece of land. Therefore, the Agriculture 4.0 scenario
    is particularly well adapted to 5G technology [112,113,114]. A framework for the
    digitization of agriculture networks and function modules for an intelligent irrigation
    system was provided by Meng and Cheng [115]. Tao and Donglin [116] also investigated
    how 5G technology may be used for agricultural planting, livestock farming, and
    traditional farming growth [117,118,119,120,121]. 9. Conclusions Modernization
    of agricultural methods is required to increase productivity levels while conserving
    nature. Precision agriculture could improve farming works by controlling actuators
    more efficiently, enhancing the use of resources, increasing revenues, and minimizing
    expenses. In order to accomplish this objective, IoT technologies have to incorporate
    more computing performance, such as edge computing, big data handling, automated
    resources, and safety features. As limited devices sense a huge amount of data
    and forward it to the gateway or the cloud, security requires special attention.
    The data must be secured throughout the agricultural system, from diagnosis to
    risks and inventory. Even though numerous security issues may affect farming production,
    they still include a few security measures. This could be because these technologies
    were in their initial phases of development. For most of the points, only computing
    resources are incorporated, and that has limited computation power. As a result,
    security mechanisms are very rare in the current list of requirement specifications.
    Reaching a higher level of agricultural development, on the other hand, necessitates
    technologies with security features that provide enough quality and validity to
    incorporate these technologies on a high level. As precision agriculture introduces
    new complexities, it also opens up new future directions in security and other
    areas. In this study, we suggested a security framework for the agricultural internet
    of things that integrates blockchain technology, fog computing, and software-defined
    networking. The suggested architecture avoids the requirement for simulation-based
    work with both private and public blockchain for communication between SDN controllers
    and IoT devices. Here, for IoT connectivity, each SDN controller is linked to
    a blockchain. SDN controllers are interconnected by a network’s topology. One
    of the key objectives of the proposed architecture is to enhance communication
    security for IoT devices. For IoT devices with limited resources, distributed
    trust-based verification makes blockchain even more useful. With a focus on fixing
    security and data reliability issues in a distributed controller context. Additionally,
    we want to increase the accuracy of our system using machine learning methods.
    It might be significant to add an intrusion detection system utilizing various
    deep learning algorithms in future work to prevent the insertion of fake Sensor
    data in the intelligent agricultural field. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: World agriculture faces the challenge of increasing its agricultural
    production by 50 % from 2012 to 2050, while reducing water consumption, as agriculture
    accounts for 69 % of all fresh water used on the planet. The use of technologies
    such as the internet of things, artificial intelligence, digital twins, among
    others, in the agricultural environment is increasing. Digital twin applied to
    agriculture is in its early stages of development. A digital twin is one in which
    data flows automatically and in both directions between a physical object and
    a virtual object. Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of
    a smart irrigation system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation
    system is one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors
    and actuators, are connected with their virtual representations. The system is
    composed of a FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation
    model in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is
    used to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate
    daily irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior
    of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication
    between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate
    by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior
    of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies.
    The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing
    both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies
    in parallel with current farm practices. Within the system proposed, farmers can
    evaluate the behavior of the system before implementing in their farms and allowing
    the system to operate automatically. It is possible to infer that the system can
    improve farm operations and reduce water usage by allowing farmers to gather soil,
    weather and crop information and evaluate multiple irrigation strategies.

    by 50 % from 2012 to 2050, while reducing water consumption, as agriculture accounts
    for 69 % of all fresh water used on the planet. The use of technologies such as
    the internet of things, artificial intelligence, digital twins, among others,
    in the agricultural environment is increasing. Digital twin applied to agriculture
    is in its early stages of development. A digital twin is one in which data flows
    automatically and in both directions between a physical object and a virtual object.
    Withing this context, this paper presents a digital twin of a smart irrigation
    system in an application scenario. A digital twin for an irrigation system is
    one in which the physical components of the system, such as its sensors and actuators,
    are connected with their virtual representations. The system is composed of a
    FIWARE-based internet of things platform and a discrete event simulation model
    in Siemens Plant Simulation software. The internet of things platform is used
    to collect, aggregate and process soil, weather and crop data to calculate daily
    irrigation prescriptions. The simulation model is used to simulate the behavior
    of an irrigation system defined in an application scenario. The communication
    between the platform and the simulation model happens in real-time and is intermediate
    by an OPC UA server. A application scenario is considered to evaluate the behavior
    of the system and to evaluate, in future research, different irrigation strategies.
    The benefits of the systems proposed are twofold. First, evaluate the behavior
    of the Internet of Things (IoT) platform and an irrigation system before implementing
    both in the field. Second, enable the evaluation of different irrigation strategies
    in parallel with current farm practices. Within the system proposed, farmers can
    evaluate the behavior of the system before implementing in their farms and allowing
    the system to operate automatically. It is possible to infer that the system can
    improve farm operations and reduce water usage by allowing farmers to gather soil,
    weather and crop information and evaluate multiple irrigation strategies. Graphical

    of thingsDigital twinSmart farmingDigital manufacturing 1. Introduction Agriculture
    plays a key role in the development of many countries. According to the Food and
    Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations, 2017) agricultural production needs to increase by 40%
    from 2012 to 2050 to meet the needs of an estimated population of 10 billion people
    by 2050. The organization states that to improve production it is necessary to
    be innovative not only by using technology such as apps, drones, and machinery
    but by performing social, organization and institutional transformations (Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2017). Some technologies that
    have been played in agriculture are the IoT (Farooq et al., 2020), Big Data (Wolfert
    et al., 2017), Cyber-physical system (CPS) (Navarro et al., 2020) and Digital
    Twin (DT) (Anthony Howard et al., 2020, Tekinerdogan and Verdouw, 2020). These
    technologies are used in agriculture to improve productivity, decrease the use
    of resources, such as water and energy, and increase product quality. One main
    concern of agriculture is the usage of water for irrigation. Accordingly with
    FAO, agriculture consumes 69% of all water used in the world (Food and Agriculture
    Organization of the United Nations, 2016). However, the distribution of freshwater
    withdraws varies with geographic location and income, as the low-income countries
    withdraws up to 90% of their available freshwater, whereas high-income countries
    withdraws up to 41% (Ritchie and Roser, 2017). It is important to highlight that
    over-irrigation and under-irrigation can cause crop yield to decrease, resulting
    in production and quality losses (Irmak et al., 2016, Ebrahimian et al., 2019).
    Within this context, the concept of smart farming emerges, which can be broadly
    defined as the use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT), in order
    to sense, monitor and control the agricultural environment, machines, and equipment
    used by farmers. The data collected by multiple ICT systems is used to create
    more efficient, productive and profitable farms (Verdouw et al., 2016, Pivoto
    et al., 2018). Irrigation is a farming process that benefits directly from the
    smart farming context. Smart irrigation strategies can be divided in monitoring
    and control strategies (Touil et al., 2022). The monitoring strategies consist
    in monitoring the weather, soil, and plant parameters. The control strategies
    consist in open-loop and closed-loop methods. Touil et al. (2022) pointed that
    the development of a real-time monitoring and control system based on weather,
    soil, and crop characteristics can improve water usage efficiency. One possible
    method to create a monitoring and control system is to develop a DT. A DT allows
    a real-time interaction between a physical object, such as the irrigation system,
    and its digital representation, such as its representation in a IoT platform,
    by allowing modifications in the physical object to automatically alter the digital
    object and vice versa (Kritzinger et al., 2018). It is important to notice that
    the use of IoT in agriculture is increasing in the last years (Navarro et al.,
    2020) and that the use of DT in agriculture is still in its early stages (Pylianidis
    et al., 2021). In addition, factors such as performance measurements, access to
    data, operations planning, operations control, and farm characteristics affects
    the adoption of technologies in agriculture (Monteleone et al., 2020). In this
    context, the Smart Water Management Platform (SWAMP) project (Kamienski et al.,
    2019) had the objective to develop an IoT platform for the management of water
    resources in irrigation. Based on the SWAMP project, an initial implementation
    of a DT for an irrigation system was presented (Alves et al., 2019), whereas a
    simulation environment for the irrigation system, developed in the discrete event
    simulation software Plant Simulation, was further described (Alves et al., 2022).
    This study extents that initial implementation by developing a DT by using a IoT
    platform capable of monitoring and controlling, in real time, the farm environment
    and an irrigation system. The IoT platform is used to collect and aggregate soil,
    weather and crop data, calculate the water needs and send irrigation prescriptions
    to the irrigation system. The irrigation system’s behavior is simulated in the
    Plant Simulation software to validate the communication between the platform and
    a future irrigation system to be implemented in a real farm. The main contribution
    of this work is in validating a system capable of monitoring the farm’s environment
    and monitoring and controlling an irrigation system. The solution presented in
    this paper presents a closed-loop monitoring and control system for irrigation
    based on data from the weather, soil, and crop. In addition, farmers can evaluate
    the system behavior in parallel with their current farm practices and validate
    if the solution meets their needs without risking their crops. Finally, once the
    communication between the IoT platform and the devices and irrigation system is
    validated in the virtual environment, the solution can be easily deployed in the
    field. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents
    the background and related work; Section 3 presents the application scenario used
    as a representation of a given farm; Section 4 presents the system design; Section
    5 presents the system operation; Section 6 presents a discussion of the application
    of a DT for an irrigation system; Section 7 drives the conclusion and future research.
    2. Background and related work This study proposes a DT of an irrigation system
    by combining a FIWARE-based IoT platform and a simulation model in Plant Simulation.
    The system proposed is part of the SWAMP project (Kamienski et al., 2019). Therefore,
    this section describes the background concepts and works used to withstand the
    development of a DT for an irrigation system. This section is structured as follows:
    Section 2.1 highlights the difference between digital model, generator, shadow
    and twin; Section 2.2 describes the use of IoT in agriculture; Section 2.3 presents
    the FIWARE platform, in which some of its components were used for the development
    of the DT; Section 2.4 presents the SWAMP project and its architecture, used to
    define the system’s architecture; Section 2.5 presents the Plant Simulation software,
    used to develop the simulation model. 2.1. Digital twins A digital model, generator,
    shadow, and twin may all be defined by the interaction between a physical and
    digital object, as shown in Fig. 1 (Tekinerdogan and Verdouw, 2020, Grieves and
    Vickers, 2017). In a digital model, the interactions between a physical and digital
    object happens only manually. A digital generator is one in which a digital object
    automatically interacts with a physical object. A digital shadow occurs when the
    physical object automatically interacts with the digital object. Finally, a DT
    allows for real-time, two-way communication between digital and physical items.
    Table 1 indicates the key concepts applied in the DT context (Jones et al., 2020).
    These concepts can be applied to an IoT context, since it allows for the communication
    of a physical object or system with its virtual representation in an IoT platform
    (Tekinerdogan and Verdouw, 2020). In the case of an irrigation system, a DT is
    capable of both monitoring and controlling the irrigation system by using sensors
    and actuators. As a result, changes to the irrigation system can affect its virtual
    representation and vice versa. Download : Download high-res image (269KB) Download

    objects interactions. The application of a DT in agriculture is in its early stages
    (Pylianidis et al., 2021, Nasirahmadi and Hensel, 2022). However, Pylianidis et
    al. (2021) argue that the benefits of using a DT in agriculture are: account for
    local system variability that are often too complex; create an automated pipeline
    of operations; integrate information from multiple sources; quantify uncertainty;
    create different levels of transparency and data access; and create human-centered
    intelligence. The use of DT can improve farm management and predict and address
    unseen issues in the field (Nasirahmadi and Hensel, 2022). Table 1. Key concepts
    related to DT. Term Description Physical object A “real world” artifact, e/g,
    a vehicle, component, product, system, model. Virtual object A computer generated
    representation of the physical artifact. Physical environment The measurable “real-world”
    environment within which the physical object exists. Virtual environment A virtual
    “world” or simulation that replicate the state of the physical environment. Physical
    process The physical process within which the physical object engages. Virtual
    process The virtual process within which the virtual object engages. State The
    current value of all parameters of either the physical or virtual objects. Realization
    The act of changing the physical or virtual object state. Twinning The act of
    synchronizing the states of the physical and virtual objects. Integration between
    virtual entities The methods required to enable communication between different
    virtual entities. Adapted from Jones et al. (2020) and Tekinerdogan and Verdouw
    (2020). This paper uses an IoT platform to create a virtual environment. The real
    environment should have sensors and actuators such as soil probes, weather stations
    and the devices used to monitor and control the irrigation system. However, in
    this work, the soil probe is simulated with data from field tests, the weather
    data is collected from external services and the irrigation system behavior is
    simulated in the Plat Simulation software. Therefore, this study simulates the
    behavior of real devices in the virtual environment. 2.2. Internet of things According
    to the European Commission Information Society and Media (2008), IoT can be defined
    as “Things having identities and virtual personalities operating in smart spaces
    using intelligent interfaces to connect and communicate within social, environmental,
    and user contexts”. There are multiples literature reviews about IoT in agriculture
    (Navarro et al., 2020, Nižetić et al., 2020). IoT solutions can be applied in
    multiple areas such as open-field agriculture, greenhouses, vertical farms, urban
    agriculture, fishery, aquaculture, livestock, agri-food supply chain and others.
    Each area has its main challenges and benefits to apply IoT (Nižetić et al., 2020).
    For agriculture in specific, some benefits of applying IoT include: increase the
    efficiency of agricultural production process, monitor yields, detect potential
    diseases, lead to water savings, and ensure crop seeding and fertility. This article
    focus on the development of a solution that can monitor and control an irrigation
    system by using a IoT platform to collect, process and send data from and to devices
    in the farm. 2.3. FIWARE platform FIWARE is a non-profit organization founded
    in 2016 by Atos Engineering, Orange Business Services and Telefonica and its mission
    is to promote the adoption of a common, collaborative and interoperable data sharing
    structure, based on standards and open source technology (FIWARE, 2020). As a
    base framework for IoT, FIWARE has main components called Generic Enablers (GE)
    that allows the creation and configuration of IoT platforms according to the needs
    of each solution and sector. Each GE has a specific function, and the platform’s
    ability to combine multiple GEs gives it flexibility. These components are divided
    into four groups depending on their main function, which are: manage context information;
    translate multiple communication protocols to a base protocol; create intelligent
    behavior by processing, analyzing and visualizing context information; and manage,
    publish and monetize context data. This study uses mainly GEs to manage the context
    information and to make an interface with devices using different communication
    protocols. This work develops its own components for processing and analyzing
    data and uses an external component to visualize data. The use of components to
    manage, publish, and monetize data is not used because it is outside the scope
    of this study. 2.4. Smart water development platform This study is based on the
    SWAMP project (Kamienski et al., 2019), and uses a 5 layer architecture as described
    below and presented in Fig. 2: • Layer 1: Device and communication - This layer
    has the sensors and actuators that interacts with the environment to monitor or
    control it. Each device can send data to the IoT platform, either directly or
    indirectly through a gateway. • Layer 2: Data acquisition, security, and management
    - This layer has the components that translate different protocols to the NGSI
    protocol used by the IoT platform. • Layer 3: Data management - This layer is
    responsible for managing the data, that can be structured or not structured, and
    to store this data in the correct format. • Layer 4: Water irrigation and distribution
    models - This layer is responsible for processing the data to monitor or predict
    the environment’s behavior. This layer uses Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms
    and big data techniques in order to process the data. • Layer 5: Water application
    services - This layer is responsible for presenting the data to the stakeholders.
    This study uses the layer architecture provided by the SWAMP project, but with
    different components and the ones presented in Fig. 2. The benefit of using this
    layered architecture is that it allows for a clear distinction on the main function
    of each component and makes it easy to integrate the platform described in this
    work with the one provided by the SWAMP project. Download : Download high-res

    described by Kamienski et al. (2019). 2.5. Plant simulation Plant Simulation,
    used in this study, provides the user with a series of components used to connect
    the simulation with an SQL database, Programmable Logic Controller (PLC), Open
    Platform Communications Unified Architecture (OPC UA) servers, etc. Within the
    context of DTs, the software offers the possibility to model certain processes
    and equipment in order to digitally represent a real system and, through connection
    with external elements such as and OPC UA server, to collect and send information
    to real equipment. This software uses a discrete event simulation method. According
    to Jeon and Kim (2016), a discrete event simulation is one in which changes in
    the system occur at discrete points of time, thus, it is necessary that an event
    occurs to generate a change in the model. The authors also argue that, in this
    type of simulation, entities can be physical representations or information flows
    and that it is essential that the simulator keeps tracking the simulation time.
    It is important to highlight that Plant Simulation is not commonly used to simulate
    continuous process such as water flowing thought pipes. However, the software
    has a module to simulate fluids that have elements such as pipes, tanks, mixers,
    etc. The simulation model develop in this work uses these elements to represent
    the components in a real irrigation system and uses methods to define the behavior
    of each element, such as opening and closing a water pump or sprinkler for example.
    Methods are scripts used to define a sequence of actions that a component can
    do and the variables that the simulation model should keep track off. The main
    benefit of using Plant Simulation is that it already has components to simulate
    the behavior of process involving fluids and that it has connection with external
    services such as the OPC UA server used in this study. 3. Application scenario
    This paper proposes a scenario of application to evaluate the DT for an irrigation
    system. Fig. 3 indicates a hypothetical example of a farm that is used as application
    scenario this study. In this design, a farm is composed of two management zones,
    named areas A and B, with dimensions of 8 m by 22 m and an equivalent area of
    in each one. Both areas have three sprinklers and one soil probe. Both areas are
    irrigated by the same water pump with and maximum flow rate of . An infinity water
    supply is considered, which means that there is always water available for irrigation.
    Each area is considered a management zone, so interventions are uniform in each
    area, which means that the sprinklers in each area are activated or deactivated
    together. However, each area can be irrigated independently. There is no flow
    rate control in each individual sprinkler. The pump controls the water flow rate
    for both areas. Download : Download high-res image (277KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Farm design used in the application scenario. Two areas
    were considered in order to evaluate, in future research, a Fuzzy Inference System
    (FIS) (Souza et al., 2020) in comparison with the Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration
    method (Allen et al., 1998). The FIS method not only uses the daily evapotranspiration,
    obtained by the Penman–Monteith method, but also the soil moisture, the days after
    planting (DAP), the rain forecast for the next day and the rain forecast probability
    for the next day, as indicated in Fig. 4. The Penman–Monteith method is the standard
    method to calculate the daily evapotranspiration, which is considered as the irrigation
    prescription for one of the zones in the proposed system, whereas the other zone
    is going to be evaluated by the FIS method. The design of the proposed system
    were considered to be able to compare both methods regarding water usage and crop
    yield. It is important to highlight that this study does not compare the results
    of both methods nor it presents the difference between the two since it can be
    seen in the work of Souza et al. (2020). However, this paper indicates the virtual
    environment for the implementation of both methods in the IoT platform. In addition,
    the IoT platform can operate in parallel with the current operations in a farm,
    so farmers can evaluate both methods with their current practices. Download :

    section describes the system overview; the IoT platform setup including the platform
    architecture, the information model and the communication between each platform
    component; and the simulation model developed in the Plant Simulation software.
    4.1. System overview A overview of the system’s operation is shown in Fig. 5.
    The system is composed by three physical objects: the soil probe, the weather
    station and the irrigation system. These objects send data to their digital representations
    in the IoT platform in via a gateway. The platform manages, stores and process
    this data to calculate the amount of water that should be irrigated in the next
    day. This information is sent back to the irrigation system to be executed. All
    the data in the platform can be visualized in a dashboard. It is important to
    highlight that even though there are three physical objects, this work simulates
    the behavior of each element. The soil probe is simulated by a python script,
    the weather station is simulated by collecting weather data from external services
    available on the internet, and the irrigation system is simulated by using an
    OPC UA server and the Plant Simulation software. Download : Download high-res

    IoT platform architecture The system architecture used in this study can be seen
    in Fig. 6 and is based on the 5 layer architecture used in the SWAMP platform
    (Kamienski et al., 2019) and described in Section 2.4. The components are divided
    as follows: in blue are FIWARE components; in gray are databases; in orange are
    components developed for this study; in red is a component used to create a dashboard;
    in yellow are the OPC UA and Plant Simulation software used to simulate the behavior
    of the irrigation system; and in green is an external weather service. The main
    function of each component is summarized below: Download : Download high-res image

    • Soil probe - This component simulates a physical 2 layered soil probe sending
    data to the IoT platform. • Data Model - This component makes the information
    model’s setup in the IoT agents and Orion Context Broker and is used only during
    the platform’s startup process. • Weather Handler - This component simulates a
    physical weather station by gathering weather information from the Open Weather
    and Weather Wunderground Application Programming Interface (API)s and sending
    it to the platform. • Irrigation Recommendation - This component aggregates data
    from the platform and calculates an irrigation prescription, in millimeters, for
    the next day. • FIWARE IoT Agent Json - This is an agent that bridges the JSON
    protocol to the NGSI protocol used inside the FIWARE platform. • FIWARE IoT Agent
    OPC UA - This is an agent that bridges the OPC UA protocol to the NGSI protocol
    used inside the FIWARE platform. • FIWARE Orion Context Broker - This component
    allows to manage the entire life cycle of context information, including updates,
    queries, records and subscriptions via its API. • FIWARE Cygnus - Cygnus is a
    connector in charge of persisting data sources in certain third party databases,
    such as MySQL used in this study, creating a historical view of such data. • MySQL
    database - This is a relational database that stores time series data collected
    from other components. • MongoDB database - This is a non-relational database
    that stores data as files. It is used mainly to store the entities structure used
    in the Orion Context Broker and IoT agents and to store the last value of each
    entity’s property. • Grafana - Grafana is an open source, multiplatform web application
    that allows the analysis and visualization of data through tables, graphs and
    alerts. It is used to display the data collected from the other components. •
    OPC UA server - This component is used to simulate a physical irrigation system
    that has monitoring and controlling devices that use the OPC UA protocol. This
    server was configured to have variables and methods capable of monitoring and
    controlling the irrigation system described in Section 3. • Plant Simulation -
    This is a discrete event simulation software used to simulate the irrigation process
    of the irrigation system described in Section 3. • Weather Services - These are
    external weather services from Weather Wunderground and Open Weather Map. 4.3.
    Information model It is important to have an information model that represents
    the farm as closely as possible. This is done in the platform by defining the
    entities that exist inside the Orion Context Broker and IoT agents. These entities
    are the digital objects used to represent not only the physical objects, such
    as the soil probe, the weather station and the irrigation system, but also only
    digital information. The entities defined for the application scenario as well
    as the relationship between them are presented in Fig. 7. In this data model,
    a Virtual Entity (VE) is an entity that represents a physical element that has
    directly communication with the IoT platform. A Virtualized Physical Entity (VPE)
    is an entity that represents a physical element that has indirectly communication
    with the IoT platform. A Digital Entity (DE) is an entity that represents a digital
    element that can be used to represent data from external services, calculations,
    and other necessary information. Download : Download high-res image (461KB) Download

    It is important to notice that the physical objects described in Section 4.1 –
    such as the soil probe, the irrigation system and the weather station – have their
    digital objects represented as VE. Likewise, the VPEs are used to represent physical
    objects such as crops and the management zones, that are real-world physical objects
    that do not interact directly with the platform. They are represented in order
    to aggregate and/or provide information needed to perform calculations for the
    irrigation prescription for each zone. A brief description of each entity is given
    below: • Current Weather - Represents the current weather conditions such as temperature,
    relative humidity, precipitation in the last hour, pressure, wind speed, wind
    direction etc. • Weather Forecast - Represents future weather conditions such
    as maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rain probability, rainfall, average
    wind speed etc. • Reference evapotranspiration - Represents data used to calculate
    the reference evapotranspiration by the Penman–Monteith method (Allen et al.,
    1998) as well as the evapotranspiration itself. • Fuzzy Needs - Represents data
    used to calculate the irrigation recommendation by using a fuzzy inference algorithm
    (Souza et al., 2020). • Crop Type - Represents data for the crop obtained from
    FAO. • Crop Instance - Represents the specific crop cultivated in the management
    zone. • Management Zone - Represents the smallest piece of land where data and
    interventions are considered homogeneous. • Irrigation Recommendation - Represents
    a irrigation recommendation, in millimeters, for a defined management zone. •
    Soil Probe - Represents the data collected by the soil probe such as soil moisture,
    soil temperature, air moisture, air temperature, illuminance etc. • Irrigation
    system - Represents the irrigation system with its monitoring and control devices.
    The information model can be expanded based on the stakeholders needs. For example,
    an irrigation system can be composed of multiple entities that represent each
    valve and component in the system, a farm can be represent by multiple management
    zones that are aggregated in multiple fields in a farm etc. It is possible to
    have multiple entities of the same entity type since Orion Context Broker is capable
    of managing data from each entity separately. The management zone has a relationship
    with almost all other entities since it is the smallest piece of land considered
    in the application scenario. It is important to note that different management
    zones can have different interventions, such as different irrigation prescriptions.
    However, within a management zone the interventions are homogeneous. 4.4. Communication
    between components This subsection describes the communication between each component
    in the platform described in Section 4.2. 4.4.1. Data model This component creates
    the entities, described in the information model, in the IoT agents and Orion
    Context Broker. These entities are used as digital objects representations in
    the IoT platform. Before creating the entities this components creates a service
    in both the IoT agents and Orion Context Broker in order to separate data for
    this application. When an entity is created in the IoT Agent, the Agent creates
    a representation of that entity in the Orion Context Broker, so it knows to which
    entity to send the data coming from devices. Fig. 8 shows the communication between
    the data model and other components. Download : Download high-res image (221KB)

    of the platform and is used to manage the entire life cycle of context information,
    including updates, queries, records and subscriptions via its API and connections
    to relational and non-relational databases. It has connections with multiple components,
    as can be seen in Fig. 6. First, the information model is defined in the Orion
    Context Broker by the data model component. Then, the IoT agents create entities
    (digital objects) representing the soil probe and irrigation system (physical
    objects) in the broker. The data model also creates the entities (digital objects)
    to represent the data from a weather station (physical object) simulated by the
    weather handler component. The broker can receive data from the IoT agents, Weather
    Handler and Irrigation Recommendation components and send data to the Cygnus and
    IoT Agent OPC UA component. Fig. 9 shows the communication between the Orion Context
    Broker and other components. Download : Download high-res image (237KB) Download

    simulate the behavior of a 2-layered soil probe (physical object). In a real environment,
    this component should read the data from the multiple sensors, such as soil temperature,
    soil humidity, air temperature, air humidity, illuminance, GPS etc, in the probe,
    aggregates its data and send it to the IoT Agent JSON. The Agent has an entity
    (digital object) used to represent the soil probe (physical object). However,
    in this study, this component sends simulated data every 30 min. Fig. 10 shows

    in the Orion Context Broker in a similar process done by the data model component.
    Then, it creates a connection with the irrigation system component, since the
    latter is an OPC UA server. After this connection, this component is able to receive
    commands and data from the Orion Context Broker and sent it to the Irrigation
    System component and vice-versa. Every time that a change is made, the component
    saves the information in an entity in the IoT Agent component and in the Orion
    Context Broker similar to what is described in Section 4.4.4 for the IoT Agent
    JSON. This component creates the communication between the simulate irrigation
    system (physical object) and its digital representation (digital object) as an
    entity in the Orion Context Broker. Fig. 12 shows the communication between the

    algorithm (Souza et al., 2020). First, this components created a connection with
    the MySQL database, then it queries data from the database and from the Orion
    Context Broker. After collecting data, it calculates the irrigation prescription
    for the next day for each management zone and then sent this data to the management

    platform. This component gathers weather information from the Open Weather and
    Weather Wunderground APIs and send it to the platform. This components calls the
    APIs every hour and than sends its data to the current weather and weather forecast
    entities in the Orion Context Broker. This component creates the communication
    between the simulated weather station (physical object) and its digital representation
    (digital object) as entities in the Orion Context Broker. Fig. 15 shows the communication

    database and then it constantly queries the database to update its dashboard.
    The dashboard can be configured in a way that best suits the stakeholder’s needs.
    In this study it is used to display current weather and weather forecast information,
    the irrigation prescription for a given day, an estimate irrigation prescription
    for the next day and information about the irrigation system such as if it is
    irrigating or not and with what flow rate. Fig. 16 shows the communication between

    Fig. 17. Simulation environment overview. 4.5. Simulating the irrigation system
    on Plant Simulation For the simulation of the irrigation system, a model using
    the Plant Simulation software developed by Siemens (2020). The simulation model
    must represent the application scenario, presented in Section 3, as close as possible.
    An overview of the simulation environment can be seen in Fig. 17. To simulate
    the irrigation system sprinklers (SP), the tank element is used. It is possible,
    using this element, to visualize the volume of water irrigated by a given sprinkler
    or region, as long as the tank has enough volume and its outlet is closed. There
    is a tank in the model for each sprinkler, for the manual operation and one tank
    for each management zone, for the automatic operation. Each area is composed by
    3 sprinklers that divided equally the flow rate coming from the pump. The sprinklers
    for each area are activated or deactivated together. The pump element is used
    to simulate the water pump, with a flow rate of when it is activated. There is
    no variable flow rate in the pump, meaning that when it is activated the flow
    rate is kept constant at and when deactivated it is kept at . Pipes are used as
    a visual representation of the proposed irrigation system and also as a way to
    direct the water to the appropriate management zones. The division of the water
    flow for each region was set at 50% for each area, regardless of the number of
    sprinklers that are connected in each management zone. Finally, the display element
    was used to show the values of some important variables directly in the simulation
    work space, as can be seen for the pump’s flow rate, for example. It is possible,
    with these elements, to visualize how the irrigation prescription would occur
    according to the prescription calculated by the IoT platform or according to the
    farmer’s manual commands sent to the platform. The simulation logic is written
    in objects called “methods” that are scripts in the SimTalk language. The simulation
    should be operational when the IoT platform sends the irrigation prescription
    to it. 5. System operation and results The following subsections describe the
    system operation considering a 2-day experiment for the application scenario considered
    in Section 3. Fig. 18 indicates an overview of the data flow during the system
    operation. Each step is described below: • Step 1 - The simulated soil probe sends
    data, every 30 min, to the IoT Agent JSON. • Step 2 - The IoT Agent JSON translates
    the data in the JSON protocol to the NGSI protocol and forwards the message to
    the Orion Context Broker. • Step 3 - The Weather Handler collects data from the
    Weather Wunderground API. • Step 4 - The Weather Handler collects data from the
    OpenWeather API. • Step 5 - The weather handler sends the climatic data from the
    two climatic services to the Orion COntext Broker. • Step 6 - The IoT Agent OPC
    UA creates the entity to represent the irrigation system and saves this entity
    in the MongoDB database. • Step 7 - The IoT Agent saves the last data received
    from the soil probe in the MongoDB database. • Step 8 - The Orion Context Broker
    saves the last data received from the IoT agents and the weather handler in the
    MongoDB database. • Step 9 - Cygnus received data from the entities that it is
    subscribed in the Orion Context Broker. This entities represent mainly the soil
    probe, the weather and the irrigation system. • Step 10 - Cygnus saves the data
    in a historical form in the MySQL database. • Step 11 - The irrigation recommendation
    collects data from the MySQL database regarding soil and weather information.
    • Step 12 - The irrigation recommendation sends intermediary and final calculations
    regarding the irrigation prescription for the next day to the Orion Context Broker.
    • Step 13 - The Orion Context Broker forwards the irrigation prescription to the
    IoT Agent OPC UA. • Step 14 - The IoT Agent OPC UA forwards the irrigation prescription
    to the OPC UA server representing the irrigation system. • Step 15 - The OPC UA
    server forwards the irrigation prescription to the simulation software Plant Simulation.
    • Step 16 - Grafana gets the historical data from the MySQL database and present
    it in a personalized dashboard. Considering a time sequence, in the first day,
    data is gathered from simulated devices such as the soil probe and personal weather
    station. By the end of the day, the irrigation prescription is calculated using
    Penman–Monteith (Allen et al., 1998) and fuzzy inference system (Souza et al.,
    2020) methods. In the next day the prescription for each area is sent from the
    IoT platform, passing thought the OPC UA server, to the simulated irrigation system
    in the Plant Simulation software. Download : Download high-res image (454KB) Download

    the Open Weather API up to 8am of the second day of the experiment. It is important
    to highlight that the data gathered from the soil probe does not represent real
    data collect from a farm. However, the data collect from the weather services
    represent data from the city of São Bernardo do Campo, in the state of São Paulo,
    Brazil. Download : Download high-res image (246KB) Download : Download full-size

    Based on the data previously presented, the platform calculated the irrigation
    recommendation for the second day, giving a result of 4.15 mm for the “area A”,
    based on Allen et al. (1998), and 2 mm and for the “area B”, based on Souza et
    al. (2020) as shown in Fig. 23, taken from the dashboard in Grafana. The figure
    also shows a preview of the irrigation recommendation for the next considering
    the data collect until the moment in which the farmer sees the dashboard. It is
    important to notice that the Penman–Monteith method uses only one day weather
    data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, radiation, etc, to calculate the
    evapotranspiration for the next day, whereas the FIS (Souza et al., 2020) method
    uses the evapotranspiration, calculated by the Penman–Monteith method, as well
    as the soil moisture, the days after seeding, the rain forecast and the rain probability.
    The soil moisture, indicated in Fig. 19, as well as the weather data, indicated
    in Fig. 22, are used in the FIS method, so the irrigation prescription using this
    method is lower than the one provided by the Penman–Monteith method. For the proposed
    application scenario, the irrigation platform sends the irrigation recommendation
    automatically at 8 am every day. Thus, the recommendations of 4.15 mm and 2 mm
    were sent respectively to the “Control Area” and “Fuzzy Area”. The OPC UA server
    simulates the behavior of a real irrigation system and is used as a connection
    between the IoT platform and the simulation software, so it forwards the prescription
    from the platform to the simulation software. The first step in the simulation
    after receiving the irrigation prescriptions is to calculate the volume of water
    to be irrigated for each of the areas, resulting in 730.14 l for the “Control
    Area” and l for the “Fuzzy Area” which are assigned as the volume of the tanks
    representing each given area. These tanks are used to define the irrigation target
    for each area. Therefore, the outlet of the tanks must be closed during the irrigation
    process so that the volume of the tank increases until its limit. The next step
    is to turn on the sprinklers SP1, SP2 and SP3 in each area. Soon after, the pump
    is started with a flow rate of as defined in the application scenario. Fig. 24
    shows the irrigation system turned on, as seen by the blue color in the pipes,
    and also the water needs for each irrigated area, as highlighted in yellow. Once
    the tank of an area reaches its maximum capacity, that is, it reaches the volume
    of water to be irrigated for that area, the model turns off the sprinklers SP1,
    SP2 and SP3 for the area. The model also turns off the water pump if the two areas
    have already been irrigated. Once all the sprinklers in a given area are turned
    off, the simulation then closes the tank inlet and opens the tank outlet of the
    respective area so that the volume of irrigated water is sent to the simulation’s
    exit and counted in the total volume of water irrigated. Table 2. Start and end

    image Fig. 24. Start of the simulation, after the simulation receives the irrigation
    commands. For the given application scenario and considering that both commands
    are sent at the same time to the simulation it is noticeable that the volume of
    water to be irrigated in the “control area” is higher than in the “fuzzy area”
    and as such the irrigation should end first in the “fuzzy area”. Table 2 indicates
    the data obtained from the virtual model (Plant Simulation) considering the application
    scenario presented. The irrigation recommendations for both areas were sent at
    the same time, that is, 3:12 min from the start of the simulation. Therefore the
    irrigation of the two areas is turned on at the same time. Thus, initially, the
    water pump is turned on with a flow rate of 1 l/s, and this flow is divided equally
    between the two areas. After that, both areas start their irrigation process with
    a flow rate of 0.5 l/s and, after completing the irrigation of the “fuzzy area”
    (in 14:57 min) the entire water flow is destined for irrigation of the control
    area. By analyzing the data from Table 2 it is possible to conclude that the irrigation
    of the “control area” took 18 min and 3 s (from 3:12 to 21:15) and the irrigation
    of the “fuzzy area” took 11 min and 45 s (from 3:12 to 14:57). When the simulation
    software detects that the irrigation is over, the volume of water irrigated in
    each area, the total volume of water used and the time to irrigate each area are
    sent back to the IoT platform to be stored. Then, the simulation model waits for
    the next irrigation prescription that should be sent by the IoT platform the next
    day. However, since only a 2-day timeframe was used in this study the simulation
    can be closed. 6. Discussion In this study, a virtual environment of DT for an
    irrigation system is composed based on the interactions between an IoT platform
    and a simulation model of an irrigation system in an application scenario presented
    in Section 3. Each DT concept presented in Section 2.1 can be summarized as follows:
    • Physical Object — The irrigation system with its physical components such as
    valves, pressure sensors etc. This is simulated by a simulation model in Plant
    Simulation. • Virtual Object — A virtual entity inside Orion Context Broker and
    the IoT Agent OPC UA that represents the irrigation system. • Physical Environment
    — The farm in which the irrigation system should be installed in the future. •
    Virtual Environment — The IoT platform which has multiple entities and components
    used to represent the farm and the irrigation system. • Physical Process — The
    process to turn on and off the irrigation system based on the farm needs and its
    interaction within the farm environment. This is simulated in the simulation model.
    • Virtual Process — The process that the platform uses to manage the irrigation
    system data. This is done mainly by the Orion Context Broker, but also by the
    irrigation recommendation component. • State — The state of the physical or virtual
    representations of the irrigation system. In the virtual environment it is the
    entities state in Orion Context Broker and in the real environment is the state
    of each element in the simulation model. • Realization — The act of changing the
    physical or virtual state of the irrigation system. In the virtual environment
    it happens by the IoT agents and the irrigation recommendation component. In the
    real environment it happens by the execution of the simulation model. • Twinning
    — The act of synchronizing the states of the physical and virtual representations
    of the irrigation system. This is done by the IoT Agent OPC UA. • Integration
    Between Virtual Entities — The communication between the physical and virtual
    representation of the irrigation system. This is done by the communication between
    the OPC UA server, the IoT Agent OPC UA and the Orion Context Broker. The system’s
    operation it can be divided in 3 steps: data collection, in which the IoT platform
    gather and stores soil, weather, and crop information; data processing, in which
    the irrigation prescription is calculated and sent to the simulation model via
    the OPC UA server; irrigation evaluation, in which the simulation model evaluates
    the irrigation prescription and send back the results to the IoT platform. These
    3 steps happens every day and all the changes in the system’s variables can be
    seen in the dashboard, created in the Grafana component, in order to monitor the
    system behavior in real time. It is important to highlight that the DT presented
    in this study can irrigate the management zones automatically. However, farmers
    have concerns regarding allowing a system to operate automatically, since they
    are risking their crops in case the system does not operate correctly. Thus, the
    proposed system allows farmers to evaluate the results of the system in a virtual
    environment before deploying it in the field. In addition, it allows farmers to
    compare the irrigation prescription calculated by the Penman–Monteith method (Allen
    et al., 1998) and a FIS (Souza et al., 2020) method with their current farming
    practices. Once the behavior of the system has been evaluated, it is possible
    to easily deploy the IoT platform to the cloud and connect the devices of a real
    irrigation system to the OPC UA server. When the system is in operation, farmers
    can visualize the past, current, and possible the future state of their farmers
    by inspecting the personalized dashboard and the data stored in the IoT platform.
    With information from the soil, weather, crop, and the irrigation system farmers
    can make better decisions, improve their operations and reduce water used in irrigation.
    Even though this study does not compare the Penman–Monteith evapotranspiration
    method (Allen et al., 1998) with the FIS method (Souza et al., 2020), there is
    research pointing to a reduction in water usage by implementing fuzzy methods
    in irrigation (Krishnan et al., 2020, Benyezza et al., 2021). These other methods
    can be easily implemented in the platform’s irrigation recommendation component
    and tested in parallel, given that the appropriate data is accessed by each method.
    Thus, allowing for the evaluation of multiple irrigation strategies based on the
    same soil, weather, and crop data. In order to deploy the suggested system on
    a real farm, it is necessary to assess some points, such as: define the adequate
    hardware and software for the irrigation system, weather station, and soil probe
    that should replace the components used to simulate their behavior; define the
    infrastructure used to deploy the IoT platform components in the cloud or local;
    change the source code of the components developed specific for this work; Change
    the information model used in the FIWARE components; define the simulation model
    in the Plant Simulation to work alongside the platform to simulate possible irrigation
    scenarios. These modifications must be carried out so that the digital representation
    of the farm is as close as possible to the real application. IoT solutions face
    many challenges and concerns including: cost concern such as hardware cost, software
    cost, energy optimization; system concerns such as environmental variations, scalability
    of deployments, simplification of platforms, real-time deployment; data concerns
    such as data reliability, data storage and fault tolerance; device concerns such
    as device standardization, device connectivity, device interoperability and device
    accessibility (Tao et al., 2021). These concerns should also apply when deploying
    the proposed system in a real farm. 7. Conclusion This study presents a real time
    communication of an IoT platform with a simulation software to generate a virtual
    environment for a DT of an irrigation system. It is noticeable that the uses of
    DT in agriculture is in its early stages, but there are multiple benefits of using
    a DT in agriculture (Pylianidis et al., 2021). The benefits of the proposed system
    are twofold: first, evaluate the behavior of the IoT platform and an irrigation
    system before implementing both in the field; enable the evaluation of different
    irrigation strategies in parallel with current farm practices. This work focuses
    mainly on creating an automated pipeline of operations for monitoring and controlling
    an irrigation system, accounting for local system variability since each management
    zone can be irrigated independently. Even thought this study does not use current
    data from a given farm, it is possible to infer that the system can improve water
    usage efficiency by evaluating multiple irrigation strategies with data collected
    from multiple sources such as soil probes, weather stations and irrigation system.
    The results in this work demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of collecting
    those types of data to create daily irrigation prescriptions and evaluate the
    irrigation process to meet those prescriptions. For further research projects,
    it is important to evaluate the IoT platform behavior in a real test field aiming
    to validate the communication between the platform and devices as well as the
    irrigation models used to calculate the irrigation prescriptions. CRediT authorship

  description: The global increase in population necessitates enhanced food security,
    yet current agricultural practices are inadequate in feeding everyone and are
    detrimental to the environment. Consequently, agriculture faces the task of increasing
    production while minimizing resource usage and prioritizing sustainability. To
    assist farmers, new technological tools using AI, Robotics and IoT have been developed
    in a new field called Smart Farming. Unfortunately, these tools are primarily
    employed in unsustainable farming practices, such as mono-cropping. However, sustainable
    methods like Agroecology exist, which involve observing how plants interact with
    their environment to devise crop management strategies that work harmoniously
    with nature, requiring minimal resources and ensuring sustainability. In this
    paper, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT) platform that utilizes an ontology
    and a set of rules to provide farmers with recommendations for optimizing crop
    development while adhering to agroecology principles. This platform employs Knowledge-based
    reasoning to correlate crop requirements with local environmental data obtained
    through a wireless sensor network deployed on the farm. It can suggest crop layouts,
    crop calendars, detect relevant events, and manage irrigation. Our system has
    been tested in a simulated environment and yielded promising results, leaving
    ample room for future improvements and developments.

    refers to a technology or platform that predicts the situations that may occur
    in the reality by creating a virtual world, a digital twin, which is identical
    to the physical world. The basic concept of digital twin emerged in 2002 when
    Dr. Michael Grieves of the University of Michigan used the term “conceptual ideal
    for product lifecycle management” to explain the concept that “the real space
    and the virtual space are connected through the flow of data”. In 2010, NASA used
    digital twins in the space exploration technology roadmap and technology developments,
    thus introducing and spreading this idea in space explorations systems. Later,
    General Electric (GE) combined the various related concepts into one using the
    term “digital twin”. According to the Top Ten Strategic Technology Trends for
    2019 presented by Gartner, “a digital twin refers to the digital representation
    of an entity, process, or system existing in the real world.” The focus was especially
    placed on digital twins in the Internet of Things (IoT) environment, explaining
    that corporate decision-making can be improved by providing information on the
    more effective performance of products, data on new products, and information
    on improved efficiency based on the maintenance and reliability information of
    many things. Recently, the digital twin technology has been introduced in various
    industries and sectors, such as manufacturing, education, shipbuilding, civil
    engineering, and city maintenance and planning, which has spurred the further
    growth of the technology [1,2,3,4]. Digital twin, which works in conjunction with
    a variety of fields and technologies, can be defined in various ways. In fact,
    the following shows that different companies define the digital twin slightly
    differently. General Electric (multinational conglomerate company): “Digital Twin
    is most commonly defined as a software representation of a physical asset, system
    or process designed to detect, prevent, predict, and optimize through real time
    analytics to deliver business value. “ Gartner (global research and advisory firm):
    “A digital twin is a digital representation of a real-world entity or system”
    Wikipedia (digital dictionary): “A digital twin is a virtual representation that
    serves as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process.”
    IBM (computer and cloud company): “A digital twin is a virtual representation
    of an object or system that spans its lifecycle, is updated from real-time data,
    and uses simulation, machine learning and reasoning to help decision-making” Furthermore,
    slightly different definitions are given to a digital twin depending on which
    industrial sector it is applied to. For example, in the smart city sector, a digital
    twin can be defined as an urban management technology that collects data for urban
    problems and provides solutions by reflecting the real-world information in real
    time in a virtual space model that simulates the real space to solve various urban
    problems. In the manufacturing sector, a digital twin is defined as a technology
    that simulates the manufacturing resources of the physical world in a virtual
    space and provides the optimal result by performing various simulations required
    for design, production, and maintenance/repair of products in the virtual space
    linked to the physical world in real-time. Because many industries that need the
    digital twin technology aim for large-scale and optimized production, interoperability
    between production technologies and factories scattered around the world is essentially
    required. Furthermore, as software and machines of various manufacturers are used,
    their compatibility must be also ensured. The standardization of digital twin
    technologies is required to achieve interoperability and compatibility at the
    global level, and many international standardization organizations are working
    on the standardization of digital twins. Because the definition and purpose of
    digital twins vary among industry domains, many international standardization
    organizations are developing the digital twin standards for their areas of interest.
    The standards development organizations (SDOs) that are currently developing standards
    related to digital twins include the European Telecommunications Standards Institute
    (ETSI), Footnote 1 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Footnote 2
    Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), Footnote 3 Industrial Internet Consortium
    (IIC), Footnote 4 International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Footnote
    5 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Footnote 6 oneM2M,
    Footnote 7 Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC), Footnote 8 Plattform Industrie 4.0,
    Footnote 9 and World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). Footnote 10 For example, the Institute
    of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) focuses on smart health, ISO focuses
    on industrial automation, IIC focuses on accelerating the development and adoption
    of IoT technology, and oneM2M develops standards for common service functions
    required by smart factories. This chapter describes the digital twin–related standards
    in ISO/TC 184, ISO/IEEE, IEC, oneM2M, and ETSI’s NGSI-LD among various standards.
    Furthermore, in recent years, some organizations have been operating open-source
    communities in connection with developer ecosystems as well as developing standards,
    and are providing open-source codes along with open standards. Therefore, this
    chapter also examines open-source activities related to digital twins. 2 ISO/TC
    184 (Industrial Data) ISO/TC 184 Industrial Automation Systems and Integration
    Committee establishes international standards for the integration of separate
    parts of manufacturing, that is, various technologies such as industrial automation
    and information system, machinery and equipment, and electronic communication.
    ISO TC 184/SC 4 (industrial data), a subcommittee, establishes international standards
    such as Standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP) used for exchanging
    product information between different industrial automation systems [5]. ISO TC
    184/SC 4 is developing standards for industrial data in general manufacturing
    industry, shipbuilding and marine industry, nuclear power plants, etc. The standards
    for product data and quality quantification are essential resources for supporting
    smart manufacturing, and they can be used for such purposes as interoperability
    between systems, integration of automation systems, inspection and maintenance,
    and distrusted structure and review of smart manufacturing functions. The scope
    of standard development in ISO TC 184/SC 4 includes standards for the following
    industrial data related to products: Geometric design data and tolerance data
    Material and functional specifications Product differentiation and configuration
    Product information catalogs and libraries Process and project data Product production
    data Product life cycle data (product characteristics related to product support,
    maintenance, and disposal) Furthermore, business-related standards have been developed,
    including organization data such as relationships between companies or internal
    departments for supplier identification purposes, personal data for authorization
    and identification, and data related to processes and procedures that assure the
    quality of industrial data. The standards developed and managed by ISO TC 184/SC
    4 include ISO 10303, ISO 15926, ISO 8000, and ISO 23247. ISO 10303 is a standard
    for exchanging design and production data in the manufacturing industry, and ISO
    8000 is a standard for product data quality quantification. ISO 23247 is a standard
    for creating digital twins. So far, a total of 765 standards have been developed
    for the industrial data sector [6]. Next, we examine in depth the standard developed
    by ISO 23247 for the creation of digital twins. 2.1 ISO 23247 As cyber physical
    system (CPS)/digital twin technologies have begun to be applied to manufacturing
    sites, the need for standardization of conceptual models, function reference architecture,
    modeling, information exchange, etc., has been discussed. The digital twin manufacturing
    framework series of ISO (ISO 23247: Digital Twin manufacturing framework) is a
    standard for applying the digital twin technology that represents physical objects,
    including physical assets, processes, and systems, on the computer in manufacturing
    [6]. The four cases of the standard series developed by ISO 23247 are as follows:
    ISO 23247-1 [7], Digital Twin framework for manufacturing – Part 1: Overview and
    general principles (defines the overview, principles, and requirements of digital
    twins for manufacturing) ISO 23247-2 [8], Digital Twin framework for manufacturing
    – Part 2: Reference architecture (defines the reference architecture of digital
    twins for manufacturing) ISO 23247-3 [9], Digital Twin framework for manufacturing
    – Part 3: Digital representation of physical manufacturing elements (defines the
    digital representation method of manufacturing resource information, including
    products, processes, and resources) ISO 23247-4 [10], Digital Twin framework for
    manufacturing – Part 4: Information exchange (defines the method of exchanging
    information on digitally represented twins) In the observable manufacturing sector,
    digital representations include static and dynamic information. Information that
    does not change during the manufacturing process is classified as static information,
    and information that changes during the manufacturing process is classified as
    dynamic information. The key members of the group include Boeing, STEP Tools,
    and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in the United States;
    Airbus and Schneider Electric in France; Sandvik and KTH Royal Institute of Technology
    in Sweden; China National Institute of Standardization (CNIS) in China; and Electronics
    and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) in South Korea. Let us take a
    closer look at the four standards being developed by ISO 23247. 2.2 ISO 23247-1
    SO 23247-1 [7] defines the overview, scope, principles, and requirements of digital
    twins for manufacturing (see Fig. 1). As shown in Fig. 1, the basic concept of
    digital twins for manufacturing can be described as follows: Observable manufacturing
    elements: observable manufacturing elements such as personnel, equipment, materials,
    processes, facilities, environment, products, and relevant documents; Data collection
    and device control: data are collected from manufacturing elements, or manufacturing
    elements are controlled; Digital twin: manufacturing resources, including not
    only the external shape but also attributes such as functions, are represented
    digitally, and the data collection and device control are linked to synchronize
    between the manufacturing elements and the corresponding digital twins in the
    same state; Application of digital twin: real-time control, off-line analytics,
    health check of manufacturing resources, predictive maintenance, etc.; Benefits
    of digital twin: real-time planning based on simulations, validation and manufacturing
    process coordination, risk management based on real-time monitoring and prediction,
    predictive maintenance, cost reduction, etc. For these, ISO 23247-1 defines the
    requirements from the perspectives such as data acquisition from manufacturing
    resources, digital representation of manufacturing resources, data analysis, management,
    synchronization, data storage, and simulation. Furthermore, as requirements for
    digital twin modeling, it defines the fidelity of the model, extensibility that
    supports the integration/addition/enhancement of digital models, interoperability
    with different types of digital models, and a variety of granularity. Fig. 1 Concept

    [8] provides a reference architecture of digital twins for manufacturing, which
    is constructed, as shown in Fig. 2, by expanding the reference structure of IoT,
    a basis of digital twins. Figure 3 shows the reference architecture of digital
    twins for manufacturing from the functional perspective. Fig. 2 Outline of Digital
    Twin reference architecture for manufacturing Full size image Fig. 3 Reference
    architecture of digital twin for manufacturing (functional perspective) Full size
    image The entities of a digital twin and the functional entities (FEs) of the
    entities in the reference architecture of digital twin are defined as follows:
    Observable manufacturing elements (manufacturing resources): characteristic functional
    elements of resources (e.g., drilling) Data collection and device control elements
    (consist of elements for data collection and data control): Elements of a digital
    twin system such as data collection function, data pre-processing function, manufacturing
    resource control function, manufacturing resource operating function, and identification
    function for identifying manufacturing resources (consisting of sub-system elements
    for operation and management, application and service, resource access and exchange)
    A digital modeling function for analyzing the physical characteristic information
    of manufacturing resources, a function for representing real objects as digital
    objects using the analyzed information, a synchronization function for maintaining
    the real objects and the digital twins in the same state, operation and management
    support functions, etc. Data analysis function, application and service support
    function, simulation function, reporting function, etc.: interoperation support
    function, access control function, plug-and-play support function, peer interface
    function for linking with other digital twin system elements, etc. Digital twin
    user elements: user interface function, etc. Cross-system elements: information
    exchange function, a function that ensures the accuracy and integrity of data,
    information protection function, etc. 2.4 ISO 23247-3 ISO 23247-3 [9] defines
    the information for digitally representing manufacturing elements, including products,
    processes, and resources. The information attributes required for this are provided
    in Table 1, but they can be expanded depending on the use case. IEC 62264-2 was
    referenced to compose Table 1. For each manufacturing element, Table 1 can be
    used to define the information attributes. Among these attributes, the definitions
    of information attributes for personnel are provided in Table 2. Table 1 Information
    attributes for manufacturing elements Full size table Table 2 Information Model
    Full size table 2.5 ISO 23247-4 ISO 23247-4 [10] defines a method for exchanging
    information in a digital twin. The interface for information exchange is defined
    using the following four entities in the reference architecture of the digital
    twin of ISO 23237-2, as shown in Fig. 4: user entity, core entity, inner interface,
    and data collection and device control entity. The requirements for these entities
    are described as follows: User network (user entity - core entity) Visualization
    function for showing the manufacturing resources in digital forms to the user
    Data exchange provided in a standardized method Transaction function, including
    PULL, PUSH, and PUBLISH Information protection function, etc. Service network
    (inner interface of core entity) Information exchange function related to the
    digital twin service provided by the core entity, such as situation reproduction,
    monitoring, and simulation Digital representation for manufacturing elements defined
    in ISO 23247-3, etc. Access network (core entity - data collection and device
    control entity) Connection support and real-time communication functions for communication
    with manufacturing elements Standardized method of data exchange Manufacturing
    element identification function Manufacturing element control information and
    synchronization information delivery function Transaction function, including
    PULL, PUSH, and PUBLISH Function for maintaining the connection with the digital
    twin when the network location of DCDCE changes Information protection function,
    etc. Proximity network (data collection and device control entity - observable
    manufacturing element) Connection support function through a local network, such
    as industrial Ethernet Functions for supporting data pre-processing and protocol
    conversion, etc. Fig. 4 Networking view of Digital Twin reference architecture
    for manufacturing Full size image 3 ISO/IEEE for Smart Health The ISO/IEEE 11073
    standards were jointly developed as part of a cooperation between the International
    Standardization Organization (ISO) and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
    Engineering Standard Association (IEEE-SA). For reference, ISO is an independent
    non-governmental international organization with members from 165 national standards
    organizations. Market-related international standards are developed based on voluntary
    participation and consensus, whereby experts share knowledge, support innovations,
    and provide solutions to global challenges. IEEE-SA is an organization responsible
    for the development and certification of global technical standards within IEEE.
    IEEE-SA develops and supports projects related to standards and test certifications
    for a variety of fields, including IoT technologies. In particular, IEEE-SA endeavors
    to lead the global standards through various technical standards and global cooperation
    for IoT, 5G, edge computing, etc., which are attracting attention as major technologies
    that will lead the Fourth Industrial Revolution. In this section, we will examine
    ISO/IEEE 11073, the standards related to the digital twin standard technology
    of smart health developed jointly by ISO and IEEE [11, 12]. 3.1 ISO/IEEE 11073
    ISO/IEEE 11073 Personal Health Device (PHD) standards were introduced in 2008
    to facilitate communication between personal health devices, such as computer
    systems and smartphones, and administrators. ISO/IEEE 11073 aims to provide real-time
    interoperability of plug-and-play and, at the same time, promote the exchange
    of status data. The 11073 standards provide standardized solutions for personal
    health systems adopted by both the research communities and industry. Recently,
    as the interest and utilization of smart health and wearable devices have increased,
    the number of research and utilization cases using the 11073-standardization system
    has also been increasing. For example, health-related systems in smart homes can
    be developed using the ISO/IEEE 11073 standards. These health-related systems
    can provide functions for detecting a person’s movement and injury due to a fall,
    remote monitoring of user’s health parameters, etc. [13,14,15]. Table 3 lists
    some of the documents for the smart health–related standards developed by the
    ISO 11073. Table 3 Smart Health–related Standards Developed Jointly by ISO and
    IEEE Full size table 3.2 Healthcare Systems Based on ISO/IEEE 11073 Standards
    for Digital Twins The explosive increase of wearable technology and the availability
    of personal health devices show the potential for providing digital twin-based
    healthcare services in the near future. The standards-based interoperability between
    healthcare devices and systems may expand efficient healthcare services and reduce
    the technical complexity of various healthcare devices. The ISO/IEEE 11073 standards
    can meet these requirements. 11073 Standards-Based Personal Health Devices Pulse
    oximeters developed according to the 11073 standards can be used for well-being
    in mobile Android-based systems. 11073-based blood pressure monitoring devices
    can be used to monitor elderly people who are vulnerable to diseases at home.
    Furthermore, the 11073 standards may be used to build various healthcare devices,
    such as weighing scales, blood glucose meters, body temperature sensors, electrocardiogram
    (ECG) monitors, thermometers, and shoe soles, that can monitor human bodies to
    construct digital patients that represent real patents. 11073 Standards Used in
    Healthcare Systems The 11073 standards can be applied not only to personal devices
    used to digitize human body information, but also to design healthcare systems
    that can use it in medical treatment through cloud systems. For example, digital
    twin health systems developed by the 11073 standards can be designed to use a
    variety of medical content obtained through the mobile phones of patients. This
    information can help identify the patient’s profile and determine the patient’s
    symptoms that are difficult to check with the naked eye. If the information of
    patients is digitized in the 11073 standards-based digital twin healthcare systems,
    the physicians can select the best treatment by checking the information of “digital
    patient” most similar to their respective patients and easily perform simulations
    in advance to predict which treatments will be effective and which ones should
    be avoided. In other words, the medical digital twin technology helps physicians
    and patients respond quickly to diseases. Furthermore, a variety of data compatible
    with the standards can be integrated and used on a digital twin platform to select
    data-based treatment methods, through which effective treatments can be facilitated.
    In conventional treatment methods, the symptoms of a patient are partially determined,
    based on which diagnosis and treatment are performed. This makes it difficult
    to comprehensively identify the patient’s detailed health conditions and relatively
    less pronounced symptoms, which are difficult to observe with the naked eye. Therefore,
    in the case of diseases that have small precursor symptoms, such as heart failure,
    it is difficult to identify the symptoms in advance and take appropriate actions.
    In the case of “digital patient” based on the data of a digital twin–based healthcare
    platform, both the body conditions and small parts of symptoms can be integrated
    and checked, enabling accurate diagnosis in the virtual world. In particular,
    through the virtual body of the “digital patient”, which can be constructed using
    11,073-based digital healthcare devices, physicians can diagnose abnormalities
    of the body quickly and predict and provide appropriate treatments in advance
    through the digital data by comprehensively identifying kidney function problems,
    heart size, irregular heart rate, changes in blood sugar level, etc., which are
    difficult to check with the naked eye. 4 IEC TC65 IEC TC65 has established many
    standards related to industrial automation over the past 20 years and is known
    as an organization that plays a vital role in the development of smart manufacturing
    standards. IEC TC65 is developing standards related to industrial process measurement,
    control, and automation, with an interest in standardizing elemental technologies
    for the implementation of smart factories, as well as standards for process control
    devices, process control valves, etc. [16]. IEC TC65 noted the Reference Architectural
    Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0) [17], a national Industry 4.0 standard of Germany,
    which was developed as a reference model of smart manufacturing in Germany. In
    the process of standardizing numerous standards related to smart manufacturing,
    deficient parts were discovered, and a reference model, RAMI 4.0, was developed
    to standardize them in a new way. As shown in Fig. 5, RAMI 4.0 has a box-shaped
    structure with three axes representing three perspectives that are essentially
    required in the Industry 4.0. Fig. 5 RAMI 4.0 layered architecture Full size image
    IEC TC 65 and ISO’s TC 184 (Automation Systems and Integration) have formed a
    Joint Working Group (JWG21) to develop Industry 4.0 standards, and the JWG21 established
    the RAMI 4.0 as a major reference model of Industry 4.0 and an international standard
    [18]. The RAMI 4.0 was successfully established in 2017 as a standard in the IEC
    PAS 63088, and research on analysis and application is underway in the US, Japan,
    China, among other countries. IEC TC 65 comprises four standardization steering
    committees (SCs) and multiple working groups (WGs) for the development of standards.
    The following describes the standards developed by the IEC TC 65’s SCs: SC65A:
    standards for industrial process measurement and control systems SC65B: standards
    for industrial process measurement and control devices SC65C: standards for digital
    data communication for industrial process measurement and control SC65E: standards
    for digital representation of characteristic functions, methods, and application
    programs of devices The following describes the standards being developed by the
    WGs related to digital twins among the WGs of IEC TC 65: WG10: IEC 62443 Part
    1–4 standards based on the United States ISA99 standards for security in the manufacturing
    sector WG16: IEC62832 standards for construing virtual production systems WG17:
    technical standards related to system interfaces between industrial facilities
    and smart grids Furthermore, IEC TC65 establishes technical standards to ensure
    interoperability between smart factory components. The major standards include
    OPC-UA, IEC 62443, and IEC 62832. IEC TC65 operates ad-hoc groups. In particular,
    an ad-hoc group, AHG 3, and its four working groups have been formed for smart
    manufacturing terminology, use cases, standards status, and smart manufacturing
    coordination, and are discussing the concept and architecture of smart manufacturing.
    AHG 3 (Smart Manufacturing Framework and System Architecture) standardizes the
    reference framework and system architecture for smart manufacturing, collects/defines
    representative cases of smart manufacturing, derives smart manufacturing requirements,
    and discusses the analysis results for the methods that use the standards in various
    stages of the life cycle. The following shows the roles of four WGs operated by
    AHG 3: AHG 3 TF: Smart Manufacturing Coordination. It reviews and coordinates
    current issues within the IEC TC65 and among the external standardization groups
    related to smart manufacturing, such as ISO AHG 3 TF: Smart Manufacturing Terms
    and Definitions. Typical and essential terms and definitions related to smart
    manufacturing in the smart manufacturing sector for additional development of
    IEC TC65 standards AHG 3 TF: Use Cases. Compiles typical and required use cases
    in the smart manufacturing domain for additional development of IEC TC 65 standards
    AHG 3 TF: Standards Landscape. It will be operated until the JWG 21 is actively
    used, and it aims to integrate and improve the standards status information as
    one. Other major standards that have been developed by the IEC TC 65 are as follows:
    Related to functional safety and functional safety network: IEC 61508 (standards
    for functional safety) [19], ISO 26262 (standards that compiled the safety standards
    for vehicles based on IEC 61508) [20] Related to high availability network: IEC
    62439 (standards for high availability of a network) [21] Related to real-time
    networks: IEC 61158 (standards for real-time communication) OPC UA (OLE for process
    control unified architecture specification) standards: OPC is a standard interface
    that enables various applications to send and receive data from various types
    of process control equipment (DCS, PLC, etc.) Digital factory (IEC 62832) standards:
    These allow a factory’s physical production system to be built by simulating it
    as a virtual production system in the information system, and deal with technologies
    used for various purposes, such as preliminary analysis of physical production
    system, analysis of problems during production, and post-analysis of improvement.
    Real-time automation networks, commonly referred to as Fieldbus, are used in the
    industrial environment, and IEC TC65/SC65C develops the following network standards
    for these: Industrial communication standard technologies are developed by dividing
    them into real-time (MT9, IEC 61158), profile (MT9, IEC 61784-2), functional safety
    communication (WG12, IEC 61784-3), and high-availability communication (WG15,
    IEC 62439) fields Initially, IEC TC65/SC65C tried to integrate them in a single
    Fieldbus technology, but considering various factory environments, Fieldbus and
    real-time industrial Ethernet standards are defined by region and company 5 oneM2M
    IoT platform is an essential element of the digital twin technology that implements
    the physical objects and data existing in the real world identically in the virtual
    world. The data collected from machines or sensors in the major domains of digital
    twins, such as smart manufacturing, smart factory, smart city, and smart health,
    are managed and stored through IoT platforms. Particularly, a standard-based IoT
    platform is one of the most basic elements for successful digital twins in the
    environment, where devices produced by different manufacturers are interconnected.
    oneM2M [22] is an international standardization organization founded to provide
    the fragmented IoT market as horizontal services of global units, and it develops
    standards for common functions of IoT service layer platforms. It was co-founded
    by eight SDOs around the world: ETSI in Europe, TTA in South Korea, TIA and ATIS
    in the US, CCSA in China, ARIB/TTC in Japan, and TSDSI in India. About 200 member
    companies around the world, including telecommunication companies, equipment manufacturers,
    and service companies, are actively involved, along with the eight Partner Type
    1 SDOs. Since the first meeting in August 2012, they have been developing standards
    for the basic functions of IoT platforms, the interworking function between the
    IoT protocols and other sectors’ communication protocol standards, management
    functions for data and things, etc. In the case of oneM2M Release 3, Footnote
    11 standards were developed for interoperability between the oneM2M platforms
    and the OSGi, OPC-UA, Modbus, and Web of Things technologies used in various industrial
    domains; edge computing that supports real-time mission-oriented services; and
    testing and certification. The industrial protocols that provide interoperability
    in oneM2M are also standards used in digital twins. Furthermore, the values of
    data produced from devices that operate in the real world using various protocols
    can be accurately displayed in the virtual space provided by the digital twins.
    Therefore, this section examines the interoperability with various industrial
    protocols developed by oneM2M. Proximal IoT Interoperability oneM2M develops standards
    for methods of interworking with devices, which were developed by various network
    protocols due to the characteristics of the platform that supports the RESTful
    architecture, to a oneM2M platform and converting them into resources. For example,
    if Z-Wave and Zigbee devices used in a smart manufacturing digital twin exist,
    oneM2M provides the resources and APIs that represent those devices in the oneM2M
    platform to facilitate the use of the data collected from those devices and enable
    the control when necessary. The proximity IoT interoperability technology defines
    not only the method of using non-oneM2M devices and services in the oneM2M systems
    but also the method of using oneM2M devices and services in non-oneM2M devices.
    Based on this, the digital twin services and applications can manage the data
    of various sensors and devices, obtain the location information, and use real-time
    updated information through the oneM2M platform. 3GPP Rel-13/14 Network Interoperability
    In digital twins, a network is an important medium that connects the real world
    and the virtual world. Particularly, in the case of digital twins for things with
    mobility, a mobile communication network such as 3GPP should be used. The 3GPP
    network interoperability function provided by oneM2M has been continually updated
    after its development early during the development of oneM2M standards. oneM2M
    Release 2 defined the device triggering and network traffic configuration functions
    that interwork with 3GPP Rel-12. In Rel-3, standards were developed for additional
    functions that control mobile communication devices used in various digital twins,
    such as device triggering recall, UE monitoring, background data transfer, and
    node schedule management. Interoperability with a Variety of Industrial Domain
    Technologies The industrial sectors closely related to digital twins have requirements
    that are stricter than those of other domains (e.g., smart home and smart office).
    For example, requirements such as error handling, assurance of real-time characteristics,
    and time data processing must be included in the smart services needed in industries
    such as smart factories, smart vehicles, and energy management. Therefore, the
    industries developed the services using network protocols suitable for the relevant
    existing domains. Zigbee, Modbus, and Data Distribution Service (DDS) are popular
    network protocols widely used in the industries. oneM2M provides a binding function
    to interwork with devices that use such separate standard protocols and device
    platforms. Furthermore, the compatibility is provided by having a data conversion
    table that allows conversion between the pertinent protocol and oneM2M message
    at a proxy node located in the middle. As a side note, oneM2M provides oneM2M
    primitive, a standard message format that defines all actions. Here, for the major
    protocols, such as HTTP, CoAP, and MQTT, the binding is supported by defining
    how the oneM2M primitive is matched to the message format of the pertinent protocol.
    6 ETSI NGSI-LD ETSI’s Industry Specification Group (ISG) for cross-cutting Context
    Information Management (CIM) Footnote 12 has developed the NGSI-LD API (GS CIM
    004 and GS CIM 009). The main objective of ISG CIM is to create technical specifications
    and reports to enable multiple organizations to develop interoperable software
    implementations of a cross-cutting Context Information Management (CIM) Layer.
    The standards work is designed to bridge the gap between abstract standards and
    concrete implementations [23]. The ISG CIM has developed an API called NGSI-LD
    Footnote 13 to enable applications to update, manage, and access context information
    from many different sources, as well as publishing that information through interoperable
    data publication platforms. It provides advanced geo-temporal queries, and it
    includes subscription mechanisms, in order for content consumers to be notified
    when content matching some constraints becomes available. The API is designed
    to be agnostic to the architecture (central, distributed, federated or combinations
    thereof) of the applications which share information. NGSI-LD uses Linked Data
    paradigm to represent information in a property graph made up of nodes (vertices)
    connected by directed links, where nodes and arcs both may have multiple optional
    attached properties (i.e. attributes). It allows defining a cross-domain information
    model through which allows ingesting and exchanging information across heterogeneous
    domain specific models. In 2020, ETSI ISG CIM has initiated a work item aimed
    at identifying the various (historical) definitions and types and characteristics
    of Digital Twins (e.g. in areas of representing human actions, in health/biological
    areas, for smart manufacturing, etc) to consider the usage of the NGSI-LD information
    model and API for realising such systems. The document shows to what extent various
    Digital Twin types can be realized or facilitated by NGSI-LD and identify new
    features for NGSI-LD which would make it more useful for such areas of usage.
    It advocates the use of NGSI-LD property graphs as holistic digital twins, maintaining
    multi-level and multi-scale descriptions of complete IoT/CPS environments, such
    as cities, buildings or factories. The nodes of the proposed multilevel graph
    stand for connected devices and non-connected things, physical entities and systems
    of all kinds that make up these environments, at different scales. The arcs of
    the graph represent relationships between these entities, which capture the physical
    structure of a system. They can capture top-down and bottom-up system composition
    relationships, or transversal connectors (like cables, pipes, etc.) in a distributed
    network-like system. A further level of description captures distributed or loosely-coupled
    “systems of systems” as “graphs of graphs”, i.e. graphs, whose “hypernodes” encapsulate
    other graphs). The NGSI-LD specification is one of the few in use within the open-source
    ecosystem for Digital Twins. 7 Open-Source Activities Digital twin–related organizations
    such as IIC, Platform Industrie 4.0, and Open Industry 4.0 Alliance are striving
    to create digital twin ecosystems through the open-source and promotional activities
    of digital twins, as well as the development of standards. These digital twin–related
    open-source activities include the Open Manufacturing Platform Footnote 14(OMP),
    Digital Twin Consortium (DTC), Footnote 15 Smart Manufacturing Innovation Institute
    (CESMII), Footnote 16 and Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA). Footnote
    17 Recently, these open-source communities have been developing not only open-source
    codes but also relevant open-source standard specifications. In other words, various
    problems identified in the development processes or new functions are reflected
    in the documents of the standards for the pertinent open-sources, and the new
    functions reflected in the open-source standards are applied to the open sources
    to accelerate the commercialization. This way, the ecosystems are created. This
    section examines these digital twin–related open-source organizations and their
    activities. Open Manufacturing Platform (OMP) OMP is a project of the Joint Development
    Foundation of Linux Foundation established by Microsoft and BMW in 2019. In the
    manufacturing platform sector, it is the only initiative set up as an open-source
    project from the beginning, and the goal is to “accelerate innovation of industrial
    IoT to shorten time-to-value”. The OMP aims at both disclosing best practices
    and encouraging open-code development. Open industrial IoT is an open manufacturing
    process platform and was created based Microsoft Azure Industrial IoT Cloud Platform.
    It provides the community members with industrial standards, common data models,
    and reference architectures that have open-source components based on open data
    models and open manufacturing standards. It is designed to eliminate complex and
    proprietary manufacturing processes to support the acceleration of innovation
    at scale through access to new technologies, as well as inter-industry collaboration
    and knowledge- and data-sharing of companies. Furthermore, the standardization
    can be achieved beyond the data models managed by conventional propriety systems
    by allowing machines to learn on their own, which is expected to contribute to
    solving problems at various manufacturing sites through time reduction of the
    manufacturing process, and improvement of production efficiency. The manufacturing
    sector has been especially focusing on the development of digital twins. Automation
    and robotic systems are widely used in production lines, and many factories have
    adopted IoT technology and used digital information to optimize production performance.
    The OMP does not only focus on digital twin technology but also contributes to
    the WG of semantic data architecture. This WG deals with “the need to share, combine,
    and reuse heterogeneous data in the manufacturing sector by providing common semantics
    to various stakeholders through comprehensive semantic data homogenization and
    delivering manufacturing data along with contextual information”. The OMP’s WG
    is developing semantic data models to help understand IoT connections and machine
    data and help explain the relationships and dependencies of machine data. Such
    a semantic data architecture ensures improvement of the total value chain and
    enables AI-based business models on a large scale. Digital twins are primarily
    based on the sensor IoT data collected from actual physical systems. The OMP technology
    based on the industrial IoT data management is also used to synchronize interoperable
    digital twins through a cloud-based approach for data collection and data integration.
    The OMP GitHub repository that provides public publications, specifications, and
    source codes is: https://github.com/OpenManufacturingPlatform Microsoft Digital
    Twin Description Language (DTDL) Microsoft is proposing a Digital Twin Description
    Language Footnote 18 (DTDL) based on JSON-LD which is programming-language independent.
    DTDL is made up of a set of metamodel classes that are used to define the behavior
    of all digital twins (including devices). There are six metamodel classes that
    describe these behaviors: Interface, Telemetry, Property, Command, Relationship,
    and Component. In addition, DTDL provides a data description language that is
    compatible with many popular serialization formats, including JSON and binary
    serialization formats. DTDL provides semantic type annotations of behaviors, so
    that analytics, machine learning, UIs, and other computation can reason about
    the semantics of the data, not just the schema of the data. In cooperation with
    Open and Agile Smart Cities (OASC), a mapping of DTLD to ETSI NGSI-LD has been
    made for the smart city context. It allows consumption of Digital Twin data though
    the ETSI standardized interface. This is illustrated though use cases relevant
    to cities given such as air quality monitoring, understanding the noise level
    in a district, the crowd flow in a road segment, traffic flow in a road segment,
    monitoring on-street parking in parking spots, availability of EV-Charging, or
    monitoring streetlights and reducing energy consumption. Digital Twin Consortium
    (DTC) The Digital Twin Consortium (DTC) launched in May 2020 is an organization
    co-founded by Microsoft, one of the world’s leading digital twin solution companies,
    in cooperation with other companies, including Dell, ANSYS, and Lendlease, based
    on open partnerships. The DTC was established under the Object Management Group
    (OMG), a standards organization that supports the development of open standards.
    Although the DTC is not a standards organization, it provides guidelines for managing
    inconsistent developments of the digital twin–related markets, interoperability
    problems, and difficulties arising when implementing digital twins in industrial
    and commercial environments. DTC industry working groups focus on the vertically
    divided market, and currently, they consist of Manufacturing, Infrastructure,
    Healthcare & Life Science, Aviation & Defense, and Natural Resource groups. The
    DTC’s Horizontal working group includes the focus areas of marketing & technology,
    terminology, and taxonomy (3T). The 3T working group has additional sub-groups
    that focus on open source and platform stack, as well as security and trustworthiness.
    The main focuses of the DTC are the life cycle of digital twins and various requirements
    of digital twins evolving through this process. The life cycle of digital twins
    includes digital threads and the physical entities or assets that they support.
    To accelerate the adoption and application of digital twin technologies by suppliers
    and final users, the DTC provides an open-source repository where they can contribute
    various elements. The contributions of the open-source community include open-source
    code implementations, guide and tutorial development collaboration documents,
    open-source models, and other assets that are valuable to the digital twin community.
    By maintaining the openness between industry-focused groups of different industries,
    the DTC provides an opportunity to collaborate on architecture, tools, and open-source
    contributions among different industries. FIWARE FIWARE was created with the ultimate
    goal of creating an open sustainable ecosystem around public, royalty-free and
    implementation-driven software platform standards easing the development of smart
    solutions and supporting organizations in their transition into smart organizations.
    From a technical perspective, FIWARE brings a curated framework of Open-Source
    software components which can be assembled together and combined with other third-party
    platform components to build platforms easing the development of smart solutions
    and smart organizations in multiple application domains: cities, manufacturing,
    utilities, agri-food, etc. FIWARE is among the founding member of ETSI ISG-CIM
    and uses NGSI-LD as a main interoperability interface across its components. FIWARE
    is a member of the Digital Twin Consortium and any software architecture “powered
    by FIWARE” gravitates around management of a Digital Twin data representation
    of the real world. It also shares with ETSI a working group on Digital Twins aimed
    at supporting implementation driven evolutions of the NGSI-LD specification for
    Digital Twins. This Digital Twin data representation is built based on information
    gathered from many different sources, including sensors, cameras, information
    systems, social networks, end users through mobile devices, etc. Footnote 19 It
    is constantly maintained and accessible in near real-time (“right-time” is the
    term also often used, reflecting that the interval between the instants of time
    at which some data is gathered and made accessible is enough short to allow a
    proper reaction). Applications constantly process and analyze this data (not only
    current values but also history generated over time) in order to automate certain
    tasks or bring support to smart decisions by end users. The collection of all
    Digital Twins modelling the real world that is managed is also referred to as
    Context and the data associated with attributes of Digital Twins is also referred
    to as context information. In FIWARE, a Digital Twin is an entity which digitally
    represents a real-world physical asset (e.g. a bus in a city, a milling machine
    in a factory) or a concept (e.g., a weather forecast, a product order). Each Digital
    Twin: is universally identified with a URI (Universal Resource Identifier), belongs
    to a well-known type (e.g., the Bus type, of the Room type) also universally identified
    by a URI, and is characterized by several attributes which in turn are classified
    as: properties holding data (e.g., the “current speed” of a Bus, or “max temperature”
    in a Room) or relationships, each holding a URI identifying another Digital Twin
    entity the given entity is linked to (e.g., the concrete Building where a concrete
    Room is located). Eclipse Ditto Eclipse Ditto is an open-source software solution
    for designing a software pattern of “digital twins” in the form of IoT development
    pattern. Eclipse Ditto builds connection points between IoT devices and digital
    twins. Eclipse Ditto provides various APIs for interaction with IoT devices. Examples
    include WebSocket and HTTP API. Recently, connection functions with other systems
    based on MQTT, AMQP, and Apache Kafka have been added. Ditto supports the following
    three: Device-as-a-service: A digital twin system must support interaction with
    heterogeneous IoT devices, various protocols, and communication patterns. Status
    management for digital twins: The status related to the attributes and setting
    information of IoT devices that compose the digital twin should be managed. The
    status of the digital twin includes the recent transmission information, desired
    attribute values of the target device, and current status. Organize your set of
    digital twins: There are interactions among many devices in digital twins. To
    find and control these devices again in the future, metadata, such as manufacturer,
    model number, and serial number, are added to the basic information of the devices
    and managed. Bosch IoT Things is an example of commercial products based on Eclipse
    Ditto (GitHub webpage: https://github.com/eclipse/ditto). Bosch IoT Things is
    a fully managed cloud service equipped with the open-source core of the Eclipse
    Ditto project. The Things service is a part of the Bosch IoT Suite portfolio and
    supports applications to manage digital twins of IoT devices. Ditto is especially
    useful in large IoT environments. In these environments, other important aspects
    of IoT solutions, such as device communication and data analysis, can be addressed
    by individual components of Ditto. Figure 6 shows the architectural configuration
    of IoT solutions that include functions provided by Ditto. Fig. 6 Ditto Digital
    Twin architecture Full size image ITwin.js Footnote 20 An iModel is a specialized
    information container for exchanging data associated with the lifecycle of infrastructure
    assets. iModels are self-describing, geometrically precise, open, portable, and
    secure. iModels were created to facilitate the sharing and distribution of information
    regardless of the source and format of the information. iModels encapsulate component
    information, including business properties, geometry, graphics, and relationships
    in a format that is open, providing standard interfaces for business, engineering,
    construction, and operations applications from multiple vendors. iModels are an
    essential part of the digital twin world. But a digital twin means a lot more
    than just an iModel. A digital twin means a vast ocean of federated data sources,
    one of which will be an iModel. The iTwin.js open-source library provides a comprehensive
    set of APIs that can be used anywhere an iModel may be relevant. It is designed
    to be modular and extensible, with the expectation that iTwin.js will be used
    in environments with many other JavaScript frameworks. iTwin.js strives to be
    as consistent as possible with established JavaScript conventions. Industrial
    Digital Twin Association (IDTA) Industrial Digital Twin Association (IDTA) was
    founded in September 2020 by Verband Deutschen-und Anlagenbau (VDMA, the largest
    association in the mechanical engineering industry in Europe), Zentralverband
    Electronik-und Electronik Industries (ZVEI, an association of electric and electronic
    product manufacturers in Germany), Bitkom (a digital association in Germany),
    and 20 companies, including ABB, Asentics, Bitkom, Bosch, Bosch Rexroth, Danfoss,
    Endress Hauser, Festo, Homag, KUKA, Lenze, Pepperl Fuchs, Phoenix Contact, SAP,
    Schneider Electric, Schunk, Siemens, Trumpf, Turck, Volkswagen, and Wittenstein.
    The goal of the IDTA is to take digital twins to the next level, prepare companies
    using open-source development models, and provide a one-stop-shop for industrial
    digital twins, which is known as Asset Administration Shell (AAS) in Industrie
    4.0. Ultimately, it focuses on five areas to enable customers to operate the platform
    more efficiently: open technology, integration, quality management, training,
    and marketing. Let us take a closer look at these five areas. In the case of open
    technology, the specifications needed to implement digital twins are provided,
    and an active open-source community is built to get started with AAS technology.
    In integration, long-term plans of harmonious sub-models for digital twins are
    established, and sub-models from the manufacturing and process industries are
    integrated. In quality management, a pre-competitive training curriculum is developed,
    and existing know-how for overall management and experts is secured. In training,
    a pre-competitive training curriculum is also developed, and existing know-how
    is provided in a way suitable for the target group. Finally, in marketing, AAS
    is disseminated as the core technology of digital twins, and international visibility
    of IDTA and the digital twin is ensured. The existing open-source activities of
    AAS are supported under the IDTA, and it is one of IDTA’s important goals to build
    an open-source community based on these activities. The open-source projects that
    have implemented AAS are as follows: admin-shell-io (https://github.com/admin-shell-io):
    This project hosts a viewer/editor for AAS (AASX Package Explorer), AAS server,
    AAS specifications and schema (aas-specs), training screencast, and frequently
    asked questions (FAQ). BaSyx (https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.basyx):
    This projects SDK or AAS in addition to other modules. PyI40AAS (https://git.rwth-aachen.de/acplt/pyi40aas):
    This project hosts Python modules for manipulating and validating AAS. SAP AAS
    Service (https://github.com/SAP/i40-aas): This project hosts systems based on
    Docker images that implement the reference architecture of RAMI 4.0, including
    AAS. NOVAAS (https://gitlab.com/gidouninova/novaas): This project implements the
    concept of AAS using JavaScript and a Low-code Development Platform (LCDP), Node-Red.
    GAIA-X GAIA-X announced the project plans in the fall of 2019 and was officially
    established in 2020. Led by Germany, GAIA-X was presented as a key execution strategy
    in the EU data strategy presented in February 2020, with the goal of applying
    it not only in Germany but also throughout Europe. It is believed that a high
    level of interoperability and reliability can be ensured by identifying and developing
    common requirements of the European data infrastructures, and based on this, the
    use of data can be maximized and data ecosystems can be built for companies. There
    are seven basic principles of GAIA-X (see Fig. 7): European data protection, openness,
    trust, digital sovereignty, data value creation, interoperability, and user-friendliness.
    Fig. 7 GAIA-X use case Full size image GAIA-X provides the infrastructure needed
    for the integration of data space, ensures secure data exchange, and facilitates
    seamless use of data in different domains. Particularly, the use of the digital
    twin in the health sector is specified as one of the use cases. In conventional
    systems, it is difficult to collect patient data because each hospital uses a
    distributed database. Furthermore, even if the data have been collected, the data
    analysis is time-consuming because the data have different formats and attributes.
    However, digital twins are constructed using an infrastructure defined by GAIA-X,
    and a patient’s information is managed as an object in the virtual environment.
    As a result, data are easily collected to manage patients, and pharmaceutical
    companies and medical technology and manufacturing companies can receive analysis
    on the effectiveness of their products. CESMII Clean Energy and Smart Manufacturing
    Innovation Institute (CESMII), a non-profit organization supported by the U.S.
    government, was founded in 2016 for the advancement of smart manufacturing. CESMII
    has been branded as a research institute of clean energy, smart manufacturing,
    and innovation, with the goal of driving digital innovation to increase performance
    and quality, reduce costs, and save energy. CESMII is engaged in various activities
    to implement interoperability, such as collaboration, standardization, and open-source
    activities to increase the innovative business value of manufacturers. CESMII
    has implemented the Smart Manufacturing Innovation Platform (SMIP) to support
    interoperability between small and medium-sized enterprises and large manufacturers.
    This platform supports data collection, data contextualization, data management,
    and data integration, and through the marketplace, it supports the smooth interoperability
    of manufacturing-oriented technologies, including detection, control, modeling,
    and analysis, irrespective of suppliers. The core technology that enables the
    interoperability of SMIP lies in SM Profile. By adopting or replicating the SM
    Profiles technology, suppliers can provide products and services to various customers
    through the CESMII SM marketplace. The digital twin plays an important role in
    the SM Profile. The digital twin supports virtual models of actual products, processes,
    or services, which can monitor, analyze, and improve the platform’s performance.
    Furthermore, it is being developed for a variety of uses, including comparable
    3D software, to track parameters required in the SM Profile and process and visualize
    data collected from sensor and manufacturing models. The goal of SM Profile is
    to provide open data models through a globally hosted cloud database. These data
    models can be used to implement digital twins, and code samples for APIs are provided
    as open-source through the CESMII GitHub (https://github.com/cesmii) so that anyone
    can use them (Fig. 8). Fig. 8 CESMII SM Profile Full size image 8 Best Practices
    Around the World (Table 4) In this section, various cases around the world applying
    the digital twin technology are examined. Table 4 Summary of digital twin technology
    application cases Full size table 8.1 General Electric (Fig. 9) General Electronics
    (GE) has built a remarkable factory to implement the “20/20 Vision” that aims
    to improve 20% efficiency in the product development cycle and 20% efficiency
    in the manufacturing/supply network, with the goal of establishing more than 500
    smart factories around the world. It is a high-tech manufacturing concept for
    improving productivity by utilizing the latest technologies of the Fourth Industrial
    Revolution in various fields, such as aviation, railways, petrochemicals, and
    healthcare. A cloud platform called Predix Footnote 21was developed to integrate
    all software and facilities of the GE Group with industrial Internet [24, 25].
    Applications are built and GE’s digital twins are implemented for efficient management
    of facilities, spanning from the hardware used for controlling to a variety of
    software that can collect and analyze data). Fig. 9 GE Predix IoT platform architecture
    Full size image Predix is mainly linked with major applications for machine/equipment
    status, reliability management, maintenance and repair optimization, etc. The
    GE Power’s Monitoring and Diagnostics (M&D) Center at the world-top class level
    performs real-time monitoring of 5000 gas turbines, generators, and other equipment
    installed in about 900 power plants, which supply power to 350 million people
    in about 60 countries around the world. In 2017, an engineer found a turbine bearing
    before it failed as a result of requesting an on-site regular inspection after
    detecting an abnormality in the process of monitoring 200 billion data that are
    sent from 1 million sensors to the cloud and edge computers every day. Through
    the detection of abnormalities in advance, the loss of about US$2 million was
    prevented. Particularly, the predictive power was enhanced by applying the asset
    performance management solution that notifies advance warnings to managers as
    early as possible for problems that might occur due to service disconnection.
    8.2 DHL & Tetra Pak In August 2019, DHL and a Swedish paper container manufacturer,
    Tetra Pak, jointly established a digital twin technology–applied warehouse in
    Singapore. The Singapore warehouse was one of the largest warehouses of Tetra
    Pak in the world and the first warehouse implemented using digital twin technology
    by DHL in the Asia-Pacific region [26]. Tetra Pak adopted an IoT-based digital
    twin warehouse and constructed a system that monitors relevant information in
    real time (see Fig. 10). The digital twin warehouse enabled Tetra Pak to predict
    field situations and respond immediately, facilitating optimal decision-making.
    As a result, abnormal or peculiar situations in restricted areas were identified
    automatically, and the product storage security was strengthened. The temperature
    sensors were linked to the Internet, and the temperature management efficiency
    in the cold chain logistics was improved. Particularly, it was expected that the
    operational efficiency would increase by about 16% if the logistics equipment–related
    information is identified in real time, and appropriate decision is made for each
    piece of equipment. Until now, the warehouses were not easy to control optimally
    because the dependency on manual work was high and data were not systemized. However,
    this problem can be solved using the digital twin, and the warehouses incorporating
    related technologies can significantly improve corporate competitiveness. Fig.
    10 Smart warehouse from DHL & Tetra Pak. (Source: DHL) Full size image 8.3 Virtual
    Terminal In South Korea, a high-efficiency port that minimizes human intervention
    was developed using the digital twin technology. Virtual Terminal provides a real-time
    monitoring and control system for the port container terminal. It is an example
    of a digital twin application case in the logistics sector, which was led by a
    South Korean company, Rockwon IT, and it received a New Software Grand Award from
    the Ministry of Science and ICT in 2016. Virtual Terminal is a port control monitoring
    system that provides real-time visualization of the location and status information
    for a variety of equipment and vehicles on a 3D geographic information system
    (GIS) map. Virtual Terminal is a somewhat unique system that combines a 3D terminal
    and a CCTV solution to display the on-site situation in the port on the 3D screen
    and CCTV screens simultaneously. It aims for an automated port terminal that minimizes
    human intervention while checking the container and crane locations in real time.
    Starting with the installation at the Busan New Port in 2013, Virtual Terminal
    has been evolving by continually adding technologies related to digital twins.
    Since then, it has been installed and operated at King Abdullah Port in Saudi
    Arabia and Dubai Jebel Ali Port Terminal 3 operated by DP&W in the United Arab
    Emirates, and it has been reported that the port productivity has improved by
    65% as a result of its application. 8.3.1 Fiware4water Fiware4Water is a project
    funded by the European Commission which intends to link the water sector to the
    FIWARE ecosystem by demonstrating its capabilities and the potential of its interoperable
    and standardised interfaces for both water sector end-users (cities, water utilities,
    water authorities, citizens and consumers), and solution providers (private utilities,
    SMEs, developers). By integrating the OWA-EPANET 2.2, a simulator for pressured
    water networks, with FIWARE, the project demonstrated the way of linking a tool
    for hydraulic and quality simulations of water distribution systems (WDS) with
    real time data from multiple sources in a standardized manner; this removed challenges
    associated with interoperability of different tools and data management systems,
    and enables an up-to-date digital twin (DT) to be maintained. Provision of a DT
    of a WDS then yields multiple benefits, including, for example, the ability to
    run simulations to determine pressure, flow and quality throughout the system
    in both forecast and hindcast scenarios to support decision making. A Water Network
    Management NGSI-LD data model has been developed to reflect the structure of an
    EPANET model, Footnote 22 with individual entities including junctions, tanks,
    reservoirs, pipes, valves and pumps. In addition to these physical objects, entities
    are also defined for time patterns (used to vary demands, quality source strength
    and pump speed settings at fixed time intervals) and data curves (used to describe
    relationships between two quantities, such as head and flow for pumps, or volume
    and water level for tanks). Every entity has a unique Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI), enabling it to be referenced. Each of these entities has specified properties
    and/or relationships, some of which are mandatory when defining an instance. For
    valves, for example, it is mandatory to provide an ID, valve type, diameter, setting,
    minor loss coefficient, initial status, start node and end node. These specifications
    of properties broadly reflect the required and optional properties of each network
    component when defined in an EPANET model. Two example entities from the Water
    Network Management data model are illustrated in Fig. 11. Figure 11a shows a ‘Junction’
    entity, complete with its associated attributes, as an example of a network node;
    ‘Tanks’ and ‘Reservoirs’ are defined similarly, with additional properties as
    required (e.g. tank diameter) and properties such as ‘location’ and ‘elevation’
    being common to all. Fig. 11b shows a ‘Pipe’ entity and its associated attributes,
    as an example of a network link. Included in this are the ‘startsAt’ and ‘endsAt’
    relationships, which much connect to a ‘Junction’, Tank’ or ‘Reservoir’ entity,
    and indicate how the network components are configured and the direction in which
    flow measurements are reported. ‘Valve’ and ‘Pump’ entities are modelled similarly,
    with the same relationships, and additional properties as required to capture
    their characteristics. Fig. 11 Illustrative example of the properties, relationships
    and values used to define (a) a junction and (b) a pipe in the Water Network Management
    data model Full size image 9 Conclusions and Remarks In this chapter, we examined
    international standards–related activities of developing and establishing standards
    for digital twins that operate in conjunction with various fields and technologies.
    The standards are developed differently according to the goals and fields of each
    standards organization. Nevertheless, ultimately, their goal is to ensure the
    interoperability of heterogeneous devices and promote wider use of digital twin
    technologies by developing standards for the digital twin’s reference models,
    devices, communication protocols, and data. In particular, this chapter examined
    the following standards organizations: ISO/TC 184 for Industrial automation systems
    and integration ISO/IEEE for smart health IEC TC65 for industry automation including
    RAMI 4.0 oneM2M for common service function for Digital Twins In recent years,
    rather than just working on the development of standards documents, which is the
    main work, the international standards organizations have been supporting or directly
    operating open-source communities so that developers can use their standards more
    easily to secure the ecosystem of the technology they are developing, respectively.
    Therefore, this chapter examined open-source activities related to digital twins.
    Finally, actual application cases related to various digital twins being developed
    around the world are examined. Notes 1. European Telecommunications Standards

    In Spain, as in the rest of southern Europe, water is a scarce, fragile, and unevenly
    distributed resource [1]. Climate models developed by the European Environment
    Agency (EEA) [2] show that, in the last 50 years, in the Iberian Peninsula, there
    has been a decrease in precipitation of up to 90 mm per decade, and predict that
    in the next 70 years, this decrease will be even greater, reaching a reduction
    of up to 40% in some areas of southern Spain. As a result of decreased rainfall
    and overexploitation of water resources, the balance between available water and
    water demand has already reached critical levels. In the context of this worrying
    future scenario, solutions need to be found. Improving irrigation efficiency and
    optimizing agricultural management practices are two of the necessary actions,
    and technology is an indispensable tool to carry them out. Precision agriculture
    (PA) has emerged as an approach to optimize farm management, which involves the
    use of a series of sensors and actuators that allow gathering context information
    from the surrounding environment [3]. Using different types of sensors and algorithms,
    the irrigation requirements of crops can be calculated automatically so that the
    amount of water they need can be estimated and applied at the right time. This
    development has led to an increase in the number of companies offering platforms
    for the visualization of sensor data, which, while useful, still requires specialized
    farmers who know how to interpret the data and apply the most appropriate management
    strategies. In addition, these platforms, being mostly commercial, are characterized
    as closed systems, which do not allow connection with third-party sensors and
    often have high costs that prevent the farmer from installing several measurement
    points, which is a problem in the analysis of spatial variability within the farm.
    Several IoT (Internet of Things) platforms for agriculture can be found in the
    literature. Previous researchers [4,5,6] created an open IoT platform developed
    with FIWARE [7] for agriculture, but none of them use the linked data (LD) version
    that allows a greater standardization of the API (application programming interface),
    which is essential for the platform to have open data. Platform [8] uses the LD
    version of FIWARE and proposes a data model to improve the management and real-time
    monitoring of crops in irrigation communities. Additionally, an IoT platform based
    on microservices, such as FIWARE, but with its own architecture, so it does not
    have a standardized API, has been proposed [9]. However, none of the above works
    integrates soil-water-plant-atmosphere models. [10] propose a mobile application
    that incorporates an agricultural model [11] for fertilization and irrigation
    scheduling, but this model does not use sensor data and is based on the single
    crop coefficient (Kc) approach instead of the dual Kc for separate estimation
    of crop transpiration (Tc) and soil evaporation (Es) (i.e., Kc = Kcb + Ke), introduced
    in FAO56 [12] which improves the accuracy of potential crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) estimation. To solve these problems, a low-cost IoT platform for precision
    irrigation has been developed in this work. Using FIWARE, more specifically the
    LD version, the objective is to create an open IoT application with an architecture
    that allows the connection of any type of sensor and agronomic model and with
    a standardized API that allows platforms of the same type, which also use FIWARE,
    to connect to each other without the need for additional configurations. The platform
    not only works as a dashboard, displaying the data captured by the sensors, but
    also automatically calculates the crop water needs using the dual Kc approach
    and allows the implementation of deficit irrigation strategies. To connect different
    sensors to the platform, a low-cost, energy-efficient data acquisition device
    has been developed. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area This project has
    been carried out on a farm devoted to olive groves located in Córdoba, southern
    Spain. The climate in this area is characterized by mild winters and hot summers,
    with mean daily temperatures around 10 °C and above 26 °C, respectively (Table
    1). The monthly mean values of grass reference evapotranspiration (ET0; FAO-Penman-Monteith
    method [12]) varies between 1.1 and 7.6 mm day−1. Table 1. Average climatic data
    in Córdoba (Andalusia; southern Spain) during the period from 2001 to 2021, obtained
    from the Córdoba agroclimatic station belonging to the Andalusian Agroclimatic
    Information Network (RIA). The average annual rainfall and ET0 for the period
    from 2001 to 2021 was 590 mm, with high interannual variability, and 1409 mm,
    respectively (Figure 1). The year 2021, when the project started, was a dry year,
    with an annual rainfall of 436 mm. Figure 1. Annual precipitation and ET0 data
    recorded at the Cordoba agroclimatic station belonging to the RIA, from 2001 to
    2021. The soil is alkaline (pH = 8.7), with a high presence of carbonates (45.3%)
    and active limestone (18.2%). The texture varied between loam and clay loam, with
    a medium water retention capacity. The soil had no salinity problems, with an
    average electrical conductivity (EC; 1:5) value of 0.14 dS/m. The average cation
    exchange capacity (CEC) was 24 cmol(+)/kg, with the exchange complex dominated
    by the presence of Ca and a high K and low Mg content. The total organic matter
    content of soil is 1.43%. This olive farm consists of two plots of olive trees.
    The first of the plots is made up of olive trees of the Arbequina variety, planted
    in 2017 with a planting frame of 6 × 2 m. The second plot is made up of olive
    trees of the Arbosana variety, planted in 2019 with a planting frame of 5 × 1.75
    m. Both plots are irrigated by means of a pump that drives the water from the
    Guadajoz River to the different irrigation sectors. Table 2 shows the characteristics
    of the irrigation system. Table 2. Characteristics of the irrigation sectors.
    Sector one with the Arbequina variety and sector two with the Arbosana variety.
    2.2. Iot Platform 2.2.1. General Architecture The architecture of the developed
    IoT platform (Figure 2) is divided into three distinct and independent layers
    that are interconnected through a set of APIs. This architecture is made up of
    a set of microservices that perform a specific task. The central component of
    the platform is the Orion Context Broker, which is responsible for connecting
    the different microservices using the same API. This type of architecture increases
    the scalability and security of the system as it allows the creation of new services
    that perform specific functionalities without affecting those already in place.
    Figure 2. IoT Platform Architecture. 2.2.2. Layer 1 (IoT Devices) All IoT applications
    need to have one or more sensors to collect data from the environment. Sensors
    are essential components of smart objects. One of the most important aspects of
    the Internet of Things is context awareness, which is not possible without sensor
    technology [13]. The first layer is made up of smart and energy-efficient devices
    that have been developed with the aim of being compatible with different connections
    and protocols. These devices have been developed to accomplish the following characteristics:
    Wireless and with different communication protocols: The devices are usually installed
    in dispersed locations without internet connectivity and have therefore been developed
    to support a wide range of communications such as Low Power Wide Area Networks
    (LPWAN), including LoRaWAN, SigFox, NB-IoT, Global System for Mobile (GSM), Wi-Fi,
    and Bluetooth. Depending on the coverage and the number of sensors (e.g., LoRa
    network needs to deploy an infrastructure that is not cost-effective for a limited
    number of sensors), one communication system or another will be chosen. Energy-efficient:
    Sensors in agriculture are usually installed in remote locations that are difficult
    to access, so they must be energy self-sufficient. Supports different output protocols:
    To measure the different agronomic factors affecting irrigation, the devices have
    to support the main protocols used by the sensors. These protocols are SDI-12
    (Serial Digital Interface at 1200 baud), RS-485 (Communication standard published
    by the Telecommunications Industry Association and Electronic Industries Alliance;
    TIA/EIA), I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit), and SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface).
    The devices also support analog sensors. The devices are programmed with the open-source
    Arduino software, which can be extended with C and C++ programming languages.
    Hardware Architecture The devices are made up of a set of components that together
    form an embedded system. The main element of the devices is the microcontroller,
    which monitors the control of power consumption, obtains data from the sensors,
    and communicates with layer two. For this purpose, the Arduino MKR family of boards
    has been used, which are open source and support a wide range of communication
    protocols. This board is based on Atmel’s 32-bit SAMD21 microcontroller. To integrate
    this board with the sensors, a printed circuit board (PCB) has been developed.
    A schematic is shown in Figure 3. The PCB can be divided into the following parts,
    each of which performs a specific functionality. Figure 3. Device Schematic. Battery
    system: consists of a 2600 mAh, 3.7 V, rechargeable 18,650 lithium-ion battery,
    which is charged by a 250 mA solar panel. To control the battery charge, the Lion
    TP4056 linear charger module has been used. This module controls the overcharging
    and discharging of the battery. Power Switch: It consists of a Logic Level Mosfet,
    which is used as a switch, cutting off the power supply to the sensors during
    the sleep period and supplying it at the moment of taking measurements. This reduces
    power consumption considerably. Voltage Divider: adjust the battery voltage to
    the MKR circuit operating voltage of 3.3 V. On/off button: button that turns the
    device on and off. Sensor Connectors: It has four jack connectors for easy integration
    with sensors. These have a jumper that enables switching from digital to analog.
    2.2.3. Layer 2 (IoT Backend) The second layer is the backend. It is based on a
    microservices architecture and uses the FIWARE framework alongside custom services.
    FIWARE brings a curated framework of open source platform components that can
    be assembled together and with other third-party platform components to build
    smart solutions faster, easier, and cheaper [7]. It is supported by the European
    Union (EU) and has been developed to create open source, standardized IoT platforms
    that are suitable for all sectors, such as smart cities, industry, and agriculture,
    and that enable better communication between systems. The EU’s commitment to FIWARE
    is due to the need to create a common standard in the IOT world, as until then
    each organization followed different paths that prevented communication between
    sensors and platforms. With FIWARE, this problem is solved, and cities, industries,
    or agricultural farms follow the same standard that allows them to share information
    in a simple way. FIWARE is composed of a series of software blocks, called generic
    enabler (GE), which perform specific functions. Each of these GEs provides open
    APIs, which facilitate cross-platform communication and make it easier to develop
    IoT applications. This is one of the main advantages offered by this framework
    since it allows integration between different FIWARE-based platforms. This is
    very important both at the farm management and research levels because it allows
    the integration of methods developed by research groups and facilitates their
    use by farmers and the private sector, improving decision making. In FIWARE, the
    state of an object in the real world is defined as context information and is
    represented by an entity. Each entity has attributes that are divided into properties
    and relationships, where the first defines the value of the entity and the latter
    defines the relationship that this entity has with other entities. For example,
    in a “Device” entity, the “SoilMoisture” attribute is a property, while the “Parcel”
    attribute is a relationship linking this sensor to the crop plot where it is located.
    The values of this attribute represent the current status of the device, which
    is the context information, and only the latest state of the device is stored
    in the context broker. Therefore, to access historical data, it is necessary to
    connect to external services that store the information in databases. The components
    of the backend are: Orion Context Broker with Linked Data Extensions (Orion-LD):
    It represents the main component of the platform and enables the management of
    the entire lifecycle of context information, including updates, queries, registrations,
    and subscriptions [14]. This component is based on the NGSI-LD API (Next Generation
    Service Interfaces—Linked Data) [15] that supports the LD concept. QuantumLeap:
    a GE that is responsible for persistently storing temporal sensor data in a time-series
    database. IoT Agent: a GE that allows the connection of the sensors with the context
    broker. It manages the different devices and is responsible for transforming the
    sensor-specific protocol into the NGSI-LD context information protocol. Authentication
    Server: a custom microservice that is responsible for authentication and authorization
    of users to the platform. It is developed with Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment,
    and uses JSON Web Tokens to ensure security. Soil Water Balance Model: A customized
    microservice that calculates the soil water balance of crop plots on a daily basis.
    The model has been developed with the Python programming language, and the microservice
    for accessing the model with Node.js. This model is described in more detail in
    Section 2.3. MongoDB: a No-SQL database that stores context data and user information.
    CrateDB: another No-SQL database where the sensor data is stored in a persistent
    way. To connect all the services or components that are in the backend, the NGSI-LD
    API provides two mechanisms called subscriptions and registrations. The first
    one informs the external services that the context data has changed, and the second
    one connects the services to the context broker, so that the context broker changes
    the context data. For example, there is a subscription that connects Orion-LD
    to the QuantumLeap service. This subscription aims to redirect to QuantumLeap
    the sensor data coming to the broker (via the IoT-Agent). An example of registration
    is when an external service, in this case the IoT-Agent, wants to connect to the
    broker to change the context data; this IoT-Agent has an associated registration,
    which is responsible for changing the status of the sensors in the broker when
    data from the sensor is received again. Linked Data Linked data concepts allow
    for one step further in the communication between platforms as it uses the JSON-LD
    (JavaScript Object Notation for Linked Data) data format, which makes it possible
    to read and write structured data supported by open vocabularies [16] that can
    be read by computers. This makes it easier to find and exchange information with
    open databases, mobile apps, and IoT platforms. This is especially useful in the
    IoT, where information exchange between platforms is currently very limited. The
    Orion-LD broker version, currently in beta, allows users to manage and request
    context information in an organized way using the NGSI-LD standards. For example,
    as will be seen in the following section, the application developed in this article
    has an entity called “Parcel”, which represents a crop plot within the farm. This
    same entity within the FIWARE standards, which are publicly available, is called
    “AgriParcel”. To relate these two concepts, FIWARE makes use of JSON-LD files,
    so that when our platform asks FIWARE to return the entitiy “Parcel”, FIWARE knows
    that it is referring to the “AgriParcel” entity. As these standards are unique
    and public, different platforms can access the same FIWARE API using their own
    entity names, which may be different between applications. Figure 4 shows how
    two apps can access different FIWARE servers using their own entities. Figure
    4. Simplified diagram of how JSON-LD works in FIWARE (with Orion-LD) using the
    “AgriParcel” entity. 2.2.4. Layer 3 (Frontend) The last layer is the frontend,
    which can be defined as the web design and development technologies that allow
    the user to interact with the backend (Layer 2). This layer consists of a user
    interface that acts as an intermediary between the user and the platform, displaying
    information and facilitating user interaction with the platform. To connect to
    the Rest API of the backend, the frontend uses the HTTP protocol. For the development
    of this layer, the ReactJS library has been used, which is based on HTML5, JavaScript,
    and CSS technologies. This library allows the creation of single-page applications
    (SPA), which significantly increases user experience and application performance.
    The web application consists of a single HTML document, and as the user interacts,
    the content changes dynamically. The frontend, as well as serving as an interface
    to facilitate the user’s connection with the server, is responsible for structuring
    the application. It is where the entities will be structured so that all users
    will follow the same pattern (Figure 5). The main entity in the application is
    the farm, where general aspects such as location, name, owner, etc. are collected.
    Within the farms are the entities (“Parcel”) corresponding to the crop plots.
    These entities contain information about the agronomic factors such as soil type,
    crop characteristics, irrigation system, irrigation strategy, and user management.
    Figure 5. Structure of the entities. Finally, within each “Parcel”, there are
    the entities corresponding to the devices. These entities represent the dataloggers
    installed in the farm and show the information and historical data of each of
    the devices. This structure makes it possible to simulate any farm in which there
    are parcels with different agronomic characteristics, on each of which one or
    more sensors are installed. Each user is assigned a role with specific permissions.
    Users with the role of administrator are the only ones authorized to add or delete
    users and administer the databases. The other users can only manage those entities
    that they have created themselves. Users can make the farms they have created
    public or give permission to different users, so that any of them can see the
    data but cannot edit anything. In addition, each farm has a private API-Key that
    can be shared to access the NGSI-LD API. 2.3. Irrigation Model The irrigation
    model is responsible for calculating the amount of water that the crop needs and
    when the best time is to apply it. Although it could be used for any irrigation
    method, in this particular case it is focused on drip irrigation as it allows
    the calculation of the wet bulb dimensions. Figure 6 shows the different elements
    that make up the irrigation model developed in this article. This diagram can
    be divided into two parts: the first one related to the soil water balance model,
    which is calculated using the FAO-56 methodology [17], and the second one related
    to the wet bulb, where the total available soil water (TAW) and the wet bulb dimensions
    are calculated. Figure 6. General outline of the proposed irrigation model. AEMET
    is the Spanish State Meteorological Agency, and elTiempo.es is a Spanish website
    where weather forecasts are shown. The application runs two types of models. The
    first one calculates the soil water balance from previous years. The user can
    choose whether to make a water balance by simulating a specific year or by making
    the balance using the average of the climatic values of the last 20 years. As
    the user can change the irrigation strategies, this first balance allows them
    to obtain the results of each of the strategies that they define and find the
    one that best suits their needs. The second type uses weather forecasts to estimate
    the crop water requirements in the next seven days and apply the most efficient
    irrigation strategy possible. All the weather data can be obtained using an on-farm
    weather station or an external meteorological API, such as AEMET and elTiempo.es,
    two meteorological services operating in Spain. 2.3.1. Soil Water Balance The
    soil water balance (SWB) model uses daily climatic data, crop characteristics,
    and data recorded by sensors to calculate crop water consumption (ETa) and water
    losses in percolation and runoff processes. The daily SWB, expressed as water
    depletion at the end of day i, is calculated using the following equation: 𝐷 𝑟,𝑖
    = 𝐷 𝑟,𝑖−1 − (𝑃−𝑅𝑂) 𝑖 − 𝐼 𝑖 −𝐶 𝑅 𝑖 +𝐸 𝑇 𝑎,𝑖 +𝐷 𝑃 𝑖 (1) where 𝐷 𝑟,𝑖 is the soil
    water depletion in the root zone at the end of day 𝑖 [mm]; 𝐷 𝑟,𝑖−1   is the depletion
    in the root zone at the end of the previous day i − 1 [mm]; 𝑃 𝑖 is the precipitation
    on day 𝑖 [mm]; 𝑅 𝑂 𝑖 is the runoff from the soil surface on day 𝑖  [mm]; 𝐼 𝑖 is
    the irrigation applied on day 𝑖 [mm]; 𝐶 𝑅 𝑖 is the capillary rise from the groundwater
    table on day 𝑖 [mm]; 𝐸 𝑇 𝑎, 𝑖 is actual crop evapotranspiration on day 𝑖 [mm],
    and 𝐷 𝑃 𝑖 is the water flowing out from the root zone -by deep percolation on
    day  𝑖 [mm]. ETa was calculated following the FAO56 method [17] as the product
    of the reference evapotranspiration (𝐸 𝑇 0 ) , calculated using the FAO Penman-Monteith
    equation, and the actual crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑡 ) , (ETa = ET0 × Kc act),
    with Kc act = Ks × Kc, where 𝐾 𝑠 is a crop water stress coefficient, and 𝐾 𝑐  is
    calculated using the FAO56 dual Kc method (Kc = Kcb + Ke) [12]. Where 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 is
    the basal crop coefficient and 𝐾 𝑒 is and evaporation coefficient, which represent
    the ratios of crop transpiration (Tc) and soil evaporation (Es), respectively
    (Tc/ET0, and Es/ET0) [18]. Thus, 𝐾 𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑡 is calculated as follows: 𝐾 𝑐 𝑎𝑐𝑡 = 𝐾
    𝑠 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 + 𝐾 𝑒 (2) To adopt the dual 𝐾 𝑐 approach, the methodology used in the SIMDualKc
    software has been used [19]. This methodology has been validated in high-density
    olive groves [20,21,22] and in other woody row crops, such as peach trees [23]
    and vineyards [24]. For the calculation of 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 , the differences in canopy density
    and crop height have to be considered as these parameters influence crop transpiration.
    𝐾 𝑐𝑏   can be calculated using the following equation [25]: 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 = 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑚𝑖𝑛 +
    𝐾 𝑑 ( 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 − 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ) (3) where 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 represents the estimated 𝐾 𝑐𝑏
    at maximum crop growth, for conditions having nearly full ground cover, 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑚𝑖𝑛
    is the minimum 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 for bare soil ( 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑚𝑖𝑛 ~0.15 ) [19] and 𝐾 𝑑 is the density
    coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑑 ) that can be found in [25,26]. 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 is calculated as a
    function of mean crop height and adjusted for local climate conditions. This is
    because the standard 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 values refer to a typical sub-humid climate (with an
    average daily minimum RH of 45% and a wind speed of 2  ms −1 ) [27], so the values
    of 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 are adjusted using the following equation: 𝐾 𝑐𝑏𝑓𝑢𝑙𝑙 = 𝐾 𝑐𝑏, ℎ +(0.04(
    𝑢 2 −2)−0.004(𝑅 𝐻 𝑚𝑖𝑛 −45)) ( ℎ 3 ) 0.3 (4) where 𝐾 𝑐𝑏, ℎ is the 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 𝑚𝑖𝑑 for
    full cover vegetation under sub-humid and calm wind conditions ( 𝑅 𝐻 𝑚𝑖𝑛 45% and
    𝑢 2 = 2 ms −1 ) that can be estimated ( 𝐾 𝑐𝑏, ℎ =min(1.0+0.1ℎ, 1.20) ) [25], 𝑢
    2 is the wind speed at 2-m height [ ms −1 ] , and h is the mean maximum crop height
    [m]. Finally, 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 is adjusted for available soil water to maintain crop ET at
    potential rate. 𝐾 𝑠 can be calculated by the following function [17,18]: 𝐾 𝑠 =
    𝑇𝐴𝑊− 𝐷 𝑟 𝑇𝐴𝑊−𝑅𝐴𝑊  when  𝐷 𝑟  >𝑅𝐴𝑊 (5) where 𝑇𝐴𝑊 and RAW are the total available
    water and readily available water in the root zone [mm], respectively, and Dr
    is the soil water depletion in the root zone relative to field capacity [mm] [17].
    The last step in the estimation of actual crop coefficient (Kc act) is the calculation
    of 𝐾 𝑒 . This coefficient is highest when the topsoil is wet and decreases as
    the water content drops: 𝐾 𝑒 =min( 𝐾 𝑟 ( 𝐾 𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 − 𝐾 𝑐𝑏 ),  𝑓 𝑒𝑤 𝐾 𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 ) (6)
    where 𝐾 𝑟 is the dimensionless evaporation reduction coefficient dependent on
    the cumulative depth of water depleted from the topsoil and 𝑓 𝑒𝑤 is the fraction
    of the soil surface wetted and exposed to solar radiation. Equations for calculating
    the 𝐾 𝑟 , 𝐾 𝑐 𝑚𝑎𝑥 , and 𝑓 𝑒𝑤 are presented in the FAO56 report [17]. The simplified
    procedures used in the SIMDualKc [19] model have been used to calculate the last
    three components of the SWB (DP, CR, and RO). The SIMDualKc model calculates DP
    and CR using the procedure described by FAO-24 [27] and calculates RO using the
    curve number method [17]. 2.3.2. Wet Bulb Calculation As the crop used is drip
    irrigated, a series of equations have been developed to calculate the dimensions
    of the wet bulb of the soil to give more precise recommendations on the hours
    that the irrigation system should be in operation. The model uses the soil properties
    to calculate the wet bulb dimensions and the soil water retention curve in order
    to estimate the maximum amount of water that can be applied without percolation
    and the TAW, respectively. Figure 7 gives an overview of the procedures followed.
    Figure 7. Flowchart of the procedures for calculating TAW and wet bulb dimensions.
    Where th1500 and th33 are the soil water content at soil matric potentials of
    −1500 and −33 kPa, respectively. Calculation of Total Available Water To facilitate
    the use of the irrigation model, the soil texture and the effective root depth
    are the only mandatory parameters to calculate TAW. To calculate the missing parameters,
    the Rosetta pedotransfer model, which predicts the hydraulic parameters of unsaturated
    soils, has been used. This model allows the estimation of van Genuchten water
    retention parameters and saturated hydraulic conductivity using limited (textural
    classes only) to more extended (texture, bulk density, and one or two water retention
    points) input data [28,29,30]. However, it is highly recommended to estimate all
    these soil parameters in the lab in order to use the extended version and get
    better results. Using the parameters calculated by Rosetta, the van Genuchten
    equation can be used to calculate the soil water retention curve [31]. 𝜃(ℎ)= 𝜃
    𝑟 + 𝜃 𝑠 − 𝜃 𝑟 (1+ (𝛼ℎ) 𝑛 ) (1− 1 𝑛 ) (7) where 𝜃(ℎ) is the soil water content
    [m3 m−3] at a matric potential h [kPa], 𝜃 𝑠 is the saturated water content, 𝜃
    𝑟 is the residual water content, 𝛼 is related to the inverse of the air entry
    suction [cm−1], and 𝑛 is a measure of the pore-size distribution Finally, with
    the calculated water retention curve, the soil TAW can be estimated as the difference
    between the volumetric soil water content at −33 kPa, which represents the field
    capacity (FC), and at −1500 kPa, which represents the permanent wilting point
    (PWP) [32] multiplied by the effective root depth. Calculation of the Wet Bulb
    Dimensions To calculate how long the irrigation system should run, it is necessary
    to know the dimensions of the wet bulb. There are several methods that can be
    used for this, which can be divided into empirical [33,34,35], numerical [36]
    and analytical models [37]. We have used two models to calculate bulb dimensions.
    The first is the Schwartzman and Zur model [33]: 𝑤=1.82  𝑉 0.22 ( 𝐾 𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝑄 ) −0.17
    (8) 𝑧=2.54  𝑉 0.63 ( 𝐾 𝑠𝑎𝑡 𝑄 ) 0.45 (9) where w and z are the horizontal and vertical
    dimensions [m], V is the total amount of water in the soil [ m 3 ], 𝐾 𝑠𝑎𝑡 is the
    saturated hydraulic conductivity [m s −1 ], and Q is the emitter discharge [ m
    3 s −1 ] The second is the DIPAC-DRIP model. Equations (10) and (11) were created
    to estimate the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the wet bulb using a non-linear
    regression analysis. 𝑤=0.2476 Δ 𝜃 −0.5626  𝑉 0.2686  𝑄 −0.0028  𝐾 𝑠 −0.0344 (10)
    𝑧=2.0336 Δ 𝜃 −0.383  𝑉 0.365  𝑄 −0.101  𝐾 𝑠 0.195 (11) where Δ𝜃 is the average
    change of SWC ( Δ𝜃 ≈ 𝜃 𝑠 /2, where 𝜃 𝑠 is the soil water content at saturation).
    The effective root depth parameter is used to calculate the dimensions of the
    wet bulb before percolation. With the volume of this wet bulb, the amount of water
    needed to bring it to the target moisture content can be estimated. To calculate
    this volume using the horizontal and vertical dimensions, the shape of the bulb
    has been assumed to be a semi-ellipse. This assumption is not entirely correct
    as the shape of the bulb is not exactly a semi-ellipse, and some studies have
    tried to calculate the shape more precisely [38]. However, it has been decided
    to use the semi-ellipse for simplification, and other studies will be taken into
    consideration for future improvements of the model. The possible overlapping of
    the surface wetted by drippers in linear branches has been taken into account.
    Since the shape of the wet bulb is considered the same, the overlapped area can
    be calculated as the area of the intersection between two equal circles: 𝐴 𝑐,𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑑
    =4 ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 𝜋 𝑅 2 𝑐𝑜𝑠 −1 𝑑 2𝑅 360 − 𝑅 ( 𝑑 2 − 𝑅 2 4 − − − − − − − √ )
    4 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (12) where 𝐴 𝑐,𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑑 is the overlapping area between the
    circles, R is the radius of the wet bulb, and d is the distance between the drippers.
    To translate this overlap area of the circles to the overlap area of the semi-ellipse,
    the following equation is used 𝐴 𝑠𝑒,𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑑 = 𝐴 𝑐,𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑑  ( 𝑧 𝑅 ) 2 (13)
    Finally, with the volume of the wet bulb, the overlapping area, and the soil humidity
    data, the total time that the irrigation system should work can be estimated as:
    𝑡= 𝑉 𝑠𝑒  ( 𝐴 𝑠𝑒 𝐴 𝑠𝑒, 𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟𝑙𝑎𝑝𝑒𝑑 ) ( 𝐼 1000 𝑧 ) 𝑄 (14) where I represents the irrigation
    needs [mm] calculated in the SWB, 𝑉 𝑠𝑒 is the volume of the semiellipse, and 𝐴
    𝑠𝑒 is the area of the semiellipse. 2.3.3. Irrigation Strategies The irrigation
    model uses four types of irrigation strategies: (1) Rainfed: when there is no
    irrigation; (2) Soil moisture target: define a maximum soil water depletion for
    each month of the year, which is particularly useful when scheduling deficit irrigation
    strategies; (3) Predefined schedule: used if the irrigation is already defined
    and it is necessary to provide an irrigation time for each day of the simulation;
    (4) Constant depth: a strategy that attempts to keep soil water depletion within
    a specific range. Other parameters, such as limiting the maximum irrigation time
    per day, the interval between irrigation days, or the days of the week on which
    irrigation can take place, are considered. 2.4. Server Implementation Finally,
    once the design is finished, it is necessary to move the backend into production
    mode. This consists of deploying the application on a server so that it is operational
    24 h a day. In this section, it is important to apply the corresponding security
    measures. The development and deployment of the application was through Docker,
    a platform for the development of software containers. Among the advantages of
    using this technology are the possibility of running multiple servers on the same
    machine in isolation, scalability, and ease of deployment in the cloud. As a server,
    we have used a Raspberry Pi 4 with 4 GB of RAM and a 64-bit Raspbian operating
    system. 3. Implementation 3.1. Device Implementation The model described above
    was implemented in the IoT system that was evaluated on the olive farm during
    one irrigation season. Two communication nodes have been installed (Figure 8),
    one in each of the irrigation sectors or plots of olive trees. Each node consists
    of three soil humidity, electrical conductivity, and temperature probes, placed
    at 15, 30, and 45 cm soil depth, and a soil water potential sensor placed at 30
    cm. Figure 8. Communication node with connected soil moisture sensors. The installation
    of the sensors is quite simple and intuitive. The communication node allows the
    connection of sensors with a 3.5 mm jack connector. As already mentioned, the
    architecture of the platform allows any type of sensor to be connected. To do
    this, when the user installs a new node, a window appears on the platform where
    the user must specify which sensors have been installed in each connector. Once
    this step is finished, the platform adapts to that sensor and displays its data.
    3.2. User Interface The application interface has been developed to be user-friendly
    and scalable. This interface allows access to the different entities within the
    farm in a quick and intuitive way (Figure 9). Figure 9. Main interface pages.
    The home page allows access to the main menus of the application, such as the
    user settings or the farms. The farms page shows the general characteristics of
    the farm and the field plots that compose it; this entity stores weather data.
    The next page is the plots page; this is the most important one because it is
    where the irrigation is calculated. This page has all the crops and agronomic
    data, the irrigation schedules, and the sensors that are installed there. Finally,
    the interface has the page sensors, where all sensor characteristics and telemetry
    are displayed. This structure allows for the separation of the different “Parcel”
    entities of a farm in order to use their characteristics as input for the agronomic
    models. 3.3. Scheduled Irrigation As mentioned above, the model allows multiple
    irrigation strategies; the use of one or the other will depend on the soil characteristics,
    the crop, the limits of the irrigation system, and the user’s management. In this
    work, a regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) strategy has been chosen as the irrigation
    allocation is not sufficient to replenish 100% of the irrigation needs of the
    olive grove on the farm. This strategy maximizes water productivity by reducing
    applied water only during the least drought-sensitive crop phenological periods
    [39], in which the crop can suffer water stress without severely affecting crop
    yield. For the two plots of olive trees monitored in this work, the RDI strategy
    evaluated in a high-density olive grove of the Arbequina variety located in the
    province of Seville was followed [40] to apply a total irrigation amount of 60%
    of irrigation needs (IN; Figure 10). Figure 10. RDI strategy applied in a high-density
    olive grove to supply 60% of the crop’s water needs [40]. Modified from [41].
    To implement this irrigation scheduling, the strategy defined in the irrigation
    model as “soil moisture target” has been used. As mentioned above, with this strategy,
    the user can define a maximum soil water depletion for each month. Thus, the RDI
    strategy can be used in the water balance model. Following this strategy, the
    model performs two simulations. The first one is an annual simulation that is
    run using historical data from the last 20 years (Figure 11). This simulation
    shows how the water content in the soil changes during a normal year. The second
    simulation predicts the water needs of the olive crops in the following 7 days
    (Figure 12). For this, the soil water content is adjusted each day with the data
    provided by the soil moisture sensors, and the simulation of the water balance
    is performed using weather forecast data and the scheduled irrigation events.
    Figure 11. Annual simulation of the irrigation model showing water depletion in
    the root zone when using the RDI strategy defined in Figure 10 for a high-density
    olive grove. Figure 12. Simulation of the next seven days from the current day,
    showing water depletion in the root zone when using the strategy defined in Figure
    10. 4. Discussion While the use of sensors in agriculture is growing exponentially,
    the use of IoT platforms is also growing exponentially. The problem is that these
    platforms often have their own architecture, and the API is not standardized.
    This makes it difficult to connect between platforms and leads to their isolation.
    FIWARE, in particular its Linked-Data version, is developed with the aim of solving
    this problem and appears as a great alternative for IoT applications in agriculture.
    That is why the most innovative part of this platform lies in its ease of sharing
    data between third-party platforms. Any platform developed with, or adapted to
    work with, the Orion-LD broker can be connected with little or no configuration.
    This is particularly beneficial in the public sector and in research, where data
    tends to become increasingly free, encouraging cooperation between researchers.
    On the other hand, it is important that irrigation platforms use agronomic models
    that provide more information to the farmer. The reliability of these models depends
    on the homogeneity of the sector and the accuracy of the data obtained. One of
    the great advantages of open platforms is that they are easily scalable and allow
    the integration of new sensors, which will be able to send real-time information
    to soil-water-plant-atmosphere models and considerably improve the accuracy of
    the estimates. For example, the integration of eddy covariance stations and sap
    flow sensors could help to improve the accuracy of the estimation of crop water
    requirements. With all this, it will be possible to integrate large amounts of
    information, what we know as ‘big data’, in quite complex models while offering
    accurate recommendations to farmers in a user-friendly and easy-to-understand
    way. In this particular case, before the implementation of this smart irrigation
    system, traditional irrigation management consisted of homogeneous irrigation
    of the olive farm, without making any distinction between the different sectors,
    despite the fact that the soil hydraulic characteristics and the olive varieties,
    as well as the planting date and tree density, were different. Moreover, the amount
    of irrigation depth applied was constant throughout the irrigation season, without
    taking into account the water requirements or the phenological stage of the olive
    tree. This was a problem, as there were periods of overwatering and others in
    which the needs of the olive trees were not supplied. By using the web application,
    which displayed the results of the sensors and the application of the irrigation
    model, the farmer improved his irrigation management, reducing water losses and
    avoiding tree water stress. It also facilitated the application of RDI strategies,
    something that is often not easy for the average farmer. Thanks to the use of
    technology, this IoT platform for smart irrigation is able to know, in real time,
    the state of the soil and of the crop and is able to use already validated soil-water-plant-atmosphere
    models that give us current and future information on the behavior of crops, all
    in an automatic way. Although it is difficult to measure the efficiency of this
    system in comparison with the conventional ones, as the latter depend mainly on
    the knowledge and experience of the farmer, it is clear that the information provided
    by this smart irrigation system is very useful for making decisions regarding
    irrigation scheduling. Furthermore, for those farmers who are not familiar with
    agronomic models, this system allows them to use these models without having the
    necessary knowledge to understand them. On the other hand, for those more experienced
    farmers who already use this type of agronomic model, this system makes their
    work much easier as it allows them to automate irrigation scheduling. 5. Conclusions
    The design of a complete open-source IoT system for smart irrigation systems is
    already completed. The system is a multilayer platform consisting of a series
    of energy-efficient smart devices connected to an IoT platform that is based on
    a microservices architecture. The platform uses the FIWARE framework alongside
    customized components and can be deployed using edge computing and/or cloud systems.
    This allows it to be adapted to the farmer’s needs, reducing costs and increasing
    safety. To complement the platform, an energy-efficient open-source datalogger
    has been designed. The datalogger supports a wide range of communications and
    protocols. The open-source availability of the data collected from the different
    sensors will facilitate the integration of the data into soil-water-plant-atmosphere
    models and their use as decision support systems for optimal irrigation management.
    In addition, a soil-water-crop model has been developed to improve irrigation
    management. This model calculates the dimensions and characteristics of the wet
    bulb when there is a drip irrigation system and uses the dual Kc approach to calculate
    the crop water requirements. Two simulations are performed in the application:
    the first calculates the soil water balance for a normal year, and the second
    calculates the water balance for the next seven days. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Increasing technological innovations have been applied to a variety
    of daily life activities, including agriculture. Plant care is improved by the
    use of modern technological applications, such as a systematic irrigation approach,
    which helps to prolong plant life. Various studies have been presented to address
    the challenges of indoor plant care. However, there are currently no ideal solutions
    for caring for and prolonging the life of plants. Numerous problems have been
    reported relevant to the subject of indoor plant care, one of which is the intense
    thirst for plant soil, which causes a variety of problems, including cutting the
    roots of plants, especially when the soil is covered with clay, reducing the plant's
    capacity to conduct the basic processes required to preserve its life. Finally,
    if the thirst continues, the plant withers and dies. Furthermore, overwatering
    suffocates the roots, halts respiration, and eventually kills the plants. Unwanted
    soil fungus also thrives in constantly wet conditions. As a result, the goal of
    this study is to design and create an automated irrigation system based on the
    Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) that can irrigate plants. The suggested system
    is divided into three stages. First, test the soil sensor's operation. Second,
    use the AskSensor IoT platform to monitor soil moisture. Third, send irrigation
    method information via Blynk apps. The findings of this paper demonstrated that
    the proposed system is superior to other related systems in several ways.

  description: This research focuses on the design and implementation of an Internet
    of Things (IoT) smart-based system for the agriculture industry, especially chilli
    plantations. Every year, chilli farmers experience huge losses due to pest infestation
    and a lack of technology to precisely manage their farms. To solve several problems,
    the IoT system was designed to continuously monitor pest detection status, temperature,
    humidity index, and soil moisture level simultaneously. Besides these, the IoT
    system is also designed for long-distance remote water, pesticide, and fertiliser
    pumps. An IoT platform was applied in this project to provide a monitoring dashboard
    and switches to empower several pumps with long-distance remotes using the LoRa
    communication systems in a wide coverage range of chilli farms. Three experiments
    were designed to determine the range of the LoRa network. All experiments and
    data collection were done on the campus of Universiti Teknikal Malaysia Melaka
    (UTeM) and the Melaka area. All experiments were analysed based on the results
    collected, such as packet reception rate (PRR), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and
    received signal strength indicator (RSSI). Based on the experiment results and
    conclusion, the LoRa communication system is suitable for applying to chilli farms
    in order to monitor all the elements such as soil moisture and pest detection
    status. The experiment also concludes that this LoRa network can be worked effectively
    up to cover a range of 260m with the elevation of the gateway.

    Nowadays, conventional agriculture farms lack high-level automated management
    due to the limited number of installed sensor nodes and measuring devices. Recent
    progress of the Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will play an essential role
    in future smart farming by enabling automated operations with minimum human intervention.
    The main objective of this work is to design and implement a flexible IoT-based
    platform for remote monitoring of agriculture farms of different scales, enabling
    continuous data collection from various IoT devices (sensors, actuators, meteorological

    1. Introduction In Chile, agriculture is an important sector of development with
    a significant impact on economic growth. Chile is located in the southern hemisphere
    and has great opportunities for agriculture and forestry production due to the
    diversity in climates throughout the country and high standards for quality and
    safety [1]. Agriculture farms can be classified into small, medium, and large
    farms [2]. According to the 2007 national agriculture and livestock census, 73.4%
    of farms are small (less than 20 hectares), 19% medium size (20–100 hectares),
    and 7.6% are large farms (more than 100 hectares). For the future development
    of Chilean agriculture, the Ministry of Agriculture has developed a framework
    that targets four main axes: associativity, rural development, sustainability,
    and modernization of activity [1]. While agriculture plays an essential part in
    the economy of Latin American countries, technology is still far from being deployed
    in the field [3]. This research is directed toward the role of Internet of Things
    (IoT) technology in agriculture farms to modernize farm activity and improve management
    and efficiency. Nowadays, modern technologies of sensors, communication networks,
    IoT, big data, and artificial intelligence are converging into complex cyber-physical
    systems and digital twins for different agriculture applications [4]. Agriculture
    applications include living plants/trees, agriculture products, agriculture fields/farms,
    agriculture buildings, and agriculture machines. These applications aim to enable
    stakeholders and farmers to remotely monitor, control and coordinate daily farm
    operations, and improve their decision making capabilities. There are many studies
    and publications in the domain of IoT for smart agriculture that aim to solve
    different problems and provide various solutions [5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].
    The main issues for developing such solutions include hardware, networking, and
    platform challenges. The hardware challenges are related to hardware implementation
    and the harshness of the operational environments, including temperature, humidity,
    rain, dependence on a limited battery power source, and other dangers that may
    affect/destroy the electronic circuits. The networking challenges are related
    to the lack of communication infrastructure in rural areas, sensing large-scale
    farms, and connecting isolated areas. Wireless technologies will play an important
    role in deploying IoT-based solutions that enable sensor/actuator nodes to exchange
    data without human intervention. The platform challenges are related to building
    a suitable platform and applications that will allow real-time monitoring. This
    work targets the networking challenges of large-scale farms in Chile to enable
    the integration of a massive number of sensor nodes, devices, and equipment. Long-range
    (LoRa) technology is a promising candidate to provide long-range communication
    over several kilometers based on low power consumption battery-powered devices.
    The main objective of this work is to design an IoT-based platform for remote
    monitoring of large-scale agriculture farms. The developed solution (hardware
    and software) can provide real-time tracking of labor activities for people and
    machines during harvest and measure different ambient and soil condition parameters
    for two fruit species, including blueberry and Hass avocado. The developed prototype
    offers a low-cost solution to access real-time data. The contribution of this
    article relies on proposing a flexible hardware and software platform oriented
    on monitoring agriculture farms of different scales, based on LoRaWAN technology.
    Even though previous work can be found using similar technologies, they focus
    on specific applications or evaluate technical aspects of specific layers of the
    IoT stack. 2. Related Work Agriculture is one of the biggest food industries in
    the world and currently one of the most critical sectors of the economy in many
    countries due to the great demand for food required by the world population. As
    food demand increases every day, maximizing food production and minimizing food
    losses and costs are necessary. With the advancement of Internet of Things (IoT)
    technologies, more companies and organizations are interested in developing new
    solutions that enable remote monitoring and control to improve crop productivity.
    IoT is a promising technology that provides great opportunities to support many
    new applications and services in different domains such as smart home, smart city,
    smart industry, smart health, and smart agriculture [5,6,7,8,9]. The authors in
    [5] reviewed IoT applications in agro-industrial and environmental fields, identifying
    different application areas (monitoring, control, prediction, and logistics),
    trends, architectures, and open challenges covering the time period from 2006
    to 2016. The authors in [6] present a comprehensive survey on the state-of-the-art
    for the role of IoT in agriculture, covering network architectures, technologies,
    and protocols. Furthermore, agriculture policies for the standardization of IoT-based
    agriculture and open research issues have been discussed. The authors in [7] developed
    a device named “FarmFox” to monitor soil health. The device uses REST API and
    TCP protocol. The developed sensor node monitors several soil parameters such
    as pH, turbidity, soil moisture, and temperature based on Wi-Fi technology and
    sends the sensor information to the end-user. The authors in [8] present a review
    of the applications of LoRaWAN for future smart farming, which include automatic
    irrigation systems, small/large arable farming, livestock and animal welfare,
    and greenhouse/indoor horticulture. The paper covers the basic applications of
    LoRaWAN for smart farms and highlights technology limits and future research directions.
    The author in [9] reviews various potential applications and challenges associated
    with IoT in agriculture and farming applications. Various case studies have been
    presented and explored regarding communication networks, cloud services, and hardware
    platforms. In [10], the author studies the impact of variant physical layer parameters
    on the performance of the LoRa network with respect to range, reliability, and
    RSSI in a tree farm located in Indiana, United States. The authors in [11] present
    a hardware and software system for the remote monitoring of vineyards. Two different
    nodes were developed and deployed to collect atmospheric data and soil parameters
    based on Wi-Fi technology in Ribeira Sacra, Spain. The authors in [12] propose
    a user-centered design model where each farmer decides their own installations.
    The experimental work considered a greenhouse with two levels of communication
    and processing nodes (edge and fog). In [13], the authors present the major applications
    of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and IoT in smart farming. The work highlights
    connectivity requirements, network functionalities, and communication technologies
    for smart agriculture. In [14], the authors present an IoT scheme based on LoRa
    technology for long-range communication in the agriculture area. The monitoring
    parameters consist of humidity, temperature, soil pH and soil moisture. In [15],
    the authors present a comparative study for LPWAN such as Sigfox, LoRa, and NB-IoT
    for large-scale IoT deployment with respect to range, coverage, deployment, cost,
    battery life, latency, and scalability. The authors in [16] present a low-cost
    solution for an automatic irrigation system. The system consists of a LoRa network
    between sensor nodes and a local gateway with an internet connection through the
    Sigfox network. In [17], the authors present a case study for an IoT-based architecture
    for research and development in precision agriculture and ecological domains.
    The authors in [18] describe the AFarCloud project that aims to support the integration
    and cooperation of the agriculture system to offer better productivity, efficiency,
    food quality, and animal health. Table 1 shows comparisons between previous research
    work on IoT-based architectures for smart farming. Table 1. Comparison among previous
    research work on IoT-based architectures for different smart farming applications.
    As connectivity is one of the most crucial factors that affect smart farming,
    there is a need for seamless connectivity and highly efficient communication among
    different devices and equipment [13]. Previous research has aimed to provide a
    sensor-specific solution such as soil health [7,11], atmospheric data [11], or
    technology-specific solutions such as Wi-Fi [11] and LoRa [10], where the detailed
    analysis of the developed system from different perspectives is missing. Furthermore,
    the selection of a particular technology for a specific application should be
    based on different requirements such as data rate, range, and power consumption.
    Low power wide area network (LPWAN) technologies will play an important role to
    support the deployment of different smart farming applications compared with traditional
    cellular systems [13]. For the adaption of precision agriculture services, the
    integration of heterogeneous IoT devices, the interoperability between different
    platforms and proprietary systems, and the cost of the required technological
    infrastructure are among the main barriers that hinder the adoption of new technologies
    [19]. Furthermore, different parameters should be taken into account for properly
    designing farming applications and services, such as coverage, cost, data delivery
    ratio, energy consumption, throughput, and collisions. The main contributions
    of this work are as follows: Propose an IoT-based platform for remote monitoring
    of large-scale agriculture farms. The proposed architecture consists of four layers:
    farm perception layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer,
    and application layer. Develop a simulation model for the LoRa-based communication
    network of large-scale farms that enable remote monitoring of different sensor
    nodes and measurement devices in the field. Investigate the feasibility of using
    LoRa-based communication for large-scale farms concerning packet delivery ratio,
    number of collisions and throughput. Design, prototype, and implement a LoRa-based
    platform using low-cost devices that enable GPS LoRa tracking and real-time monitoring
    of ambient and soil conditions. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. IoT-Based Architecture
    for Smart Farming This section presents the complete IoT-based architecture for
    smart farming [20,21]. The proposed architecture consists of four layers: farm
    perception layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and
    application layer, as shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. IoT-based architecture for
    smart farming. Farm Perception Layer This layer includes the different monitoring
    parameters such as weather conditions, soil moisture and humidity, plant monitoring,
    machine status, and water monitoring. The farm field includes various sensor nodes,
    actuators, and measurement devices. These nodes could be fixed sensor nodes, mobile
    sensor nodes, agro machines, etc. Sensor nodes are used for acquiring different
    measuring parameters covering, for example, plant, soil, and environment. The
    main objective of this layer is to enable data transmission with minimum human
    intervention. This work targets large-scale farms in Chile. The developed sensor
    nodes are designed to provide real-time tracking of labor activities (human and
    machines) during harvest for traceability and yield mapping. Furthermore, the
    system will be used for measuring the field conditions for two fruit species,
    including blueberry and Hass avocado. Sensors and Actuators Layer Different sensor
    nodes and measurement devices are installed in the field to collect data (e.g.,
    temperature sensors, soil sensors, weather stations, light sensors, humidity sensors,
    images, and videos). The collected data are transmitted to gateways or data collection
    points via wired/wireless communication. Monitoring data from this layer is used
    to keep track of the crop growth, where different parameters could be adjusted
    from the control center side, such as irrigation, fertilization, and pesticides.
    Communication Network Layer The main function of the communication network layer
    is to enable data transmission from the farm perception layer to the application
    layer based on different long-range and short-range communication technologies.
    Such solutions include wired (Ethernet) and wireless (ZigBee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi,
    3G/4G, LoRa, NB-IoT, Sigfox) communication technologies that are used to exchange
    data with the help of field gateways distributed in the field. Other network equipment
    includes network switches, routers, gateways, and base station infrastructures.
    Application Layer The application layer handles all the data received from sensor
    nodes and measuring devices via the communication network layer, as well as data
    storage, analytics, and visualization for different agriculture parameters such
    as weather conditions, irrigation information, soil quality, etc. The received
    data allows the end-user to remotely monitor and control farm operations. Thus,
    the application layer enables farm management, including planning and decision
    making. 3.2. LoRa-Based Architecture for Large-Scale Agriculture Farms 3.2.1.
    LoRa Technology LoRa technology is a promising candidate to support remote monitoring
    of large-scale agriculture farms due to their flexibility and simplicity. The
    LoRa network is based on two main components: LoRa physical layer and LoRaWAN.
    The proprietary LoRa physical layer was developed by the Semtech corporation based
    on spread spectrum modulation and chirp spread spectrum (CSS) [22], while the
    LoRaWAN is an open specification developed by LoRa Alliance [23]. Each LoRa transmission
    includes different parameters such as transmission power, spreading factors (SF),
    code rate (CR), center frequency, and bandwidth. These parameters affect the data
    rate, communication range and robustness of the signals [23,24]. Spreading Factor
    (SF): The ratio between the data symbol rate and chirp rate. The configuration
    of SF affects the data rate and coverage distance. The high spreading factor supports
    low data rates and a long communication range. Code Rate (CR): Is the forward
    error correction rate that affects the airtime of packet transmission. Central
    Frequency: It depends on the industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) band used.
    Bandwidth: It affects the data rate of transmissions. In general, the communication
    network for a LoRa-based architecture consists of a hierarchical topology, formed
    by LoRa nodes which communicate through gateways. The architecture consists of
    LoRa nodes, LoRa gateways, network servers, and application servers. There is
    no association between LoRa nodes and the gateways; however, all gateways within
    the range of a LoRa node can receive messages. The central network server is responsible
    for processing the incoming packets, filtering the duplications, and forwarding
    the messages to the application servers. Figure 2 shows the main elements of the
    LoRa-based network architecture layout for smart farms. Figure 2. LoRa-based network
    architecture for smart farms. Data Acquisition: LoRa sensor nodes are responsible
    for collecting sensing data or control actions (actuators) through communication
    with gateways. Gateways: LoRa gateways are internet-connected devices responsible
    for receiving/transmitting data packets from/to different LoRa sensor/actuator
    nodes. Network Server: The network server is responsible for managing the LoRa
    gateways and handling the duplication of the received packets. Additionally, it
    is responsible for sending/scheduling data and acknowledgment to be transmitted
    for specific nodes. Application Server: The application server is responsible
    for handling LoRaWAN application layer, such as downlink/uplink data encoding/decoding
    and encryption/decryption. 3.2.2. Design Requirements This section provides the
    design requirements that should be considered while designing the IoT-based platform
    for large-scale farms. The performance evaluation metrics include modular design,
    unit cost, system scalability, robustness (ability to handle seasonal climate
    variability), and power management [5,6,19]. Hardware and energy efficiency requirements:
    All sensor nodes and measuring devices in the farm perception layer are exposed
    to harsh environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, rain, and wind
    that may affect the electronic circuits. These challenges should be considered
    during hardware design and implementation. Cost requirements: The total cost of
    the IoT system includes the price of sensor nodes, measuring devices, gateways,
    and base stations. Scalability requirements: The system back-end and databases
    should be able to support receiving information from a large number of sensor
    nodes and measuring devices. Additionally, the system should be able to add new
    hardware and/or software. Network coverage requirements: Wireless communication
    offers many advantages compared with wired-based solutions. However, network reliability,
    interference, and data loss should be evaluated as many sensor nodes use an unlicensed
    spectrum such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi, LoRa, etc. Interoperability requirements: Smart
    Agriculture farms should be able to integrate heterogeneous IoT devices, different
    proprietary systems, and/or platforms at different levels (data acquisition, communication
    network, and applications). 4. Results 4.1. LoRa Network Model and Simulation
    Results The LoRa communication network model is evaluated through simulation.
    The simulation models are based on the Open Source (Framework for LoRa) FLoRa
    Simulator, which is a simulation tool based on OMNeT++ [23,24,25]. FloRa Simulator
    includes different modules that simulate LoRa physical layer, LoRaWAN, gateways,
    and network servers. In FloRa, all the transmission parameters of the physical
    layer could be configured, such as the transmission power, code rate, bandwidth,
    center frequency, and spreading factor. Figure 3 shows the configured network
    topology for sensor nodes located in the playfield of the Universidad Técnica
    Federico Santa María (UTFSM) campus, Valparaiso, Chile. Figure 3. (a) UTFSM campus;
    (b) FLoRa simulation. This experiment aims to evaluate the performance of LoRa
    PHY and LoRaWAN technologies. The main metrics are data delivery ratio (DR), energy
    consumption (EC), throughput, number of collisions, and spreading factor (SF)
    distribution. The main features of LoRa links, energy consumer modules, and network
    elements are given below [20]. LoRa Links: The LoRa transmission is successful
    if the received power is greater than the receiver sensitivity. The model is based
    on the log-distance path loss model and shadowing, where the path loss is based
    on the distance between the transmitter and receiver. Energy Consumer Modules:
    The three main states for the LoRa radio are transmit, receive, and sleep. The
    energy consumed is based on the amount of time spent by the LoRa radio in a particular
    state. Network Elements: The simulation model enables the network end-to-end simulation
    by modeling end-nodes, gateways, and network servers. The gateways and the network
    servers are communicating over IP such as Ethernet and Wi-Fi links. The performance
    of the LoRa communication network is evaluated with adaptive data rate (ADR) and
    without ADR. Different configurations with different numbers of LoRa nodes (100,
    200, 300, and 400) are considered. The main simulation parameters are given in
    Table 2. The simulation scenarios consider one LoRa Gateway connected to the network
    server. Table 2. Simulation parameters for FloRa Simulator. 4.1.1. Delivery Ratio
    The delivery ratio for LoRa networks is defined as the ratio between the number
    of messages correctly received by the network server and the total number of packets
    sent by every node. The delivery ratio gives a number between “0” and “1”. If
    the delivery ratio is close to “1”, then the network could be considered with
    an ideal behavior. However, a value close to “0” means that every transmitted
    packet may not reach the destination. Figure 4a,b show the results of the delivery
    ratio. Figure 4. Delivery ratio: (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. The ADR-enabled
    scheme is preferred for networks with a high density of nodes, as their performance
    does not decrease dramatically over time. For a small number of nodes, LoRa networks
    with ADR-disabled achieve a better delivery ratio than those with ADR-enabled
    due to their less saturated spectrum and fewer collisions. While increasing the
    number of nodes, the communication with ADR-disabled tends to be unstable compared
    with the ADR-enabled scheme, as this value decreases dramatically (about 0.75
    in the case of 400 nodes). 4.1.2. Energy Consumption The energy consumption for
    LoRa networks is defined as the accumulated energy consumption of every node in
    the network in millijoule (mJ). The ADR-disabled case shows similar results of
    power consumption for different packet frequency (28 and 56 packets) with a different
    number of sensor nodes (100, 200, 300, and 400). The energy consumption values
    did not show a significant difference in terms of the number of nodes in the network.
    Compared to the case with ADR-disabled, ADR-enabled communication schemes achieve
    better results with lower power consumption. Figure 5a,b show the results of the
    energy consumption for end nodes. Figure 5. Energy consumption for end nodes:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.3. Throughput The reception throughput
    corresponds to all the acknowledgment and control messages perceived by the gateway,
    which are sent to the end devices, as shown in Figure 6a,b. The transmission throughput
    corresponds to all the data flow that the gateway perceives and is forwarded to
    the network server, which corresponds to the data packets transmitted by the end
    devices. Both scenarios (ADR-enabled and ADR-disabled) are very similar, as shown
    in Figure 7a,b. This confirms that networks operating with or without the “ADR”
    mechanism transmit the same amount of data. Figure 6. Gateway reception throughput:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. Figure 7. Gateway transmission throughput:
    (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.4. Collisions The collision metric is defined
    as the number of perceived collisions concerning the gateway. As shown in Figure
    8a,b, there is a noticeable reduction in collisions in the case of ADR-enabled
    networks. The ADR-enabled mechanism helps in providing better energy usage, a
    higher reception throughput, and fewer collisions. Figure 8. Collisions perceived
    by LoRa gateway (a) ADR-disabled; (b) ADR-enabled. 4.1.5. SF Distribution This
    section analyzes and comments on the SF distribution, comparing the results with
    and without ADR. We chose the distribution result of the 29th run in each case,
    as it is one of the 30 executed runs. The chosen scenario is when nodes communicate
    with the network server every 15 min. When the ADR mechanism is disabled, no SF
    change is taken in the network, resulting in every node having its initial SF
    value. However, with ADR-enabled, at different communication ranges different
    SF values take place in order to provide better performance metrics, as shown
    in Figure 9. Figure 9. SF distribution with different number of sensor nodes:
    (a) 100 nodes ADR-disabled; (b) 100 nodes ADR-enabled; (c) 200 nodes ADR-disabled;
    (d) 200 nodes ADR-enabled; (e) 300 nodes ADR-disabled; (f) 300 nodes ADR-enabled;
    (g) 400 nodes ADR-disabled; (h) 400 nodes ADR-enabled. 4.1.6. Discussion The simulation
    results for data delivery show that more transmission packets imply a lower delivery
    ratio because more sensor nodes are transmitting simultaneously and occupying
    the same channel. In the case of ADR-enabled, a higher delivery ratio is achieved
    compared with ADR-disabled. We can conclude that ADR-enabled is recommended for
    networks supporting a high density of sensor nodes. At the same time, ADR-disabled
    offers better behavior for networks with a lower number of sensors and lower transmission
    frequency. As most of the sensor nodes in the agriculture field will be battery-powered,
    energy consumption is an essential factor for the network lifetime. The results
    of ADR-enabled showed a lower energy consumption than ADR-disabled. Concerning
    the throughput of transmission/reception at the gateway, the results showed that
    end devices are transmitting the same amount of data for ADR-enabled and ADR-disabled
    scenarios. However, the SF distribution in the case of ADR-enabled offers better
    performance and energy usage. In general, the network performance with ADR-enabled
    provides better performance for energy consumption, reception throughput, and
    collisions. A trade-off should be considered while designing a communication network
    with a small number of sensor nodes. 4.2. Localization Results In large-scale
    farms, there are different activities that require information about locations,
    such as people and equipment [26]. This section aims to study different scenarios
    for localization using a low-cost solution, considering off-the-shelf GPS LoRa
    nodes, in order to evaluate the accuracy and operation capability in a real environment.
    The collected real data from the GPS nodes are compared with different high precision
    and high-cost mobile devices. In this work, the GPS LoRa tracking nodes are called
    “Farm Tracker”. These Farm Trackers can be used by persons/machines during the
    cultivation process to acquire GPS data for real-time tracking and harvest management
    and relay it to the control center using LoRa communication. The Farm Tracker
    system has been implemented and tested in UTFSM (Universidad Técnica Federico
    Santa María) campus, Valparaiso, Chile. The collected data from the GPS LoRa nodes
    are compared with Geo Tracker Mobile applications installed on different high
    precision and high-cost mobile devices. The current prototype is a proof-of-concept
    and can be used in various farm applications. Figure 10a shows the satellite map
    for the experimental scenarios for the Farm Trackers. The GPS LoRa nodes setup
    is implemented and tested on the playfield located around the coordinates 33°02′05.3″
    S 71°35′38.5″ W of the UTFSM campus. The total area is about 6705 m2. The playfield
    is covered with grass and surrounded by trees and buildings. There are no obstacles
    (e.g., buildings, trees) in the intermediate terrain. The location of the LoRa
    gateway (Dragino DLOS8) is shown in Figure 10b,c. This is an outdoor LoRaWAN gateway
    which includes a 1 × SX1301 + 2 × 1257 LoRa transceiver. Table 3 shows the technical
    specifications for the Dragino DLOS8 LoRa Gateway [27]. Figure 10. Experiment

    3. Technical specifications for Dragino DLOS8 LoRa gateway. The experiments were
    carried out on 26 January 2022 at 05:00 PM. The Geo Tracker Mobile application
    was the software installed on four mobile phone devices (D1–D4) to collect data
    during the experiment. A smartwatch (D1) was used for data collection among the
    devices. For scenario 1, the closest and longest distance between the mobile devices
    and the LoRa Gateway is about 50 m and 90 m, respectively. For scenario 2, the
    closest and longest distance between the mobile devices and the LoRa Gateway is
    about 20 m and 50 m, respectively. Table 4 shows the mobile device types, brands,
    and models. The data collected from the field are stored in a laptop connected
    to the LoRa gateway for further analysis. The results of the GPS LoRa nodes are
    visualized using OpenStreetMap. Table 4. Mobile devices characteristics. GNSS:
    Global Navigation Satellite System. The measurement was collected using GPS LoRa
    nodes (ESP32 TTGO GPS NEO6 board). In the backside of the module, there is a battery
    holder for a Li-Ion battery which enables the portable operation of the nodes.
    The GPS LoRa nodes are named: ESP32-1, ESP32-2, ESP32-3, ESP32-4, and ESP32-5.
    The node ESP32-2 had a problem during the experiment and was not considered for
    data collection. Smart mobile devices used are smartwatch (D1), LG K41S (D2),
    Samsung S20 (D3), and Xiaomi POCO F3 (D3). The measurements were collected by
    four people. Each person ported a GPS LoRa node (ESP32 TTGO GPS NEO6) and a mobile
    device with Geo Tracker Mobile APP. The four persons start moving simultaneously
    and in the same direction. Table 5 shows the parameter settings for the GPS LoRa
    nodes. The measurements were collected using four LoRa nodes (ESP32-1, ESP32-3,
    ESP32-4 and ESP32-5). Figure 11 and Figure 12 show the movement direction and
    routes for scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively, using the Geo Tracker Mobile
    APP. Figure 11. GPS LoRa results in experiment site for scenario 1 (movement direction

    the GPS LoRa nodes. As explained in the previous section, the prototype of the
    GPS LoRa nodes consists of four nodes. Each node includes a LoRa transceiver,
    GPS receiver, a microcontroller, and Li-Ion battery. Figure 13 shows the schematic
    diagram for the Farm Tracker network. The network is configured as a star topology
    where GPS LoRa nodes transmit data to a central system using LoRa communication.
    For each LoRa frame, the payload includes the device ID and GPS data information.
    The received data can show, in real-time, the locations of the moving nodes and
    visualize them on a map. In this work, the system has been designed to determine
    the real-time locations of farmworkers inside the farm during different cultivation
    activities. However, the system can be extended to support other tracking applications.
    Figure 13. Schematic diagram for the Farm Tracker network. At this stage, the
    most critical metric was to test the ability to receive GPS LoRa data from different
    nodes and GPS accuracy. Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the results of
    scenario 1 and scenario 2, respectively, for the movement direction and route
    using GPS LoRa nodes. The collected data includes the information of Device ID,
    GPS location (latitude and longitude), and a time stamp. The results verify the
    success of the GPS data reception. Figure 16 shows aggregated GPS LoRa results
    for movement direction and route of scenario 1 and scenario 2. In large-scale
    farms, such information is valuable for harvest management [26] and human/machine
    safety [28], which could be used for improving the field logistics and creating
    yield maps. Figure 14. GPS LoRa results for Scenario 1 movement direction and

    Implementation This section explains the design and implementation of the low-cost
    sensor nodes and data transmission. Five sensor nodes have been designed and implemented
    for monitoring different parameters of ambient and soil conditions, including
    temperature, humidity, moisture, etc. Table 6 shows the main specifications of
    sensors used in the design. There are two types of measurements: ambient parameters
    (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, vibration, and ultraviolet) and soil
    parameters (soil moisture and temperature). The complete list of the main sensors
    is shown in Figure 17. Figure 17. Real sensor nodes used for the design (a) Capacitive
    Soil Moisture; (b) DS18B20; (c) BME280; (d) SW-18010-P; (e) GYML8511. Table 6.

    We have implemented five sensor nodes as proof of concept at this stage. The nodes
    have been installed in an indoor environment to collect different monitoring parameters.

    the assembling of the sensor nodes. Figure 20 shows the complete system architecture
    where the configuration of LoRaWAN server on The Things Network (TTN) stack has
    been configured to receive monitoring data from LoRa sensor nodes and visualized
    using ThingSpeak Platform. Figure 21 shows the measurements from sensor node number
    “Heltec 04” since 19 February 2022. The data are available online using the following
    links: Heltec 04 (https://thingspeak.com/channels/1657668), Heltec 03 (/channels/1657672),

    6. Discussion The applications of IoT and LoRa technologies have received great
    interest for their support of different applications in large-scale agriculture
    farms. This work presented the results of the hardware and software platform which
    target large-scale farms. The proposed platform overcomes the challenge of legacy
    solutions, including hardware and services, to support extended coverage. Detailed
    descriptions for the proposed architecture have been given, including the communication
    between sensor nodes, LoRa gateways, and the network server for real applications
    in Chile. Although most of the research has been carried out by conducting different
    experiments for different crop farms, this work has focused on designing and building
    the complete sensor network with low costs (infrastructure investment and operating
    expenses). Furthermore, the developed LoRa simulation model using FloRa showed
    the network performance with respect to data delivery ratio, energy consumption,
    throughput, number of collisions and spreading factor distribution. The main results
    include: Propose IoT-based architecture consisting of four layers: farm perception
    layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and application
    layer. Present a complete system architecture, components, interconnections, and
    detailed implementation of the proposed solution. Design, prototype and implement
    LoRa-based platform using low-cost devices that enable GPS LoRa tracking (Farm
    Tracker) and remote real-time monitoring of ambient and soil conditions. All the
    components have been acquired and purchased from the Chilean market. The platform
    allows the integration of new sensor nodes as well as data visualization. The
    system could be adjusted to collect data locally in a local database without the
    need to access the internet. The current cost of the sensor node is 53,500 CLP.
    The ongoing research work aims to: Develop the energy harvest module using a small
    solar panel to support the autonomous operation of the developed sensor nodes
    for remote real-time monitoring of ambient and soil conditions. Add more low-cost
    sensors to the current prototype, such as wind speed and wind direction. Enable
    notification for critical situations and abnormal values (sudden change from the
    rated values) as well as advanced data processing techniques. Such information
    will help to improve farm operation and productivity. Integrate the monitoring
    data collected from moving nodes such as drones and unmanned ground vehicles (UGV).
    7. Conclusions This work developed an innovative LoRa-based platform that provides
    an inexpensive solution for real-time monitoring of different applications in
    large-scale agriculture farms, including GPS LoRa tracking and monitoring atmospheric/soil
    data. The proposed IoT architecture consisted of four layers: farm perception
    layer, sensors and actuators layer, communication network layer, and application
    layer. The data transmission in the proposed solution is based on low power wide
    area network (LPWAN) using LoRaWAN, which meets the design requirements of large-scale
    agriculture farms. The system has been validated using an actual prototype as
    well as simulation. Data from different sensor nodes are transmitted to the LoRAWAN
    Gateways and then to The Things Network (TTN) platform. The TTN platform is responsible
    for data collection, formatting, and rerouting to ThingSpeak platform for data
    storage, visualization, and analysis. The received data opens new opportunities
    for different data analytics solutions which enable real-time data processing
    and support various forecasting services for farm management. Our ongoing work
    is to develop actuator nodes for controlling and automating different farm operations
    and processes such as irrigation. The developed sensor/actuator nodes will be
    installed in different real environments (mountains and rural areas). Although
    this work was focused on large-scale agriculture farms, it could be applied for
    other applications with similar requirements in the smart grid and smart cities
    domain. Author Contributions Conceptualization, M.A.A. and M.D.Z.; methodology,

    Based on IoT-A and FIWARE Chapter © 2017 1 Introduction The Internet of Things
    (IoT) has an increasing development, mainly because of the continuous efforts
    of a wide community of scientists, developers, vendors, and, particularly, end-users.
    Due to the significant number of solutions and needs, different players identified
    that either the available commercial IoT-enabled products are not suitable to
    their demands, or there is no product for a specific requirement, lacking a generic
    solution that can be reused in different scenarios [1]. IoT solutions generate
    vast amounts of data, creating new demands for computing systems such as distributed
    storage, processing capacity, and communication. Cloud computing facilitates the
    deployment of IoT solutions by providing flexibility in resource allocation and
    centralized management [2]. However, IoT solutions have specific requirements
    and constraints, such as low latency for real-time applications, which the Cloud
    cannot solve alone. A potential solution is moving the intelligence of devices
    to the edge of the network, allowing storage, processing, and low latency capabilities
    closer to the IoT devices. This concept is known as Edge computing and is defined
    as any computing and networking resource between the IoT devices and the cloud
    [3]. Fog and mist computing are introduced as edge computing approaches, acting
    as crucial components to IoT solutions. Fog computing brings the concept of Cloud
    computing solutions closer to things, providing computing and communications resources.
    Mist is the hardware located closest to the devices, is the extreme edge of a
    network. The introduction of edge computing to an already complex IoT solution
    brings new challenges for managing an inherently distributed and heterogeneous
    solution. However, most IoT management approaches in the literature explore two
    aspects of the field: devices (sensors/actuators) and wireless communications
    (LoRa, Wi-Fi, 4G) [4]. The management of real-world IoT solutions faces unexpected
    issues since the end-to-end communication between the things and the cloud passes
    through potentially many intermediate software, hardware, and communication components
    [5]. Practical IoT operational problems arise when the end-to-end dataflow stops
    being updated at the end-user monitoring application. When this happens, there
    is no comprehensive management solution to pinpoint the exact failure location
    and cause, which may be in any software, hardware, and communication component
    along the path between the sensors and the dashboard. The hands-on experience
    gained by managing an IoT-based Smart Irrigation platform for more than three
    years [5] provided us with precious understanding of the fundamental problems
    suffered by IoT systems and impelled us to provide innovative management solutions.
    This paper presents a novel four-layer IoT management architecture (IoTManA) that
    can be applied to different smart applications, such as smart cities, smart agriculture,
    smart health care, and smart industry. The generic characteristic of IoTManA makes
    it able to operate in different environments regardless of the infrastructure
    or platform adopted by the IoT solution. Using a layer-based approach, IoT components
    are represented as Virtual Entities that can support different needs of an IoT
    environment, such as scalability, context awareness, and availability. The IoT
    management system (IoTManS) implements IoTManA for smart water management, developed
    to demonstrate how the IoTManA can be applied to manage IoT solutions in distributed
    locations. IoTManS ensures the availability of the data collected by the sensors,
    the proper operation of the infrastructure—hardware and software components, communication
    between components, and analyzing dataflows and data quality by managing, monitoring,
    and evaluating each component in the end-to-end path. Here, we report a running
    version of IoTManS that manages a Smart Irrigation IoT solution [5] showing how
    it obtains context information to monitor and manage applications, ensuring the
    control needs for a decentralized solution. Also, we show results of testbed experiments
    with smart irrigation and smart city scenarios to demonstrate the practical use
    of our management architecture and system and evaluate performance and scalability.
    This paper brings three main contributions to the IoT management: A management
    architecture that allows mapping how the failure of components in one layer impacts
    components from upper layers. A graph-based view of the end-to-end path between
    devices and the cloud, considering all the components in between, such as software,
    hardware, and communication components. An architecture and modeling approach
    for facilitating an integrated monitoring and failure detection system to automatically
    detect and inform root causes. We highlight that the purpose of our architecture
    is the management of IoT solutions, which makes it different from existing IoT
    Architectures. Whereas there are different architectures for facilitating the
    understanding and development of IoT solutions [6,7,8,9], no similar IoT management
    architectures have been found in the literature. Existing IoT management approaches
    and architectures typically focus solely on device management [10]. This paper
    is organized as follow: Sect. 2 presents the background and related work. Section
    3 details the proposed IoTManA and IoTManS. Section 4 presents the design, modeling
    and implementation of IoTManS and IoTManA based on an IoT smart agriculture solution.
    Section 5 presents a practical implementation of our architecture and system with
    examples and performance evaluations experiments. Section 6 presents and discusses
    the results of the performance evaluation experiments. Finally, Sect. 7 provides
    a discussion and a summary of future works. 2 Background and Related Work IoT
    Management is a complex task due to the distributed nature of such applications
    that can cover a large geographical area with various software, hardware, and
    communication components. Therefore, a successful IoT Solution must provide management
    features that consider high levels of heterogeneity, interoperability, and scalability,
    thus needing a unifying architecture and middleware [11]. In this section, we
    present state-of-the-art IoT architecture and management efforts. 2.1 IoT Architectures
    The IoT concept is based on devices transmitting data through a communication
    channel, and since there is no current leading solution, most standardization
    efforts aim at meeting this concept. Yearbook et al. [12] analyzed several proposals
    that try to meet IoT architecture needs, such as scalability and security. Numerous
    efforts on designing new IoT architectures can be found in the literature focusing
    on software components [6,7,8,9]. Washizaki et al [13] surveyed different architectures
    and design patterns for IoT systems. With the same direction, the International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO) proposes in ISO/IEC 30141 [14] a reference
    model and a reference architecture to generic IoT solutions that meet the characteristics
    necessary in a multi-layer approach based on reusable designs and industry best
    practices. A multi-layer architecture facilitates understanding roles, locations,
    and abstraction levels of different networking, hardware, and software components
    and is nowadays adopted by most IoT Platforms. An IoT platform—also known as IoT
    software platform [1] or IoT middleware [15, 16]—implements an IoT architecture
    providing a variety of building blocks to facilitate the development of an IoT
    solution, such as device connectivity, device management, data management, data
    analytics, security, and visualization [5]. IoT platforms collect data from devices
    and enable the development of IoT solutions that control, monitor, and manage
    these devices. It is often composed of several middleware components, each of
    them focusing on a specific feature in a particular layer to provide an end-to-end
    platform involving data generation, transmission, storage, and processing. The
    growing interest of different sectors of society in IoT technologies and the lack
    of standards opened up the opportunity for a breed of IoT platforms, amounting
    to 650 IoT companies on the open market in 2019 [17]. A drawback of this rapid
    evolution is the proliferation of heterogeneous sensor networks that lack interoperability
    [18]. One approach to this problem is the virtualization of fundamental components
    into programmable objects and communication between them regardless of their communication
    methods [19, 20]. The virtual representation of the object can then be treated
    as an entity within the managed environment, making the system itself also become
    an entity. The concept of virtualization of real components is explored in different
    areas. Girau et al. expand the concept of virtualization to the user, representing
    the user as a virtual entity that executes its tasks through functions [21]. Ray
    surveyed different architectures applied to specific domains such as device management,
    system management, heterogeneity management, data management, monitoring, and
    visualization [22]. The proposals target specific problems or scenarios and platforms,
    strengthened by recent IoT solutions that address specific domains. Frequent solutions
    manage devices [23, 24], applications [25, 26], security [27, 28], and many others
    specific aspects, such as interoperability [29]. Zyrianoff et al. [30] proposed
    a 5-layer IoT Architecture (IoTecture), that provides support for highly distributed
    data management functions and separates physical and data-driven models from application
    services. IoTecture objective is to help the deployment of IoT smart applications
    over different distributed locations in the mist, fog, and cloud implementing
    the concept of IoT computing continuum (IoTinuum) proposed on the same work. IoTinuum
    considers the mapping of software components into physical locations, that provides
    a clear view of the different deployment locations for architectural components,
    divided up into five stages, namely Thing (sensor/actuator), Mist, Fog, Cloud,
    and Terminal (the place where the end-user interacts with a smart application).
    The mist can be considered the lowest hierarchical edge computing system, the
    closest to the devices. Mist components are usually applied to create communication
    facilities such as LoRaWAN gateways and Wi-Fi access points, providing storage
    and processing capabilities [30]. The five stages of IoTinuum define the end-to-end
    information path, starting with data collected by sensors up to commands executed
    by actuators. These five stages might not be necessarily present in all configuration
    scenarios. Instead, depending on application characteristics, requirements and
    constraints, Mist, Fog, or Cloud stages may not be present. IoTManA is an extension
    of IoTecture. While IoTecture provides a reference architecture to IoT Platforms
    and guidelines to deploy a Smart Application focusing on data management, IoTManA
    is an architecture to manage IoT Platforms and Smart Applications that follow
    the IoTecture. In other words, IoTecture and IoTManA are both architectures, but
    the former aims at system development and deployment, whereas the latter aims
    at system management. IoTManA focuses on the data and managing components at different
    layers such as devices, networks, services, and applications executed in the different
    IoTinuum stages. Pena et al. proposed a similar approach of an architectural reference
    model focusing on management, considering the different aspects of IoT Systems
    [10]. However, the proposal does not use a multi-layer approach, limiting the
    architecture to be used only by their own IoT Platform. 2.2 IoT Management Besides
    inheriting management requirements from cloud and edge computing, IoT environments
    have specific challenges such as device, network, and application management that
    must yet consider problems of scalability and heterogeneity. A typical research
    domain explored by IoT solutions is resource management in varied and distributed
    locations like the cloud, fog, or mist. Considering the edge components in their
    approaches, Mostafa et al. proposed an algorithm for the management and effective
    resource selection in fog computing [31]. Martinez et al. surveyed the design,
    resource, and management of fog computing systems focusing on service and resource
    allocation [3]. The same efforts are found in [32,33,34,35], and other studies
    extend the resource management in approaches that consider the mist as a component
    on the edge [36, 37] into the deployment. Bouakouk et al. [38] surveyed different
    paradigms towards Cloud-IoT, analyzing architectures and taxonomy focusing on
    the challenges in edge and cloud computing. Elliot et al. [39] proposed an orchestrator
    to manage Docker containers between heterogeneous cloud service providers, considering
    the challenge of deploying different IoT Platform components . Jain et al. [40]
    propose a similar approach to design the whole distributed IoT application in
    one place, considering different application components to be deployed at different
    edge nodes. Xu et al. [41] addressed the same concept applying a rule engine in
    a distributed hybrid cloud management platform considering the resource allocation
    between different cloud providers, treating the heterogeneity in the cloud level
    . Avasalcai et al. proposed a decentralized resource management technique and
    a technical framework to deploy latency-sensitive IoT solutions on edge devices
    [42]. Sinche et at. [43] surveyed IoT Management technologies, frameworks and
    protocols, focusing on devices and proposing a taxonomy for IoT devices management.
    To the best of our knowledge, in the current literature, there is no architecture
    capable of providing manageability to an IoT solution in different layers simultaneously—software,
    hardware, connections, sensors—and considering a multi-location distributed infrastructure—cloud,
    fog, and mist. Most of the efforts in new architectures are directed to IoT Applications.
    Compared with existing IoT management approaches, our proposal is technology-
    and platform-agnostic and acknowledges critical aspects needed by any IoT solution,
    such as deploying cloud and edge components, infrastructure abstraction, availability,
    and scalability. Our approach deals with data to implement solutions to different
    management problems. Here, we demonstrate how the architecture can be applied
    in a management system that allows failure detection while identifying the root
    cause, i.e., the process of identifying and isolating the main component responsible
    for the failure. 3 IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) The IoT Management Architecture
    (IoTManA) aims at managing different aspects of infrastructure (machines, devices,
    and communications), software components (brokers, databases, services), dataflow,
    and data quality, providing a manageable end-to-end environment. It can be applied
    to different areas due to the representation of components as virtual entities,
    being easy to model any IoT smart solution with heterogeneous devices and components.
    Also, it has been developed and extensively tested in the context of a smart irrigation
    solution [5]. IoTManA follows the IoT Computing Continuum (shortened to IoTinuum)
    [30] and uses a deductive to empirical approach, where the data was collected
    and modeled repeatedly during the development of the smart irrigation platform
    until the proposal reaches a sufficiently satisfying level of conciseness [44].
    Figure 1 depicts the IoTManA 4-layered architecture: Layer 1 (Infrastructure)
    manages devices (sensors and actuators), physical and logical hardware (i.e.,
    bare metal and virtual machines or containers), and network infrastructure. It
    includes the management of sensor, mist, fog, and cloud hardware components. The
    hardware components may be a simple Raspberry Pi, a computer, or a dedicated server.
    This layer also manages the links between the computing components, including
    LoRa or other wireless technology links between device and mist, a WLAN link (e.g.,
    Wi-Fi) between mist and fog, and the Internet connection between fog and cloud.
    Layer 2 (Software Components) manages software components (e.g., services or microservices)
    of the IoT Platform and Applications. Layer 3 (Dataflow) manages the availability
    of dataflows across hardware, software, and network elements. The steps of an
    end-to-end dataflow may be monitored indirectly rather than directly. For example,
    if data is received from a sensor in the cloud, it can be safely assumed that
    dataflow is actively working. Layer 4 (Data Quality) analyzes the data quality
    from two perspectives of veracity. A univariate data analysis performs simple
    checks of data ranges (e.g., maximum and minimum), periodicity (e.g., data received
    every x minutes), and the anomaly of one variable at a time (e.g., a substantial
    unexpected variation of a metric). A multivariate data analysis performs more
    complex analyses of multiple variables (e.g., comparing rainfall with soil moisture).
    Fig. 1 IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) Full size image To provide a manageable
    end-to-end environment, the data availability (Layer 3) and data quality (Layer
    4) are critical components since we consider the endpoint of the flow as the availability
    of the data for consumption. These Layers differ since Layer 3 monitors the hop-by-hop
    dataflow, whereas Layer 4 monitors the end-to-end data quality. IoTManA represents
    a conceptual view of layers that increase abstraction, scope, and softwarization
    level from the bottom up, allowing one layer to be mapped into the layer below
    to link effects and facilitate root cause detection. The coherence between the
    four hierarchical layers is fundamental for guaranteeing that any adverse event
    (e.g., a failure) in a layer that affects components located in upper layers will
    be immediately propagated to the management services in such a way for the cause-effect
    relationship to be understood so that appropriate corrective actions can be taken.
    Even though Layer 4 (Data Quality) is close to the analytical or data-intensive
    models of particular IoT Solutions, it must also be connected to Layer 3 (Dataflow)
    so that the problems in the latter can be mapped to the former. In other words,
    even though platforms may differ in terms of where and how components are placed,
    these layers must be interconnected. IoTManA can be implemented by different management
    platforms, such as our IoTManS presented in this paper. 4 IoT Management System
    (IoTManS) This section presents the process of design, modeling, and implementation
    of the IoT Management System (IoTManS) using a use case based on a Smart Agriculture,
    detailing each software component of the IoTManS and its functions. The same process
    is applied to a simple Smart City solution with a different IoT Platform in order
    to show how IoTManS is not technology-dependent and can manage diverse solutions.
    4.1 IoTManS Design IoTManS implements IoTManA, as depicted by Fig. 2, where the
    color of the boxes relate to the colors of IoTManA layers in Fig. 1. We adopt
    the same color pattern throughout this paper. Components represented by white
    boxes implement more than one layer. IoTManS is composed of a set of software
    components that implement the abstract functions within IoTManA. The key software
    components comprising IoTManS are: IoT Agent: monitors and controls the mist,
    fog, and cloud machinery (physical/logical) and the software components running
    on them. Monitoring is a data collection of hardware/software components functioning,
    such as fault or performance, which is sent to the IoT Manager. There are two
    types of IoT Agents: (1) IoTAgent Infra—for obtaining information from the infrastructure
    and system metrics; and IoTAgent Software—for obtaining data from software components
    such as availability and status. Control means any actuation on hardware, software,
    or communication components, such as turning on/off equipment or software components
    and changing configurations. IoT agents can monitor Docker containers, processes,
    connections between hosts, CPU and memory usage, and application availability.
    Availability is monitored by different approaches to validate the operating state
    of an application, such as sending a request to a health check endpoint in the
    software component (in case of a REST API available) or consuming the service
    (e.g., subscribing in a topic to the MQTT broker and then publish a message, receiving
    the same information in the form of a subscription). IoT Manager: is the core
    of IoTManS, responsible for monitoring, analyses, and actuation actions. The IoT
    Manager receives monitoring data from the IoT Agents and analyzes the end-to-end
    dataflows, handling the data and acting if necessary. It may also actuate remotely
    on IoT Agents, e.g., sending commands for changing the state of monitored components.
    The IoT Manager comprises two sub-components: (a) L1, L2, L3 Manager is responsible
    for the management of the three first layers on the IoTManA Layer; (b) L4 Manager
    that operates as a data quality analyzer; (c) Action Manager that allows changing
    the state of software, hardware, and communication components automatically or
    manually. IoT entity observer: composed of an IoT entity editor (IoTEE) and an
    IoT entity visualizer. The IoTEE allows CRUD (creating, reading, updating, and
    deleting) functions over virtual entities, which correspond to managed physical
    entities. The IoT entity visualizer is a custom dashboard that allows end-user
    and operators to check the status and the historical values (time series) of the
    managed entities. IoT sensor setup (IoTSS) is used in field installations (and
    updates) of physical sensors and their association with virtual entities. IoTSS
    works in places where 4G/Wi-Fi connectivity is not guaranteed due to limited coverage
    or shadow areas. The IoTSS binds the physical device and its digital representation
    in the system as a virtual entity, making it easy to install and manage new devices
    on a virtual level. Fig. 2 IoT Management System (IoTManS) Full size image 4.2
    IoTManS Implementation and Operation Modes IoTManS considers each virtual entity
    as a JSON representation of an entity to be managed, such as software, hardware,
    a communication component, a device, or a system. Virtual entities allow the IoT
    Manager to integrate and manage different aspects of the platform. For instance,
    sensors can be configured by the IoTSS using the virtual entity that contains
    attributes such as publish interval, operation method, format, and address that
    indicates where to publish the data. The software components that compose IoTManS
    were initially deployed onto the FIWARE IoT Platform, using Orion Context Broker
    as the core component for receiving the management messages from the IoT Agents
    to the IoT Manager in a Smart Irrigation solution, which was in turn replicated
    in a lab testbed to evaluate its performance, scalability, and effectiveness.
    Afterward, it was ported to store management messages in the ThingsBoard IoT platform,
    in an attempt to demonstrate that: (1) Both IoTManA and its implementation IoTManS
    are not dependent on particular platforms; (2) The performance of IoTManS depend
    exclusively on the underlying platform and not on the management system. In the
    FIWARE implementation, IoT Agents update the status of each component to FIWARE
    Orion, which notifies the IoT Manager of each new data arrival. A similar approach
    is used in the ThingsBoard implementation, where IoT Agents update the status
    of each component as a device. Unlike FIWARE Orion that only receives the data
    and forwards it, ThingsBoard treats the data from the receiving to the time-series
    data storage, being necessary to use a plugin, also provided by the developer,
    to recover the data from the platform and forwards it to the IoT Manager. In other
    words, the IoT Manager operates as a data consumer of the IoT Platform. Therefore,
    the scalability of the IoT Manager is directly proportional to the scalability
    of the underlying IoT Platform it is implemented on. The IoT Manager has two operation
    modes: Active mode: The IoT Manager periodically polls the graph-based structure,
    implemented by IoTManS to determine the state of each component, detecting and
    creating an event accordingly, updating the graph, and taking the corresponding
    actions. The active mode allows the IoT Manager to handle components that cannot
    be directed monitored (e.g., if the component has no interface or monitoring endpoint).
    For instance, when IoT Agents cannot collect metrics directly from a specific
    component, the IoT Manager can use the graph to analyze the state of each known
    device that composes the end-to-end path between sensors and the cloud. In solutions
    that apply time-driven sensors, IoT Manager can establish a threshold of data
    samples in order to determine the state of a component or Agent. For example,
    if the sampling time is 60 seconds and the threshold is three samples, after 180
    seconds since the last message, the IoT Manager assumes that an IoT Agent is down.
    Passive mode: The IoT Manager does not actively check the graph and waits until
    a message from IoT Agents arrives with management data about the monitored components.
    In this method, the IoT Agent continuously monitors the components and notifies
    the IoT Manager when their state changes. This method can be applied in solutions
    that apply event-driven sensors, where the monitoring by sampling time is not
    relevant. The active and passive modes can be combined for the real-time monitoring
    of certain components, allowing the IoT Manager to act and respond quickly upon
    changes at the monitored components, with no need to wait until the next graph
    polling. The combination of the passive and active modes allows the IoT Manager
    to operate in highly heterogeneous IoT Solutions, as it is able to determine the
    state of components, devices, connections, software, and hardware that are compatible
    or not with the IoT Agents in a stable or unstable environment, and demanding
    real-time monitoring or not. Virtual entities are organized as a directed acyclic
    graph (DAG) where vertices are the monitored components and edges represent a
    cause-effect relationship between components. The use of a DAG allows IoT Manager
    to organize and represent the architecture and allow an easy understanding of
    its components and their relationships. The graph approach also gives the IoT
    Manager the structure necessary to detect and isolate failures. 4.3 Use Case This
    section demonstrates the IoTManS operation in an IoT Smart Irrigation scenario.
    Figure 3 illustrates the deployment of a Smart Irrigation Solution based on the
    FIWARE IoT Platform 1 [5], applying the IoTinuum stages: Thing (soil moisture
    sensors and weather station), Mist (LoRaWAN gateway, Weather Station Collector),
    Fog (ChirpStack [45], MQTT), and Cloud (FIWARE components). Fig. 3 Use Case on
    a Smart Irrigation Solution Full size image In this solution, the sensors transmit
    data to the LoRaPackageForwarder, a software component that receives and forwards
    the messages to the LoRaGatewayBridge, which converts Packet Forwarder protocols
    into a ChirpStack data format. The Mist and the Fog implement a ChirpStack LoRaWAN
    server, an open-source software composed by Chirpstack Network and Application
    Servers, and Redis and PostgreSQL databases. ChirpStack is in charge of the communication
    and management of LoRaWAN devices, using the Mosquitto MQTT broker to exchange
    information between modules. The FIWARE IoT Agent (not the management IoT Agent,
    but the protocol translator) consumes data received by Mosquitto from ChirpStack
    and transforms it into the JSON NGSI [46] format used by FIWARE Orion and FIWARE
    Quantum Leap. Orion is a publish/subscribe broker responsible for creating, registering,
    updating, notifying, and subscribing to the FIWARE IoT Platform. Orion is the
    core of FIWARE, storing only the last state of virtual entities in a MongoDB 2
    database. To preserve historical data, Orion must work with other software components
    that store data, i.e., databases, such as FIWARE Quantum Leap. The latter subscribes
    to an entity and is notified by FIWARE Orion each time this entity is updated,
    converting the data from JSON NGSI to the native CrateDB 3 format. 4.4 Modeling
    Figure 4a illustrates the representation of each component of the managed solution
    as a virtual entity. On Layers 1, 2, and 4, the numbering is on top, representing
    the component itself. On Layer 3, the numbering is between components, since it
    represents the data flowing between them. The components on Layer 1 represent
    the hardware elements and the state of the communication links between them: (a)
    Thing is a generic representation of any connected device; (b) LoRa represents
    the connection between Thing and the Mist; (c) Wi-Fi is the state of the local
    wireless connection between the Mist and Fog; (d) Internet is the component that
    represents the connectivity status between Fog and Cloud; (e) Cloud represents
    the hardware used to host the Application executed in a Cloud service provider.
    On Layer 2, the numbers represent each software component necessary for the IoT
    environment to become operational, creating the end-to-end communication as described
    in Sect. 4.3. On Layer 3, the numbers represent abstractions of the connectivity
    between pairwise components on Layer 2, creating an end-to-end dataflow. The network
    entities (such as Wi-Fi and Internet) represent the connectivity between two entities,
    storing data about latency and availability. In the Smart Irrigation scenario,
    a LoRa EndNode transmitting one packet every minute in a controlled environment
    checks the LoRa connection availability. Suppose the LoRa EndNode is transmitting
    data successfully. In that case, we can assume that the LoRa Radio connection
    is operational, so a failure in retrieving the data is located on the LoRa device
    or the Fog and its components. The IoT Manager can check if the LoRa Connection
    is up by comparing the interval between the current and last transmission time
    from the LoRa EndNode entity. Entities on Layer 3 can be monitored using sniffers
    or other techniques for monitoring the connection between two components. For
    example, Orion and Quantum Leap have counters that store the number of messages
    sent and received, which allow us to verify the correct operation of the end-to-end
    dataflow. Whenever the measurement of a specific connection is not straightforward,
    the state of Layer 3 Components can be determined by the state of the components
    of each end of the connection. On Layer 4, the Data Quality checks the arrival
    of each data to verify its integrity and usability. Figure 4b follows the same
    numbering scheme to represent entities organized as a DAG, handling each layer
    and how each component affects other components on upper layers. Each entity,
    represented as a node, is self-contained with its attributes, such as hardware
    resources, process, and availability. Also, a cross-layer design allows relationships
    between entities from different layers in a bottom-up approach. For example, the
    failure of the mist node (e.g., a Raspberry Pi playing the role of a LoRaWAN gateway)
    causes the LoRa Packet Forwarder and the LoRa Gateway Bridge services to go down,
    which in turn interrupts the communication from the sensors with the following
    components. Fig. 4 a Modeling a smart irrigation solution—b IoTManS components
    and DAG representation Full size image In our approach, upper layers depend on
    lower layers to be operational. Layer 4 analyses the database and messages received
    to determine the data quality, depending on the software and database components.
    Layer 3 represents the dataflow and depends on each software component (Layer
    2) and communication infrastructure (Layer 1) to be available, and any failure
    will affect the whole dataflow since it is continuous. Layer 2 components depend
    on entities that represent the infrastructure where they execute. Layer 2 can
    also represent software dependencies, indicated by the edge connecting components
    5 to 4 at L2 in Fig. 4b. Component 4 (ChirpStack Net Server) depends on component
    5 that represents its database (RedisDB). If the database (5) fails, the ChirpStack
    Net Server (4) will not be operational, and the failure that started at component
    5 propagates to component 4 that also fails. In other words, our graph modeling
    approach represents dependencies between components within the same IoTManA layer
    or from layer N to layer N+1. By making explicit the dependencies of each entity,
    the IoT Manager can analyze the relationship between components and correlate
    their status to determine the health of the platform. This approach also allows
    the IoT Manager to determine the impact of an individual software component in
    the platform, facilitating failure isolation, detection, impact analysis, and
    prevention. Figure 5 represents the DAG illustrated on Fig. 4b in a failure scenario.
    Component 3 on Layer 1 (Mist) presents a failed hardware status. Since it is a
    Layer 1 failure, the IoT Manager can determine its impact on the whole platform
    even before other components detect the failure. The Layer 1 components are not
    directly impacted since there are no co-dependencies. However, the Layer 2 software
    components (2 and 3) executed on the Mist will fail since they depend on the infrastructure.
    This behavior will expand the failure to components 1, 2, and 3 on Layer 3 and
    then the whole dataflow. In this scenario, the IoT Manager can create the reverse
    path to locate and isolate the failure and then pinpoint component 3 on Layer
    3 as the root cause of the problem. The failure of a component that affects the
    operational status of other components executing on upper layers—as the fog hardware
    causing the failure of all software components running on it—is known in the literature
    as a common mode failure. Current approaches do not consider edge components or
    IoT environments. For example, Cerveira et al. deal with common mode failures
    on cloud environments [47] and Mauro et al. use containers to migrate services
    in case of failure [48]. The IoTManS graph approach considers the end-to-end impact
    described on Layer 3 dataflow, not only on the cloud but also on all IoTinuum
    stages. Fig. 5 Component Failure Representation Full size image The fourth Layer
    – Data Quality, is currently performed by the IoT Manager using univariate data
    analysis, periodically checking data ranges and anomalies on the sensor entity.
    Togneri et al. present a preliminary study using multivariate data, considering
    the end-to-end dataflow methods to identify relevant situations, such as sensor
    failures and the mismatch of contextual sensor information due to different spatial
    granularities during the data collection process [49]. IoTManA is generic enough
    to be adapted to different solutions, not being technology-dependent on the managed
    IoT solution. Porting it to other IoT solutions requires knowledge of its components,
    their dependencies, and the dataflows. Figure 6 illustrates the use of IoTManA
    in a generic solution that implements a LoRa Device sending data to a local LoRa
    Gateway connected to the TTN 4 (The Things Network) LoRaWAN server that in turn
    forwards the data to a ThingsBoard IoT Platform 5 hosted on an AWS Cloud Service
    Provider 6, a simple IoT scenario where a device is transmitting data to an IoT
    Platform on the cloud. The Things Network is a collaborative IoT ecosystem that
    creates networks, devices, and solutions using LoRaWAN. It provides tools for
    developers to publish and consume data from various sources and apply them to
    different IoT Solutions. Therefore, Fig. 6 does not represent any IoT solution
    in specific. However, this scenario aims at demonstrating that the modeling can
    be applied to different IoT Solutions, as long as there is prior knowledge of
    how the platform operates, its components, and the dependence between them. Using
    this knowledge, Fig. 7 represents how the components numbered on Fig. 6 can be
    organized in order to describe their dependencies and dataflow. Each component
    is dependent on the related components on layers below, as software is dependent
    on hardware where its executed. On L2, component \"MQTT Broker\" is dependent
    on the availability of the \"ThingsNetworkServer\" and Component 6 (ThingsBoard
    Server) is dependent on its database on component 7 (Cassandra). Fig. 6 Modeling

    size image 5 IoTManS Performance: Methodology In order to evaluate the performance
    and scalability of the IoT Manager, we envisioned two sets of experiments. The
    first set of experiments—failure detection—aims at determining the IoT Manager
    performance regarding the failure detection time using the active and passive
    modes, also analyzing the time needed to isolate the failed component and determine
    the components affected by the failure in single and multiple failures scenarios,
    totaling four scenarios studied. The second set of experiments—Scalability—aims
    to evaluate the scalability of the IoT Manager in a Smart City scenario with a
    varying number of monitored components in two different IoT Platforms. 5.1 Methodology
    5.1.1 Failure Detection Figure 8 illustrates the testbed used in the first set
    of experiments, failure detection on smart irrigation scenario, and shows the
    placement of each software component. The red arrows indicate the IoTMA Software
    and IoTMA Infra collecting the data from software and hardware, respectively,
    and publishing it to a FIWARE Orion that notify the IoT Manager of each data arrival.
    This scenario was deployed in a testbed implementation using four virtual machines
    representing IoTinuum stages (Thing, Mist, Fog, and Cloud), running a complete
    smart irrigation solution [5], but in a controlled testbed environment. SenSE
    (sensor simulation environment) [50] is a simulator capable of generating synthetic
    traffic on a large scale, simulating thousands of devices transmitting LoRaWAN
    messages to the Mist, simulating an IoT Platform in operation. All software components
    are deployed as Docker containers, namely Mosquitto, ChirpStack Network Server,
    Redis, PostgreSQL, ChirpStack Application Server, IoT Agent, FIWARE Orion, MongoDB,
    FIWARE Quantum Leap, and CrateDB. The testbed executes an IoT Platform in execution
    with simulated data from SenSE, and its dataflow is numbered on Fig. 8 originating
    on SenSE through the Mist and Fog until the storage on the Cloud. The command
    injector is a software component used in the experiments to send a command to
    a specific software component, starting or stopping the Docker container and storing
    the timestamp when the command was sent. Thus, the IoT Manager runs in an individual
    virtual machine, not being affected by changes in the monitored environment. Fig.
    8 IoT agent and IoT manager deployment Full size image The connections between
    the Mist, Fog, and Cloud stages are emulated using a WANem [51] (Wide Area Network
    emulator) installation to simulate latency in the Wi-Fi and Internet connections
    with delays of 45ms each. Only the latency parameter is considered. In addition
    to the platform components, an instance of the IoT Agent is executed in each virtual
    machine, monitoring the four stages of the IoT Computing Continuum: Thing, Mist,
    Fog, and Cloud. The IoT Agents monitor the entities and send their status to the
    IoT Manager every 60 seconds. In this scenario, the manager operates the active
    method every 60 seconds. Since we are dealing with multiple virtual machines,
    we synchronized the machine clocks using an NTP (Network Time Protocol) 7, thus
    avoiding affecting the results. The components are represented in Fig. 9, and
    the DAG used by the IoT Manager to manage the components is illustrated in Fig.
    10. Layer 4 is not considered in these scenarios. Fig. 9 Failure detection testbed—components
    representation Full size image Fig. 10 Failure detection testbed—DAG representation
    Full size image Based on real data collected by the IoT Agents during five months
    of operation from the SWAMP Platform [5] deployed with FIWARE, we use a Weibull
    distribution to determine the lifetime of each component. Using this knowledge,
    we create a timeline with the lifetime of each component, determining the time
    of failure and its order. When the time is reached, the command injector sends
    a command to stop the Docker container of the correspondent software component
    storing the timestamp. Using the presented structure and components, the first
    set of experiments evaluates the behavior of the IoT Manager in four scenarios
    considering the main factor the detection time: Failure detection on active mode:
    when the IoT Manager detects a failure, first it creates an alarm, checking, in
    turn, the DAG to determine the root cause and evaluate which components will be
    affected by the failure. The operation time is determined by comparing the timestamp
    generated by the IoT Manager on the failure detection alarm and the timestamp
    generated by the command injector. Failure detection on passive mode: the IoT
    Agents check the monitored component every second, notifying the IoT Manager only
    on state changes. Operation recovery active mode: the command injector sends a
    command to start a component, whose timestamp is stored and compared to the timestamp
    of the IoT Manager when it detects for the first time after the fail that the
    state of the component was changed to normal. Operation recovery passive mode:
    the IoT Agents check the monitored component every second, notifying the IoT Manager
    only on state changes 5.1.2 Scalability IoTManS, like any IoT management system,
    must be scalable to keep up with the massive number of sensors and software, hardware,
    and communication components involved in any effective IoT solution. Figure 11
    illustrates a Smart City solution that uses sensors (1) connected to a mist (2)
    located on a light street pole collecting temperature and air quality data. The
    data is transferred by a software component running on the mist that collects
    it from the sensors and forwards it to a Fog node (3) located nearby through Wi-Fi
    to be stored and processed. The fog node sends the data to the cloud (4) using
    an Internet connection, so the data is available to be consumed by different applications.
    The number of connected devices, sensors, and even Fog nodes scattered around
    the city may vary, and IoTManS needs to be prepared to meet these needs. Fig.
    11 IoT smart city solution Full size image The scenario described can be represented
    in IoTManS as illustrated in Fig. 12, where each end-to-end path is described.
    Figure 13 illustrates the DAG used to manage the smart city solution. Each new
    component—sensor, device, connection, fog—can be readily added as a virtual entity
    and attached to the DAG. Similarly, if one component needs to be removed, it can
    be achieved by removing the node, the branch related to it, and the edges connecting
    it to other independent nodes that can be reused by different components, like
    the fog in this example. Fig. 12 Scalability test—components Full size image Fig.
    13 Scalability test—DAG Full size image Scalability is evaluated for the passive
    mode since the active mode consists of polling the graph at predetermined time
    intervals, and the IoT Manager does not react to them in between polling events.
    In other words, the IoT Manager only considers the graph state when it starts
    the polling, ignoring changes even if they occur during the processing time. This
    experiment evaluates the scalability of the IoT Manager operating in the passive
    mode, where it receives multiple messages from different monitored components,
    detects failures, updates the DAG, and then creates alerts. The purpose of the
    experiment is to determine the number of components that can be managed simultaneously.
    The scenario for the Smart City solution illustrated in Fig. 13 was simulated
    varying the number of components—sensors, Mist nodes, Fog nodes—where IoT Agents
    send monitoring data simultaneously. The performance of the underlying platform
    hosting IoTManS interferes with the results since the IoT Manager is a consumer
    of the IoT Platform and treats each component as an entity. The experiments evaluate
    the performance of the IoT Manager using both FIWARE and ThingsBoard platforms
    managing 1000, 1500, and 5000 components for the scenario depicted by Fig. 13.
    Due to the number of devices, we use simulated components sending data every 60
    seconds using the Poisson distribution with 8, 10, and 40 messages per second.
    These numbers represent, respectively, low, medium, and high traffic and were
    chosen based on our experience on performance evaluations of IoT environments
    explored in [52, 53] and [30]. Each component has a 5% chance to fail in every
    message. When a component fails, a notification is generated with a failure timestamp
    and sent to the IoT Platform that forwards it to the IoT Manager. The IoT Manager
    handles the message, updates the graph, and creates an alert storing the current
    timestamp. The experiment evaluates the maximum number of managed components that
    the IoT Manager can handle before losing data using two IoT Platforms. The processing
    time is the main factor analyzed, comparing the timestamp of the failure to the
    timestamp when IoT Manager detects and handles the failure. 6 Results We present
    here the results of the two sets of experiments. Each experiment was executed
    50 times with an asymptotic confidence interval of 95%. 6.1 Failure Detection
    Table 1 presents the results of the first set of experiments, Failure Detection.
    Table 1 Failure detection results Full size table Failure detection on active
    mode: after the Docker stop command executed by the command injector, the IoT
    Manager detects the malfunction of a component, creates the alarms, determines
    the root cause, and determine which components will be affected by the failure
    in 90.36 s with a 5.64 confidence interval. Figure 14 illustrates the DAG shown
    in 10 failure in the Layer 2 component PostgreSQL located on the Fog before the
    failure, changing to the representation on Fig. 15 after the detection time. Whenever
    an interruption on the dataflow is detected in the active mode, the IoT Manager
    searches the graph in the reverse path to isolate and locate the root cause of
    the failure. After detecting the root cause, in the next iteration (60 s), the
    IoT Manager identifies that the ChirpStack Application Server also fails since
    it depends on PostgreSQL. In other words, the IoT Manager can detect the failure
    in other components before the effective detection by the IoT Agents, since the
    ChirpStack Application Server will try to reconnect to PostgreSQL for some time,
    not necessarily going down at the same time of PostgreSQL. Failure detection on
    passive mode: After the failure is injected, the IoT Manager detects and processes
    the notification in 806 ms with a confidence interval of 6.6ms. Fig. 14 Management
    graph on the dashboard before failure Full size image Fig. 15 Management graph
    on dashboard after failure Full size image Operation recovery active mode: after
    the system recovered from a failure state, the IoT Manager needs 94.56 s with
    a confidence interval of 2.98 s to detect that the system is fully operative again.
    The results are similar to the Failure detection on active mode since both scenarios
    identify state changes in the system. Operation recovery passive mode: the IoT
    Manager detects and processes the notification in 820 ms with a confidence interval
    of 7.3 ms. The difference between the significantly lower processing time needed
    by passive mode and active mode can be explained by the fact that the passive
    mode operates as event-driven while the active mode operates as time-driven. In
    event-driven operations, the notification occurs immediately after the fail, reducing
    the processing time. In the time-driven operation, the IoT Agent operates on a
    fixed time interval, being necessary to wait that time to publish the data. On
    the other hand, the passive mode IoT Agent needs to interact directly with the
    managed device to determine their state, which, since IoT Solutions are highly
    heterogeneous, is not always a possibility. The active mode can operate on devices
    that do not allow direct interaction by considering the states of other components
    connected to these devices. The combination of active and passive modes demonstrates
    how the system can fulfill the needs to operate on complex and heterogeneous IoT
    solutions. Regarding the processing time in both passive and active modes, IoTManS
    demands a time slightly lower than the sampling time, making it adaptable to different
    IoT solutions and needs. In comparison with fault detection techniques such as
    fall-curve [54], which analyzes the behavior of the devices to detect a failure,
    the IoTManS performs better since it does not demand specific hardware and several
    samples to detect the fault. Fault tree analysis techniques adopted in [55] depend
    on historical data to create a minimally valid fault detection mechanism. According
    to Power and Kotonya, a Complex Event Processor technique operating in a distributed
    manner takes an average of 100 ms to process 100 events [56]. Besides having a
    lower failure detection time, IoTManS processing time also includes the diagnosis
    since it can identify the root cause and how the fault impacts the system. Fault
    diagnosis includes three tasks: (i) fault detection—detect a fault or malfunction
    in the systems determining when it occurs; (ii) fault isolation—to determine the
    location of the faulty component; (iii) fault identification—determine the type,
    shape, and size of the fault [57]. In this experiment, IoTManS successfully implemented
    the three tasks of fault diagnosis with success using a signal-based fault diagnosis.
    The information gathered by IoTMan Agents can be used in future work to implement
    more robust fault diagnosis techniques in different components such as surveyed
    in [57] and [58], and specific techniques focused on software repair as surveyed
    in [59]. 6.2 Scalability Figure 16 shows the results obtained on the scalability
    experiments. Even though the FIWARE implementation of the IoT Manager had a lower
    processing time, the platform is more affected by the increasing number of components.
    For example, the processing time is significantly affected from the 1000 scenario
    to the 1500 scenario (88.13–273,79ms), compared to the variation on the exact
    scenarios for the ThingsBoard (3053.44–3085.32ms). With 1500 components, FIWARE
    starts to refuse 10% of the messages received. This behavior occurs due to the
    dependence of FIWARE Orion on the MongoDB database, which demands a lot of computational
    resources for the continuous handling of messages creating a rapid shortage of
    resources. This behavior and limitation of the FIWARE platform were also identified
    in [5] and [30] that analyze the performance of the FIWARE platform in different
    Smart Irrigation scenarios, identifying the MongoDB as the bottleneck of the FIWARE
    platform. Furthermore, FIWARE Orion also lacks efficient message management and
    message queuing, simply rejecting messages that cannot be dealt with immediately.
    As a result, FIWARE was not able to execute the scenario with 5000 components.
    The ThingsBoard Platform implementation of the IoT Manager requires considerably
    more time to handle the messages than FIWARE since the platform operation is different,
    not just forwarding the message but internally processing, storing, and forwarding
    the message using a plugin. On the other hand, it reveals higher stability in
    supporting a large number of components. The Things Boards platform was able to
    handle 5000 components sending data every 60 seconds without losing data. In both
    implementations, the IoT Manager received and handled all messages without any
    loss. In other words, the IoT Platform drops data when its limits are reached.
    Fig. 16 Processing time on scalability scenario Full size image 7 Conclusion Our
    IoTManA and IoTManS approach for the management, deployment, configuration, monitoring,
    and maintenance of IoT solutions is a generic approach applied to different applications,
    such as Smart Agriculture, Smart Cities, Smart Health Care, and Smart Industry.
    The abstraction obtained with the virtualization of the components organized in
    a multi-layer architecture can provide management at levels such as system, application,
    device configuration, deployment, monitoring, and failures, automatically informing
    root causes of problems. Furthermore, the graph representation and visualization
    allow the understanding and mapping of the complexity and components and how components
    relate in an IoT solution. Direct acyclic graphs are a generic method to correlate
    different components in an inherently distributed, complex, and heterogeneous
    IoT environment. This approach could be modeled in a way that allows entities
    to be dependent on their characteristics. For example, an application requiring
    a minimum free disk space to operate correctly can depend on its virtual entity
    and monitor the available disk space needed to be available, creating alarms or
    taking actions to guarantee its execution. In addition, the graph-based approach
    can increase context awareness to IoT Manager. The IoT Management Architecture
    and IoT Management System are successfully implemented in a real IoT Solution
    using different IoT Platforms as its core, managing with success at multiple IoT
    solutions levels and showing that the proposal is generic, scalable, and no technology
    dependent on the managed environment or in a specific IoT Platform to manage the
    messages. Future work intends to explore the data collected by IoT Agents and
    managed by IoT Manager to develop mist, fog, and cloud awareness and placement,
    deployment, and resource management techniques. Finally, we intend to explore
    techniques applied in the data quality analysis necessary to Layer 4. Finally,
    applying the concepts proposed in this paper, we intend to develop a generic self-managed
    system. Notes https://www.fiware.org. https://www.mongodb.com. https://crate.io.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Chennai, India SECTION I. Introduction Because
    of the lack of land due to the growth of commercial and metropolitan regions,
    agriculture, a vital social function, is becoming erratic. The truth should be
    confronted that agricultural land is running out and the utilization of agricultural
    land is growing. And people lose interest in agriculture as a result of the lack
    of intelligent automation systems. Utilizing drainage water results in recycling
    wastewater with environmentally friendly dirt-absorbing capsules, which has a
    significant influence on lowering greenhouse gas emissions [1]. The 2015 Status
    of the World''s Soil Resources report delivered by the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) Intergovernmental Technical Panel on Soils raised worldwide attention tosoil''s
    basic job in life on the planet yet assessed that 33% of the land is moderate
    to profoundly corrupted, and it is deteriorating. The report recognized 10 principal
    dangers to soil''s capacity to work: soil disintegration, soil natural matter
    misfortune, supplement lopsidedness, soil fermentation, soil defilement, waterlogging,
    soil compaction, soil fixing, salinization and loss of soil biodiversity [2].
    The ongoing directions have possibly horrendous results and a large number of
    individuals are in danger, particularly in probably the weakest locales. As the
    soil condition is very weak there isno nutrient in the crop which is yielded [3].
    Crop monitoring being a vital parameter is not done efficiently nowadays; to solve
    that problem the proposed method includes a pH sensor, Total Dissolved Solids
    (TDS) sensor, Dissolved Oxygen (DO) sensor, Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) sensor,
    water levels sensor and soil moisture sensor to monitor the crop parameters [4].
    With the advent of robots, the ESP8266 Wi-Fi module is used to transfer sensed
    data to the cloud, and the NRF24L01module is utilized to transmit and receive
    data even in faraway locations. With the introduction of cutting-edge technology
    in an approachable way, people can benefit from cultivating crops on drainage
    basins. 1.1 Manmade Disasters The manmade disasters related to this study are
    discussed in this section as follows: a) Global Warming Rising concentrations
    of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) are warming the environment. The expanded temperature
    brings about higher assessment rates and a wetter climate, which prompts a pattern
    of additional warming. The typical worldwide temperature has expanded by around
    1.4 degrees Fahrenheit (0.8 degrees Celsius) throughout recent years, as per the
    National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). b) Deforestation Somewhere
    in the range of 2015 and 2020, the pace of deforestation was assessed at 10 million
    hectares each year, down from 16 million hectares each year during the 1990s.
    The area of essential backwoods overall has diminished by more than 80 million
    hectares beginning around 1990. c) Soil Erosion Soil degradation most ordinarily
    starts with culturing like furrowing and harrowing, the soil aggregates to fall
    to pieces, which then, at that point, causes loss of soil natural matter as life
    forms. This speed up degradation since soils with lower natural matter substance
    and less accumulation are more inclined to speed up degradation. Soil erosion
    proceeds and supplements decline to levels excessively low for good harvest development.
    d) Water Contamination In numerous locales of the world, districts and industries
    release wastewater into open depletes atfirst planned for the transport of just
    agricultural drainage water. In non-industrial areas particularly, metropolitan
    and modern wastewater is frequently deficiently treated before removal into such
    open channels. The outcome is a gamble that farming drainage water quality is
    polluted withmicroorganisms, microbes, hazardous organics, and minor components
    including weighty metals. 1.1. Existing Solution (a) Hydroponics Hydroponics [5]
    is a kind of cultivation and a subset of hydroculture that includes developing
    plants, normally crops, without soil, by involving water-based mineral supplement
    arrangements in fluid solvents. This is shown in figure 1. Earthbound or oceanic
    plants might develop with their underlying foundations presented to the nutritious
    fluid, or, moreover, the roots might be upheld by an idle medium, for example,
    perlite, rock, or other substrates [6]. Despite inactivemedia, roots can cause
    changes in the rhizosphere pH and root exudates can influence rhizosphere science
    and physiological equilibrium of the supplement arrangement by optional metabolites
    [7], [7], [9]. The supplements utilized in the tank-farming frameworks can emerge
    from a wide rangeof sources, including fish dung, duck compost, bought synthetic
    manures, or fake supplementsolutions [10]. Plants regularly developed hydroponically
    in a nursery, on dormant media, incorporate tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, strawberries,
    lettuces, and weed, typically for business use, and Arabidopsis thaliana, which
    fills in as a model creature in plant science and genetics [11]. Hydroponics offers
    many benefits, strikingly a decline in water utilization in horticulture. To grow
    1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of tomatoes utilizing escalated cultivating techniques requires
    400 liters (88 devil lady; 110 U.S. lady) of water; utilizing tank-farming, 70
    litters (15 pixie lady; 18 U.S. lady); and just 20 litters (4.4 demon lady; 5.3
    U.S. lady) utilizing aeroponics [12]. Since tank farming takes significantly less
    water to develop products, it very well may be conceivable coming soon for individuals
    in unforgiving conditions with minimal available water to become their food [13].
    Fig. 1. Hydroponics Show All (b) Deep Water Culture Deep Water Culture (DWC) is
    a tank-farming technique for plant creation by suspending the plant establishes
    in an answer of supplement-rich, oxygenated water. This is shown in figure 2.
    Otherwise called profound stream strategy Deep Flow Technique (DFT), drifting
    pontoon innovation, or raceway, this strategy utilizes a rectangular tank short
    of one foot deep loaded up with a supplement-rich arrangement with plants drifting
    in Styrofoam sheets on top [14]. This strategy for drifting the sheets on the
    supplement arrangement makes a close to rubbing less transport line of drifting
    rafts [15]. DOC, alongside supplement film procedure, and total culture, is viewed
    as quite possibly the most well- known tank - farming framework utilized today.
    Ordinarily, DWC is utilized to develop present-moment, non-fruiting yields like
    salad greens and herbs [16]. The huge volume of water mitigates quick changes
    in temperature, pH, Electrical Conductivity (EC), and supplement arrangement composition
    [17]. Fig. 2. Deep water culture Show All (c) Drip System Hydroponics (DSH) In
    trickle framework aqua-farming, the water-based supplement arrangement is conveyed
    to the underground root growth of plants utilizing a dribble water system. This
    is shown in figure 3. This sort of low-stream water system is very water-proficient,
    keeping away from squandering because of vanishing by giving dampness through
    sluggish dribble at the foundation of the plants instead of emulating precipitation
    from a higher place. When intended for plants in discrete compartments that are
    managed exclusively, a tank-farming trickle framework will gradually and consistently
    give dampness and supplements precisely when and where it''s required. Utilizing
    a siphon situated in the supplement arrangement repository, tank-farming trickle
    frameworks convey the supplement answer for the underlying foundations of plants
    through dribble producers [18]. The siphon is normally associated with a clock
    that computerizes the water system plan. The framework can be set up so there''s
    no less than one producer conveying arrangement straightforwardly to the root
    mass of every plant. Also, assuming your producers have components permitting
    you to control their results, you can change how much arrangement each plant gets
    as indicated by the requirements of that specific plant. Notwithstanding, trickle
    framework aquaculture doesn''t need to be simply convoluted. With straightforward
    vertical nurseries, for instance, all you want are the trickle producers at the
    extremely top [19]. Whether or not it''s a vertical or a standard-level developing
    framework, the supplement arrangement will stream down through the developing
    medium, and when it arrives at the base, that hasn''t been taken up by plant rootsend
    route will be either gotten back to the repositoryfor reuse or disposed of. Fig.
    3. Drip system hydroponics Show All (d) Aeroponics The fundamental rule of aeroponics
    development is to develop plants suspended in a shut or semi-shut climate by splashing
    the plant''s hanging roots and lower stem with an atomized or showered, supplement-richwater
    solution [20]. This is shown in figure 4. The leaves and crown, frequently called
    the shade, stretch out above. The underlying foundations of the plant are isolated
    by the plant support structure. Frequently, shut cell froth is packed around the
    lower stem and embedded into an opening in the aeroponics chamber, which diminishes
    work and cost; for bigger plants, trellising is utilized to suspend the heaviness
    of vegetation and organic product. Preferably, the climate is kept liberated from
    bugs and sickness so the plants might becomebetter and more rapidly than plants
    filled in a medium. Be that as it may, since most aeroponics conditions are not
    impeccably deterred from the outside, bugs, and illness might in any case cause
    danger. Controlled conditions advance plant improvement, well-being, development,
    blossoming, and fruiting for some random plant species and cultivars. Because
    of the responsiveness of root foundations, aeroponics is frequently joined with
    customary tank farming, which is utilized as a crisis “crop saver” - reinforcement
    nourishment and water supply - if the aeroponics device comes up short. High-pressure
    aeroponics is characterized as conveying supplements to the roots using 20- 50
    micrometer fog heads utilizing a high-pressure (80 pounds for every square inch
    (550 kPa) stomach siphon. Fig. 4. Aeroponics Show All (e) Nutrition Film Technique
    (NFT) An appropriately planned NFT framework depends on utilizing the right channel
    incline, the right stream rate, and the right channel length. This is shown in
    figure 5. The plant attaches are presented to satisfactory supplies of water,
    oxygen, and supplements. In prior creation frameworks, there was a contention
    between the stocks of these prerequisites, since unnecessary or lacking measures
    of one outcome in the unevenness of either of the others. NFT, as a result of
    its plan, gives a frameworkwherein each of the three prerequisites for solid plant
    development can be met simultaneously, given that the straightforward idea of
    NFT is constantly recalled and drilled. The consequence of these benefits is that
    more significant returns of great products are gotten over a long time of editing.
    A drawback of NFT is that it has very little buffering against breaks in the stream,
    like a consequence of a blackout. Be that as it may, in general, it is one of
    the more useful techniques. Similar plan attributes apply to all customary NFT
    frameworks. While slants along channels of 1: 100 have been suggested, practically
    speaking it is challenging to fabricate a base for channels that are adequately
    consistent with empowering supplement movies to stream without ponding in privately
    discouraged regions. As an outcome, it is prescribed that inclines of 1: 30 to
    1: 40 be utilized. This considers minor abnormalities in the surface, yet, even
    with these slants, ponding and waterlogging may happen. Theslant might be given
    by the floor, or seats or racks might hold the channels and give the necessary
    incline. The two strategies are utilized and relyupon the neighborhood, not set
    in stone by the site and yield prerequisite. Fig. 5 Nutrition film technique Show
    All Fig. 6 Proposed technique Show All The proposed solution shown in figure 6
    involves the integration of IoT and sophisticated robotics in drainage basins
    for wholesome agricultural development with the aid of monitoring leading to climate
    change mitigation, soil erosion, and many manmade disasters [21–23]. Artificial
    Intelligence systems can also be integrated into the proposed system for obtaining
    better yield and prediction of the yield in an advancedmanner [24–25]. a) Use
    of Drainage Basin According to Archimedes'' principle, a submarine or a boat can
    drift because the heaviness of water that it uproots is equivalent to the weight
    of the boat. This dislodging of water gives an up thrust that acts inverseto gravity,
    which would pull the boat down. The same principle we are using to design our
    working prototype in the drainage basin. The prototype is designed in such a way
    that there will be an inlet and outlet for water in a floating tray. To counterbalance
    the sinkage of the tray the prototype is integrated with IoT in which the inlet
    and outlet of water are maintained. Also, the submarine has versatile arrangements
    of short “wings” called hydroplanes on the stern (back) that assist to control
    the point of the plunge. To keep the tray level at any set profundity, the tray
    keeps a distance between air and water. Causing the tray to move as though it
    were a submarine the use of drainage water and avoiding the reliance on agricultural
    land for crop growth has a positive impact on meeting the water demand. Nitrogen
    and phosphorus, which are soil nutrients that aid in plant growth, are nutritional
    components found in drainage water. The drainage water also contains a lot of
    nutritive components since it mixes with minerals. The use of Fe6 capsules, which
    function as an excellent absorbent in absorbing dirt, is cost-effective and has
    positive effects on cleaning the water in cases when there is dirt present in
    the water. b) Advanced Robotics Used for Crop Cultivation Problems will arise
    when physically sowing crops and pulling weeds. Robotics can be used to solve
    such issues. The principal area of use of robots in horticulturetoday is at the
    collecting stage. Arising utilizations of robots or robots in horticulture incorporate
    weed control, sowing seeds, collecting, natural checking, and soil examination.
    A couple of mechanical advances as of late have prompted the improvement of a
    significant number of the robots recorded underneath. Numerous agrarian automatedprogressions
    use machine vision innovation to stay away from perils, recognize yields, and
    even decide whether they are fit to be reaped. Machine or PCvision regularly includes
    a camera or numerous cameras taking care of data to the robot that permits itto
    find and access the harvests around it. Machine vision makes it feasible for robots
    to perform assignments like weed picking, development checking, reaping, arranging,
    and pressing. Satellite area frameworks like Global Positioning System (GPS) have
    additionally made a significant number of advances in rural mechanical technology
    conceivable. Mechanical homestead hardware frequently depends on GPS data to position
    and find themselves on ranches. Independent fieldfurrowing, cultivating, or exploring
    work vehicles and hardware might utilize a blend of PC vision sensors and GPS
    to explore and go about as the driver in mechanical furrowing trucks. One more
    innovationutilized in agrarian robots is Artificial Intelligence(AI). AI gives
    a high -level strategy for distinguishing impact ways that can assist independent
    vehicles withfiguring out how to adjust and keep away from newor unforeseen dangers
    in their ways. It additionally empowers picking and quality control robots to
    advance as they go, and to foster the best techniques for recognizing and executing
    their undertakings. Robotized drone seeders are for the most part utilized in
    ranger service businesses at present; however, the potential for more far and
    wide use is not too far off. Planting with drones implies exceptionally difficult
    to arrive at regions that can be replanted without imperiling laborers. They are
    likewise ready to establish considerably more proficiently with a group of two
    administrators and ten robots equipped for establishing 400,000 trees perday.
    Independent accuracy cultivating is a moderateinnovation that joins mechanical
    technology and Geographic Information System (GIS) planning. By producing a guide
    of a field and including data about soil properties, for example, thickness and
    soilquality, independent seeders can seed more precisely than customary transmission
    spreading seeders or robot seeders. c) Integration of IoT This technique depends
    on IoT, which assists in observing and continuous monitoring of water-quality
    parameters such as pH using a pH sensor, Total Dissolved Salts using a TDS sensor,
    Dissolved Oxygen using a DO sensor, moisture content of soil using a moisture
    level sensor, water level of the tray using water level sensor. In addition to
    all these sensors, the prototype is also built with an LDR sensor which is also
    called a light-dependent resistor for observation of solar radiation and power
    generation the working of all those above-mentioned sensors is provided using
    solar and also a backup system if internet connectivity is lost. All of these
    sensors have microcontroller integration. NRF24L01 transceivers are also used
    for data transmission and reception, and an advanced Wi-Fi module integrated Arduino
    board is used to transfer data to the cloud for users to monitor the crop. Although
    there won''t be a network in remote locations, data can still be transferred to
    the cloud from a server with network access by transmitting the data to the server
    through a transceiver. IoT in agribusiness utilizes robots, drones, far-off sensors,
    and PC imaging joined with constantly advancing AI and scientific devices for
    checking harvests, reviewing, and planning the fields, and giving information
    to ranchers to objective homestead the executives intend to set aside both time
    and cash. With IoT, organizations can appreciate benefits like better harvest
    efficiency and further developed specialist well-being. They can utilize less
    manure, water, and pesticides. Since ranchers can diminish the composts and pesticides
    they use, there are fewer overflows into groundwater and waterways. This outcome
    leads to a lower influence on the biological system. d) Low Energy Use One more
    natural advantage of natural cultivating is the decrease in energy use. A few
    well-known yields, for example, com require nitrogen -rich soil which is ahigh
    energy use item whenever cultivated in traditional ways. Regular cultivating accomplishes
    this by vigorously splashing with nitrogen -richmanures. Energy estimations start
    with the assembling and transportation of these items. Moreover, the utilization
    of hardware for rehashed uses of the less viable manure brings about a by and
    large higher energy need than that of natural cultivating. Natural cultivating
    accomplishes the nitrogen-rich soil; all things being equal, by utilizing treated
    soil compost and the utilization of cover crops. SECTION III. Conclusion The proposed
    idea is distinctive because of the use of drainage basins, sophisticated robotics,
    and IoT. The sewage''s nutritious content contributes to about 56% of plant development.
    The installation of IoT helps and continuously monitors the plant field for changes
    and also maintains control over the functioning of sensors, and the employment
    of robots for crop cultivation such as weed control, soil examination, seeding,
    etc. Overall, this will therefore technically be beneficial for the crops raised
    using these methods. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More

    India SECTION I. Introduction The global urban population is rapidly growing,
    especially in developing nations. In 2018, 55.3% of people worldwide lived in
    urban settings, and by 2030, that number is expected to reach 60%. The real time
    monitoring of an agriculture environment is a crucial task among the researchers
    to develop a real time measurement system The environmental vital parameters need
    to be measured and system performance has been periodically assessed to test the
    system for developing smart farming. Smart farming is executed with the application
    of various technologies in order to analyze the environmental vital parameters
    such as nutrients in soil, moisture content, temperature, pressure, soil gases
    etc. The systemis designed in which the data is to be acquired, stored, exchanged
    via various distributed sensors in the farm land. Smart farming involves agricultural
    sensors and Internet which helps to acquire data of various environmental vital
    parameters and share the information with the farmers periodically. The development
    of smart farming system employing different physical sensors to detect the environmental
    quantity. In addition, the smart wearable monitoring system has the potential
    to measure and monitor these vital parameters continuously and provide an instant
    support to the farmers to assess the plant growth status. Basically, the plant
    growthmainly depends on the distribution of solar radiation which is the main
    source for all living things. The electromagnetic energy created by the sun''s
    solar radiation, which is a result of nuclear fusion. The primary source of all
    physical and biological processes on earth is solar radiation. Solar radiation
    or power obtained per square meter (Wm2) is referred to as Solar irradiance. There
    are two types of solar radiation: diffused solar radiation, in which the light
    from the sun is absorbed, scattered, and reflected by the atmosphere; and direct
    beam solarradiation, in which the light directly strikes the earth. The climate
    of the environment is impacted by even little variations in solar radiation. A
    surplus of solar radiation also has an impacton agricultural fields and human
    health. In essence, frequency or wavelength are used to express solar radiation
    measurements. Frequency is calculated as the number of wavelength cycles per length,
    expressed in hertz (Hz), and wavelength is simply the distance between the peaks,
    expressedin nanometers (nm). The measurement of solar radiation becomes very important
    which drives the process of photosynthesis. The distribution of solar radiation
    lies on the structure ofelectromagnetic spectrum which generally contains UV radiation,
    visible radiation and infrared radiation. The solar spectrumreaches the earth
    surface is also reflected by many sources such as clouds and other parts. The
    plants are not taking the entire solar radiations. The majority of solar radiation
    that reaches the planet is visible. The UV radiation reaching the surface is quite
    little. Solar energy is essential in an agricultural area from the time the seed
    is planted until the plant has reached full majority. Additionally, photosynthesis
    uses solar energy as a fuel source. Photosynthesis is a process that promotes
    plant development while lowering atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. It increases
    the atmospheric oxygen content. Day and night shifts in the amount of radiation
    that reaches the earth''s surface. The angle of the sun with the earth determines
    it. The light energy from 400nm to 700nm are called visible band which is the
    main part of light spectrum for plant photosynthesis. The UV radiation from 100nm
    to 350nm is the main source for damaging the plant growth and infrared radiation
    which is greater than 700nm dries the plant and soil. The accurate measurement
    of these environmental parameters helps the farmer to monitor the plant growth
    and takes the necessary control actions based on real time data. The transmission
    of solar radiation at earth surface is depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1: Solar radiation
    transmission Show All This article presents a descriptive study on different methods
    for monitoring environmental parameters and list the types of sensors involved
    in smart farming, embedded hardware interfacing, IoT with wireless protocols.
    IoT enabled smart farming is the key to success in precision agriculture. The
    importance and need of measuring the environmental parameters and monitoring them
    paves the way for the design of real time smart farming system. SECTION II. System
    Architecture Overview Agriculture is the practice of cultivating land or growing
    food crops on a sizable field which includes cereals, fruits and vegetables. Agriculture
    encompasses products such as cotton, leather, wood, and others in addition to
    food crops, supporting and enhancing human life. Agriculture''s interactions with
    the environment have a significant impact on our ecosystem Increasing agricultural
    production benefits all living things, including humans. Agriculture''s environmental
    impact is influenced by a number of climatic factors, including terrain, rainfall,
    temperature, soil quantity, and water availability. Environmental issues associated
    to agriculture include the following significant issues: climatic change, improper
    soil and plant health monitoring, a lack of irrigation systems, pollution, and
    deforestation. Developing an irrigation system and applying fertilizer to the
    area will help the soil condition for agriculture. The population is increasing
    at an unsustainable rate, cultivable land is disappearing, and environmental parameters
    are being severely impacted, necessitating an increase in food production. Numerous
    environmental conditions exist that have an impact on agricultural output worldwide.
    This has a negative impact on farmers both mentally and financially. In order
    to maximize crop output and maintain farmland, it is essential to regularly evaluate
    cultivable land because crop productivity can change drastically in a short amount
    of time. By monitoring the big acre fields, current technologies have played a
    major part in the development of a system to meet these criteria. There is a significant
    demand for physical manpower and rising cost to monitor big acres. In recent years,
    several sensors and wireless protocols have been used to monitor agricultural
    fields. The installation of sensors at fields offers a reliable way to collect
    data and transfer it through a wireless network. The farmers in the producing
    areas won''t be benefited from the monitoring system''s existence alone. After
    keeping an eye on the crucial environmental indicators, it is vital to bring a
    solution to govern the manufacturing fields. This can be achieved by creating
    a wearable environmental monitoring device. The technological overview for the
    development of wearable environmental monitoring system is presented in Fig. 2.
    Fig. 2: Proposed system architecture for wearable environmental monitoring system
    Show All The wearable environmental monitoring system becomes very necessary to
    estimate the critical environmental parameters for good agricultural productivity.
    The main factors that need to be regularly examined are sun radiation, soil quality,
    temperature and atmospheric pressure humidity. These metrics can be seen by numerous
    agricultural sensors in huge farm areas. The usage of sensors aids farmers in
    understanding the health of their plants so that they may address issues based
    on the data gathered and produce abundant crops. To sense crucial metrics and
    trigger the controller to execute its instructions, a variety of sensors and regulating
    devices are used. Various types of sensors are utilized to track the soil, rainfall,
    temperature, sun radiation, atmospheric pressure and position. These sensors''
    main objective is to continuously monitor environmental variables so that farmers
    can increase crop yields. Fig. 3: Significant role of wems Show All A. Uses of
    Sensors in Smart Farming It is necessary to develop a system to estimate the critical
    environmental parameters for good agricultural productivity. The main factors
    that need to be regularly examined are sun radiation, soil quality, temperature,
    and atmospheric pressure humidity. These metrics can be seen by numerous agricultural
    sensors in huge farm areas. The usage of sensors aids farmers in understanding
    the health of their plants so that they may address is sues based on the data
    gathered and produce abundant crops. To sense crucial metrics and trigger the
    controller to execute its instructions, a variety of sensors and regulating devices
    are used. The soil, rainfall, temperature, sun radiation, atmospheric pressure,
    and location are all monitored using various types of sensors. These sensors''
    main objective is to continuously monitor environmental variables so that farmers
    can increase crop yields. Wireless modules or mobile phone applications with cellular
    towers can control these sensors directly. Capacitive sensors, inductive sensors,
    photoelectric sensors, distance sensors, infrared sensors, motion sensors, humidity
    sensors, temperature sensors, light sensors, sound sensors,pH sensors, UV sensors,
    soil moisture sensors, and air flow sensors are just a few of the agricultural
    sensors that can be used to monitor agricultural fields. GPS is used by location
    sensors in order to function. It is employed to determine the farm''s precise
    location. Optical sensors use light to determine the characteristics of the soil,
    such as its organic matter, mineral content, air and moisture. Electrochemical
    sensors can measure the pH and nutrient content of soils. Mechanical and air flow
    sensors assess air flow rate and soil compaction. Farmers may identify and track
    the state of their land and plant growth using the data that has been gathered
    utilizing sensors. To obtain information from the sensor and create the control
    signal needed to activate the required output devices, a variety of controlling
    devices are used. Included in the control action''s implementation are systems
    for automatic irrigation system control, motor speed control, and water tank level
    control. B. Methods for Monitoring Environmental Parameters An environmental key
    parameter such as temperature, humidity, solar radiation, water irrigation level,
    pH content in the water, moisture in soil, crops disease can be monitored using
    different technologies. According to the literature, the radio frequency setup
    can be used for sending and receiving the real time data through sensors [1].
    Also, Intra network monitoring systemhas an integration of precision sensors with
    cameras to measure the values of environmental parameters and delivers the important
    state of their plant conditions. Wireless sensornetworks (WSNs) with various sensornodes
    provides an efficient approach for monitoring the environmental vital parameters
    [2]. Sensors implemented with ZigBee technique is capable of handling of monitoring
    severe environmental conditions [3]. Automatic drip irrigation control system
    with sensors installed in the field to collect the data of moisture in soil, temperature.
    The system is implemented with low-cost sensors to reduce the water wastage. Automatic
    drip irrigation control system works based on soil temperature and moisture level
    in order to maintain the water level [4]. Wireless Sens or Networks (WSNs) with
    Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is also proposed to measure soil moisture, crops
    disease [5]. C. Embedded System Design for Wems The development of wearable environmental
    monitoring system mainly depends on the design of analog front end unit which
    consists of sensor, processing unit, microcontroller and wireless connnunication
    devices. The sensing technology and their integration with microcontroller offers
    the rapid view of acquiring the environmental signals. The flexibility of software
    programming languages could serve a source for designing the WEMS with greater
    functionality. The development of portable devices in an agriculture environment
    plays a vital role for measuring and monitoring applications. The embedded hardware
    and programming software can be integrated to develop a miniaturized device for
    monitoring the environmental vital parameters. The main advantage of developing
    a wearable environmental monitoring system in an agriculture environment is to
    provide continuous monitoring of real time data. The major consideration of designing
    a wearable device is low cost, low power consumption, long time monitoring, energy
    saving, preventing the data loss, data security and timely connnunications. D.
    Use of Network Protocols The environmental vital information can be connnunicated
    with the support of different network protocols. The research reported that soil
    and environmental information were collected and transmitted with Long-Range Wide
    Area Network (LoRa-WAN) [19]. Here, the various vital parameters are estimated
    from various locations and transmitted to main LoRa gateway using LoRa module.
    The system can facilitate to send sensor data to long distance. The dynamic IoT
    architecture with LoRa-W AN is designed in Smart agriculture system which collects
    soil data, weather data and is found to be scalable and with increased performance
    [20]. Crop monitoring is facilitated with full-stack IoT framework connected to
    a cloud-based software platform with microcontroller to collect various pH values
    [14]. IoT platform with Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa WAN) [8] is designed
    for collecting real time data such as air temperature, soil temperature, humidity
    of grapes and greenhouse vegetables production plant. This WAN based IoT platform
    is designed for improving management of generic farms. Strawberry infection prediction
    system with Cloud -based technology via LoRa network is also designed in which
    the identified parameters are host plants, pathogens, environmental factors. This
    system supports efficient data transfer and increased communication reliability
    even in poor communication environment [21]. Smart farming systems are designed
    for measuring and monitoring environmental parameters. Wireless Sensor Nodes connects
    with the Internet and data are stored in cloud server for analysis and providing
    immediate support for farmers. The communication protocol plays its role of providing
    immediate and ubiquitous support. E. Iot Enabling Platforms and Data Processing
    Technologies The computing architecture with latest technology provide a support
    to develop a monitoring system [22]. This system is set up to monitor the plant
    status continuously which includes soil condition and water level [23]. Artificial
    Neural Network based smart and green framework which provide services for data
    monitoring, preprocessing, fusion, synchronization, storage and irrigation management
    [24], [25]. Prediction analysis employs the Kalman filter (KF) to obtain noise-free,
    high-quality data, which is then transmitted over cluster-based WSNs [26]. IoT
    devices with decision tree architecture is used for decision making using prediction
    analytics for crop yield prediction and crop classification. This system supports
    high quality of data for analysis and data transfer in WSN application. This system
    acquires physical data and sends it to cloud. Application is in temperature forecasting.
    The deployed ANN application can be applied to predict other climatic parameters
    of a smart agriculture [27]. SECTION III. Design Consideration for Wearable Environment
    Al Monitoring System This section of the article presents the design consideration
    for developing a wearable environmental monitoring system The scientific information
    from previous published articles have been collected and reviewed with the following
    keywords: Analog front end design, Energy harvesting module integration and Remote
    wireless monitoring system design. A. Analog Front End Design The different quantities
    from ambient environment provides a main source for indicating the environmental
    conditions. The different environmental vital parameters need to be measured and
    monitored regularly for identifying the growth of many plants. The analog front-end
    unit consist of sensor, processing unit and microcontroller which provides an
    easy way to develop a sensing module for measuring these vital parameters. The
    integration of different environmental sensors with processing unit provides the
    quality acquisition of an analog signal. The signal acquired from the sensor mixed
    with the noises in real time due to some environmental disturbances affects the
    quality of signal extraction for vital parameters measurement. The analog signal
    must be processed by a microcontroller through ADC (analog to digital converter).
    The ultimate use of this microcontroller is to provide the estimation of vital
    parameters and also provide easy interfacing between sensing module and wireless
    devices. The flexibility of 8-bit microcontroller with reduced instructions provides
    a best choice to develop an analog front end unit. The processing unit must contain
    filter and amplifier for removing the unwanted noises fromthe original signal
    and also increases the amplitude of the signal for further processing. The individual
    components of analog front end unit must be powered by 3.3V or 5V which depends
    on the type of devices and their electrical specifications. The optimum use of
    input voltage range for providing the supply is 3.3V by lithium-ion battery. B.
    Energy Harvesting Unit Design The continuous monitoring of environmental vital
    parameters becomes very much important in an agriculture environment. This could
    be done by providing the continuous power to the individual components of the
    device. There are different energy sources available to provide the energy to
    the device such as indoor and outdoor light, wind and solar radiations. The converting
    an energy from the ambient environment becomes a best solution to provide the
    energy to the device in an agriculture environment. The devices used for extracting
    the energy form the ambient environment are solar cell and photodiodes. The energy
    harvesting unit must be designed with these devices to extract the ambient energy
    and provide the uninterrupted power to the device. The selection of energy harves
    ting chip is very important which provides the constant output voltages by converting
    the energy from solar radiations. These output voltages can be used and stored
    by secondary battery for delivering the supply at any emergency situations. C.
    Remote Wireless Monitoring System Design The continuous monitoring of an environmental
    vital parameters has many advantages such as plant growth identification, plant
    disease classification, instant monitoring of vital parameters and provide support
    to farmers to know the conditions of their land. The development of remote wireless
    monitoring system contains wireless devices and transmission protocols which could
    be used for sensing the measured data to the remote locations. There are many
    wireless devices available such as Bluetooth, Zigbee, Wi-Fi, GPRS, GSM and LoRa
    devices. The choices for selection of these wireless devices depends on the type
    of applications. These wireless devices can be interfaced with the microcontroller
    to send the data to the next locations. The important consideration for selecting
    these devices lies on their standard, operating frequency, modulation, RF channel,
    Bandwidth, Power consumption, Data rate, Latency, Range, Cost. Table I: Comparative
    features of wireless devices Due to the requirement for constant monitoring, quick
    data transmission, and data visualization at any time, the significance of wireless
    communication technology has been rising quickly. According to the review, numerous
    wireless modules are often employed by researchers working in the fields of agriculture
    and environmental monitoring. The comparative features of different wireless devices
    used in agriculture and environmental research is listed in Table I. Fig. 4: Design
    considerations for wems Show All The overall design consideration of WEMS is shown
    in Fig 4. The wireless monitoring system transmits the most important data for
    the amounts being monitored and displays the desired output replies. In order
    to transmit and monitor the real-time data from an analog sensing module for use
    in agriculture and environmental applications, there is an urgent need for the
    development of wireless monitoring systems. In order to monitor and visualize
    real-time data, internet of things (IoT) based design techniques offer an effective
    configuration using wireless connection technologies. In order to convey data
    to far areas, this work recommended the creation of a wireless monitoring system
    made up of Wi-Fi, long-range communication modules, and wireless web server communication
    which can be used in an agricultural setting to successfully monitor the required
    output environmental parameters. SECTION IV. System Design for Environmental Vital
    Parameters Measurement and Monitoring Fig. 5: System block diagram to measure
    environmental vital parameters Show All Considering the demand and need of increasing
    the productivity of agriculture farmlands, it is well and good to design an optimal
    system that provides immediate support and assistance for farmers. Meanwhile the
    optimal system is to be designed with essential parameters such as cost, ubiquity,
    user friendly and robustness. The benefits which are focused are providing assistance
    via android applications. Also, it helps the farmers to get immediate data about
    the farmlands which are located away from their home. The proposed system design
    for measurement and monitoring of environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity and solar radiation is presented in Fig. 5. The Light intensity sensor
    helps to collect light intensity data, Temperature sensors enables to collect
    the temperature, Humidity sensor aids in collecting the humidity data and UV sensors
    are used for collecting UV radiation data. Here, the light intensity, temperature,
    humidity, and UV sensor are integrated with the low power microcontroller for
    acquiring the environmental input quantity and measuring the vital parameters
    through the embedded C programming. The microcontroller and sensing modules are
    communicated through mode of inter integrated circuit which is the two-wire communication
    interface between the controller and sensors. Also, the Wi-Fi wireless device
    is interfaced with the processing unit for transmitting the vital parameters to
    the monitoring stations. The different experiments have been conducted and estimated
    the vital parameters. Here, the light intensity is measured in terms of voltages
    and UV radiation is measured by microwatts per cm2, The solar power is measured
    by W/m2 within the range of 1000W/m2. Fig. 6: Recorded uv radiations plot Show

    II: Measured quantities of environmental parameters SECTION V. Conclusions and
    Future Directions The food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations
    claims that in order to keep up with the projected growth in global population
    which is expected to reach 9 billion people by 2050 further increases the food
    production. It follows that, in order to minimize starvation and prevent irreparable
    harm to the Earth''s surface, boosting agricultural output while protecting the
    environment is becoming increasingly crucial. However, the amount of land that
    will be cultivated globally will only increase little. In order to acquire local
    awareness of the condition of the land and crops, precision agriculture is centered
    on the employment of distributed telecommunications and sensing technologies.
    In order to boost food production while lowering costs and resource waste, the
    telecommunication capability is also used to identify the best control measures
    in real time. A huge number of sensors must be deployed due to the large geographical
    area and variety of characteristics to be monitored. The proposed work presents
    the development of a real-time measurement system made up of sensors to measure
    and monitor the environmental vital parameters. For the development of environmental
    measurement and monitoring systems, the employment of sensor technology and signal
    processing techniques is crucial, and their application in agricultural and environmental
    research has significantly risen. An effective method for field sensing in the
    open air is real-time sensor interfacing. The assessment of essential environmental
    characteristics benefits farmers in a variety of ways. In order to create a real-time
    system to track environmental important characteristics including percentages
    of temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light intensity, and solar radiation,
    this paper describes the systematic approach to integrate the various sensors
    for measurement of vital parameters. In this study, the development of sensor-based
    wearable environmental monitoring system is also carried out. A measurement of
    various environmental essential metrics such as percentage of humidity, UV radiation,
    temperature and solar radiation variation depending on light intensity, is made
    possible by the integration of sensor modules and processing units. The information
    in this paper highlights how to integrate several sensors to measure the important
    environmental characteristics. Recent technical developments have served as a
    range of motivations for sensor-based measuring systems. Environmental factors
    are greatly impacted by population increase and industrial advancements. These
    alterations in the environment have a significant impact on the healthy plants''
    growth. Environmental elements that have an impact on plants include dynamic temperature
    changes, light radiation dispersion, humidity variations, poor soil quality, low
    air permeability, high terrain, reduced water, and extreme climate. A team of
    experts have looked at the demand for a system with sensors for use in environmental
    and agricultural applications. These sensors are frequently employed to measure
    important environmental characteristics. Farmers must be able to monitor the growth
    of their plants, so the development of low-cost, compact sensors is crucial. The
    information presented in this paper provides a clear perspective view for monitoring
    the environmental parameters, different physical sensors and their use in smart
    farming, portable embedded system platforms design, IoT design with network protocols.
    These smart techniques could be a best solution to develop a smart wearable environmental
    monitoring system in an agriculture environment. The design of wearable environmental
    monitoring device can be extended with wireless sensor network which is connected
    by Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRa-WAN) in a real large acre agriculture field
    for analyzing environmental parameters. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    Location: Herning, Denmark SECTION I. Introduction The existence of a static or
    mobile gateway in the network infrastructure of an Internet of Things (IoT) platform
    enables efficient connectivity among end devices to external networks (e.g., the
    Internet) by translating the communication protocols used by each side of the
    gateway [1]. On the other hand, Inter-net access offers the advantage of storing
    data and metadata in specialized databases and processing them in a framework
    with computational resources significantly superior to those existing up to the
    gateway level [2]. These data processing and storage capabilities are enabled
    through cloud-layer components [3]. In addition, data and metadata can be converted
    into useful information for final beneficiaries. At the application-level end,
    the raw data visualization is no longer a real benefit. Therefore, it needs to
    be jointly operated with decision support systems, recommendations, and notifications
    to help end users decide on the next specific steps for each use-case [4]. Long
    Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) is a member of the big family of Low Power Wide
    Area Network (LPWAN) technologies that are characterised by wide area coverage
    and low power consumption at a price of low throughput and long latency. Along
    with SigFox and NB-IoT, LoRaWAN represents one of the most popular LPWAN solutions
    in the commercial market [5]. LoRaWAN has already exhibited its high performance
    in various applications, but several shortcomings of this technologies exist:
    low computation resource, high require- ments for low energy consumption, optimum
    placement of gateways to ensure maximum coverage, and/or inexactitudes between
    on-field testing and producers'' data sheets [6]. In general, network coverage
    can be estimated based on simulations using dedicated software with high resolution
    maps at a cost of high expenses or through hardware based network testers with
    a drawback of data post-processing. Due to fact that the maps based on which the
    software is developed are not available at locations and that possible changes
    in an environment could occur, significant differences between simulations and
    terrain measurements may exist [5]. On the other hand, hardware network testers
    usually operate point-wise, providing the value of the received signal strength
    at given positions. If a device moves, these tools often lack the possibility
    to track the signal strength in a web application. Moreover, there are interoperability
    issues that make it dif-ficult to integrate an IoT platform with LoRaWAN gateway
    deployment for connectivity [7] [8]. In this paper, we present an end-to-end multi-purpose
    IoT platform that has LoRaWAN network coverage testing capa-bilities by design,
    thus eliminating the aforementioned issues. The platform accommodates LoRa Wan
    devices with sensing capabilities from different vendors. The LoRaWAN network
    is configured to operate according to the Europe allocation frequency plan, at
    868 MHz. The platform is capable of collecting sensor data, as well as network
    parameters such as Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Signal-to-Noise
    Ratio (SNR) for each gateway in the range of an end device. The data and metadata
    are retrieved initially through The Things Stack (TTS) platform which is not a
    persistent solution. As part of our system design and implementation, we introduced
    our own Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) server where a filtering solution is
    implemented to retrieve only the useful metadata and to generate separate analyses
    for each gateway in the range of our own devices. The useful data and metadata
    are stored in a light database (SQLite) on the HTTP server and in a Telegraf,
    Influx and Grafana (TIG) stack on the main platform server. To reveal the benefits
    of the developed platform, we performed experiments in three scenarios and generated
    a heat map for the scenario when multiple gateways co-exist. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Sec II presents related work on LoRaWAN network coverage
    testing. In Sec III, we present the IoT architecture and the platform used to
    demonstrate its operation and reliability. Sec IV presents the experiments performed
    based on several relevant scenarios and illustrates the testing results and their
    impact. Finally, Sec V concludes the paper. SECTION II. Related Work Recent development
    in IoT applications imposes the neces-sity of more efficient wireless communication
    technologies. IoT applications take the advantage of LoRaWAN capabili-ties that
    surpass other similar technologies according to [9]. Among the most relevant components
    of a LoRaWAN net-work, LoRaWAN gateways have aroused enormous interests in the
    research community because of their roles for efficient data reception Nowadays,
    wireless communication technologies provide the appropriate context for any network
    to efficiently perform in various transmission environments including high density
    areas (e.g., smart cities [10]–[13]) and sparse coverage areas (e.g., rural areas
    [14], [15]). In a LoRaWAN network deployed in a rural area in Jakarta, gateways
    act just as simple packet forwarders [10]. In that paper, the authors analyzed
    the signal quality and coverage of a LoRaWAN network and the evaluation was performed
    to ensure that the gateway could receive data properly and possible faults were
    determined. Another LoRaWAN network coverage testing was presented in [11] and
    the authors mea-sured link quality parameters in dense urban environments. The
    advantage of the network relies on the use of open-source low-cost hardware. In
    addition, the performance of LoRaWAN can be improved through an efficient loT
    simulator (e.g., SimpleloTSimulator) to emulate a high density LoRa sensor network
    [12]. When designing a LoRa network for the Gyor region, Hungary, the authors
    in [13] considered that LoRaWAN gateways should be placed so these devices ensure
    efficient functionalities with the highest possible data rate. Furthermore, LoRaWAN
    gateways are the core of the re-search presented in [14], where the authors evaluated
    the capacity of a LoRaWAN gateway and a multi-gateway network to serve a rural
    area in the Bologna region, Italy. The analysis was performed through both a set
    of laboratory experiments and on-field tests, but their research focused on the
    supported capacity of the gateway in two use-cases: small area and big area. Moreover,
    LoRaWAN was proved to be able to integrate with the current fifth generation (5G)
    network [16] by enabling LoRaWAN gateway in a 3rd generation partner project (3GPP)
    access network/a non-3GPP untrusted access network or as a part of an eNodeB/a
    core network (virtual mode). Yet, none of the above-mentioned research deals with
    Lo-Ra Wan gateway coverage capabilities in comparison with the datasheets provided
    manufacturers. The most relevant work to our approach was performed [17] at the
    915 MHz frequency bands, whereas our LoRaWAN end devices and gateways oper-ate
    on the European frequency plan at 868 MHz. In addition, the authors in [17] used
    their approach only for their own Raspberry Pi based gateway, whereas we developed
    Pycom based end devices and multiple gateways (own Pygate gateway and other in-range
    gateways). Although network parameters for each gateway such as RSSI and SNR are
    collected in both [17] and our work, the authors therein overtook only the parameters
    for their own gateway. In our HTTP server, we have implemented a filtering process
    to perform separate analyses on each gateway found in the range of an end device.
    Further-more, we introduce two databases, one SQLite database on the HTTP aggregation
    server and the Telegraf, InfluxDB, and Grafana (TIG) stack on the main server,
    whereas one Firebase database was used in [17]. For performance assessment, we
    conducted extensive experiments based on which we generated for each gateway a
    corresponding heat map. In contrast, the assessment in [17] was done merely through
    simulations. SECTION III. Proposed Architecture of the Lot Platform In this section,
    we present the architecture and the components of the loT platform we propose
    which encompasses built - in coverage testing capability. A. Architecture Overview
    In Fig. 1, the proposed architecture of the loT platform with built-in network
    coverage testing is illustrated. In this architecture, the platform is organised
    with three loT-specific layers. From bottom to top, we have the Device layer (com-prising
    of the perception devices, as sensors), the Network layer (including the long
    range network), and Cloud layer (responsible for data processing, storing, and
    analysis). For the sake of simplicity, only a single device, which is the one
    responsible for network coverage testing, was employed for our experiments. B.
    Platform Components At the Device layer, there must be (at least) one device with
    GPS coordinate tracking capability. In our experiments, this device is developed
    through Pycom development boards, including a Pytrack expansion board and a Lopy
    v4 devel-opment board based on a Semtech SX1272 LoRa/LoRaWAN communication module.
    One of the advantages of the Lopy v4 development board resides in its equipment
    with three other communication links through Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Bluetooth,
    and SigFox. The Pytrack expansion board is equipped with a Quectel L 76-L Global
    Positioning Sys-tem (GPS), supporting beside GPS services, Global Navigation Satellite
    System (GLONASS), Galileo, and Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) services.
    In addition, it includes a 3-axis accelerometer. Through the Pytrack board, one
    collects GPS data (latitude, longitude). At the Network layer, an 8-channel LoRaWAN
    Pygate gate-way is selected. It is also equipped with a Lopy v4 module to complete
    its hardware setup and has both Wi-Fi and Ethernet interfaces. The latter one
    is available via the PyEthernet board attached to the gateway. The half-dipole
    antennae installed at both mobile device and gateway are optimized for performing
    communications at 868 MHz. For experiments, LoRaWAN devices send data to the gate-way
    with a maximum power level of 14 dBm. At the gateway, RSSI and SNR are estimated
    and the values are available at the The Things Stack (TTS) server side. Fig. 1.
    Lot architecture with built-in network coverage testing functionality. Show All
    The Cloud layer encompasses an HTTP server in charge of overtaking loT device
    data and metadata related to Lo-RaWAN communication from the TTS server. As an
    inno-vative element, the Sanic framework which was developed since 2018 [18] was
    used in our implementation. Unlike other frameworks, it is possible to define
    synchronous functions (instances) or asynchronous functions (co-routines) in Sanic.
    Thus, the advantage of Sanic resides in the asynchronous processing of requests,
    being able to resolve several requests at the same time. Sanic also has its own
    built-in web server. In addition, at the HTTP server, the distance between each
    gateway and the mobile device is computed. To comply with other telemetry purposes,
    a Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) broker was implemented and the HTTP
    server acts also as an MQTT publisher, taking in charge of the proper pay load
    formation such that it fits the requirements of the TIG stack. Furthermore, the
    HTTP server sends the sensor and GPS data along with the computed distance between
    each gateway and the mobile device to the MQTT broker. The MQTT topics are organized
    depending on where the gateway messages come from, after gateway-based packet
    filtering. For the purpose of redundancy, the data are inserted on an SQLite database
    at the level of the HTTP server. Finally, the sensing data is retrieved from the
    SQLite database and is further processed to identify the patterns and recognize
    the events related to each use case the platform is targeted at. The latitude,
    longitude, and RSSI data are processed on-line and timely network coverage maps
    are gen-erated along with the recommendations on gateway placement. On top of
    the architecture, there is a mobile application (APP) through which a human operator
    can monitor the status of the testing LoRaWAN packets (e.g., if sent by the mobile
    device, or received by the HTTP server) and a web APP where the coverage heat
    maps and the placement recommendation are visualized at the end of an experiment.
    Table I SX1272 parameter configuration in three experiments SECTION IV. On-Field
    Experiments and Results This section presents the methodology and the scenarios
    to perform our experiments. In addition, we present and discuss the obtained experimental
    results. A. Procedures for Coverage Measurements and Analysis To perform coverage
    measurements and gateway placement recommendation, a step-by-step procedure is
    outlined below and the same methodology apples to each scenario. The testbed which
    includes both a gateway (or multiple gateways) and the mobile device is placed
    in terrain; The configurable parameters of the communication mod-ule are initialized.
    The parameters in Tab. I are valid for the mobile device for all scenarios. The
    spreading factor SF = 7 ensures the maximum possible throughput at a cost of coverage.
    For bandwidth allocation, we have chosen a value of 125 kHz to ensure a proper
    receiver sensitivity of S rx =−123 dBm . This also led to a data rate (DR) of
    5.469 kbps. The chosen code rate (CR) was 4/5 and it is suitable only for low
    interference environments as in the first two scenarios mentioned in the next
    subsection. For each measurement, change the location of the mobile device across
    the terrain. Each time when available, the mobile device sends its GPS coordinates
    through a LoRaWAN packet (not exceeding the maximum allowable payload). The gateway
    receives the packet and the LoRaWAN server stores the position temporarily along
    with its metadata. Using a webkook, the LoRaWAN server sends a request to the
    HTTP server. It processes the request and filters the relevant data and metadata
    ensuring data persistence through the SQLite database. The data are retrieved
    from the database and the RSSI-distance characteristics are plotted. The experimental
    data is compared with the two-ray model P r 2 −ray[dB]= P tx −20lo g 10  ( 4πfd
    c )+10lo g 10 ⌈2sin( 2 h t h r f cd )⌉ 2 and the free-space model P r FSPL [dB]=
    P tx + 1 − 47−20lo g 10 (d)−20log10(f) , where F tx =14dBm , and h t , h r are
    the heights of the device and gateway antennae. Repeat the above steps across
    the terrain. Then a heat map is generated for each scenario. Table II The locations
    and the gateway coordinates B. Scenarios for Performance Assessment In order to
    reveal the benefits of our platform, we have performed extensive experiments in
    three scenarios. In the first two scenarios, we brought our gateway in an area
    where no other gateways were operating. For this purpose, we chose Soceram Neighbourhood
    (SOCERAM), in the town of Campina, and at the top of the Cross Hill in the Cornu
    township (CROSS), both in the Prahova County, Romania. The third experiment was
    conducted in Bucharest, on the premises of the Faculty of Electronics, Telecommunications
    and Information Technology (ETTI), University Politehnica of Bucharest (UPB).
    Soceram In this scenario, we positioned our gateway at a height of 1.73 m in the
    proximity of a car parking lot and of a small building. The region lies is a sub-urban
    area and there are only small buildings with slight vegetation (only few trees).
    The tilt of the gateway antenna was intentionally set such that the directivity
    significantly decreases. The terrain has a varying elevation. Cross In this scenario,
    the gateway was placed on top of the Cross Hill, at a height of only 1.5 m above
    the ground level, the same height as the mobile device antenna. The mobile device
    was placed inside a passenger car driving at a speed of 10 km/h following a route
    on the hill. The antenna tilts were intentionally placed such that a decrease
    in antenna directivity occurs. Even though the surrounding is characterised by
    significant variations in elevation, the terrain on which the route was followed
    was flat. way in Fig. 2) was placed on the 2nd floor of Building B of the ETTI,
    at a height of 10m above ground. The mobile device was carried by a human operator
    inside the premises following two routes (red and green shown in the same figure).
    On UPB Etti In this scenario, our own gateway (marked as Gate-campus, there are
    many tall trees and a high building as seen in Fig. 2. The same as in CROSS, the
    terrain ETTI is also flat. Different from the other two scenarios, other gateways
    exist in the range of the mobile device. Fig. 2. Route in the ETTI scenario. Show
    All Fig. 3. Results in the SOCERAM scenario. Show All Ideally, the coverage in
    all scenarios should be satisfactory. In the next subsection, we show nevertheless
    that the network coverage measurements reveal the coverage gaps and the fact that,
    in reality, one cannot ensure the theoretical coverage circle within a certain
    radius. C. Experimental Results Soceram In Fig. 3, the experimental results for
    this scenario are presented. The measured RSSI values from our experiments and
    the calculated theoretical signal strength (based on both free space and two-ray
    models) are plotted against the distance, following the order of the received
    packets. We observe that the expected RSSI values decrease with distance, and
    vice versa. In this scenario, the minimum RSSI value for which we could receive
    a packet is -120 dBm and it is achieved at a maximum distance of only 156.50 m.
    Due to the propagation conditions and the antenna height and tilt, the coverage
    is very small. Although the theoretical signal strength calculated from the two-ray
    model is -76.69 dBm, the value we measured in real-life is much lower. Fig. 4.
    Results in the cross scenario. Show All Cross In this scenario, the experimental
    results shown in Fig. 4 were obtained. Again, the measured RSSI values and calculated
    theoretical signal strengths are plotted as distance varies, where the x -axis
    represents the sequence number of the received packets. In this case, a minimum
    measured RSSI value of -119 dBm was reached at a distance of merely 100.69 m away
    from the gateway. In contrast, the theoretical minimum signal strength at this
    distance predicted by the two-ray model is -69.04 dBm. Etti In this scenario,
    eight gateways are in the range of the mobile device (not simultaneously, though)
    and the packets sent through them are processed separately. Since we only know
    precisely the position of our own gateway, we compare the distances between the
    points where the minimum and the maximum experimental RSSI values are achieved
    (referred to as key points) for each gateway in order to make relevant comparisons.
    The obtained results are illustrated in Tab. III. We observed that even though
    our own gateway was positioned outside, at a relatively high height (9 m at the
    2nd floor), the coverage conditions were inappropriate for a longer range communication
    link between the ground mobile device and the gateway. The maximum distance at
    which the packets could be received did not exceed 50 m from the point the maximum
    RSSI was obtained until the minimum RSSI was achieved. This result contradicts
    the simple hypothesis that a high elevation gateway can improve the coverage.
    This finding reveals once again the benefit for implementing the proposed built
    - in network coverage testing functionality and to find coverage gaps. In comparison,
    the elevation for gateways #5 and #6 is 13 m and 4.5 m respectively. Fig. 5 depicts
    the gateway coverage map for the investigated area. For each gateway, the receiving
    points are plotted with a different color. The size of the circle markers is proportional
    to the received signal strength. The highest packet reception ratio is obtained
    for gateway #8. On the opposite side, gateway #9 received only 1 packet. D. Lessons
    Learnt The main results obtained from the experiments in the first two scenarios
    confirm the benefits of the proposed approach and reveal the drawback of simulation
    only based solutions when deploying LoRaWAN networks. Although the results ob-tained
    are valid for both gateway and end device deployment, this paper focuses mainly
    on gateway placement. Table III Comparison between the distances between the key
    points In the CROSS scenario, we have revealed important coverage issues due to
    several reasons. Firstly, the poor cover-age conditions were due to the low height
    of the antennae. Secondly, the intentional improper antenna placement affected
    the antenna gain and, thus, the received signal strength. This experiment arose
    the idea of equipping the antennae with tilt sensors that transmit also their
    data to the loT platform when still in coverage in order to increase the quality
    of the recommendations. Based on the latitude and longitude of both mobile device
    and gateway as well as on the gateway antenna tilt given by the tilt sensor, real-time
    recommendations will be provided to the platform user to correctly position the
    gateway to maximize the coverage. Another challenge resides in the accuracy of
    the GPS data. When the mobile device position varies, its new position determines
    the changes in the received signal strength. If the GPS data do not follow precisely
    the position update, then for the same GPS position and same RSSI can be plotted
    on the graph. This last issue may arise even in valid GPS data conditions, when
    the minimum RSSI is limited to the value of receiver sensitivity. SECTION V. Conclusions
    and Future Work This paper presents a solution that embeds the network coverage
    testing functionality into an loT platform. Three scenarios were investigated
    and some lessons were learnt from these experiments. In addition, the three scenarios
    revealed the importance and the benefits of such an approach. As the next step,
    we will develop the recommendation component such that, based on a simple 2 dimensional
    (2D) site surveying, one finds the proper placement of a LoRaWAN gateway on all
    three coordinates: latitude, longitude, and elevation. Furthermore, we will investigate
    the employment of our own LoRaWAN server instead of using the TTS server. Fig.

    United Arab Emirates SECTION I. Introduction The demand for dairy products is
    expanding at an accelerating rate as the population grows. Most farmers in impoverished
    nations make their living selling dairy products. Farmers'' livelihoods are heavily
    dependent on the health of their cattle. Swine fever, squamous cell carcinoma,
    and warts are just some of the diseases that may affect livestock. Other diseases
    that can be seen in livestock include polio encephalomalacia and hypomagnesemia
    are just a few of the diseases that environmental parameter variations have a
    negative impact on [1], [2]. An acute breathing syndrome coronavirus (SARS-COV),
    according to a WHO publication, is a highly infectious virus that may transmit
    to other animals and humans [2]. [2] In 2002, Guangdong province in southern China
    became the first place to disclose SARS infections, and by 2003, 26 nations across
    the world had documented cases. There have been around 2% GDP losses in East Asia
    because of this [3]. Smart technologies must be integrated with traditional systems
    to compete in today''s rapidly changing environment. The systems must be changed
    to Smart Dairy Farming for improved production of dairy and dairy products. Recent
    technological advancements have made agriculture more technologically sophisticated,
    and this trend is expected to continue as more high-tech tools and equipment become
    accessible. Farm animal husbandry has made significant progress in recent years.
    Many scientists are working to enhance the tools used to measure animal fitness.
    Animal performance health is directly or indirectly influenced by environmental
    conditions. An individual Heart rate is the most critical evaluation of one health.
    The environmental factors include air temperature, air pressure, and humidity.
    The variation in heart rate causes many diseases. As a result, the notion of fitness
    monitoring relies on the use of technologies that are either intrusive or oblique.
    Basically, the telemonitoring testing system comprises a heating unit and a laptop
    [4], [5]. Unfortunately, there isn''t a ready-to-use solution on the market for
    tracking and monitoring animals in real-time. Figure 1 provides an overview of
    the creatures that would be protected by the suggested method. Fig. 1. The proposed
    implementation of animal shielding Show All In most cases, doctors examine the
    animal''s bodily parameters by hand. In poor nations, livestock farmers have several
    challenges in maintaining the health of their animals. As a result, the equipment
    is constantly advised for changes. To identify early sickness in animals, the
    most widely used devices throughout the world merely measure heart rate. An examination
    of the literature shows that wearable animal health monitoring devices are critical
    tools for veterinary professionals, and that measurement parameters provide reliable
    records of animal health. As a result, animal health care costs are low. It is
    customary for a farmer or veterinarian to conduct a physical examination and observe
    the animals to establish their health. In the long run, it may need to be done
    again. It may be possible to give a low-cost and highly effective solution throughout
    the globe using the pit animal health monitor. It''s easy to see all the animals''
    stats from the base station every time new information is posted. The animals''
    health concerns, such as suspicion and anomalies, may be simply stated as a variety
    of health issues. It''s possible to get a decent sense of the herd''s health by
    just glancing at a new version of the software. Animals may be treated or separated
    quickly if behavioral abnormalities or significant signals are discovered in hours
    rather than days or weeks. This research has offered an example of an animal health
    monitoring Program since animals cannot communicate and do not disclose their
    difficulties. As demand for high-quality dairy products grows, so does the need
    for smart dairy farming (SDF). In today''s environment, the SDF provides several
    advantages. Advanced sensing technologies and data analysis may help the SDF decrease
    environmental problems, reduce resource consumption, and enhance animal health.
    The SDF. The temperature sensor module, heart charge module, and GPS module are
    all included in the version system. One-of-a-kind animal fitness evaluations may
    be made using these specific factors. As a result, this application''s real-time
    parameter monitoring features are being scrutinized. Dairy producers confront
    several challenges in today''s commercial environment, including the management
    of cattle, poor production, and excessive labor expenses. One of its most notable
    aspects is that there will be little manual monitoring since there will be less
    work involved. When you treat an animal well and give it what it needs on schedule,
    you will get twice as much out of it. Smart Dairy Farming (SDF) can address all
    of the farmers'' difficulties. SECTION II. Literature Review Standard and preparatory
    mixing are both mentioned as a function of teds in one definition in [6]. According
    to [6] this fundamental protocol is useful for nationwide online sensory networks.
    Contamination may be detected by a fluctuation in core body temperature. A normal
    frame temperature is used to distinguish unique species of animals from the other.
    The frame can feature at a specified temperature. Herbal ingredients that involve
    moisture should also be carefully considered since they influence the animal''s
    metabolism and behavior. The findings of research may be tainted by inaccurate
    measurements of temperature and humidity. The animal''shealth is greatly impacted
    by maintaining a relative humidity range of 30% to 70%. Plants and animals'' ability
    to cool down is influenced by the ambient conditions [7]. Somewhere in the 1980s,
    WSN research began, and since 2001, it has added value to the financial and research
    industries. It''s the same as the low-cost, low-energy components that are now
    available, such as CPUs, radios, and sensors, all built onto a little chip the
    “system on a chip” (short for “SoC”). [8]. The WSN generation is now an essential
    aspect of any country''s growth since it is being employed as a critical monitoring
    system for a wide range of facilities. There are no dangers connected with cable
    architectures with the WSN, which simplifies the process of sizing and monitoring
    data significantly [9]. With the use of WSN data transmission technology, we may
    collect real-time sensor node data remotely via the internet, cost-effectively
    making it possible for us to access the measured and stored data in several locations.
    More than that, the sensors may be turned on so that esp8266 can analyze and interpret
    the data in real-time. A Wi-Fi router may be used to link the WSN to the internet,
    allowing the sensors'' real-time data to be sent to the IoT platform on a regular
    basis. [10], [11]. A computer or an IoT database may then display environmental
    changes in real-time, allowing farm owners to monitor environmental factors even
    if they are physically present at the farm. Figure.2. The smart dairy building''s
    architecture Show All Live location tracking, frame temperature, and coronary
    heart charge are all included in cow health monitoring systems now in use. With
    the aid of three Node MCU-based sensors, the system has been put together. All
    the data is sent and received by each Node MCU at the same time. The database
    in the proposed system is updated on a regular basis. Temperature, humidity, CO2,
    and air quality are all monitored via a network of independent nodes for the purposes
    of environmental monitoring. The health of the cows is adversely affected by any
    deviation from the specifications listed above. It might cause the animal to get
    ill or perhaps die. All these variables may be tracked and acted upon immediately
    in the event of an anomaly due to the system''s ongoing environmental monitoring.
    In agriculture and cattle, a lack of efficiency and production may be remedied
    using the Internet of Things (IoT), a high-performance technology. In agriculture,
    IoT applications are playing a significant role. There are several different types
    of agricultural monitoring, including temperature, livestock, irrigation, and
    soil monitoring. Currently, we are experimenting with IoT in dairy farming. This
    project''s major goal is to construct an IoT -based livestock monitoring system
    that can autonomously check the health of dairy cows. There are several approaches
    that may provide assistance in designing emerging solutions for the rising challenges
    in designing smart as well as autonomous management systems. Fuzzy logic design
    [36], [45], [46], [34], [49], [51], Machine learning [38], [40], [41], [44], [47],
    [55]–[58], swapping operation [39], Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [50], and
    computational intelligence [37], [42], [43], round robin [52], equalization technique
    [53], and explainable artificial intelligence [54] are some of the approaches
    that are being used while employing and constructing a number of smart, and autonomous
    frameworks. SECTION III. Material and Method Here you''ll find information about
    the instruments and interconnecting techniques that will be used in the planned
    implementation. The suggested system''s block diagram may be seen in Figure 3.
    It has been implemented a tracking system that includes body area sensors, temperature
    sensors, heart sensors, and a GPS module. Nodes for sensing CO2, temperature,
    humidity, and air quality are also included in this system since they are all
    necessary components. The Node MCU, an IoT mainly built on the ESP8266 Wi-Fi SoC,
    interfaces with the environmental parameter control system. Each node in the cow
    barn oversees monitoring its own set of environmental parameters to make sure
    that no harmful substances exceed their safe levels and endanger the animal''s
    health. In the database, the cow''s collar and environmental factors are regularly
    updated, and the owner may examine the farm''s facts from any location, at any
    time, thanks to the front-end development. The suggested prototype development
    helped define the modules and parameters for each module in the proposed system.
    Reminders to be vaccinated have been included into the system as well. A push
    notification is sent to the veterinarian''s mobile as the planned vaccination
    date approaches. The suggested model''s process is shown in full in Figure 3.
    There are four distinct sections to this course: Including cow collars, Environmental
    monitoring, Water system and the database. The cow collar for animal health monitors
    the temperature, heartbeat, and position of each dairy cow on the farm''s smart
    technology. The owner and veterinarian will be notified immediately if any anomalies
    are discovered while this data is being evaluated. Figure.3. The recommended overview''s
    methodical overview Show All A database has been set up to save this information
    so that it may be accessed by the dairy farm''s owner at any time. In the cow
    barn, the environmental conditions determine the levels of CO2, temperature, humidity,
    and other air quality indicators. Each sensor has its own independent node, so
    thresholds may be established, and an alert triggered if the readings go over
    them, which in turn leads to action. The database is also being updated with environmental
    sensor data. The tank''s water level is measured by a sensor in the system. To
    prevent the tank''s water level from falling below the predetermined threshold,
    a replenishment system is in place. Figure.4. A diagram of the proposed system''s
    three modules Show All A. Interfacing of Different Electronic Modules The temperature,
    pulse, and position of the cow in real time are just a few of the indicators used
    to assess her health in this study. It is possible to monitor a wide range of
    environmental characteristics in a workstation using environmental sensors. These
    environmental characteristics may be monitored efficiently and accurately using
    Wireless Sensor Nodes. The water level is measured using an ultrasonic sensor.
    Our study will make use of sensors that measure temperature, CO2, humidity, and
    air quality. The following table provides specifics about each of the sensors.
    a. Temperature and Humidity Sensors It is usual for a cow to have a body temperature
    ranging from 36.5°C to 39°C. This device uses the MLX90614 [18] sensor to detect
    body temperature and humidity. This sensor is directly attached to the analogue
    pin of the Node MCU. The animal''s health is adversely affected by temperature
    ranges that fall outside of the ranges. The vet and owner get an emergency notice
    when the pet''s body temperature rises over 39°C. The temperature and humidity
    independent node''s process is shown in Figure 3. It is the Node MCU''s job to
    get the DHT11 sensor value, which includes temperature in °C and air quality percentage,
    from the sensor. These values are compared to the specified threshold values by
    Node MCU. The database pushes a notification to the owner if these values go outside
    of the acceptable range. There is a database in which the owner may see the statistics
    for Temperature and Humidity, which are saved and updated. Figure.5. Wireless
    interfacing of temperature and humidity sensor node Show All b. Node MCU For those
    who want to experiment with the Node MCU ESP8266 [12], it comes pre-installed
    with a 32-bit RISC CPU and an ESP-12E module. With a clock frequency range of
    80MHz to 160MHz and support for real-time operating systems (RTOS), this microprocessor
    is an excellent choice. The Node MCU has 128KB RAM and 4MB Flash memory for storing
    data and programs. High computing power, Wi-Fi/Bluetooth and Deep Sleep Operating
    characteristics will help IoT applications. A Node MCU may be powered via a Micro
    USB connector and a VIN pin (External Supply Pin). It may exchange data through
    UART, SPI, or I2C. c. Heart Rate Stethoscope It was agreed that the cows'' heart
    rates would be measured by using a CR-747SS stethoscope [13]. Due to the cow''s
    thick skin, the human pulse sensor is unable to accurately measure the temperature.
    Using this stethoscope, we built an amplifier circuit and connected it with the
    stethoscope''s amplification circuit. An amplifier circuit then amplifies the
    heartbeat and feeds it to the Node MCU. The data is subsequently placed in a database
    from which it may be retrieved at any moment in the future. An amplifier and metal
    electrodes are employed to solve this problem. Using the “Proteus” platform, this
    amplifier''s circuit diagram is being developed. Signals from electrodes ranging
    from 1 mV to 2mV will be amplified by this amplifier, which has a gain of around
    1000. When it ranges from 48 to 84 beats per minute, the cow''s heart rate is
    considered normal. A signal of 10 millivolts is amplified using a 741 operational
    amplifier with a gain of roughly 1000. The ECG signal from the metal electrodes
    was sent into the amplifier as an input. d. GPS Module Because of its high sensitivity
    and superb accuracy, the u-box NEO-6M GPS engine on these modules is ideal for
    interior use. Also included are an MS621FE-compatible rechargeable battery and
    an EEPROM for saving configuration information. The module is compatible with
    3.3- to 5-volt DC inputs (due to its built-in voltage regulator) [15]. e. Battery
    and Charging Module The cow collar is powered by a 18650 lithium-ion battery.
    The size of the cow collar is maintained to a minimum. 4.2V and 1A are the recommended
    charging currents for the 18650 battery (0.5C). If you''re dealing with batteries,
    you''ve probably heard of the MAh and C ratings. It is possible to estimate how
    long your battery will survive depending on current usage using the Ah rating.
    For example, a 18650-cell rated at 2850mAh indicates that if we draw 2.850A from
    the battery, it will survive for one hour; and similarly, it would last for 10
    hours if we consume 0.285A [16]. The TP4056A module charges and discharges this
    cell. The module is powered by 5 volts, which may be supplied via a USB remote
    connection. This module may be powered by any kind of mobile charger and its wire.
    Connect IN+ to a 5V supply and IN- to ground to power this module directly. When
    the charge is connected properly, the RED led will glow high, indicating that
    the battery is charged. The charging process is controlled by the TP4056 Liner
    voltage IC [17]. f. Microphone Sound Sensor The heartbeat may be detected with
    the microphone sound sensor KY-038 [18]. In this module, a microphone receives
    a cow''s heartbeat and sends it to the sensor''s Analog input (AO). The A0 pin
    on the Node MCU receives this boosted Analog signal from the amplifier circuit.
    g. CO2 and Air Quality MQ-135 is the sensor used for CO2 and air quality sensors.
    The sensor (MQ135) collects data on both CO2 and air quality index using the same
    sensor. Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the normal range are between 400 and 1000ppm.
    The Node MCU is programmed to accept these values and store them in the appropriate
    ranges. Every two-minute period, this data is gathered. The GSM module notifies
    the owner if the anomaly occurs. The Node MCU is also connected to the GSM module.
    The database collects all of the CO2 and air quality data in one place. When the
    time period reaches and fresh CO2 and Air Quality data are acquired, this database
    is updated. This data is readily available to the database''s owner at any moment.
    The Node MCU calculates the MQ135 sensor value, which includes CO2 in ppm and
    Air quality in AQI. Using these numbers, Node MCU does a comparison to the previously
    set thresholds. The database pushes a notice to the owner if these values go outside
    of the acceptable range. All of the facts about CO2 and air quality are kept up-to-date
    in a database that the owner has access to. h. Water Level Detection Sensor The
    HC-SR04 sensor is utilized for the water level system installation. It is powered
    by a +5V supply and can measure from 2cm to 80cm with a 3mm accuracy. Aside from
    that, it features a four-pin module with the following connections: VCC, trigger,
    echo, and ground. The water level system components may be seen in Figure 4. An
    LED, a Node MCU, and an HC-SR04 water level sensor are all that''s needed. In
    order to tell whether or not the water tanks are drained, the leading is used.
    When the LED is lit, it shows that the water level has fallen below the specified
    threshold. It shuts off as soon as the tank''s water level reaches the predetermined
    level, indicating that the tank is full. Figure.6. A working overview of the water
    level system Show All I. comparison old vs new system B. Implementation This section
    focuses on how the method is put into practice. There is a lot of information
    here on how the key modules operate and how they relate to the model that was
    built. Android phones that match the basic criteria can run the software since
    it has been turned into an executable application. Every user of the application
    must first register with the system and then log in. In this way, the user has
    access to the app''s features. Here are a few screenshots of the program''s main
    interface: Figure.7. Log-in page Show All a. Cow Collar Front-End Database A total
    of four factors are required in order to get Cow Collar Data from the cow collar.
    These four criteria may be used to identify each cow''s unique identifier number.
    When using the ID number display to keep track of an individual cow''s data, you
    may search for and identify that cow quickly and easily. The following are the
    values shown in the cow collar section for each of the four parameters. 1. Temperature
    2. Heartbeat Rate 3. Latitude 4. Longitude. The animal''s position has been recorded
    using a GPS gadget. Mlx90614 and stethoscope are used to measure the temperature
    and heartbeat, respectively. Cattle data, environmental parameters, and water
    level detectors may all be accessed from the front end. Show All b. Water Level
    Front-End Database Displaying information such as the proportion of eatable water
    and the water level is made easier with the aid of a sensor node that measures
    the water level. Because there is only one of this equipment on the whole farm,
    it does not have a serial number. Adding another node with a unique number is
    made easier by the presence of a whitespace character. The water level section
    has the following parameters. 1. Amount of water in a solution 2. The level of
    water in the ocean. We only broadcast the sensor node data required to refill
    the water container when it runs low, regardless of the direction of transmission.
    A certain degree of a water table decline is a reasonable assumption to make.
    In this case, the gadget will activate the water pump and send a signal to the
    owner indicating that the pump has been activated. Rather than relying on a motor
    pump, LED lights are utilized in our case. SECTION IV. Final Hardware This system
    consists of an IoT platform. An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices
    that use the embedded system, such as a processor for the processing of data,
    sensors that are HC-SR04, GPS module, Temperature and humidity, Environmental
    sensors etc. IoT devices (Node MCU) share the sensor data they collect by connecting
    to the sensors. Then, data is sent to the cloud or application to analyze locally.
    In this case, an IoT device collects data and sends it to the IoT gateway. In
    the end, data sent to the application to analyze it and send an alert message
    to the doctor or owner if anything exceeds the limit. When the level of the water
    decreases, then the HC-SR04 sensor turnON the red LED and sends an alert message
    to the node MCU on the other hand, when the water level increases it turns ON
    the blue LED. As Node MCU is connected to the application using WiFi to send alert
    messages to the owner or doctor. Temperature and humidity sensors are used to
    know about the increase or decrease of temperature in the animal body. When body
    temperature exceeds or decreases from the range 36.5 to 39. It uses sensor MLX90614
    which is connected to the Node MCU and it sends an emergency or alert notice if
    it falls outside the range. These values are noticed by the Node MCU after every
    instance. The database is regularly updated after getting data from the sensor.
    For air quality monitoring, a gas sensor, MQ135 is used. The range of carbon dioxide
    is 400ppm to 1000ppm. Node MCU calculates the MQ135 sensor value, which includes
    carbon dioxide and air quality. The database pushes a notification to the owner
    or doctor if these values go outside the range. The data in Node MCU is updated
    regularly after getting the values from the sensors. Fig. 9. Final hardware Show
    All SECTION V. Conclusion This research recommended the use of a Node MCU-based
    intelligent embedded system by using various sensors and IoT analytics. Data on
    animal health and climatic parameters may be recorded and stored using the plug-and-play
    prototype that has been proposed. Using an Internet-based database, a front-end
    developer builds a connection between the wireless sensor nodes and the data they
    collect. This study goes into great detail on how IoT technology is being used
    in livestock husbandry to keep track of stray and stressed animals in remote grazing
    areas. As a result of this, ranchers and farmers can keep an eye on their livestock''s
    stress levels and stray animals at a given distance. So that specific sensor technologies
    can be used to monitor livestock location and health, as well as ensure animal
    well-being in rapidly changing farm environments. Authors Figures References Keywords

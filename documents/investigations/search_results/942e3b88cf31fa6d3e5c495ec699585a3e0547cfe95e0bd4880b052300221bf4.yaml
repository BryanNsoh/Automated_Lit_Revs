    Challenges Implementing Internet of Things (IoT) Using Cognitive Radio Capabilities
    in 5G Mobile Networks Chapter © 2016 Internet of Things and Cognitive Radio Networks:
    Applications, Challenges and Future Chapter © 2023 Cognition Radio Enabled IoT
    Chapter © 2020 Keywords Cognitive Radio Internet of Things (IoT) Spectrum sharing
    Dynamic spectrum access Frequency bands 1 Introduction Spectrum is a natural source
    and there is very limited availability of spectrum. There is a fixed spectrum
    assignment and bandwidth is also found to be very expensive. Some frequency bands
    like radio and TV are unutilized while the other frequency bands are overutilized.
    This shows that there is inefficiency in the utilization of the spectrum. This
    necessitates to exploit the spectrum opportunistically; therefore, we need to
    dynamically utilize the spectrum, which is called dynamic spectrum access [1].
    To achieve this dynamic spectrum access, we need a clever radio or clever system.
    Such a clever system or radio is known as cognitive radio. It is an intelligent,
    adaptive, aware radio model that senses its functional surroundings and dynamically
    adapts its radio operating parameter to update systems like mitigating interference,
    facilitating interoperability, and maximizing throughput. Spectrum scarcity is
    one of the major problems as most of the spectrum is left unused leaving behind
    spectrum holes. So, cognitive radio makes use of their spectrum hole in an efficient
    manner, thus leaving very less spectrum holes. Recent studies show that in the
    integration of cognitive radios with IoT-based wireless communication technologies,
    multiantenna systems [1,2,3] offer better results in terms of data rates, efficiency,
    availability, complexity, robustness and solve the spectrum scarcity issues even
    in coming age of the Internet of Things [4,5,6,7]. Improved intelligent radio
    systems efficiently work with fifth generation wireless networks by employing
    the licensed spectrum with the primary user and unlicensed spectrum combined with
    different application bands [8]. As it is an effective tool to mitigate various
    issues wirelessly, its smart sensing technique regulates the ability of spectrum
    resources [9]. The predominant characteristics of cognitive radio are its capability
    and reconfigurability. The capability of the cognitive radio to sense its radio
    environment by noting down the variations is called cognitive capability whereas
    the ability of the cognitive radio to change the functional elements according
    to the need of the radio surroundings is called reconfigurability. Achieving these
    characteristics in cognitive radio can be well explained in the “cognitive cycle”
    as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Cognitive radio cycle Full size image The primary role
    of cognitive radio is spectrum sensing, spectrum management, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum mobility. The process of detecting an unused part of the spectrum
    or spectrum hole, that is, detecting whether the primary user is present or absent.
    Occupying the efficient part of the spectrum to obtain the user’s requirement
    is spectrum management. In addition, the cognitive radio provides fair spectrum
    scheduling method among Cognitive radios users and distributes spectrum among
    the scheduled users is known as spectrum sharing. Further, spectrum mobility performs
    transition to a better spectrum, that is, to empty the channel, where the licensed
    user is identified. Further, this chapter is structured as follows. Section 2
    comprises the system model of the IoT-based cognitive radio network. Section 3
    comprises the spectrum sensing phenomenon and layer-wise structure of the cognitive
    radio cycle. Further, Sect. 4 illustrates the IoTs-based cognitive radio network
    structure. Section 5 presents the complete process of spectrum sensing using MATLAB.
    Section 6 comprises the simulation results and discussion followed by the conclusion
    in Sect. 7. 2 System Model for IoT-Based Cognitive Radio Considering an IoT-based
    cognitive radio network consisting of a primary IoT device (PD), primary access
    point (PAP), secondary IoT device (SD), and secondary access point (SAP) as shown
    in Fig. 2. It is assumed PD and SD transmit information to their respective access
    point. The spectrum has been divided into licensed primary IoT (P-IoT) and unlicensed
    secondary IoT (S-IoT). Assuming that primary access point (PAP) and the secondary
    access point (SAP) are unbuffered, thus there is no possibility of the combination
    of signals received from earlier transmissions. If an error occurs during the
    transmission, we adopt an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol to correct the
    error. When new information is generated at the PD or SD, while the primary IoT
    and secondary IoT users are busy in the current transmission, the PD and SD discard
    the current information and start to transmit new information or packet of data.
    Fig. 2 IoT-based cognitive radio network Full size image 3 Potentials of Cognitive
    Radio Cognitive radio is a dynamic spectrum access that improves spectrum utilization.
    It gives better interoperability and improved vertical handoff by selecting the
    best network. Link optimization is done with respect to modulation, power and
    topology, better usage of other resources, increased capacity and high data rates,
    improved coverage, service quality, and link reliability by intelligently identifying
    the channels for communication. In spectrum management, the use of radio frequency
    for efficient use and gain benefits of cognitive radio is regulated [10]. It has
    three processes such as cycle sensing, deciding, and acting. The measurements
    are taken in first process and spectrum sensing is performed, which is affected
    by various wireless limitations. Because the measurements may be uncertain in
    first process, a decision needs to be made by the secondary, which is knowledge
    based and observation. Eventually, in the last step of the cycle, because of the
    uncertainty, wrong actions are taken. So, it is important to acknowledge the uncertainty
    by sensing the spectrum optimally by making right decisions and taking correct
    action. Spectrum sensing is a very eminent method in cognitive radio system because
    it allows secondary users to acknowledge about the environment by finding the
    availability of primary user. It is formulated as follows: $$ y(k)=\\Big\\{{\\displaystyle
    \\begin{array}{c}{N}_0\\kern7.5em {\\mathrm{H}}_0\\kern0.5em :\\mathrm{PU}\\kern2.375em
    \\mathrm{Absent}\\\\ {}h\\ast x(k)+{N}_0,\\kern3.125em {\\mathrm{H}}_1\\kern0.78em
    :\\mathrm{PU}\\kern2.375em \\mathrm{Present}\\end{array}} $$ (1) where k = 1 ….
    K, K is the number of samples, y(k) is the SU received signal, x(k) is the PU
    signal, N0 is the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with zero mean and variance
    𝛿w2, and h is the complex channel gain of the sensing channel. H0 and H1 show
    the presence and absence of the PU signal. The PU signal detection is achieved
    using one of the spectrum sensing method to take decisions among the two hypotheses
    H0 and H1. At the receiver end, the test statistic (T), is then correlated to
    a threshold (γ) to sense the presence or absence of PU signal. The Hypothesis
    H1 and H0 refer to the presence and absence of the PU signal respectively and
    decided as follows: $$ \\Big\\{\\kern0.5em {\\displaystyle \\begin{array}{c}\\
    T\\ge \\gamma, \\kern6.75em {\\mathrm{H}}_1\\\\ {}\\ T<\\gamma, \\kern6.25em {\\mathrm{H}}_0\\end{array}}
    $$ (2) where 𝛾 denotes the sensing threshold. Absence of PU signals enables the
    SU to get access to the PU channel. 3.1 Generic Flow Diagram of Cognitive Radio
    The fundamental objective of cognitive radios is spectrum sensing, spectrum sharing,
    and spectrum access. They work in PHY and MAC layers [11]. Further, cognitive
    radios influence the functioning of upper protocol layer. For quality of services
    observation, learning and decision-making must also be performed at the network,
    transport, and application layers [12]. Figure 3, shows the generic flow diagram
    of cognitive system. Fig. 3 Generic cognitive radio flow diagram Full size image
    4 IoT-Based Cognitive Radio 4.1 Need for Cognitive Radio in IoT The exponential
    growth of internet traffic, count of licensed users will increase accordingly.
    This will make an issue to the unlicensed users. Therefore, it is very difficult
    to manage the expenses of obtaining spectrum from these unauthorized users. Cognitive
    radio networks are the feasible choice to combat this issue. Second, the expanding
    of internet will increase the count of IoT tools connected to the network. This
    will cause interference in the network due to device-to-device communication.
    IoT-based cognitive radio can assign channels that are interference free. Huge
    payload of information generated by individual users will require enormous bandwidth
    for transmission. Efficient spectrum utilization using cognitive radio technology
    will cater to this challenge. 4.2 Cognitive Architecture for IoT The cognitive
    architecture structure for the cellular IoT is shown in Fig. 4 [13]. The framework
    consists of three levels of enablers. Each layer consists of fabrics that are
    used for the mechanism of various functionalities. The virtual object (VO) levels
    create the virtual description of real-world and digital objects are used for
    the exchange of the information with the real-world object (RWO). Fig. 4 Cognitive
    radio IoT-based architecture Full size image The VOs can be further used for the
    generation of composite virtual objects (CVOs). Thus, the combination of these
    layers and structure together will create a cognitive network which can be used
    for power optimization, energy efficiency, reduced computational time, and increased
    reliability. The service function includes translation of service request, real
    world knowledge, and request information down to the CVO level in order to create
    meaningful mashups to serve the request. The real-world knowledge will help us
    decision-making necessary for cognitive radio cycle [14]. 5 Flowchart for Spectrum
    Sensing in Cognitive Radio In this section, a brief flowchart for spectrum sensing
    in cognitive radio is discussed. We considered five different combinations for
    primary users with different transmission signal frequencies of 1 KHz, 2 KHz,
    3 KHz, 4 KHz, and 5 KHz, respectively as shown in Fig. 5. Different cases have
    been considered describing various combinations of primary users. We calculate
    the sum of all primary users and plot the power versus frequency graph of the
    resultant signal. Further, the spectrum is checked for any empty slot and secondary
    user is supposed to occupy the empty slot. After the secondary user has entered
    in the spectrum, we calculate the sum of the primary user signal and secondary
    user signal and plot the power spectral density. The sampling frequency is chosen
    to be 12 KHz. The noise affects the spectrum sensing process; accordingly, we
    consider the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is equivalent to 15 dB in each case.
    Fig. 5 Flowchart for Spectrum Sensing Full size image 6 Results and Discussion
    This section covers all the results simulated in MATLAB software using efficient
    spectrum sensing algorithm for cognitive radio. Figure 6 shows the presence of
    one primary user keeping channel capacity minimum and probability is less. Second,
    empty slots are occupied by secondary user as shown in Fig. 8, by improving channel
    capacity and deduction in probability. Secondary user fills the third and fourth
    slots in the iteration as shown in Figs. 10 and 12, respectively. Fig. 6 Only
    one primary user is present in spectrum Full size image In fifth iteration, due
    to the presence of one primary user, all slots are occupied as shown in Fig. 14,
    having maximum channel capacity and spectrum probability. Case 1: Figure 6 shows
    the power spectral density graph for the cognitive radio system when only one
    primary user is present. Only one slot is occupied, which is shown in graph by
    the spiky peaks on the both sides of 1 KHz frequency spectrum. The power in this
    frequency range is almost 1 dB, that is, most of the signal power is confined
    within this spectrum. Figure 7 shows the probability of detection of empty slots
    due to the presence of only primary user. The detection probability of vacant
    slot is maximum in this case. Fig. 7 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of one PU Full size image Case 2: Secondary user senses the spectrum and occupies
    the second slot. Now, two slots are present in the spectrum. This is shown in
    graph by two spiky peaks ranging between 1 and 2 KHz frequency spectrum. Power
    in these two bands is almost equal to 4 dB as shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 Secondary
    primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Figure 9 shows the probability
    detection of unoccupied slots when only two slots are in use. The detection probability
    of empty slots somehow decreases as compared to case 1, because one more slot
    gets occupied in this case. Fig. 9 Detection Probability of holes in presence
    of second PU Full size image Case 3: In Fig. 10, secondary user again senses the
    spectrum and finds three empty slots, thereby, occupying the third slot. The spiky
    peaks at 1, 2, and 3 KHz band frequency demonstrate the occupancy of three slots.
    Again, the power at these frequency bands is 4 dB. Figure 11 shows the detection
    probability when three slots are occupied. Again, it can be seen that with the
    occupancy of one more slot, the detection probability of empty slot decreases.
    Fig. 10 Third primary user is present in spectrum Full size image Fig. 11 Detection
    Probability of holes in presence of third PU Full size image Case 4: Figure 12
    shows the power spectral density graph when four slots are occupied. This is shown
    with four spiky peaks at 1, 2, 3, and 4 KHz frequency bands. Figure 13, demonstrates
    the decrease in the detection probability of empty slots. Now, only one slot is
    left unoccupied. Fig. 12 Fourth primary user is present in spectrum Full size
    image Fig. 13 Detection Probability of holes in presence of fourth PU Full size
    image Case 5: Secondary user once again senses the spectrum in the fifth repetition
    and fills the fifth slot. Figure 14 shows the full spectrum with all slots being
    occupied. Now, there is no scope for any spectrum hole. The slots are occupied
    at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 KHz frequency bands. Most of the signal power is confined
    in the spectrum over these bands. The bandwidth requirement for the transmission
    of all primary users will be 4 KHz. In this way, efficient spectrum sensing is
    being done by the cognitive radio algorithm. Figure 15 shows the detection probability
    when all slots are occupied. The detection probability of empty slots is the least.
    Fig. 14 All five primary users present in the spectrum Full size image Fig. 15
    Detection Probability of holes in presence of fifth PU Full size image Table 1
    lists the detection probability (PD) of vacant slots versus probability of false
    alarm for different occupancy. The probability of false alarm (PF) has been taken
    as 0.1 for each case. Table 1 Detection Probability versus false alarm probability
    Full size table 7 Conclusion This chapter presents the insight and innovative
    ideas of cellular IoT-based cognitive radio networks. The need of cognitive radio
    in IoT and IoT-based cognitive radio architecture has been briefly discussed in
    this chapter. We also present efficient spectrum sensing algorithm depending on
    spectrum sensing. The algorithm takes five iterations to make the spectrum completely
    occupied. In each and every iteration, secondary user occupies the slot left vacate
    by the primary user. Thus, minimum resources are getting wasted and full occupancy
    of channel is obtained in the last iteration. The last iteration, that is, when
    all the slots get occupied are having highest detection probability and spectral
    efficiency. In this way, the channel goes from the worst to the best case. Simulation
    results validate our analysis. Cognitive radio can be used for 4G and 5G technology
    for better spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing. References T. Alam, S.R. Thummaluru,

  description: Spectrum Sensing as a Service (SSaS) is emerging as the enabling business
    model for efficient spectrum sharing in many recent applications. In such model,
    sensing infrastructure provides dynamic spectrum access networks, also known as
    cognitive radio networks, with information about availability or unavailability
    of given spectrum bands. In return for such information, the service provider

    is faced with the challenging scarcity of spectrum resources [1], [2], [3]. Spectrum
    sharing with the help of cognitive radios (also known as software-defined radios)
    is strongly believed to be among the very promising solutions for this problem
    [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Idle spectrum channels can be dynamically
    utilized without affecting licensed wireless users, also known as primary users
    (PUs), to gain more capacity. The viability of this approach, however, relies
    heavily on the accuracy of idle spectrum identification. A false positive, i.e.,
    identifying a given spectrum band as idle while it is not may lead to harmful
    interference caused to PUs by unlicensed wireless users (also known as secondary
    users, abbrev. SUs). On the other hand, a false negative, i.e., identifying a
    given spectrum band as busy while it is not, will deprive unlicensed users of
    some valuable spectrum resources. Therefore, the accuracy and reliability of spectrum
    sensing, the process of identifying idle/busy spectrum bands, is very critical.
    Thus, it received tremendous attention over the past decade [11], [12], [13],
    [14]. Cooperative sensing is one of the favored approaches to carry out the spectrum
    monitoring task [15]. It promises higher sensing accuracy based on the redundancy
    of devices involved in making the sensing decision [16]. Accuracy and energy consumption
    are generally the most investigated issues related to spectrum sensing. In [17],
    the authors investigate how throughput of SUs is affected by the spectrum sensing
    process under different levels of data availability in energy harvesting-based
    CRNs. As SUs use the harvest-then-transmit mode of operation, it is important
    to have an energy efficient spectrum sensing process that maximizes the energy
    left for data transmission. The paper presents Markov Chain models to understand
    how SU throughput is affected by data availability and sensing energy consumption.
    An important conclusion in this work is that, in some cases, non-cooperative spectrum
    sensing can be better, on the average sense, than cooperative sensing in terms
    of SU throughput. Optimizing cooperative spectrum sensing in energy-harvesting
    CRNs is investigated in [18]. The objective is to devise a cooperative sensing
    strategy among SUs so that their achievable throughput is maximized while PUs
    are protected and sufficient energy is harvested. The work in [19] addresses the
    accuracy of cooperative sensing in cognitive radio sensor networks. It proposes
    a clustering-based decision protocol and employs an entropy based weighted method
    to fuse local decisions and produce a global one. Energy efficient spectrum sensing
    in mobile cognitive radio sensor networks is investigated in [20]. The paper presents
    a framework to optimally predict energy consumption of the sensing process given
    node mobility. In [21], Graph Convolution Network model is proposed to solve the
    cooperative spectrum sensing problem. The objective is to construct a model that
    is capable of handling the hidden node problem and adapting to dynamic changes
    in the wireless environment. A different way of handling cooperative spectrum
    sensing in CRNs is presented in [22]. A prediction-based sensing scheme is used
    where the status of a spectrum channel is predicted before actual sensing is performed.
    This prediction is done cooperatively as well, with the purpose of improving energy
    efficiency by avoiding wasteful sensing. Spectrum sensing as a service (SSaS)
    is an emerging paradigm of cooperative sensing [23], [24], [25]. This paradigm
    calls for the use of a dedicated infrastructure wireless sensor network (WSN)
    to monitor the spectrum and then provide sensing results via direct communication
    with the sensors or via cloud services [26]. A sensing cost is imposed upon SUs
    by the sensing service provider according to a given pricing function [23], [27].
    As proposed in [27], SUs can pay in return of the sensing service by cooperating
    with the infrastructure sensor network in the sensing task. Another alternative
    (the one assumed in this work) is money payment where the owner/operator of the
    CRN pays the sensing service provider according to a given per-request pricing
    function. We assume the later option in this work and we explain it in detail
    in Section 2.2. Fig. 1 shows the three coexisting networks; the dynamic spectrum
    access network (i.e., CRN), the spectrum sensing network, and the multichannel
    primary licensed network. SUs receive information about the availability/unavailability
    of spectrum channels from the spectrum sensing network. The spectrum sensing network,
    on the other hand, monitors the activity of PUs on a set of licensed spectrum
    channels and provide results as a service to clients. In this paper, we are interested
    in the problem of allocating spectrum channels along a given route, as shown in
    Fig. 1, in a multi-interface multi-hop dynamic spectrum access network. The objective
    is to minimize the spectrum sensing cost imposed by the sensing service provider
    while maintaining QoS guarantee on the data rate. Download : Download high-res

    Channel assignment and routing in multi-channel multi-interface wireless networks
    has been studied before [28], [29], [30], [31]. In [28], the problem of improving
    the capacity of multi-channel multi-interface IEEE 802.11 wireless networks is
    investigated. An interface assignment algorithm, along with a routing strategy
    were proposed. A distributed joint channel assignment and routing protocol is
    proposed in [29] for IEEE 802.11 multi-channel multi-interface mobile ad-hoc networks.
    The tradeoff between flexibility and switching overhead in multi-interface wireless
    mesh networks is investigated in [30]. A static interface assignment strategy
    is used for heavily loaded nodes, while a hybrid assignment policy is used for
    the rest of nodes. In the hybrid assignment, some interfaces are fixed while others
    are allowed to change their channels. In [31], a routing and interface assignment
    algorithm for multi-channel multi-interface ad hoc networks was proposed. The
    proposed algorithm establishes a route first, and then assigns channels to interfaces
    along the established route. A cost metric that accounts for the number of hops
    and adjacent hop interference is used. In [32], a multi-interface cognitive radio
    node model was proposed for enhancing routing in multihop cellular networks. An
    AODV-based routing protocol is proposed where the proper interface is activated
    on each node according to spectrum availability. The ordinary cellular interface
    is used only when no licensed or unlicensed spectrum resources are available.
    Each node has interfaces to exploit licensed idle channels, as well as unlicensed
    idle channels. 1.1. How is this work different? Despite being a well investigated
    issue in literature, we study the spectrum allocation problem in a unique setup.
    Our problem is to allocate spectrum channels to links of an existing route under
    an SSaS model. The SSaS provider has a location-dependent function to price sensing
    requests. Under this function, requests made by different SUs to monitor the same
    channel may impose different costs by the SSaS provider based on the locations
    of those SUs (see Section 2.2 for details). This problem under this specific scenario
    has not, to the best of our knowledge, been studied before. This work is important
    as a continuation of the ongoing efforts to prove the viability of the SSaS model
    [23], [24], [25] and to optimize network operations and functionalities under
    such model [24], [27]. 1.2. Contributions The main contributions of this work
    are as follows: - We identify and formulate the problem of minimum cost spectrum
    allocation with QoS guarantees along an established route in multi-interface dynamic
    spectrum access network. We also investigate the complexity of the problem. We
    prove the decision version of the problem to be NP-complete (and consequently
    the optimization version to be NP-hard) by a reduction from the well-known Integer
    Knapsack problem. Obtaining the optimal solution for NP-hard problems in polynomial
    time is not, yet, achievable. Therefore, polynomial-time sub-optimal algorithms
    must be proposed. To have a reference baseline against which the performance of
    such sub-optimal algorithms is evaluated, we propose an integer linear program
    (ILP) formulation to obtain the optimal solution. ILPs are usually solved using
    optimization solvers like CPLEX [33]. Keep in mind that such solvers are not guaranteed
    to obtain optimal solutions of NP-hard problems in polynomial time, and thus they
    cannot (in practice) replace the need for sub-optimal algorithms. - Given the
    NP-hardness of our research problem, we propose a sub-optimal algorithm based
    on the idea of ILP relaxation and iterative variable fixing. In ILP relaxation,
    integrality constraints are relaxed allowing variables to be assigned real values
    instead of integer values. Then, successive variable fixing is used to produce
    an integer solution from the solutions of relaxed ILPs solved over a number of
    iterations. The accuracy of the proposed sub-optimal algorithm is evaluated against
    the optimal solution (obtained by solving the ILP formulation) using extensive
    numerical experimentation. Furthermore, the effect of route’s rate requirement
    and number of per-node interfaces on the service cost is also thoroughly investigated
    under various route lengths. 1.3. Organization The rest of this paper is organized
    as follows. In Section 2, we present some preliminary assumptions and outline
    the system model. The research problem is formally defined and formulated in Section
    3. We then propose our sub-optimal algorithm in Section 4. Numerical results are
    presented and discussed in Section 5. We finally conclude the paper in Section
    6. 2. Preliminaries and system model In this section, we present the system model.
    We first explain the network model in Section 2.3. Then, the spectrum pricing
    model is introduced in Section 2.2. 2.1. SSaS model We assume an SSaS model that
    relies on an infrastructure wireless sensor network in which nodes are capable
    of spectrum monitoring (via cognitive radios) [23], [24]. The SSaS provider receives
    requests from client SUs to monitor a given spectrum channel(s) at specific location(s).
    The SSaS provider then optimizes the set of sensors to be activated in order to
    serve the incoming request, and sets a price for the service to be paid by the
    requesting client. We refer the reader to [24] for an idea about optimized sensor
    activation. The price that the SSaS provider sets is expected to be different
    for different requests. We explain this issue in Section 2.2. 2.2. Spectrum pricing
    model The SSaS provider sets service prices according to a given pricing policy.
    It is not within the scope of this work to investigate the design of such a policy.
    However, we need to make a few assumptions that we believe will hold in any pricing
    policy. We assume that service prices vary both temporally and spatially. In other
    words, different service prices may be set by the SSaS provider for sensing the
    same spectrum channel at different geographical locations or at different times.
    Such variation in prices can be justified by the following scenarios. 2.2.0.1.
    Scenario 1: variation in PU density Consider the case in Fig. 2. Assume the SSaS
    provider is requested to monitor a given spectrum channel at the points and .
    The circle around a PU represent the area within which no SU activity is allowed
    whenever the PU is active, i.e., PU’s protection region. Given a sensing request
    , the SSaS provider must monitor the activity of every PU where falls within its
    protection region. This means that only needs to be monitored in regards to request
    , while must be monitored in regards to request . The latter spreads over a larger
    area requiring more sensor nodes, and consequently a higher price. 2.2.0.2. Scenario
    2: variety in available sensors In this case, we are concerned with the scenario
    in which the distribution of available sensors in the SSaS infrastructure WSN
    is not uniform. This could occur due to a non-uniform deployment of sensors, or
    due to non-uniform distribution of sensing requests which leaves non-uniform distribution
    of available sensors. When there is abundance of available sensors in a given
    area, an activation schedule can be calculated to activate sensors in turns to
    save their energy and prolong the WSN’s lifetime. However, when there are fewer
    sensors in the same area, scheduling may not be possible leading to faster depletion
    of those sensor’s batteries. Furthermore, exploiting all sensors in a given area
    means that the service provider may have to reject future requests, affecting
    service availability. Therefore, it makes sense for the SSaS provider to impose
    higher cost for requests around which smaller number of sensors are available.

    Fig. 2. A toy example to illustrate “Scenario 1”. 2.3. Network model We assume
    a multi-interface cognitive radio network (MI-CRN) that consists of a set of multi-interface
    secondary users (MI-SUs). Each MI-SU is equipped with multiple cognitive radio
    interfaces, through which it can opportunistically utilize a set of licensed spectrum
    channels , where . The MI-CRN uses multihop communication, and it relies on a
    SSaS provider to get information about the availability/unavailability of any
    licensed spectrum channel. Throughout this work, we assume that all MI-SUs transmit
    on a fixed transmission power level. We further assume that the number of available
    interfaces may be heterogeneous among nodes in the MI-CRN. Multihop routes are
    established within the MI-CRN using any routing protocol. Our task in this paper
    is to assign spectrum channels to links along such a route so that the total spectrum
    sensing cost is minimized, and a given QoS rate requirement is satisfied. If no
    such assignment exists, a new route should be established. 3. Problem definition
    and formulation In this section, we start by presenting a formal definition of
    the research problem. Then, we analyze the problem’s complexity and prove that
    it is NP-hard. Finally, we propose an Integer Linear Program (ILP) formulation
    of the problem to be used for obtaining the optimal solution using existing optimizers.
    3.1. Problem definition Given a route that consists of a set of MI-SUs , and a
    set of links . Assume that every MI-SU is equipped with interfaces. We need to
    assign a set of channels to every link so that the total cost imposed by the SSaS
    provider is minimized and the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The expected
    data rate along the route is above or equal to a predetermined threshold . (2)
    The number of distinct channels assigned to every link is no more than the minimum
    of and . (3) The number of distinct channels assigned to links and link is less
    than or equal to for all . Let and denote the mean idle time and busy time of
    channel on link respectively. We assume that and are provided by the SSaS provider
    to its clients in order to facilitate their spectrum decision process. Also, let
    be the capacity of channel along link . Then, the expected data rate on link over
    channel , denoted , is calculated as follows: (1) Then, the expected data rate
    on link , denoted , is calculated as follows. (2) We assume that the SSaS provider
    imposes service prices according to a pricing function for monitoring spectrum
    channel around the coordinates of MI-SU . In order for channel to be used on link
    , it must be monitored by the SSaS provider based on the locations of and to make
    sure that the those two MI-SUs can use channel without harming any primary user.
    Therefore, let us define as the set of spectrum channels that need to be monitored
    around the location of MI-SU according to a given channel assignment. is the set
    of channels assigned to ’s incoming and outgoing links, and it is calculated as
    follows: (3) Now, we can define our research problem formally. Definition 1 The
    Minimum Cost - Bounded Rate (MCBR) Problem Given a route in a multi-interface
    sensor-aided CRN that opportunistically utilizes a set of licensed spectrum channels
    , find a channel assignment such that: (1) (3) (3) The total cost is minimized.
    3.2. Problem complexity Before discussing the complexity of our research problem,
    we need first to clarify some basic terms in computational complexity and intractability
    [34]. A problem is said to be NP-hard if every problem in NP class is reducible
    (i.e., transformable) to this problem in polynomial time. On the other hand, NP
    is the class of all decision problems that can be solved using nondeterministic
    polynomial-time algorithms. A nondeterministic polynomial-time algorithm is one
    that can verify a given solution (to be correct or not) in polynomial time. Finally,
    a problem is said to be NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard. Let us now
    analyze the complexity of the MCRB problem. To do so, we need first define a decision
    version of the MCRB problem and call it MCRB-D. Definition 2 The Minimum Cost
    - Bounded Rate Decision Problem (MCBR-D) Given a route in a multi-interface sensor-aided
    CRN that opportunistically utilizes a set of licensed spectrum channels , and
    given a constant . Is there a channel assignment such that: (1) (3) (3) . It can
    be shown that the MCBR-D problem is NP-complete by a reduction from the Integer
    Knapsack problem [34]. The integer knapsack problem is defined as follows. Definition
    3 Integer Knapsack (IK) Problem Given a finite set , a size and a value for each
    , and positive integers and . Is there a subset such that and ? In other words,
    the Integer Knapsack problem can be described as follows: “Given a set of items
    where each item has a size and a value , and given a knapsack of integer capacity
    . Can we fit a subset of the items into the knapsack such that the sum of their
    values is greater than or equal some integer threshold ?” To prove the NP-completeness
    of the MCBR-D problem, we first need to show that MCBR-D NP, and then prove that
    every instance of the IK problem can be reduced in polynomial time to an instance
    of the MCBR-D problem. Lemma 1 MCBR-D NP. Proof Given a solution for every link
    , we can calculate the rate of link using Eq. (2) and the set of node using Eq.
    (3) and verify them against constraints (1), (2) of Definition 3. This can be
    done in . During this process of calculation, the total cost can also be gradually
    evaluated. Finally, constraint (3) of Definition 3 is verified in . Therefore,
    the total time needed to verify a solution is .  ■ Lemma 2 IK MCBR-D. Proof every
    instance of IK can be mapped in polynomial time into an instance of MCBR-D as
    follows: - Create a route of a single link, i.e., and . - For every element ,
    create a channel and add it to , i.e., . - Set the number of interfaces as , i.e.,
    number of interfaces on every node equals the number of channels. - Set the rate
    of channel on the single link as . - Set the rate lower bound . - Set the sensing
    cost of channel at node as . Therefore, using channel on the single link will
    impose a total sensing cost of . - Set the cost upper bound as . The mapping procedure
    is summarized in Table 1. If a solution is found for the MCBR-D problem instance,
    then there is a solution to the IK problem instance as well. If the total cost
    , then by definition . Similarly, if , then by definition .  ■ Theorem 3 The MCBR-D
    problem is NP-Complete. Proof Given that MCBR-D NP as shown in Lemma 1, and given
    that IK MCBR-D as shown in Lemma 2, then MCBR-D is NP-Complete. ■ Now, given that
    the decision version of the MCBR problem is NP-complete, then the optimization
    version is NP-hard. Table 1. A summary of the mapping procedure to convert an
    instance of IK problem into an instance of MCBR-D problem. Element of IK Mapped
    to in MCBR-D – 3.3. Integer linear program formulation We are now ready to present
    an integer linear program formulation (ILP) of the MCBR in order to obtain its
    optimal solution. The optimal solution will later be used as a reference to measure
    the performance of the sub-optimal algorithm proposed in Section 4. The ILP formulation
    uses two main types of binary variables: - : a binary variable to indicate (if
    equal to 1) that channel is assigned to link . - : a binary variable to indicate
    (if equal to 1) that channel is assigned to ’s incoming and/or outgoing link along
    the route , and it therefore needs to be monitored around the location of . The
    ILP formulation is outlined next in Eqs. (4)–(10). The cost of sensing channel
    at is (i.e., if the channel is used at and 0 otherwise). The objective function
    minimizes the total spectrum sensing cost by summing over all nodes in and all
    channels in . Constraints (5), (6) make sure that variable is equal to 1 if any
    of the two variables and is equal to 1. In other words, these constraints guarantee
    that channel is assigned to one of the interfaces at if is assigned to ’s incoming
    and/or outgoing links. Constraint (7) ensures that the total number of channels
    that node uses does not exceed its number of available interfaces . Finally, constraint
    (7) requires the total rate that a solution offers to link to be at least equal
    to . ILP Formulation of the MCBR Problem (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) 4. Relaxation-based
    iterative fixing (RIF) algorithm As the MCBR is NP-hard, we propose in this section
    a sub-optimal algorithm that is based on a linear program (LP) relaxation of the
    original ILP formulation. The idea of the proposed algorithm is to first relax
    all integer variables in the ILP formulation and make them real variables between
    0 and 1 (inclusive). Therefore, constraints (9), (10) will be replaced with the
    following two constraints respectively: (11) (12) Then, the algorithm works in
    iterations. In every iteration, some of the link channel assignment variables
    (i.e., ) are fixed (i.e., set to either 0 or 1). When the selected variables are
    fixed, the LP is generated and solved again. This process repeats until all variables
    are fixed. This procedure is outlined in Algorithm 1, and we call it the Relaxation-Based
    Iterative Fixing (RIF) Algorithm. As an input, RIF takes the ILP formulation of
    the MCBR problem, abbrev. . It then defines an empty set to hold the variables
    that get fixed during execution. A relaxed version of is then created, abbrev.
    . After that, in a while loop, the following steps take place: - The relaxed program
    is solved using any existing LP optimization algorithm. In our case, we used CPLEX
    optimizer [33]. - If the problem becomes infeasible (due to some improper variable
    fixing that we have already done), we run Algorithm 2 to try to achieve a feasible
    solution or at least one that has the maximum possible rate. - Otherwise, we check
    if there are variables that have the value of 1. If so, we fix them to 1, add
    them to , and update with the needed constraints to enforce the assignment. -
    Otherwise, the variable that has the maximum value among the channel assignment
    variables, excluding the ones in , is selected. If it has a value of 0, then this
    means that all variables are either 0’s or 1’s and we have reached a complete
    integer solution. Thus, that solution is returned. - On the other hand, if , we
    ceil it to 1, and add that to as a constraint (i.e., ). Then, two scenarios are
    possible: (a) Scenario 1: becomes infeasible. In such a case, we replace the “1”
    assignment with a “0” assignment by modifying the constraint to look like . (b)
    Scenario 2: is feasible. In this case, we maintain the “1” assignment. - The variable
    representing the maintained assignment (whether a “0” or “1” assignment) is added
    to set . The outer while loop terminates when all variables have been fixed (to
    either 0 or 1). Download : Download high-res image (431KB) Download : Download

    If Algorithm 1 fails to find a feasible solution, it calls Algorithm 2 to search
    for a feasible solution without worrying about cost minimization. The latter searches
    for an assignment that results in the highest bottleneck data rate. Algorithm
    2 also uses the idea of iterative variable fixing. It creates a relaxed LP version,
    abbrev. , of the original ILP formulation . However, it changes the objective
    function to be “Maximize ” instead of “Minimize ”. Therefore, here is a variable
    and not a given constant. Thus, maximizes the bottleneck rate subject to constraints
    on the number of available interfaces to every node along the route. In every
    round, the algorithm fixes one assignment variable (the one that results in the
    highest objective value). When all assignment variables are fixed (either to 0
    or 1), the algorithm terminates. Download : Download high-res image (399KB) Download

    1 works iteratively. In every iteration, it fixes one link assignment variable
    (representing the assignment of channel to link ). The total number of link assignment
    variables is . Thus, the maximum number of iterations is also . As the number
    of iterations is bounded, convergence of the algorithm is guaranteed. In every
    iteration of Algorithm 1, a linear program is solved twice. Linear programs (LPs)
    can be solved in polynomial time using several algorithms [35]. Let us assume
    that the complexity of the LP solver algorithm of choice is . Assuming that Algorithm
    1 succeeds (and thus does not call Algorithm 2), the worst case computational
    complexity in this case is . Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download

    to Algorithm 1, it executes a maximum of iterations. In every iteration, and in
    the worst case, an LP is solved for every remaining unassigned variable (the foreach
    loop at line 8). Therefore, the total number of times an LP is solved is given
    as follows: Therefore, the complexity of Algorithm 2 is . This makes the complexity
    of Algorithm 1 in case of failure . The complexity varies with different LP solver
    algorithms. For example, the complexity of Karmarkar’s projective algorithm is
    , where is the number of variables and is the number of bits needed to encode
    the problem’s data [35]. Another example is Vaidya’s algorithm that has a complexity
    of [36]. 5. Performance evaluation In this section, we evaluate the performance
    of the proposed RIF algorithm by comparing it to the optimal solution obtained
    by solving ILPs using IBM Cplex Optimizer. We perform extensive experimentation
    with various combinations of parameters to make sure the algorithm is well validated.
    Let us first outline the experimentation setup, and then present the findings.
    5.1. Evaluation setup In every experiment, we generate a route of length MU-SUs
    where the location of every individual node is determined randomly within the
    transmission range of its predecessor on the route. Every node is assumed to have
    a random number of available interfaces chosen uniformly at random form the range
    . To simulate achievable data rates of various channels along different links
    of the route, we need a way to simulate channel statistics and for all . We used
    the same technique proposed in [27] (see Section 6.B) with the assumption that
    all channels have the same capacity. As for the service pricing function , the
    cost of monitoring a given channel at a specific location is drawn uniformly at
    random from the range [1, 10]. In regards to the QoS requirement , we set it as
    a percentage of the upper bound on the achievable data rate along route. To get
    this upper bound, we treat every link individually. For every link , at most channels
    can be assigned to it. Let be the set of best channels (in terms of achievable
    data rates) to be used along link . Then, the upper bound on the data rate of
    link is calculated as follows: (13) Then, we set as follows: (14) where . 5.2.
    Results Now, we are ready to present the results. We ran three categories of experiments.
    The first addresses the accuracy of the RIF algorithm. The second addresses the
    performance of the RM-IF algorithm which is used when RIF fails. The third category
    addresses the effect of rate requirements (i.e., ) on the cost of the solution.
    5.2.1. Algorithm accuracy To evaluate the accuracy of RIF algorithm, we generated
    routes of lengths . For every generated instance, the number of interfaces for
    every node is randomly generated from the range , where . Fig. 3 shows the error
    of RIF algorithm for . The error is calculated as follows: Every point on the
    three subfigures is an average of 1000 randomly generated instances. Fig. 3.a
    shows that RIF is roughly within 15% of the optimal solution when the rate requirement
    is low ( ) for all values of and for all route lengths. When is increased to 0.5,
    the error becomes more dependent on the maximum number of available interfaces
    and weakly dependent on the route length. For low interface availability ( ),
    Fig. 3.b shows that the error is within 15% for very short routes (length of 5)
    to 19% for long very routes (length of 25). The values are roughly around 15%
    for and 14% for for all route lengths. Fig. 3.c shows the case when , i.e., very
    high rate requirements. Here the dependency of the error on both route length
    and is more obvious. For low interface availability ( ), RIF algorithm is within
    6% of the optimal for very short routes (length of 5) to around 31% of the optimal
    solution for long routes (length of 25). This range improves when is increased
    to 4 becoming 6% for short routes to around 23% for long routes. It improves even
    further when allowing more interfaces (i.e., ) becoming 6% for short routes to
    around 19% for long routes. 5.2.2. The failure behavior of the algorithm when
    RIF algorithm fails to find a feasible solution, it calls RM-IF algorithm to find
    a solution with the highest bottleneck rate possible. However, if the rate achieved
    by RM-IF is lower than the required data rate, then we failed to find a feasible
    solution. This is expected to occur in cases of very restrictive circumstances
    (i.e., high and low ). Therefore, we need to quantify the failure rate defined
    as the ratio of the number of instances for which no feasible solution is found
    to the total number of instances (multiplied by 100%). Fig. 4 shows this ratio
    against rate requirement and number of interfaces . Every point on the figure
    is the average of 7500 randomly generated instances. Every 1500 instances correspond
    to a route length from the set . As the figure shows, the failures rate is almost
    zero for . The failure rate with the increase of and the decrease of . However,
    in the most difficult case of and , only 12% of the instances are not solved by
    the proposed algorithm. This number decreases to around 3% when . Even if the
    proposed algorithm fails to find a feasible solution, it tries to find a solution
    with the highest possible bottleneck rate. In Fig. 5, we quantify the ratio of
    the achieved data rate to the required data rate (i.e., ). Similar to the previous
    experiment, every point on the figure is the average of 7500 randomly generated
    instances. Every 1500 instances correspond to a route length from the set . For
    clarity of presentation, we set the ratio ( ) to 1 if . As the figure shows, in
    the worst case ( and ), the achieved rate is around 0.89 of . It improves to be
    around 0.98 of for . Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download

    how the rate requirement (represented by ) affects the cost of the solution (as
    stated in Eq. (4)). To do so, we generate a random route instance of a given length.
    We solve the instance for and find the cost, let that be . Then, we reduce to
    a value from the set and solve the instance again. The cost reduction in this
    case is calculated as: For the same value of , 1500 instances are randomly generated
    with a fixed route length from the set and a fixed number of interfaces from the
    set (i.e., ). The cost reduction is then averaged over all the 1500 instances.
    It is worth pointing out that the optimal solutions (obtained by solving the proposed
    ILP formulation) are used for this experiment. Fig. 6.(a), .(b), and .(c) show
    the average cost reduction for route length 5, 15, and 25 respectively. The findings
    of this experiment can be summarized as follows: Download : Download high-res

    the problem of spectrum allocation along an established route in dynamic spectrum
    access networks with the objective of minimizing the spectrum sensing cost imposed
    by a SSaS provider while maintaining QoS guarantees. We formulated the problem
    as an integer linear program. Given the NP-hardness of the problem, we proposed
    a sub-optimal algorithm based on the idea of iterative relaxation and variable
    fixing. Via extensive experimentation, we proved that our proposed algorithm is
    within 19% of the optimal solution. We also studied the relationship between rate
    requirements and cost reduction and showed that around 50% cost reduction is gained
    if the rate requirement is cut by half. Declaration of Competing Interest The

    Kenya SECTION I. Introduction In recent years, spectral resource demand increased
    drasti-cally, simultaneously with the development of wireless tech-nologies and
    user demand growth. Spectrum regulation au-thorities are practically unable to
    address user demand for all its users. However, spectrum sharing is introduced
    to address these issues. In this method, the spectrum can be shared based on time,
    location, and space and can be achieved through licensing arrangements. Even though
    the 4G era has long supported spectrum sharing, several difficult problems still
    pre-vent the effective application of spectrum-sharing algorithms. Industry and
    academic researchers have started conceptualizing the next generation of wireless
    communication systems (i.e., 6G) to solve these existing issues in 4G and 5G [1].
    When designing future communication systems, it is always important to have proper
    spectrum sharing to eliminate the use of trusted third-party coordination, prevent
    unauthorized access (spectrum misuse) and alteration of radio frequency sharing
    records in databases and establish strong security measures against attacks. These
    requirements can be achieved by carefully integrating BC technology with next-generation
    wireless communication systems. The BC technology has shown strong evidence for
    improving efficiency and security issues in many application areas [2]. The interest
    in BC increases due to its key attributes, such as security, anonymity, and data
    integrity. It is possible to use BC to control transactions without any third-party
    organization. The consensus algorithm is considered a core component of the BC
    system. For the generation of the new blocks, the consensus algorithm acts as
    a verification and measurable mechanism to ensure the agreement states of specific
    data among the distributed nodes of the BC network [3]. Proof of Work (PoW) and
    Proof of Stake (PoS) is mainly used as two consensus algorithms in BC networks.
    Spectrum misuse is one of the crucial issues that should be addressed when developing
    future wireless communication systems. Current DSA systems cannot monitor spectrum
    exploitation in real-time and mitigate security risks because of limited monitoring
    capabilities, inadequate data processing, evolving security threats, etc. Although
    the literature shows the number of BC-enabling DSA techniques, they cannot address
    the above issues [4] due to the high computational power of the consensus algorithms,
    latency, and lack of scalability. The consensus algorithm can be considered a
    key enabling feature to address the issues of existing BC-enabled DSA solutions.
    When developing consensus algorithms, paying close attention to the communication
    network''s latency and the computational costs for its secondary users (SU) with
    limited battery life is important. BC-based DSA techniques use universal, all-purpose
    consensus algorithms like PoW or PoS. These consensus algorithms consume high
    computational costs and considerable time during mining. Therefore, novel consensus
    mechanisms must be designed and developed to overcome the limitations of the existing
    consensus algorithms used in DSA. To address this research gap, we propose an
    RF sensing-enabled BC-based novel consensus algorithm for DSA named ''Proof of
    Equation (PoE).‘ PoE uses a numerical equation with three main parameters, i.e.,
    sensor capability, hash proportion (stake), and similarity score, to calculate
    the consensus score rather than using cryptographic calculations. The PoE algorithm
    is implemented using Python scripts-based simulation to evaluate the performance
    regarding scalability, block production time, and transaction throughput. GNU
    radio software has been used for sensor capability implementation. It is an open-source
    software development toolkit providing several signal-processing blocks to implement
    signal-processing systems. It can be used for designing and implementing software-defined
    radio (SDR) systems. The remainder of this paper can be outlined as follows. Section
    II discusses the current state of the art of BC-based DSA and consensus algorithms.
    Section III describes the operation of the proposed consensus architecture. The
    performance evaluation is given in Section IV, and conclusions are drawn in Section
    V. SECTION II. Related Works In [5], a BC-based digital token-based approach is
    intro-duced to track and validate the use of licensed frequency bands in DSA.
    This work utilizes the ERC721 standard (non-fungible token standard) and develops
    a proof of concept (PoC) solution using Ethereum BC. When a particular frequency
    band (FB) is leased, the spectral token is transferred (Ownership transfer) from
    primary users (PU) to secondary users (SU) using SC, a special form of an SC-
    named token contract. This spectral token needs to be automatically returned to
    the PU after the agreed-upon lease period expires. If multiple SUs at the same
    time request the same FB, PU can select the best bidder based on price and the
    lease time. A new BC-based mobile network infrastructure direction is discussed
    in [6]. The key feature of the proposed structure is the tokenization of spectrum
    and network infrastructure that allows trading them with multiple mobile network
    operators (MNOs) over BC. This framework uses five key ledgers for network management.
    Since mobile networks have thousands of transactions per second, the performance
    of all these ledgers depends on transaction speed. The critical factor affecting
    ledger performance is the underlying consensus mechanism. Therefore suitable consensus
    algorithms must be selected for the mobile networks by comparing their features.
    After com-paring different consensus algorithms, Proof-of- Formulation (PoF) is
    identified as the capable algorithm for the consensus process for mobile network
    management. Although PoF seems to be a capable algorithm, it is unsuitable for
    DSA as it can''t collect spectrum data when realizing consensus. In [7], authors
    have proposed a scalable, secure novel consensus algorithm, Delegated Proof of
    Reputation (DPoR), a modified version of delegated PoS. For the miner selection
    process, a reputation voting mechanism is used in DPoR rather than a stake voting
    mechanism as in DPoS. In DPoR, a reputation score is calculated for the reputation
    voting mechanism. Every node must register its account with an official address
    in this reputation voting mechanism. The reputation concept in DPoR consists of
    a combination of three factors defined in Equation 1. P, U, and R represent stake
    power, resource usage, and the transaction-based repu-tation rating, respectively.
    w 1 + w 2 + w 3 is equal to 1. Rep= w 1 P+ w 2 U+ w 3 R (1) View Source Stake
    power is calculated based on the account''s staked tokens. In the DPoS consensus,
    the stake amount is converted to the vote weight. On the other hand, DPoR consensus
    process uses SCs, unlike DPoS. If an account has an amount to be used for voting,
    it will be moved 10% to a staking SC every day and then converted to stake power
    in DPoR. Then, an account''s CPU, RAM, and bandwidth are considered resource usage.
    Transaction activity (R) is the most significant factor in this innovation. Some
    accounts can have many in/out transactions. That type of account is much appreciated
    in this transaction activity calculation process. In [8], a novel customized con-sensus
    mechanism called Proof of Sense is proposed to detect spectrum fraud in wireless
    networks. Unlike conventional algorithms like PoS and PoW, this mechanism follows
    an energy-efficient way of collecting spectrum sensing data to detect spectrum
    violations. In this mechanism, sensing nodes (miners) must participate in a cryptographic
    key recovery phase initiated by the spectrum regulator. The spectrum sensor that
    captures this random cryptographic key first becomes the next block creator and
    is able to forge the next block. The works propose in [5] and [6] employ generic
    consensus algorithms for DSA solutions. In [5], the PoW consensus algorithm for
    DSA solutions is less energy efficient and expensive. Furthermore, the above solutions
    lack application-specific consensus in their implementation and lack spectrum
    misuse detection capability. The work [7] introduces a generic reputation-based
    algorithm that could not be used in DSA-based applications to gain application-specific
    performance. The proof of sense consensus algorithm proposed in [8] is customized
    for spectrum misuse detection in DSA. Even though this mechanism addresses what
    is missing in the [5] and [6], evaluating the quality of spectrum data is missing.
    SECTION III. Operation of the Proposed Consensus Algorithm-Proof of Equation (poe)
    The main objective of this study is to propose a customized novel consensus algorithm
    for spectrum misuse detection. Fig. 1 presents the overall consensus architecture
    of the proposed novel consensus algorithm. It is named as “Proof of Equation (PoE)”,
    which is scalable and secure with an acceptable decentralization. It is developed
    by referring to the PoS consensus algorithm, where stake can be defined as the
    number of holdings of a wallet. The core of the proposed PoE consensus algorithm
    is consensus score calculation based on a numerical equation with main three parameters
    such as sensor capability, hash proportion (stake), and similarity score. Therefore
    this algorithm is cost-effective and energy-efficient as no hash power is consumed.
    Due to that reason, miners are not needed. The numerical equation of consensus
    score (V) can be defined as follows. V=aC+bH+cS (2) View Source C, H, and S parameters
    can be defined by, C - Sensor capability. H - Hash proportion/stake. S - Similarity

    Show All A. Obtaining Parameters Sensor Capability (C): A known text-embedded
    signal is transmitted by the regional operator. Then, sensors should detect that
    text -embedded transmitted signal and extract the text. At the receiver end, detection
    probability is calculated. For that process, a simple algorithm is used. By employing
    SC at the receiver side, the transmitted text by the regulator can be obtained
    for comparison with the received text. The receiver should not be able to modify
    the transmitted text. By calling the SC, each of the sensors gets the operator-transmitted
    raw text value and it compares with the sensor''s received text value. The detection
    probability value is calculated based on the difference between the transmitted
    and received texts (based on errors in the received text). Finally, the calculated
    detection probability value should be assigned to Equation 2 as the sensor capability
    value (C). The complete process for obtaining the sensor capability value is portrayed
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Proposed Method for the Detection Probability Calculation Show
    All Hash Proportion/Stake (H): Sensed data should be uploaded to the IPFS database
    from time to time by every sensor. Each sensor will receive a hash for each data
    uploaded. Hash is a fixed-sized string that can be used uniquely to identify data.
    The hash proportion is calculated by the number of hash values collected by each
    sensor over the number of hashes it can collect for 24 hours. Once the sensor
    becomes the winning node, it can upload all pending hash values to the BC. H=  No.

    Similarity Score (S) Every sensor in the network receives other sensors'' data
    set hashes using BC transactions. Then, access the other sensor''s spectrum data
    in the IPFS database using hash values. The similarity score is calculated by
    computing the correlation coefficient between each data set received from other
    sensors and datasets of its own. B. Parameter Combination According to the Equation
    1 there are three coefficient values a,b, and c for sensor capability, similarity
    score, and Hash Proportion respectively. Sensor Capability - Coefficient a: The
    coefficient a was defined using the traffic intensity of the day. When the traffic
    intensity is high, spectrum sensors in the network need a higher capability to
    collect more accurate data by spectrum sensing. When the traffic intensity is
    low, this requirement can be slightly relaxed. Therefore, the coefficient of sensor
    capability “a” should have a higher priority when the traffic intensity is high.
    This can be achieved by normalizing the network traffic to the range between 0
    and 1 and getting that value for coefficient “a”. This coefficient value needs
    to be applied to all sensors in the selected area. Hash Proportion/Stake - Coefficient
    b: When the number of sensors in the area is higher, repetition of the same data
    sets can be expected. This will work the other way around when the network''s
    number of sensor nodes is low. Therefore, when sensors in the network are low,
    Stake should have higher priority to get the total capacity of the sensors. Therefore
    stake coefficient “b” can be defined as, b= 1  Number of sensors in the system  (4)
    View Source The coefficient of hash proportion will be more prominent when there
    are fewer sensors and lower when sensors in the area are higher. Similarity Score
    - Coefficient c: The similarity score helps to eliminate malicious users in the
    system because the correlation coefficient between malicious data sets and honest
    sensors has a significant difference. Data similarity coefficient “c” is crucial
    for all the sensors regardless of the location and traffic density. Therefore
    malicious users would not be able to have a considerable similarity score for
    malicious data sets, which results in a low consensus score for malicious users.
    Coefficient “c” sets to one to give the highest priority. SECTION IV. Simulation
    Results This section elaborates the simulation results of the imple-mented PoE
    algorithm. The PoE algorithm is implemented using the Python3 programming language.
    As this is a simu-lation, only back-end development is carried out using REST
    APIs with the Flask framework. This BC is simulated by using multiple nodes which
    run on a local computer. Blockchain nodes are connected using socket communication.
    Every node has a wallet which used to create transactions within the network.
    This digital wallet has a public key and a private key. It is used to add digital
    signatures to transactions and blocks. For the simulation, transactions are posted
    to the network by executing a Python script with transactions included. Fig. 3
    portrays the high-level view of the simulation. Fig. 3. High-level View of the
    Simulation Show All All the simulations are carried out on a laptop that has a
    core i7-1165G7 CPU and 8GB RAM. Nodes in the net-work are simulated by running
    the Python script in multiple command terminals. When a defined number of transactions
    are completed in the network, the consensus score for each transaction is calculated
    by using 3 parameters. Then block creator is selected after the consensus score
    calculation, and it creates the block and adds it to the BC. When reaching the
    consensus in the network, the winner''s node''s screen output as “I am the forger,”
    and other nodes output as “I am not the forger”. We evaluate the Scalability,
    block production time, and throughput of the proposed PoE algorithm. A. Scalability
    of Poe Scalability in a BC network indicates the ability of a consensus protocol
    to handle the increasing number of BC nodes. In theory, PoW which is used in bitcoin
    has the scalability feature to a greater extent. It can hold as many users in
    the network. We started the simulation with a network size of 4 participants,
    then we adjust the network size from 4 to 10 with step 2. Furthermore, we set
    the block size fixed to 500. We quantify the average time to produce a block and
    results are shown in Fig. 4. We can observe that when we increase the network
    size from 4 to 10 average block production time increases slightly by milliseconds.
    We can expect the PoE can provide higher scalability. B. Block Production Time
    Next, we vary the number of transactions in a block from 100 to 500 to measure
    the average time it takes to produce a block with different network sizes. In
    our simulation, we measure the block production time with different network sizes
    ranging from 4 to 10. Fig. 5 reveals a continual growth of block production time
    with the number of transactions in a block (block size). This is because as the
    block size increases block creator needs to process more transactions. Here, Processing
    tasks include Merkle tree calculation, winner IPFS hash se-lection, and packaging
    transactions in the transaction pool to the block. After completing the above
    processes, a block will be created. Therefore, block production time will continue
    to grow when block size increases. Furthermore, we can observe that when the number
    of nodes in the network increases block production time will be increased slightly
    than the previous level of nodes for the same block size. This is because when
    the network size increases nodes with the highest consensus score have to be found
    by iteration. Fig. 4. Average Block Production Time Variation with Different Network
    Sizes Show All We simulate the PoE, PoW, PoS consensus algorithms with 100 transactions
    to compare the block production time. The difficulty in PoW is set to five zeros.
    The results are shown in Table I. We can observe that the PoW consensus algorithm
    consumed a higher time than the other two algorithms. There-fore it is clear that
    PoW is inefficient and energy-consuming. But PoS and PoE consume very little time
    to forge a block compared to Po W. Table I reveals that PoE is around four times
    faster than PoS. The reason for this is PoE has a linear equation to select the
    next forger. Therefore we can conclude that the proposed PoE is fast and efficient
    compared to popular algorithms like PoS and PoW. Table I Comparison of block production
    time of different consensus mechanisms C. Transaction Throughput Transaction throughput
    of a BC network is the number of transactions that can be processed in a unit
    of time. Our proposed PoE algorithm is computationally efficient as it uses a
    consensus score rather than solving a cryptographic puzzle. In this simulation,
    we increment the block size from 100 to 500 and the network size from 4 to 10
    using steps of two. Fig. 6 reveals how throughput varies in the simulated network.
    We can observe that transaction throughput increases when blocking size increases.
    When considering the variation of transaction throughput with different network
    sizes we can conclude that if the network size is smaller throughput is high.
    This is because smaller networks have a lower delay as it uses less bandwidth.

    and non-blockchain-based spectrum-sharing systems with the proposed system. (Here,
    L→ Low, M→ Medium, H→ High, → Not Relevant/Not Available) Table II Features comparison
    with key related works SECTION V. Conclusion This paper introduces a novel consensus
    algorithm namely, Proof of Equation (PoE) for DSA. The proposed algorithm is based
    on the consensus score rather than a cryptographic calculation. In PoE, the sensor
    with the highest consensus score forges the next block in the BC. The performance
    of the PoE is evaluated by considering the block production time and throughput
    while increasing block size. The scalability of the proposed consensus is also
    evaluated with different network sizes. PoE is also compared with the existing
    algorithms PoW and POS. The results verify that the PoE consensus algorithm can
    outperform the PoW and PoS regarding block production time and throughput. Therefore,
    the PoE consensus is fast and efficient for DSA and can address the issues in
    existing con-sensus mechanisms. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can collect
    spectrum data to detect spectrum misuse. Developing the DSA system with the proposed
    consensus algorithm using hardware like Software Defined Radios (SDRs) and raspberry
    pi computers is left as the future research area. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This Research

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Trichy, India SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive
    radio independently manages radio spectrum utilization. The radio spectrum might
    be utilized while it is not being utilized by the existing radio framework. Such
    unused radio frequencies are known as spectrum opportunity (or) blank area. Joseph
    Mitola III and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. formally settled with the possibility of
    Cognitive Radio (CR) in 1999. As indicated by Mitola, CR is the new way to deal
    with remote network connection when Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and the
    connected networks are computationally complex. Here, a smart device is proposed
    by considering its environmental factors. Here, the essential goals considered
    are (i) dependable correspondences and (ii) effective utilization of accessible
    assets. These targets are accomplished by checking and changing the inner states
    due to the change in considering the radio frequencies. The objective of a Software
    Defined Radio (SDR) network is establishing a remote “black box”, whose correspondence
    could be altered by considering the requests of the associated devices and the
    accessible data transfer capacity. Figure 1: Block diagram contrasting SDR Show
    All The use of various insights to quickly move to unoccupied channels while bypassing
    congested channels is critical to the advances in cognitive radio. This augments
    the radio frequency spectrum with minimal measure of obstruction among different
    clients. Optional radio frameworks have a huge test for deciding whether they
    are working inside a spectrum. Cognitive Radio (CR) comes in two types: spectrum-detecting
    cognitive radio and full cognitive radio. Full CR considers each conceivable boundary
    that might be considered by a remote hub or organization, considering total boundary
    conditions of the remote hub or organization. Spectrum detection in cognitive
    radio considers the channels of the radio frequency spectrum. The power control
    technique ensures trustworthy correspondence between cognitive radio terminals
    and essential clients. The cognitive radio has two key qualities that may be outlined:
    Cognitive ability: Information might be accumulated or seen from the radio spectrum
    on the account of radio innovation. Reconfigurability: Cognitive ability empowers
    the observing of the radio spectrum, and this feature permits the radios to be
    customized to the particular working circumstances. SECTION II. Literature Review
    Jianqing Liu et al. (2016) recommended a novel method to solve unlicensed users''
    energy problems. When allocating spectrum to unlicensed users, the licensed user''s
    channel capacity, channel status information, traffic load, and transmission requirements
    are considered. The proposed strategy increases the unlicensed users'' energy
    efficiency more than the currently used cooperative solutions. Nie Nie et al.
    (2007) employed a game theory technique to enhance the cognitive radio network''s
    performance. The system makes certain nodes to cooperate in order to minimize
    the energy usage. The maximum power transmission was not constrained by any transmission
    power usage in the first technique. Another approach uses an iterative algorithm
    to allocate power and scheduling spectrum, which results in power and channel
    scheduling for all unlicensed users. According to the simulation results, autonomous
    channel and power allocation have increased the system performance. Fang Ye et
    al. (2011) examined the interference restriction in the CR network using a genetic
    approach to perform resource allocation. This author suggests allocating enhanced
    genetic resources. The two sets employed in this approach are the realistic spectrum
    allocation policy and the randomly updated spectrum allocation policy. The limited
    freely available module that is employed after updating the population causes
    computational complexity, which is reduced by this approach. Results from virtual
    experiences uncover that the proposed strategy is more productive than both the
    norm and quantum hereditary ways to deal with spectrum allocation. Deepak Joshi
    et al. (2012) Researchers have recently studied the challenges in cognitive radio
    networks that use Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM). The simulation
    results show an enhanced outcome. Huahui Wang et al. (2010) In CR network, power
    and channel assignments were considered. There are various bands that make up
    the whole electromagnetic spectrum, wherein each band contains a number of channels.
    The proposed system optimizes the total rate for all CR users and ensures balanced
    traffic spectrum allocation. To increase the sum rate, a stable water filling
    technique has been devised. The simulation results demonstrate the improved outcome.
    Wei Wang et al. (2011) proposed a framework for performing a combined spectrum
    allocation and power regulation to make use of the 43 licensed portions of the
    electromagnetic spectrum that are not being used after considering the temperature
    limit and opportunistic spectrum allocation. To achieve the highest throughput
    in a single flow network, a power assignment mechanism is developed based on time
    division multiplexing model. The system must decide how to distribute the available
    spectrum in a cooperative way. The simulation results demonstrate how the author
    achieves effective spectrum utilization with this suggested approach. SECTION
    III. Proposed Method Cognitive radio was first introduced in a conventional setting
    by Joseph Mitola at a gathering held by the Illustrious Establishment of Innovation
    in Stockholm in 1998; he and Gerald Q. Maguire, Jr. further on the point in an
    article distributed in 1999. The expression “cognitive radio” is utilized to allude
    to a framework that can recognize and decipher its current circumstance, adjusting
    its radio''s functional boundaries continuously founded on its perceptions of
    its general surroundings. In CR, remote senders and receivers intelligently determine
    which channels are busy and which are not, and switch to the free channel. ➢ Spectrum
    Sensing One of the goals of spectrum sensing/detection, especially obstacle detection,
    is to obtain the spectrum state (empty/occupied) with the goal that the SU can
    reach the spectrum under the impedance pressure. Here, the challenge is in sorting
    out how much disturbance the essential SU signals are delivering at the end. ➢
    Spectrum Decision A selection model is required to perform spectrum allocation.
    The level of refinement of this model is interpreted by enabling the considerations
    used to examine the spectrum. The decision model turns out to be more complex
    when SU has a large number of goals. At the point when there are a few essential
    and optional clients, choices on spectrum access will be impacted by client preferences.
    Users'' access to the spectrum might be cooperative or uncooperative. Each user
    in a non-cooperative environment serves their own purpose, but all users in a
    cooperative environment may cooperate to accomplish a single objective. For instance,
    numerous SUs could compete with one another to access the radio spectrum in order
    to optimize each one''s throughput. ➢ Spectrum Analysis or Sharing The detected
    spectral findings are analyzed to determine spectral quality. The problem here
    is how to assess the type of spectrum. This component might be considered by utilizing
    various measurements, including Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). ➢ Spectrum Mobility
    or Handoff Spectrum Versatility hints at interactions that allow CR clients to
    switch between work iterations. By allowing wireless terminals to operate in the
    most ideal repeat range, CR networks accommodate dynamic frequency usage to meet
    simple communication requirements when transitioning to higher repeat ranges.
    SECTION IV. Results and Discussion Spectrum blockage is a consequence of the quick
    development of remote administrations in the recent years for increasing the interchanges
    among clients. Researchers are more concerned on solving the challenges in static
    spectrum allocation based on the current remote network conditions. This might
    prompt wasteful utilization of the spectrum and the subsequent blank areas. Blocked
    radio frequencies might stay away from the utilization of Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA) by CR network. ➢ Spectrum Access using Auctions Barters reason that purchasers
    and dealers might cooperate to trade labor products. In CR networks, barters are
    principally used to push SUs towards more productive spectrum utilization. Many
    groups are typically engaged with bartering. The following auction types are mentioned
    and are often included in auctions. First-Price Sealed-Bid auction (FPSB): Costs
    are borne by whoever wins the bartering. Contingent upon how much different offers
    exist. Profit and winning percentages are traded off in a game of chance. Second-price
    sealed-bid auction (Vickrey): Highest lost offer will be paid by the winner. Bidding
    one''s value is the best course of action in this type of auction. English auction
    (Open Ascending-bid auctions): The barter starts with a least price offered. Offers
    are raised until no other person will outbid them. Offering up to the worth and
    holding out until the cost in outbid is the ideal methodology in an English closeout.
    Dutch auction (Open Descending-bid auctions): Prices will progressively reduce
    after starting off at a relatively high value, according to the auctioneer. The
    most noteworthy bidder is the one whose bid is acknowledged first. The employment
    of the Dutch auction at Holland''s flower marketplaces is how it got its name.
    Figure 2: Organigram showing types of auctions Show All Not at all like conventional
    sell-offs, twofold closeouts permit bidders and venders to execute on a similar
    thing simultaneously. Since in sell off based frameworks each channel is given
    to a solitary organization, the idea of PU and SU in a similar channel doesn''t
    exist. The controller awards channels to discharge and the discharge deliberately
    share the unused channels with SUs. The regulator assigns the privilege of becoming
    the channel''s PU or SU. ➢ Spectrum Access using Multi Agent Systems Distributed
    Artificial Intelligence (DAI) is predicated on changing from individual to aggregate
    conduct with an end goal to overcome the challenges while managing complex circumstances
    requiring the enormous number of substances. Table 1: Agent-CR comparison ➢ Spectrum
    Access using Game Theory A mathematical framework called “game theory” may be
    used to evaluate the iterative options and behaviors of people, who are concerned
    with their personal gain. Cooperative games and competitive games are the two
    main gaming categories. All players in a alliance game will have more consideration
    about the progress of the group all in all than they do for their own benefit.
    In cutthroat games, players are persuaded to a great extent for monetary profit
    by prompting forcefully individualistic navigation. The sign of the game-hypothetical
    strategy is the idea of Nash Equilibrium (NE). Each player in NE is accepted to
    realize every other person''s harmony procedure, and none can advance their situation
    by changing their own balance methodology. Another crucial idea in game theory
    is Pareto efficiency. If it is impossible to change a condition such that at least
    one person benefits without harming anybody else, it is said to be Pareto efficient.
    Anyone may discover both pure and blended tactics in any game. A mixed strategy,
    on the other hand, combines several different techniques with associated probability.
    An activity and the unadulterated technique that utilizes only that activity are
    both addressed by every cell in the award network. Using a mixed approach, the
    possible actions are randomly chosen using a probability distribution. Let ai
    be any action of Ai and Ai = “all possible actions of agent i”. Si(aj) is equal
    to the probability that action aj is taken when mixed strategy si is used. A pure
    strategy is a special case of a mixed strategy where only one action acts as support.
    The probability of each action in a fully mixed approach is greater than 0. For
    example, support (si) =Ai. A Possible Nash Equilibrium in Game Mixed Approaches
    without Real Strategy. Reenactment results show that the proposed strategy further
    develops execution over the non-helpful standard. It has been shown that the normal
    price per SU per aperture for useful and unhelpful spectral acquisition and access
    decreases as single-channel acquisition time increases and access time is forced.
    In this figure, we can see that the proposed technique of capturing and accessing
    shared spectrum using alliance formation outperforms the unacceptable situation
    in all the measurements considered. This advantage diminishes with = 0.5, or when
    a big part of the space is utilized for detecting a solitary channel, however
    it doesn''t go under an improvement of 54.7% over the non-helpful technique. Figure
    3: When there are N = 10 SUs and K = 14 channels in a network, the average reward
    per SU per slot shifts depending on how much time is needed to perceive a single
    channel. Show All A few less popular issues that emerge when gatherings have disparate
    objectives might be better perceived with the assistance of game hypothesis. It
    offers a worldview for looking at the issue of SU spectrum access in cognitive
    radio organizations with the dependence of specialists in comparative circumstances.
    Because of the difficulty of expecting that players know their own and other players''
    settlements and the trouble of tackling games containing blended strategies when
    there is a major result network, game hypothesis can''t be used to assess every
    single serious concern. ➢ Spectrum Access using Multi Agent Systems An agent is
    a piece of software that can achieve a specific task in an autonomous way (for
    the sake of the user or the application). To run the reenactment, two different
    fixed upsides of time (T 1 and T2), with T1 being what is going on and T2 addressing
    a lengthier time span. T1 permits SU specialists to demand some spectrum inside
    a period imperative of T1 Minutes; this breaking point, as well, is inside a period
    limitation of T1 Minutes. When should be visible in Table 3, in any event, when
    the quantity of specialists develops, the typical number of messages(per specialist)
    remains moderately consistent at around 4. At the point when the time limitation
    is T2, the strategy''s presentation drops far underneath 80%, yet it actually
    stays stable. Table 2: T1 and T2 message success and number SECTION V. Conclusion
    The findings demonstrate that by adding collaboration between main and secondary
    user devices, the suggested solution can accommodate the high spectrum sharing
    needs. Even with several agents, the success percentage for spectrum allocation
    is close to 80%. This research study has covered many techniques for performing
    dynamic spectrum access in cognitive radio networks, where the network''s capability
    is not streamlined due to client behavior, which is frequently used in this field
    because it can satisfy the clients to consider powerful spectrum. This study has
    also demonstrated various research analysis process that utilized Markov models
    to represent the dynamic nature of SUs; thereby improving the outcome when compared
    to the previously discussed procedures. Finally, this study focused on how multi
    -specialist frameworks could be used for performing Distributed Spectrum Allocation
    (DSA). In contrast to game theory, the proposed approach has only been limitedly
    used to address the issue of spectrum allocation. The MAS in the CR is used in
    a variety of ways; some provide interaction exclusively among SUs, while others
    coordinate to establish dynamic spectrum access. SECTION VI. Future Scope In future,
    a higher level of quality will be guaranteed for CR portable terminals and work
    on the dependability of remote network connections by integrating multi-specialist

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Bengaluru, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Rapid advancements in wireless technology have led to a belief that usable radio
    frequencies are scarce. This scarcity is rather due to the inefficient usage of
    traditional static spectrum allocation. Most of these licensed spectrums are idle
    at most times and hence the spectrum bands are highly underutilized [1]. Dynamic
    spectrum access (DSA) provides a solution to this problem by dynamically choosing
    a free licensed spectrum band to transmit data which surely increases the utilization
    of these bands. Multiple operators can use the same band at different times solving
    the problem of spectrum scarcity. DSA is supported by Cognitive Radio (CR). CR
    was proposed by Joseph Mitola in 1999 as an intelligent radio which can perceive
    the surrounding spectrum environment and adapt itself to the surrounding changes
    [1]. A Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) enables sharing of frequency bands between
    Primary Users (PU) and Secondary Users (SU) solving the problem of spectrum scarcity.
    SU can use a licensed spectrum band for transmission as long as the high priority
    PU is not using it. When a PU chooses to use the band the SU must select another
    vacant band for its services. Thus, SU uses a spectrum management framework comprising
    four main steps 1) Spectrum sensing, 2) Spectrum decision, 3) Spectrum sharing,
    4) Spectrum mobility as shown in Fig. 1 [2]. Spectrum sensing checks for the presence
    of PU and other spectrum conditions to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). Spectrum
    decision involves choosing an ideal spectrum for transmission from the available
    bands. Spectrum sharing involves sharing a band with multiple SUs without collision.
    Spectrum mobility is switching from one band to another band while maintaining
    a seamless connection and satisfying QoS parameters. Spectrum mobility involves
    spectrum handoff and connection management [2]. Fig. 1: Spectrum management framework
    [2] Show All Spectrum handoff is one of the most important part of the spectrum
    management framework. The handoffs could be triggered due to any of these reasons:
    (i) performance of the available channel is below the QoS requirements due to
    poor signal quality, (ii) appearance of PU on the available channel even when
    SU is static, (iii) the available channel becomes unavailable due to SU mobility
    and (iv) false alarm in imperfect channel sensing. The existing spectrum handoff
    strategies are: Reactive handoff Proactive handoff Hybrid handoff Non handoff
    Reactive strategies continuously monitor the network for the arrival of PU through
    spectrum sensing. Proactive strategies predict the availability of bands and spectrum
    handoff is completely dependent on the prediction algorithms. Hybrid strategies
    incorporate the features of both proactive and re-active strategies [2]. Fig.
    2: Spectrum handoff concept [2] Show All The requirements of an efficient spectrum
    handoff technique are: minimum handoff time, reduced interference to PUs, less
    frequent handoffs, and reduced service time. Reactive and proactive spectrum Handoffs
    both come with their respective pros and cons as listed in Table I. Proactive
    handoffs can be inaccurate and costly in terms of energy, while Reactive Handoffs
    can lose more data via collisions. Few researchers have used machine learning
    based approaches. In CRN, the resource availability itself is dynamic and that
    is where su-pervised or unsupervised algorithms alone are not applicable to the
    spectrum handoff problems in CRN. Supervised and unsupervised models can propose
    a better solution only if the values of the input parameters are known before
    and are not expected to change in the future. But, spectrum handoff is very much
    dependent on the performance of spectrum sensing and PU activity. By learning
    spectrum parameters, spectrum sensing time and a number of channels to be sensed
    can be made dynamic based on surrounding network conditions. Therefore, reinforcement
    learning which can fine tune its input parameters and policies in accordance with
    the variations in the network is more suitable [3]. The factors that cause network
    changes could be the number of PUs entering or leaving the network, number of
    SUs in the network, residual energy of the users, the QoS requirements of applications,
    etc. The literature is searched by using the spectrum handoff, CRNs, and reinforcement
    learning as keywords. The latest papers starting from 2017 are considered. The
    referred papers are classified depending on their aim into: approaches to re-duce
    the convergence time, basic application of RL to improve the performance. The
    accuracy of the spectrum prediction algorithms is highly dependent on the randomness
    in PU activity. As PU activity is time dependent i.e. the PU traffic may be very
    high during the day time and low during the night. Based on the applications,
    one may have to decide the sensing periodicity in the given area. SECTION II.
    Literature Survey Researchers have used numerous methods to estimate the spectrum
    availability of the PU channel and Expected Trans-mission Time (ETT). Researchers
    have attempted to use various priority queuing models to manage the spectrum access
    among the high priority PUs and contending SUs. In the case of the SUs with different
    QoS requirements, and to attend the SUs with rigid QoS requirements, SUs are also
    prioritized by various researchers [4]. The prioritization among the SUs plays
    a significant role and is inevitable in the case of heterogenous networks in 5G
    especially when the Internet of Things (IoTs) supports various applications and
    with different capability exists in a network. There are many challenges involved
    in spectrum handoff. Selecting a target channel accurately is one of them. For
    proactive techniques to work well channel accuracy is a must. Extended handoff
    latency is another challenge which affects the performance of reactive techniques.
    Aggarwal et. al [5] propose a hybrid spectrum mobility technique to address the
    issues of traditional reactive and proactive mobility techniques. Here a centralized
    device is proposed which uses a probabilis-tic approach for handoffs and centralizes
    the functions of the individual SUs to a single device. This device calculates
    and maintains a matrix with the idle probability of all channels. This model matches
    the accuracy of a reactive model as the sensing occurs at the time of handoff.
    While it also improves the handoff latency as it senses channels which are most
    likely idle to least likely idle. Single cognitive device instead of all CUs having
    to do the processing individually by themselves also helps conserve energy. The
    residual time of a spectrum is the amount of time a SUs can transmit in a spectrum
    hole. The residual time of these holes determines the availability of channels
    for the SU. Hoque et. al [6] propose an analytical model to study charac-teristics
    of performance metrics including switching delay and finite handoff. Authors consider
    a lognormal, Erlang-m,n and exponential distribution for the analysis on spectrum
    handoff impacted by residual time and switching delay. Among these distributions,
    it was observed that the Erlang distribution performs the best. This model observed
    minimum spectrum handoffs as compared to the other traditional techniques. Handoffs
    situation arises when a SU has to move from one channel to another due to the
    arrival of a licensed PU. Gupta et. al [7] provide a hybrid strategy of handoff
    which uses attributes of both purely reactive and purely proactive techniques.
    The spectrum sensing and choosing of the next spectrum are done proactively while
    the handoff occurs on a reactive basis. The authors implement a Discrete Markov
    chain-based greedy algorithm which can be used to proactively determine the target
    channel. Here, fixed-sized time slotted CR network is assumed which chooses the
    best channel on the basis of the highest probability of K-idle time slots among
    the channels. Performance analysis proves that this approach outperforms the traditional
    reactive and proactive approaches in terms of service time, number of handoffs,
    and throughput. Table I: Spectrum-hand off techniques In CR networks, SU need
    to vacate their channel when a PU arrives in the network. Such frequent handoff
    can degrade the QoS of these interrupted users. Existing techniques do not give
    any preference to these interrupted SU over uninterrupted PU to resume their remaining
    transmission. Zahed et. al [8] propose a prioritized proactive scheme which gives
    higher priority to these SUs over the uninterrupted ones. This is implemented
    using a preemptive resume priority(PRP) M/M/1 queue. The total service time is
    evaluated for the model and compared with existing techniques as a metric for
    performance analysis. The proposed model outperforms the existing model in the
    total service time evaluated. Improvements to this study can be made by working
    with more extensive traffic models which enhance the traffic statistics for both
    primary and SUs. Other metrics like handoff delay, resource utilization and interruption
    probability could also be used to better validate the model. Deployment of CR
    networks must first require precise simulation of these networks. Also, CR network
    protocols are often cross-layered, and can''t be trivially implemented in off-the-shelf
    hardware. A. Al-Ali et. al [9] present a framework for ns3 that is suitable and
    introduces several CR features like spectrum sensing, PU detection, and spectrum
    handoff. Only the transport, network, data link and physical layer are modified
    and the other layers till transport layer are untouched. Authors define a new
    concept of cognitive interface in the link and physical layer. This CR node can
    define control, transmitter, and receiver interfaces. The results are compared
    against the older NS-2 software and demonstrate improvements in execution time
    and memory usage. A fuzzy logic system is one of the most effective ways to solve
    decision-based word problems. It uses a mathematical tool to make decisions that
    resemble human reasoning. A. Alhammadi et. al [10] introduce spectrum handoff
    based on this System. The fuzzy logic system comprises of a fuzzy logic controller
    consisting of three variables as input: arrival rate of PUs, eNB load, and received
    power. And an output variable is the handoff probability. The results were simulated
    on matlab with 27 logic rules utilized to find handoff probability. The algorithm
    avoids unnecessary handoffs and provides a good solution to avoid communication
    interruption caused by the mobility of SUs. Y. Song et. al [11] use probability
    based prediction to propose proactive spectrum handoff criteria to prevent collision
    between SUs and PUs. Two metrics were predicted and considered: (1) Probability
    of the channels being free for the data transmission, (2) the expected length
    of the channel''s free duration. This work considers three probability thresholds:
    the threshold over which the channel is free for the next frame transmission,
    the threshold over which the channel is free at the end of the present frame and
    the threshold under which the present channel is considered occupied at the end
    of transmission of the frame. The handoff latency is much lesser than reactive
    models but is less accurate. Performance results also show that the proposed channel
    selection technique produces higher throughput and shorter handoff delays in multi
    SUs scenarios. The following papers have used reinforcement learning based approaches.
    Zhou et. al [12] have proposed Q-learning based spectrum handoff method with the
    channel occupied as the current state and channel selection as the action to be
    taken. Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is used as the reward to compute the Mean Opinion
    Score (MOS) for every channel that is used for transmission. The authors have
    defined two MOSs for each channel m as given below: MOS= τ1 1+τ 2.10 − SIN R m
    10 MOS= τ1+τ3.| f p − f n | 1+τ 2.10 −SIN R m 10 (1) View Source τ1,τ2,τ3 are
    adjustment parameters. f p and f n are the centre frequencies of the currently
    occupied channel and the channel to which transmission is switched. The second
    MOS chooses a channel that is away from the current channel thereby reducing the
    interference level to PU which has occupied the current channel. The proposed
    MOSs reflect the channel quality but do not identify the most available channel.
    Both factors that is channel quality and channel availability time have a direct
    impact on the number of spectrum-handoffs. Also, the switching delay associated
    with spectrum-handoff increases with the difference between the frequencies of
    the chosen channel and the current channel. Zhao et. al [13] have extended the
    work of Zhou et. al by incorporating transfer learning. The existing SUs who have
    learned the optimal spectrum handoff strategy transfer their knowledge to any
    new SUs entering the network. Thus, new users'' Q-table gets initialized to the
    state-action values given by the existing users which significantly reduces the
    convergence time of the new users. Thus, the exploration time during which the
    performance is unpredictable gets reduced and improves the network performance.
    Shi et. al [14] defines a set of states based on the PU presence on the channel,
    the waiting time, the maximum waiting time, the experienced effective service
    time, the required service time, and the current SU channel. State is represented
    as a number in which different digits represent the parameters listed here. The
    action space is the number of channels and channel selection is the action to
    be taken. Reward function is an indicator of measured Packet Drop Ratio (PDR)
    which is used to update the quality of the channel. The results indicate that
    the convergence time is faster if measured values of PDR are used for spectrum-handoff
    decision instead of computationally complex analytical expressions. Also, using
    the measured values of PDR, the learning agent can be made to respond quickly
    to the changes in the radio environment. Thakur et.al [15] propose to combine
    reactive and proactive handoff techniques using OR and AND to enhance the performance
    of existing models. The results of these fusion techniques are evaluated against
    the models using monitoring or prediction individually using performance metrics
    like re-source wastage, throughput, interference and data loss. With the results
    it was found that AND fusion performs better than these traditional techniques
    in terms of achieved throughputs and resource wastage. While OR performed better
    if the network is unable to tolerate data loss. The paper however does not account
    for factors like multipath propagation, fading, path loss and shadowing affecting
    the channel state information which may lead to increased frequency of false alarms
    and misdetections. Extra energy cost on channel switch, switching delay, and collisions
    due to excessive switch are by-products of spectrum handoff that have been largely
    overlooked. S. Wang et. al [16] provides the energy efficient spectrum management
    technique and optimization technique in terms of throughput, transmission collision,
    delay and sensing accuracy. Paper proposes a switch-stay to handle the trade-off
    between the transmission reliability and the SU''s energy efficiency considering
    above mentioned parameters as constraints. SECTION III. Research Challenges SU
    performs spectrum sensing to detect the spectrum op-portunities and PU channels
    are sensed periodically to reduce interference to the PU. In Energy Detection
    (ED) based spec-trum sensing, all the surrounding nodes are to be synchronized
    accurately so as to perform spectrum sensing simultaneously. Also, all the SUs
    are paused from data transmission during the sensing time to have better sensing
    accuracy. The main reason for this is that ED cannot identify if the user on the
    channel is PU or SU. By telling SU to stop the transmission during sensing, one
    can be sure that if there is a user on the channel, it will be the PU. The time
    required for spectrum sensing depends on the number of channels to be sensed as
    well as the sensing time per channel. The longer the sensing time, the shorter
    will be the transmission time available for the SUs and shorter sensing times
    will introduce errors in spectrum detection, which affect the performance of both
    SU and PU. Spectrum detection errors will cause frequent handoffs and increase
    the interference to the PUs. SU can be made to continuously learn the channel
    parameters from the periodic spectrum sensing and frequent spectrum handoffs.
    The learned knowledge can then be used to decide upon the channels to be sensed
    by keeping the number of channels to be sensed or the sensing time fixed. Learned
    knowledge will also contribute to the selection of a channel with a longer availability
    time which reduces the frequency of spectrum handoffs and improves the performance
    of both SU and PU. There are few attempts in this direction [17] and requires
    further improvements. The important parameters that cause change in the network
    and are to be considered in spectrum handoff are: Transmission delay Channel Quality
    Number of PUs entering or leaving the network Number of SUs in the network Residual
    Energy of the SUs QoS requirements of applications SECTION IV. Performance of
    Hybrid Handoff: a Case Study In this section probability based hybrid spectrum
    hand off by Manav et. al [5] is compared with reactive round-robin spectrum hand
    off method. NS3 was used to simulate and implement CRNs. NS3 is a discrete-event
    network simulator for internet systems, targeted primarily for research, and educational
    use and suitable for large-scale simulations. NS3 is free software, licensed under
    the GNU GPLv2 license, and is publicly available for research, development, and
    use. Although NS3 alone does not support CRNs, A. Al-Ali et.al [9] developed a
    framework that was built by modifying NS3 source code to suit CR networks. Various
    changes were made in the source codes of the software, which are explained one
    by one. Fig. 3: Base code Show All As the snippet of the base code above shows
    in Fig. 3, it was written to setup a TCP connection between the nodes. The simulation
    time was often altered to get results according to the requirements. A packet
    tracer file was also produced to be observed on WireShark. A bulk sender was used
    to continuously send data for the entire simulation time. Fig. 4: Data members
    introduced Show All PUModel class deals with Primary User activity. IsPuActive
    checks and returns a bool value if a PU is transmitting in the same spectrum of
    the CR. CheckActive checks if the PU is active at a channel at that time. GetNextOffTime
    checks for the next PU off time. SetPuMapFile sets the PU map file. New data members
    are introduced in PUModel class namely 2 arrays idle and idle_prob. A function
    called Select_Channel is introduced to select the ideal channel for transmission
    based on the probability-based algorithm. Idle array stores the availability of
    a channel at that instant, while idle_prob stores the idle probability of each
    channel at every instant. The constructor initializes the array values of idle
    and idle_prob as 0. The data member of class PUModel- ReadData reads the text
    file containing information about the PUs including their arrival time and departure
    time. In this function, the idle array is also filled and idle probabilities are
    also computed and stored in the array idle_prob. Value of ‘1’ in the idle array
    signifies the channel is idle at that instant while 0 signifies a busy channel.
    The Select_Channel function is the function which chooses a free channel with
    the highest idle probability. It senses the channels in the decreasing order of
    idle probability and returns the first idle channel found. Spectrum Manager is
    the main class which interacts and puts together and makes use of all other classes.
    It has member functions like Start to start the sensing cycle, SenseEnded is a
    callback for when the sensing is finished, HandoffEnded is a callback for when
    the handoff is finished, SetPuModel sets Pu Model in the spectrum manager, SetRepository
    sets the reference to the global repository that all the nodes share. A new data
    member called m PUModel was introduced which was an object of the class PUModel.
    The constructor was also changed and the object of PUModel was added as one of
    the parameters. The sense_ended function from this class calls the Decide Spectrum
    function from the Spec-trum Decision class and passes the same PUModel object
    to the function. This module decides the next channel when a PU is detected on
    the current one. It consists of two functions DecideSwitch and DecideSpectrum.
    DecideSwitch checks whether to stay on the same channel or switch. DecideSpectrum
    gets the next channel to be used based on the policy of choice. DecideSpectrum
    chooses the spectrum handoff technique. In this function the object of PUModel
    was added as well to now call the Select_Channel function from the PUModel class.
    Here a new case called PROBABILISTIC_SWITCH was added in the switch case to include
    the new algorithm as one of the techniques. The default value of m_spectrumPolicy
    was also initialized to PROBABILISTIC_SWITCH in the constructor. SECTION V. Simulation
    and Performance Analysis The simulator parameters are shown in Table II. Sensing
    time and transmission time are kept constant at 100ms and 900ms. Number of PU
    channels available for transmission are considered as four and they transmit between
    2 nodes. TCP packets were used to transmit data. The simulation time was kept
    constant for the first part of the result at 90s. Table II: Simulation parameters
    A. Effect of Handoffs The amount of data transferred gets severely compromised
    with an increased number of handoffs. The simulation time for below results was
    set to 90 seconds. Probability based spetrum hand off is simulated for four different
    scenarios of 0, 5, 10 and 15 handoffs. These handoffs are achieved by manually
    changing and altering the PU activity of the 4 channels in the text file. Simulation
    for zero handoffs is achieved by making the de-fault channel completely free of
    PUs for the given simulation time. Because of no handoffs this case has the highest
    transfer of data of 1000 kB. As depicted in Fig. 5 excess handoffs have quite
    an impact on the throughput. As the handoffs reduce the time available for transmission,
    handoffs can be costly and carry noticeable overhead which reflects on the performance
    as shown by throughput. Hence, an efficient handoff strategy is of utmost importance
    and can influence performance of the network massively. Fig. 5: Throughput vs
    handoff Show All B. Comparative Analysis The performance of probability based
    hybrid spectrum handoff technique is compared with reactive round-robin based
    spectrum handoff in terms of delay and throughput. In proba-bility based hybrid
    spectrum handoff, every node updates the idle channel probability after every
    sensing slot. The channel with maximum idle probability is chosen for data transmission.
    But, reactive round-robin method chooses the next available channel without considering
    any other parameters. Accordingly, the hybrid technique showcases better performance
    for 2 reasons: (i) number of handoffs are minimized as a channel with longer availability
    time is chosen, (ii) performance is also better as the channels with the highest
    idle probability are sensed first. Hence, time is saved by making less unsuccessful
    senses. Due to the reduced number of spectrum switching in hybrid spectrum handoffs,
    the time available for data transmission is more. As a result, the performance
    of hybrid spectrum handoff is better in terms of throughput and delay as shown
    in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7. The results over 30s, 60s and 90s of simulation time are
    shown. The techniques were compared in terms of throughput and delay against simulation
    time with other parameters like sensing time and PU arrival rate kept the same
    for both scenarios. Fig. 6: Comparing probabilistic and round-robin: delay Show
    All Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 prove that the probabilistic model performs better than
    the regular round-robin model, and the results improve with time. The probability
    based hybrid spectrum handoffs consumes less energy compared to round-robun technique.
    Fig. 7: Comparing probabilistic and round-robin: throughput Show All In comparison
    to proactive spectrum handoff, this model will perform better if the sensing time
    is low. If the sensing time is high, proactive spectrum handoff will perform better
    in terms of extended data delivery, but this model will still outperform the round
    robin model. As this model replicates the accuracy of a reactive handoff model,
    it will also provide better accuracy than a proactive model. In cases where the
    PUs traffic model is significantly random and where incorrect pre-dictions can
    lead to poor performance, this model will perform significantly better than a
    proactive handoff technique. SECTION VI. Conclusion and Future Work Spectrum handoff
    is an important function in the spec-trum management framework of cognitive radio
    network. An efficient spectrum handoff mechanism should maintain the connectivity
    in the network with a minimum number of spectrum handoffs, minimize the possible
    interference to PU and maximize SU performance. This project implements a simple
    yet effective means of a hybrid spectrum handoff technique. The project is implemented
    in NS3 which is a better alternative to NS2. The model showcases better performance
    than the trivial methods in terms of parameters like throughput and delay. Probability
    based hybrid spectrum handoff can be further improved and analysed by including
    numerous nodes transmitting between channels simultaneously. Considering other
    parameters of the channel like channel quality and degradation may help better
    this model. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Optimisation

    I. Introduction According to Cisco''s industry forecasts, the number of wireless
    devices connected to IP networks will reach 29.3 billion by 2023, and the demand
    for wireless networks will be 250 times higher than today[1]. However, stringently
    limited wireless spectrum and static spectrum allocation cannot meet the growing
    demand for wireless spectrum[2][3]. Aiming to solve the problem, DSA serves as
    an effective technology to improve the spectrum utilization efficiency by allowing
    the secondary user (SU) to dynamically discern the idle spectrum and gain opportunistically
    access. In order to avoid interference to the primary user (PU) as much as possible,
    the cognitive user continuously and actively monitors the spectrum for the PU
    presence. In recent years, rapid development and excellent application of machine
    learning have provided new ideas for bringing DSA into feasible approaches[4].
    In [5], the authors proposed an access scheme for spectrum sharing between LTE-U
    and WiFi users through Q-learning, which is challenging to handle the large state
    space problems due to the limitations of Q-learning itself using table updates.
    After that, DRL with model-free features, especially DQN, was widely concerned,
    which uses deep neural networks to replace the Q-value table to fit the Q values
    and overcome the limitations of traditional Q-learning. In [6], the proposed DQN
    method outperforms all previous algorithm and some human game in Atari. In [7][8],
    the author proposed a centralized spectrum allocation algorithm via DQN, but the
    central controller required in the network brings heavy channel control overhead
    to the underlying network and may reduce the security and stability of the network.
    The authors in [9][10] focused on combination of two spectrum access technologies
    under the game theory model, but the method relies on environmental knowledge,
    and the performance is constrained when the prior knowledge is insufficient. Based
    on deep recurrent neural network, a DQN method was proposed to solve the spectrum
    access problem between multiple channels and multiple PU[11]. However, the authors
    only considered the problem of spectrum sharing between SU, and does not consider
    the existence of PU. The authors in [12] studied the spectrum sharing of the relevant
    channel mode, and the performance achieved using the DQN algorithm is close to
    the ideal performance of Myopic. However, the relevant channel mode will over-simplify
    the channel dynamics and the access strategy. In [13], the author proposed a distributed
    DRL spectrum access algorithm based on reservoirs computing. Although the algorithm
    achieves a high SU channel access rate, the interference of SU on PU was not dealt
    with. Similarly, the authors in [13] only studied the DSA problem of one kind
    PU in the network, and the algorithm implementation is of high complexity. With
    an aim to tackle the multiple heterogeneous user coexisting problem, we propose
    a multi-user DSA algorithm for complex heterogeneous CRN in this paper. The DSA
    algorithm under consideration is based on Multi-User Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (MUDRL), and it combines both LSTM and ResNet. The proposed algorithm is referred
    to as Multi-user Deep Reinforcement learning Spectrum Access (MDRSA) algorithm.
    Unlike the previous spectrum access algorithm, MDRSA uses the neural network composed
    of LSTM and ResNet as the fitting Q network, which is called as the LR-Q network.
    In addition, the MDRSA algorithm will comprehensively consider the action results
    of PU and SU at the same time when making action selection, so as to further improve
    the agent’s ability to predict the spectrum dynamics. Simulation results show
    that in the complex heterogeneous network environment, MDRSA can achieve higher
    channel utilization and is able to control the interference of SU to PU at a low
    level. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, the system
    model is described. Section III presents the proposed MDRSA based on Multi-User
    Reinforcement Learning. In Section IV, the performance evaluation results of the
    proposed algorithm are given. Section V concludes the paper. SECTION II. System
    Model Consider a distributed heterogeneous cognitive radio network, where there
    are N SUs. In addition, there are M PUs whose MAC protocols are not identical.
    The purpose of this setting is to verify that SU can share the licensed spectrum
    of multiple heterogeneous PUs. Suppose that each PU orthogonally occupies only
    one OFDM channel. We use an interweave sharing model[14], in which the SU monitors
    the state of the licensed channel and accesses the idle channel in a timely manner,
    where only when the PU does not use the licensed channel can the SU attempt to
    access the channel for transmission. The model in this paper aims to describe
    a scenario where each SU accesses an licensed channel using interweave policies
    in a distributed cognitive radio heterogeneous network, where multiple SUs compete
    for one transmission access point. According to the different MAC protocols executed
    by different users in the realistic environment, we consider two different heterogeneous
    wireless network PU nodes. One is a time-slot node using time-division multiplexing,
    and the other is the probability node that accesses the channel with a certain
    probability p* in each time slot. We assume that SUs always have transmission
    requirements. Therefore, the SU will attempt to access the channel whenever a
    spectrum hole is detected. As shown in Figure 1, multiple PU and SU are randomly
    distributed across the network, with different PUs using different licensed channels
    and the SUs maintaining channel state awareness. In the figure, S – T represents
    the transmitter of a time-slot PU node, and its corresponding receiver is S −
    R; P – T represents the transmitter of a probability PU node and its corresponding
    receiver is P − R. SU – T represents the transmitter of a SU node and SU – R denotes
    its corresponding receiver. In our research scenario, there are multiple dynamic
    channels. Figure 1 shows the time-slot channel and probability channel. The dynamic
    model of these two channels is shown by one example in Figure 2. In Figure 2,
    channel 1 and channel 3 show the dynamic rule of time-slot channel, which can
    be represented as (1): s(a)={ 1 0 t−C<t+a−C≤t,a∈{i,j,k} otherwise (1) View Source
    where s(a)=1 indicates that the channel is occupied and s(a)=0 indicates that
    the channel is idle. In the case of Channel 1, the time-slot user will occupy
    up to X(X ≤ C) of the continuous C time slots, then there are 2X occupancy forms.
    For example, a time-slot user occupies the ith, jth, and kth slot for transmission,
    while any SU is prohibited from accessing the channel during these time-slots.
    In Figure 2, Channel 2 shows the dynamic rule of the probability channel. In each
    time-slot, the probability user occupies that time slot for transmission. The
    dynamic rule of the channel can be expressed as (2): s(a)={ 1 0 p< p ∗ p> p ∗
    (2) View Source Fig. 1. System model Show All Specifically, the probability user
    will generate a random number p ∈ [0,1] at the beginning of each time slot, and
    if p < p*, the probability user will occupy the channel for transmission. If p
    > p*, the probability user remains silent and does not occupy the channel. In
    this case, the licensed channel remains idle and the SU can access the channel.
    Assuming that each of the above channels is independent of each other, we model
    each channel as a two-state Markov model, that is, each channel has two states
    of idle (1) and occupied (0), and only one state can exist for the one time-slot
    channel. Fig. 2. Multichannel dynamic pattern Show All Based on the above system
    model and with an aim to improve network channel utilization and control interference,
    the SU senses the channel state at the beginning of each time slot and decides
    what actions to take next. The SUs will observe the effect of actions on completion
    of specified tasks from the environment. The measured indicator is reward, SU
    gets corresponding rewards by observing the results after the action is performed.
    If one SU chooses not to transmit, the reward signal of the environmental feedback
    is Ri, which returns the channel state observation signal at this time. If the
    SU chooses to access a channel, the environment will feedback positive reward
    Rs or negative reward Rf. We use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to maximize long-term
    expected rewards, maximize channel utilization and reduce spectrum access conflicts,
    namely: E= max a Q(s,a) (3) View Source Where Q(s,a) is the output function of
    the standard Q-learning, indicating the value of executing action a in state s.
    In Q-learning, it is updated by the following: Q( s t , a t )←Q( s t , a t )+α[
    r t+1 +γ max a t+1 Q( s t+1 , a t+1 )−Q( s t , a t )] (4) View Source Where st
    is the current state, s t+1 is the next moment state, at is the current action,
    a t+1 is the next moment action, r t+1 is the delay reward, α ∈ [0,1] is the learning
    rate, γ ∈ [0,1] is the reward discount, which weighs the importance of immediate
    reward and future reward. In the following work, with Q-learning, the reward is
    defined as a parameter that is positively related to successful access and negatively
    related to access failure. Then maximizing the licensed channel utilization and
    reducing conflicts is made possible by maximizing the expected cumulative reward.
    SECTION III. Spectrum Access Strategy for Complex Heterogeneous Networks A. Multi
    User Reinforcement Learning At present, the proposed DSA algorithm based on machine
    learning only directly considers the channel state, and does not specifically
    study the impact of each SU on the channel state. Based on the work in [15], we
    propose a MUDRL based multiuser spectrum acess algorithm, which considers the
    impact of each SU on the channel state. Different from the traditional RL, our
    MUDRL quantifies the state action results of each PU, and then takes them into
    consideration in the action decision-making of agents. After performing the optimal
    action at each time step, the agent observes a reward vector in the environment.
    Each element in the reward vector corresponds to a user node, which is used to
    update the user’s state action value Q (i) (s,a) . Since the agent can only perform
    a single action at any time, in order to consider the impact of PU access results
    on the agent''s action decisions, we design a comprehensive objective function
    Q T (s,a) for MUDRL, which integrates the single objective function Q (i) (s,a)
    of each user node, representing the amount of impact of all user nodes on the
    agent''s action decisions. By comprehensive objective function Q T (s,a) , the
    agent can comprehensively consider the impact of the access results of all nodes
    on the agent''s action decisions, so as to select the optimal target action[16].
    Assuming that there are L heterogeneous PUs in the network, then there are L orthogonal
    channels. The comprehensive objective function of each agent can be defined as:
    Q T (s,a)= ∑ i=1 L+1 w i Q (i) (s,a) (5) View Source where i =1,2,⋯,L +1, wi ∈
    [0,1] is the weight coefficient, and Q (i) (s,a) is the action value function
    of the node i. Where i =1,2,⋯,L indicates that the node a PU node, and i = L +1
    indicates that the node is an agent node. After the agent executes the action,
    the agent will observe the effect of the action in the environment on completing
    the task, and generate a L +1 dimension reward vector. Each element in the reward
    vector represents the transmission result of the corresponding node, and the reward
    will be used for update the value function Q(s,a) of the state action pair (s,a)
    of the corresponding node. Specifically, let r (i) represent the reward corresponding
    to the node, so the reward vector received by the agent can be expressed as [
    r (i) ] L+1 i=1 . Therefore, for a state action pair (s,a), MUDRL agents no longer
    maintain the scalar value Q(s,a), but need to maintain a value vector [ Q (i)
    (s,a)] L+1 i=1 , where Q (i) (s,a) represents the cumulative discount reward of
    node i. Unlike traditional Q-learning, which uses table to update the Q value
    of the maintenance state action pair, MUDRL uses neural networks to fit the value
    function Q(s,a) of the state action pair (s,a). In the phase of neural network
    fitting Q(s,a), the algorithm uses q(s,a) to represent the fitting value corresponding
    to Q(s,a) of the state action pair (s,a), and the corresponding comprehensive
    objective function is expressed as q T (s,a) . Assume that at time t, the environment
    state is st, and the algorithm uses ε − greedy policy to make decisions when selecting
    actions, using the following formula: a t ={ arg max a q T ( s t ,a) randomaction
    with1−ε withε (6) View Source The reason for randomly selecting actions is to
    avoid the local optimization of agent due to q(s,a) that does not converge to
    Q*(s, a). Where q T ( s t ,a)= ∑ L+1 i=1 q (i) ( s t ,a) . After executing the
    action at, the agent will simultaneously update each element q (i) ( s t ,a),i=1,2,⋯,L+1
    , in the L +1 dimension fitting Q value vector, that is q (i) ( s t , a t )← q
    (i) ( s t , a t )+α[ r (i) t+1 +γ q (i) ( s t+1 , a t+1 )− q (i) ( s t , a t )]
    (7) View Source where q T ( s t+1 , a ′ )= ∑ i=1 L+1 q (i) ( s t+1 , a ′ ) a t+1
    =arg max a ′ q T ( s t+1 , a ′ ) (8) (9) View Source Note that the update of MUDRL
    is different from that of traditional Q-learning. In traditional Q-learning, actions
    with the optimal Q-function are selected. However, in MUDRL, the algorithm uses
    a double Q network to decouple the direct relationship between the target action
    selection and the optimal Q function. Secondly, in MUDRL, in order to consider
    the impact of the access result of the PU on the agent''s action decision, when
    selecting the target action, we use a comprehensive objective function. Therefore,
    from the above analysis, when making action decisions, MUDRL no longer only considers
    the value function Q(s, a) of the agent itself, but also considers a comprehensive
    objective function Q T (s,a) that integrates the value functions of multiple users.
    Q T (s,a) directly considers the impact of the access results of the PUs on the
    agent''s action choices, thus improving the accuracy of the agent''s action decisions.
    Fig. 3. MDRSA agent architecture Show All B. MDRSA Algorithm Based on Multi-user
    Reinforcement Learning On the basis of MUDRL, we proposes a dynamic spectrum access
    algorithm for complex heterogeneous radio networks, namely MDRSA algorithm. Similar
    to traditional RL, MUDRL is also a modeless learning method. It gradually summarizes
    historical experience from the interaction with the environment and learns action
    decision-making policy. The MDRSA algorithm aims to improve the channel utilization
    and control the interference of SU to PU at a low level. Figure 3 shows the basic
    structure of MDRSA algorithm agent. As mentioned above, heterogeneous PUs M and
    N SUs coexist in a distributed cognitive radio heterogeneous network. Each SU
    is considered as an agent, and each agent interacts with the environment independently
    to learn decision-making policy. At the beginning of each slot, the agent''s perception
    of the channel generates a state vector with a length of M, which is recorded
    as ot. For example, when the agent senses channel 2 is occupied, the state vector
    o t ={0,1,⋯,0} . At time, t it is. assumed that the environment input state of
    the agent is represented as st, and the action selected by the agent is a mt ={0,⋯,
    a t ,⋯,0} , indicating that the action of the agent acts on the mth channel, where
    a t ∈{transmit,wait} , transmit indicates that the agent selects the channel for
    transmission, and wait indicates that the agent does not transmit. After the agent
    executes the action, the agent will observe the result z mt ∈{successful,failed,idle}
    of the action on the channel state in the environment, where idle indicates the
    channel is idle, successful indicates successful data transmission, and failed
    indicates access failure. Therefore, we define the channel state at time t +1
    as c t+1 =( a mt , o t , z mt ) . In addition, we define the environmental state
    at time t +1 as s t+1 =[ c t−H+2 ,⋯, c t , c t+1 ] , where H is the length of
    historical state to be considered by the agent. At the same time, the environment
    state is also the input state of the agent. When the agent executes action amt,
    the PU will also access the channel according to its own transmission requirements,
    so the environment state will be transferred from st to s t+1 , and the agent
    will observe a reward vector [ r (i) t+1 ] L+1 i=1 . The r (i) t+1 reward function
    is defined as follows: r (i) t+1 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ R s R i R f if z t =successful if z t
    =idle if z t =failed (10) View Source where Rs indicates that the user has successfully
    occupied the channel for transmission; Ri indicates that the user remains idle
    at this time; Rf indicates that the user failed to access the channel. When the
    SU fails to access, the agent will learn the experience of the failed access,
    update the access policy, and avoid the recurrence of such events in subsequent
    timeslots. Then, the agent combines the experience generated at the last moment
    into experience tuple ( s t , a mt , r t+1 , s t+1 ) and stores it in the experience
    pool. When the number of experiences reaches a certain value, the agent starts
    to extract samples from the experience pool and perform experience replay. Because
    MDRSA uses double Q network, the agent updates the network parameters of the target
    network every F times of training. The pseudo code of the above algorithm is shown
    in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1 MDRSA SECTION IV. Simulations In this section, we
    verify the performance of the algorithm through the Tensorflow platform. The traditional
    Q-learning algorithm and DQN algorithm, as the comparison algorithm of our MDRSA,
    have been simulated and compared in detail. A. Simulation Settings The performance
    indicators in the simulation are the utilization of idle timeslot channels by
    SUs, the utilization of all channels by network users, and the interference rate
    of SU to PU. The channel dynamics of heterogeneous users used in the simulation
    are as follows: Time slot node: Each slot node occupies the ith, jth and kth slots
    of the consecutive C slots for transmission. Probability node: the probability
    threshold of the probability node accessing the channel transmission in each time
    slot is p*. Other parameter settings in the experiment are shown in Table I. TABLE
    I Hyperparameters of MDRSA B. Experimental Results and Discussions In this scenario,
    we simulate a multi heterogeneous multi-user network with four slot node users,
    one probability node user, and seven SUs. This scenario is mainly to prove that
    MDRSA has good performance in the complex heterogeneous multi-user network environment.
    From Figure 4, the MDRSA achieves 83% utilization of idle timeslot channels by
    SUs under multiple heterogeneous channels, achieving high utilization of idle
    timeslot channels. DQN and traditional Q-learning achieve 74% and 40% idle slot
    channel utilization respectively. From Figure 5, in the multi heterogeneous channels
    environment, the MDRSA achieves 87.6% utilization of all channels, achieving high
    utilization of channels. The DQN algorithm achieves 77% channel utilization, while
    the traditional Q-learning algorithm only achieves 56% channel utilization. Let’s
    assume C=10, p ∗ =0.2 , where there are only four slot nodes and one probability
    node, the optimal channel utilization is 28%. We add 7 SU pairs to the network,
    the MDRSA increases the channel utilization by 3.13 times, the DQN algorithm increases
    the channel utilization by 2.75 times, and the traditional Q-learning algorithm
    increases the channel utilization by 2 times. Figure 6 shows the PU interference
    when the algorithm training converges. The white square indicates that the PU
    is disturbed, and the black square indicates that there is no conflict. From Figure
    6, MDRSA algorithm has only minor interference to the PUs, DQN algorithm has more
    interference to the PUs, while traditional Q-learning algorithm has serious interference
    to the PUs. To sum up, in the multi heterogeneous multi-user scenario, although
    DQN and Q-learning both improve channel utilization, they have a large interference
    to the PUs, especially the interference of Q-learning to the PUs, which seriously
    affects normal communication of the PUs. On the contrary, our proposed MDRSA not
    only improves the channel utilization, but also has little interference to the
    PUs, which does not affect its normal communication. SECTION V. Conclusions We
    studied the distributed dynamic spectrum access problem of complex heterogeneous
    networks in cognitive radio. Based on MUDRL, combined with LSTM and ResNet, we
    proposed the MDRSA spectrum access algorithm. In the previous article, we introduced
    the structure, principle and implementation of MDRSA in detail. The purpose of
    MDRSA is to achieve high channel utilization of SU and low interference to PU
    in a complex heterogeneous network. Finally, we verified the feasibility of the
    MDRSA spectrum access algorithm in a multi heterogeneous multi-user scenario.

    KEYWORDS: CRNDSAEBGFractalSDRWCRSN 1. INTRODUCTION The opportunistic utilization
    and spectrum management is an essential demand of today’s wireless communication
    system. Dynamic spectrum allocation (DSA) is the key technology to deal with the
    spectrum scarcity in the cognitive radio network (CRN). The cognitive radio (CR)
    exhibits high versatility in spectrum management to improve channel utility. The
    multiple efforts are studied and reported for sharing of the non-utilized spectrum
    of licensed primary user (PU) [ 1]. DSA is the prime approach to explore the opportunity
    between the licensed primary user PU and unlicensed secondary user (SU) for efficient
    spectrum utilization. Figure 1 shows the conceptual model of spectrum sharing
    between the primary and secondary user over channel vacancy. Figure 1: Cognitive
    radio sharing Display full size Moreover, the primary user is a licensed user
    with all infrastructural facility to access all network priorities. PU authorization
    has no intervention due to SU access and leads all transmission scheduling. The
    maximum channel utility extraction is the key indicator of dynamic access protocol
    (DAP) of CRN through high transient switching between PU and SU spectrum allocations.
    [ 2]. The fast data transmission and maximum bandwidth scanning are the attributes
    of self-oriented CR embedded systems. The adaptive supervision on dynamic channel
    allocation is governed by software defined radio (SDR), which elicits the cognitive
    radio operating procedure. Field programming gate array (FPGA) develops all SDR
    supervised hardware’s re-configurability to deal with adequate RF stimuli in wireless
    communication network. Additionally, SDR removes the need for padding of many
    embedded systems in CRN and comprises common utilities with re-configurability.
    Over the large utility spectrum of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
    and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), CR-SDR
    explores the opportunistic utilization by iterative scanning and subsequent allocations.
    The wideband spectrum sensing is the first step toward this tedious task and experience
    many challenges such as transmission rate, noise interference, scanner bandwidth,
    converter accuracy and impedance matching with the channel. Therefore, multidimensional
    efforts are proposed for parameter optimization under transmission control protocols
    (TCP) to meet CRN challenges. Transmission rate and data efficiency are the main
    constraints in wireless cognitive radio sensor networks [ 3]. The distributed
    network of WCRSN plays a vital role in vacant channel allocation to SU over unoccupied
    spectrum of licensed PU under communication protocols to avoid any inter channel
    interference (ICI). The network layer of TCP experiences many challenges to cater
    DSA for wide spectrum sensing in WCRSN [ 4]. Few FCC standards-based licensed
    and unlicensed frequency spectrums are listed in Table 1 to elicit the need for
    a wide scanning radiation device [ 5]. Table 1: Spectrum allocation as per FCC
    Download CSVDisplay Table 1.1 Wireless Cognitive Radio Sensor Network The three-layer
    model describes the applicability and process flow of the CRN system, defined
    as perception, network and application. Figure 2 shows illustrative insight of
    the three-layer structure of cognitive radio for a broad level of understanding.
    The application layer presents user interference and spectrum management for a
    wide domain of interrupt requests. The network layer is responsible for all connection
    establishments, acknowledgments and channel switching as per the granted permissions.
    This paper explores the utility enhancements of attributes of perception layer
    of the CRN, here actual hardware interface is exposed to RF environment in order
    to execute the SDR instructions. This needs an effective incorporation of Wireless
    communication protocol (WCP) to avoid any illegal congestion and opportunistic
    utilization of licensed channel. TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC) protocol (TFRC-CR)
    and Opportunistic Hybrid Transport Protocol (OHTP) were reported in the literature
    to exhibit effective channel transmission [ 6, 7]. At perception, opportunistic
    access needs fast and reconfigurable SDR-controlled embedded system to respond
    RF stimuli. CR is recognized as a high-throughput and restless system in wide
    RF environment and supported by hardware reconfiguration. Wideband and narrow
    band spectrum sensing experiences a high level of interference between actual
    channel vacancy and noise appearance to exhibit false channel utility. The perfect
    impedance matching and isolation property removes random noise appearance and
    identifies the real channel utility by PU. This process is governed by the SDR
    through continuous work function and dedicated spectrum scanning. This CR model
    persists an association of RF radiating structure at perception layer and leads
    the scope of multifold development of antenna devices [ 8]. In favour of cognitive
    perception, two parallel processing are recommended simultaneously, one smart
    sensing algorithm and second compatible radiating hardware to execute in the desired
    domain. Therefore, to accomplish this attribute, the antenna structure design
    and development is prodigiously an important section of cognitive radio. Moreover,
    wideband scanning antenna deserves more attention for the coverage of maximum
    vacant channel opportunity with the adequacy of other parameters. Additionally,
    WCRSN challenges more attributes such as efficiency, radiation property, gain,
    size and polarization properties [ 9]. Figure 2: Cognitive radio layer structure
    Display full size 1.2 Antenna Module The continuous scanning of unutilized licensed
    spectrum of PU or white space is the fundamental task of any WCRSN. The complexity
    variation is observed in the designing of hardware or software for the technical
    processing of narrow band scanning (NBS) and wideband scanning (WBS) of spectrum.
    The adequate hardware designing and smart soft computing is expected in Narrow
    band scanning (NBS) technology. A typical discrimination between noise and actual
    signal presence is a major area of concern in both the scanning modules. To deal
    with this situation, SNR improvement is taken into consideration for SDR development
    in CRN. SDR processes manipulative actions as an interface between networking
    protocols and RF environment. This action leads to execution through reconfiguration
    of parametric properties of embedded systems and learning algorithms. Field programming
    gate arrays (FPGA) and digital signal processor (DSP) are the promising candidates
    to match SDR-supervised reconfiguration properties. The adequate wideband RF radiating
    structure can remove the need for complex hardware requirement in WCRSN for both
    NBS and WBS [ 10]. A spectrum sensing module is shown in Figure 3, it shows a
    process flow approach of interfacing between software protocols and perception
    layers. The hardware interface access to RF stimuli is an iterative process and
    repeats the RF scanning until vacancy is detected. This generates new key technology
    of action in RF environment: software defined antenna (SDA). Figure 3: Spectrum
    sensing modules for perception layer Display full size The spectrum-sensing module
    elaborates the supervision of SDR to manipulate SDA properties with respect to
    RF triggering for the management of every possibility of WSN. The high data rate
    is the key attribute of the sensing and transmitting feature of SDA in CR. The
    bandwidth transition shift or consistent large bandwidth are the desirable parameters
    of SDA to facilitate large spectrum scanning. Spectrum sensing and channel transmission
    depend upon the feed manipulations of SDA system and triggered by the SDR. On
    exploring more in perception layer, the CRN establishment and channel allotment
    management are observed in Figure 4. First interface to the exposed RF spectrum
    is the SDA, it collects the RF stimuli and process to discriminate the presence
    of signal transmission from noise appearance. The bidirectional communication
    is held between the opportunity controller and the data access manger to collaborate
    reliable sharing on licensed vacant channel of PU. Timing and synchronization
    lead to the avoidance of channel interference and uncalled delay to actual authorized
    user for transmission. These all depend upon the high throughput of RF interface
    unit to sensitize every possible opportunity. Thus, a wideband, high transmission
    rate, high efficiency and feed controlled antenna system is always desirable as
    a crucial component for RF external interface in CR system [ 11]. This paper involves
    the design of an extra-large band antenna with orientation-free surface for high-speed
    versatile scanning in WCRSN and compatible integration in SDR development environment.
    Figure 4: RF Stimulus module for perception layer Display full size 2. ANTENNA
    DESIGN FOR CRN This section focused on the design of adequate antenna structure
    to scan maximum possible spectrum opportunity for WCRSN. The antenna is dedicated
    for two functional objectives of WCRSN, first to sense maximum possible vacant
    channel opportunity and second to maintain bilateral communication over dedicated
    channel for RF signalling. Sensing of available opportunity is a very tedious
    task for the SDR system and it needs high-speed synchronization with perception
    hardware interface. Frequency reconfiguration is an alternative choice, but the
    antenna has limited applications in spectrum scanning due to narrow band width.
    The switching frequency and speed of operation of PIN diode-based devices has
    limited applicability in scanning systems. Moreover, PIN diode exhibits relevant
    switching characteristics, but transient response of the antenna over wideband
    scanning leaves many practical issues. Thus, instead of using a multiple set of
    antennas for scanning a wide frequency spectrum, a single-unit extra-wideband
    antenna covers opportunistic spectrum scan more effectively. The bi-surface modifications
    are proposed on a compact 12 × 18 × 1.6 mm3 FR4 substrate with dielectric constant
    4.4. The fractal slot approach is proposed for radiating surface and ground is
    optimized with electromagnetic bandgap (EBG) structure. The base structure is
    selected as U-shape to achieve all wideband attributes of antenna and subjected
    to modifications to extend the radiating ability. The finite ground is optimized
    through deformed ground structure (DGS) for bandwidth enhancement and characterized
    by EBG structures for large impedance matching. The combinational effect of fractal
    slot and EBG structure in the antenna develops highly compatible radiating structures
    for CRN. The iterative modifications are applied on a 12 × 11 mm2 rectangular
    patch to reshape the top radiating surface and respectively EBG patterns in ground.
    All modifications are modelled and simulated on high-frequency simulation structure
    to finalize the artefacts associated with the design. The mathematical model is
    conceptualized to analyse the antenna performance parameters. The electrical length
    of the structure is equivalent to half of operating wavelength and physically
    denoted as L. The relative slot length of the fractal structure is determined
    as 0.45 λ eff-slot for the entire band of operating frequency. Table Download

    The main structure describes a rectangular 12 × 18 × 1.6 mm3 substrate to resonate
    a central frequency of 7.5 GHz. The design iterations are subjected to step-by-step
    modification as per the need of extended frequency boundaries. First, all iterations
    are subjected to the top surface of the antenna and comprise the formulation of
    results in desired domains. Subsequently, the bottom surface undergoes optimization
    of trade-off between bandwidth and impedance matching. The variable impedance,
    path difference, radiating characteristic and distribution current are the prominent
    features of the slot insertions. Additionally, the combinational effects lead
    to the key objective of the dedicated antenna profile and need to optimize as
    per the zone of applications. Every respective modulation is observed precisely
    for desirable performance and phenomenal attributes. The vertical and horizontal
    combinations of the slot geometries cover the edge radiation and produce multiple
    resonances. The optimized square-shaped 1 × 1 mm2 EBG pattern reduces the spurious
    feed radiations and broadens the boundaries of critical cut-off frequencies. The
    synchronization between radiating patch and optimized EBG-enabled ground produces
    desirable radiation characteristics, gain, efficiency and compatible bandwidth
    in CRN. Additionally, truncated corner produces two orthogonal modes of operation
    and the antenna exhibits circular polarization. The diagonally opposite corners
    provide a path difference and respective 90-degree phase shift. Figure 5: Top
    and bottom view layout of the proposed antenna Display full size The orthogonal
    cross-correlation effects enable the antenna to offer orientation-free surface,
    which is the most prominent feature of the WCRSN. The antenna equivalent diagram
    describes the functional attributes of the slots on the radiating side and EBG
    pattern on the ground side. The distribution of current is deviated in both phase
    and amplitude to obtain effective electromagnetic properties. The resultant phase
    shifts and respective path differences show successive harmonic components of
    fundamental radiating frequency. This electrical equivalence is shown in Figure
    6 to elaborate voltage current relationship of the proposed antenna for entire
    operating range. Figure 6: Equivalent diagrams of the proposed antenna Display
    full size 3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The modelled antenna is subjected to observe
    for UWB, gain, efficiency, polarization and radiation property in reference to
    CRN compatibility. The antenna is modelled and simulated for every respective
    modulation in radiating characteristic with respect to slot insertions. Also,
    cross-correlation effects of self and mutual excitations are observed to illustrate
    current distribution on antenna surface. The distributed L-C tank circuits are
    excited through EBG patterns to suppress spurious feed radiations and optimization
    analysis of ground surface. EBG pattern creates an array of L-C tank circuits,
    which generates combined resonant effects on feed network. Figure 7 shows the
    design evolution of antenna in reference to return loss characteristics. Figure

    Antenna 5 is the best feasible model for WCRSN to cover a wide range of frequency
    from 0.78 to 12.0 GHz on high-frequency simulation structure. The top radiating
    surface modification elicits the optimizations of parameters and comprises respective
    relative changes in ground modifications. W = patch width, ε r = relative permittivity,
    g = gap width and h = substrate thickness, the equivalent inductance L and capacitance
    C can be expressed as L = μ 0 h (7) C = W ε 0 ( 1 + ε r ) π cos h ( 2 W + g )
    g (8) ω = 1 L C (9) B W = Δ ω ω = 1 η L C (10) The deterministic bandwidth (BW)
    is analysed through Equations (7) and (8) and illustrated the EBG effects on overall
    radiating structure. The effects of degenerative mutual coupling of EBG patterns
    are presented in Figure 8 to elicit return loss characteristics. The insertion
    of EBG patterns in ground makes the antenna to execute broadening of available
    bandwidth. This shows better impedance matching and compatibility enhancement
    of the RF structure to spectrum interface in CRN environment. The essential orthogonal
    modes are generated through corner truncation to make antenna orientation free
    during RF scan. Figure 8: Effect of EBG Display full size During the scan of PU
    spectrum, antenna orientation restricts the maximum utility scan of available
    vacant opportunity. The proposed structure offers circular polarization and Figure
    9 shows 3db axial ratio for the entire range of frequency. Diagonally opposite
    truncated corner generates two equal but orthogonally phase-shifted modes of radiations.
    Interestingly, the proposed structure is compatible for a complete band of frequency
    of operation of a simulated antenna structure for axial ratio. Additionally, the
    effect of the corner truncation is realized for return loss characteristics to
    observe any performance deviation. Figure 9: Axial ratio with frequency sweep
    Display full size Therefore, antenna offers a fare relationship on return loss
    characteristics for antenna with and without corner truncation as shown in Figure
    10. Moreover, it is observed that the corner truncation has improved impedance
    matching toward both corner edge frequencies. The phenomenal distribution of LC
    lumped circuit in orthogonal mode excitation generates the variation of net electrical
    equivalence. Hence, corner truncation helps in both circular polarization and
    bandwidth broadening of the proposed structure to justify the candidature of antenna
    in CRN. Figure 10: Effect of corner truncation Display full size The design simulation
    and adequate result analysis are used to obtain the antenna prototype, as shown
    in Figure 11. Antenna design pattern is fabricated on commercially available FR
    4 substrate with pre-defined dimensions of 12 × 18 × 1.6 mm3 and dielectric constant
    of 4.4. The fabricated structure is subjected to experimental measurements of
    performance characteristics on Rohde & Schwarz ZVA 40 VNA. The proposed antenna
    performance characteristics are validated through close match between measured
    and simulated results. Frequency cross-coupling is the main cause of negligible
    variation in the performance characteristics of the experimental measurements.
    Specifically, interference affects the lower edge corner of the operating bandwidth
    of the antenna due to less noise immunity at lower frequencies. The relative |S11|
    analysis is shown in Figure 12, the measured operating characteristics offer 0.79–12.0
    GHz and simulate 0.72–12.1 GHz for |−10 dB| return loss parameters. This close
    match enhances antenna eligibility for wide-band scanning and opportunistic transmission
    in WCRSN sensing. The proposed antenna elicits its high utility in real-time applicability
    of high impedance bandwidth for scanning of maximum possible scan of PU’s network.
    Moreover, antenna gain, efficiency, radiation properties need high emphasis to
    justify the complete candidature of the antenna for sensor networks in cognitive
    radios. Figure 11: Antenna prototype Display full size Figure 12: Simulated and
    measured return loss Display full size The total realized gain of the antenna
    is measured and compared with respect to isotropic radiating source in Figure
    13. Again, the close match is observed is between simulated and measured gain
    for the complete operating range of frequencies. The antenna offers 2.59 dBi average
    gain and offers minimum to maximum range as 1.51 dBi at 700 MHz to 3.12 dBi at
    7.2 GHz, respectively. The sustainable gain characteristics hold the antenna viable
    for frequency scan for far field and nearfield radiation domain. The measured
    and simulated radiation patterns in E-plane and H-plane are presented on different
    frequency intervals in Figures 14 and 15, respectively. The bidirectional radiating
    pattern offers high compatibility with directional radiating characteristics in
    the cognitive radio technology. The stable radiation pattern of the proposed structure
    elicits RF field accessibility in wide spread spectrum sensing and transmission.

    radiation characteristics Display full size Figure 15: E plane radiation characteristics
    Display full size For wide applications in cognitive sensor networks, antenna
    efficiency is also a prominent feature of the antenna. Current distribution describes
    the radiation resistance of the surface of the antenna in terms of electric field
    distribution (v/m). This distribution is represented in Figure 16 for electric
    and magnetic field distribution at 2, 6 and 10 GHz frequency. Figure 16: Current
    distribution Display full size The combinational effects of fractal slots, corner
    truncation and EBG pattern generate field correlation in EM distribution. The
    varying distribution on the top surface indicates the relative change of impedance
    over the path of current from feed strip to broad edges. The mutual coupling is
    conceptual orientation of the electrical equivalences of inductive-capacitive
    (LC) network arrays of slot structures. Eventually, truncated corner reflects
    the overall geometry by inserting orthogonality in the E-M field generation. Based
    on the effects of self, cross and mutual coupling on radiating structure, the
    antenna offers net radiation resistance to maximize the radiation efficiency within
    the permissible trade-off. This radiation efficiency justifies the tolerance against
    noise immunity and offers high SNR values of scanning network, as shown in Figure
    17. The proposed antenna offers approximately 79.9% average radiation efficiency
    with a peak of 92% for higher frequency range (7–12 GHz). The recorded efficiency
    of the antenna is found suitable to sustain permissible limits of SNR under the
    transmission control protocols for both narrow and wideband scanning. Figure 17:
    Radiation efficiency Display full size Based on overall analysis of simulated
    and experimented results of the proposed antenna, the impedance bandwidth, gain,
    radiation efficiency, radiation patterns and circular polarization of the structure
    enhanced the feasibility for wideband sensor network. In reference to the reported
    categories of antenna for CRN, the proposed antenna proves its candidature more
    strongly toward versatile radiation characteristics for much lower edge of frequencies
    without any dimension enlargement. Additionally, antenna validates its novelty
    through compatibility with GSM, GPS, WiFi, Zigbee, LoRa, Sigfox, UWB and X-bands.
    The overall performance measures of the proposed antenna are compared with the
    antenna reported in the refereed literature. Table 2 presents the comparative
    classifications of antenna characteristics and validates the candidature of antenna
    for WCRSN in cognitive radios as per FCC standards. Table 2: Design comparison
    with other UWB sensing antennas Download CSVDisplay Table 4. CONCLUSION A compact
    wireless cognitive radio sensor network antenna is presented in this paper with
    wide range spectrum scanning capabilities of low-frequency bands (800–3100 MHz),
    complete UWB (3.1–10.5 GHz) and X band (8–12 GHz). The proposed structure elicited
    the mutual and cross-coupling effects of fractal slot, truncated corner and EBG
    structure to enhance radiating characteristic. The antenna sustains the permissible
    threshold of average gain, return loss, radiation efficiency and stable radiation
    pattern for the entire operating range. The miniaturized structure antenna is
    truly feasible for high-speed scanning of vacant channel opportunity in the licensed
    spectrum of the primary user. The antenna exhibits adequate compatibility with
    SDR environment with respect to each RF stimuli. The antenna offers average gain
    2.59 dBi and average radiation efficiency 79.9% for the entire band of spectrum
    scan in CRN. Therefore, the proposed antenna is perfectly compatible for wide
    range opportunistic scan of licensed network and suitable for dedicated transmission
    of secondary user signals over cognitive radio network applications. Additional

    I. Introduction The rapidly growing demand for wireless connectivity from 5G+
    to Internet of Things (IoT) and WiFi-enabled devices has brought renewed interest
    and impetus behind dynamic spectrum sharing [2]–[4]. Even with millimeter-wave
    (mmWave) technology, the propagation loss in the 28 GHz - 300 GHz bands is much
    higher than in the sub-6 GHz bands [5], making the latter better-suited for various
    wireless systems. The premium placed on sub-6 GHz bands together with the need
    to protect scientific uses in the mmWave bands are driving the renewed interest
    in spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access (DSA). DSA techniques are designed
    to improve spectrum utilization by allowing secondary unlicensed users to take
    advantage of ephemeral transmission opportunities in space, time, or frequency
    [6]–[8]– a capability often referred to as cognitive radio. Currently, there are
    three widely used DSA techniques for cognitive radio networks (CRN): interweaving,
    overlay, and underlay [2]. In the interweaving mode, the secondary users search
    the band for spectrum holes (vacant sub-bands) which represent secondary transmission
    opportunities. The overlay paradigm requires tight coordination between the primary
    and secondary users, which complicates implementation. Relative to the interweaving
    and overlay modalities, underlay spectrum sharing is appealing in terms of its
    prioritization of the licensed / legacy users, practical feasibility, and its
    relative simplicity– there is no need for continuous spectrum sensing or tight
    coordination with the primary system. There is a plethora of works on DSA and
    cognitive radio, spanning two decades of research ranging from spectrum sensing
    [9], [10] and channel gain “cartography” [11] to different spectrum sharing modalities
    [12]–[24]. A common assumption in those works is that the signal to interference
    plus noise ratio (SINR) at the secondary receiver can be made high enough to enable
    reliable decoding. In practice, this is hard to ensure if the primary transmitter
    is powerful (e.g., a TV or radio station) while the secondary is power-limited
    (e.g., a WiFi or IoT device). Furthermore, many of these works are relying on
    assumptions that are hard to meet in practice– such as the availability of cross-channel
    knowledge at the secondary users. Few spectrum underlay works have attempted to
    circumvent the need for such assumptions. One interesting recent example is [25],
    where the authors proposed a nice semi-blind beamforming-based underlay spectrum
    sharing approach, which allows the secondary users to access the spectrum while
    minimally affecting the primary network performance, without requiring any channel
    knowledge at the secondary network. However, the proposed method in [25] still
    requires i) the primary communication to be bidirectional (which does not hold
    for legacy radio/TV broadcast, or scientific uses); ii) the flow direction of
    primary traffic to be predictable; iii) effectively time-invariant channels from/to
    the primary users; and iv) training pilots for designing the beamformer at the
    secondary receiver. These are still restrictive assumptions. In particular, the
    reverse transmission of the primary user needs to be synchronized with the forward
    of the secondary, and vice versa, so the secondary users need to track which node
    is transmitting in the primary network. Is it possible to design an underlay strategy
    that enables reliable decoding at very low SINR and modest SNR at the secondary
    receiver, without noticeable increase of the noise floor at the primary receiver?
    Is it possible to do this seamlessly, without any coordination between the primary
    (legacy / incumbent) and the secondary user? The answer is, surprisingly, affirmative.
    This paper proposes a secondary transmission protocol that operates at very low
    power yet allows reliable secondary communication without requiring any channel
    knowledge or coordination with the primary system. The key idea is that the secondary
    user sends its signal twice, each time at very low power. Assuming that the secondary
    receiver employs at least two receive antennas, the proposed transmission protocol
    allows the secondary receiver to create two “views” of the signal space that only
    share the secondary signal– the interference from the primary network is potentially
    very strong, but different in the two views. Invoking canonical correlation analysis
    (CCA) on these two views, the secondary receiver can reliably decode its intended
    signal under very strong interference from the primary user. Transmitting the
    same signal twice can be viewed as repetition coding [26], or as elementary direct-sequence
    spreading [27], [28] with spreading gain equal to two. Our approach is fundamentally
    different from these classical techniques in the way that this controlled redundancy
    is exploited at the receiver (i.e., on the “decoding” side), where we leverage
    the unique strengths of CCA. CCA is a well-known statistical learning tool that
    seeks to find linear combinations of two random vectors such that the resulting
    pair of random variables is maximally correlated [29]. In recent work [30], we
    came up with a new and broadly useful algebraic interpretation of CCA as a method
    that identifies a common (shared) subspace between two signal views, even under
    strong interference from individual (per-view) components. CCA has found many
    other applications in signal processing and wireless communications, including
    direction-of-arrival estimation [31], equalization [32], radar [33], [34], blind
    source separation [35], [36], and more recently cell-edge user detection [37],
    [38], and multi-view learning [39]–[41], to name a few. Our contributions and
    the merits of this paper can be summarized as follows: We propose a novel secondary
    underlay framework that enables seamless primary-secondary coexistence– there
    is no need for coordination between the two. Assuming that the secondary receiver
    is equipped with two receive antennas and down-conversion chains, simple repetition
    of the secondary signal coupled with CCA processing at the secondary receiver
    can recover the secondary transmission even at very low SINR. This claim is rigorously
    backed by identifiability and new theoretical performance analysis in the noisy
    case. The approach is data-driven and unsupervised in that it directly recovers
    the secondary information signal (up to complex scaling), without requiring channel
    state information or primary signal recovery and cancellation. It even works with
    analog modulation of the primary and/or the secondary signal. Time-varying channels
    for the primary and the secondary user can be naturally accommodated, provided
    that the channel coherence time is greater than half the secondary transmission
    frame length (comprising a transmitted packet and its repetition– and the packet
    length is up to our control and can be fairly short). From a computational point
    of view, what is required is the computation and inversion of small correlation
    matrices, and then a principal eigenvector computation, which can be done using
    e.g., the power method. Hence, the approach is attractive for practical implementation.
    The approach is immune to carrier frequency offset, which can be compensated after
    the secondary symbol sequence is extracted using CCA. Furthermore, exploiting
    the repetition structure and CCA, we develop a matching synchronization algorithm
    that identifies the correct timing of the secondary transmission frames even at
    very low SINR in an unsupervised manner– i.e., without using any pilot symbols,
    only exploiting the structured redundancy introduced by repetition. These side-benefits
    are very fortunate, for otherwise synchronization is a very difficult problem
    at very low SINR without very long pilot sequences for acquisition. Last but not
    least, in order to demonstrate the practical feasibility and merits of our approach
    we have built and tested a prototype using software defined radios, where both
    the secondary and primary users were realized using USRP-2920 radios. We conducted
    multiple experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed underlay CCA
    approach under realistic conditions. Our laboratory experiments verified that
    the proposed approach can reliably recover a secondary user signal that is buried
    under strong interference from the primary system (SINR as low as −40 dB), and
    that it approaches the attainable detection performance in the interference-free
    regime (where the primary user is idle). Further, simulations are also provided
    to show the impact of the number of secondary receive antennas, higher order modulation
    and different fading scenarios, on the performance of the proposed method. A preliminary
    version of part of the results in this paper has been accepted for presentation
    at the IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing
    (ICASSP) 2021 [1]. Relative to the conference paper, this journal version includes
    i) a generalization of the synchronous model in [1] to the practical setup where
    the two transmitters are not synchronized; ii) comprehensive solution of practical
    synchronization issues at the secondary receiver, including a low-complexity algorithm;
    iii) theoretical performance analysis; iv) additional simulations and baselines;
    and v) the design and execution of extensive laboratory experiments, and discussion
    of associated insights obtained using the software radio testbed we developed
    for this purpose. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. After briefly
    reviewing CCA in Section II, Section III presents the system model and highlights
    the major limitations of the prior art in terms of secondary underlay schemes.
    The proposed secondary transmission protocol is described in Section IV, while
    the proposed detector is presented in Section V. Section VI explains how to resolve
    synchronization issues at the secondary receiver. Experimental results are provided
    in Section VII, and conclusions are drawn in Section VIII. SECTION II. Overview
    of CCA Consider two data sets Y 1 =[ y (1) 1 ,…, y (N) 1 ]∈ C M 1 ×N and Y 2 =[
    y (1) 2 ,…, y (N) 2 ]∈ C M 2 ×N , where y (n) ℓ represents the n -th realization
    of the random vector y ℓ associated with the ℓ -th view, ℓ∈{1,2} . We assume without
    loss of generality that all the data vectors { y (n) ℓ } N n=1 in each view are
    zero-mean, otherwise the sample mean can be subtracted as a pre-processing step.
    In its simplest form, CCA aims to find two linear combinations of the elements
    of random vectors y 1 and y 2 , z 1 = q H 1 y 1 and z 2 = q H 2 y 2 , respectively,
    such that the two derived random variables z 1 and z 2 are maximally correlated,
    where (⋅ ) H denotes conjugate transpose. In that sense, CCA seeks to find a “latent”
    component that is common between the two random vectors. From an optimization
    perspective, the CCA problem can be posed as [29], [42], max q1, q 2 Re{ q H 1
    Y 1 Y H 2 q 2 }  s.t.  q H ℓ Y ℓ Y H ℓ q ℓ =1,ℓ∈{1,2}, (1a) (1b) View Source where
    Re{⋅} extracts the real part of its argument. Notice that the scaling constraints
    serve to exclude the trivial (and meaningless) all-zero solution. An appealing
    feature of CCA that renders it suitable for practical implementation is that (1)
    admits an algebraic solution via eigendecomposition [42]. In particular, the optimal
    canonical vectors can be obtained via first solving the following generalized
    eigenvalue problem to obtain q ⋆ 1 and λ ⋆ , R 12 R −1 2 R 21 q 1 =λ R 1 q 1 .
    (2) View Source where R i = 1 N Y i Y H i is the sample auto-covariance of the
    random vector y i , and R ij := 1 N Y i Y H j is the sample cross-covariance of
    the two random vectors y i and y j , respectively, for i,j=1,2 and i≠j . Further,
    it can be easily verified that the term λ ⋆ represents the square of the correlation
    coefficient, ρ( q ⋆ 1 , q ⋆ 2 ) , associated with the optimal canonical pair q
    ⋆ 1 and q ⋆ 2 , where ρ( q ⋆ 1 , q ⋆ 2 )=Re{ q ⋆H 1 Y 1 Y H 2 q ⋆ 2 }. (3) View
    Source Once the optimal q ⋆ 1 and λ ⋆ are obtained from solving (2), the optimal
    q ⋆ 2 can be obtained via direct substitution in the following q ∗ 2 = 1 λ ∗ −
    − √ R −1 2 R 21 q ∗ 1 . (4) View Source A more intuitive formulation of (1) (that
    also happens to be more convenient for our purposes) is to minimize the distance
    between the linear projections of Y 1 and Y 2 on q 1 and q 2 , respectively. That
    is [42], [43], min q1, q 2 ∥ ∥ Y H 1 q 1 − Y H 2 q 2 ∥ ∥ 2 2  s.t.  q H ℓ Y ℓ
    Y H ℓ q ℓ =1,ℓ={1,2} (5a) (5b) View Source Expanding the cost of problem (5) and
    using the constraints, the equivalence between (1) and (5) can be easily verified.
    Throughout this work, we will focus on the distance minimization formulation of
    CCA. In what follows, we will see how judicious design of the secondary signaling
    protocol can be used to leverage the power of CCA to enable simultaneous and fully
    independent operation of two coexisting systems without affecting each other’s
    performance. SECTION III. System Model Consider an underlay cognitive radio network
    comprising a single-antenna secondary transmitter (STx) communicating with a secondary
    receiver (SRx) equipped with M s ≥2 antennas, in the presence of a single-antenna
    primary transmitter (PTx) and primary receiver (PRx) with M p ≥1 antennas, as
    shown in Fig. 1. Multiple secondary and primary users can also be accommodated
    as we will explain later. Let h s ∈ C M s , h ps ∈ C M s , h sp ∈ C M p and h
    p ∈ C M p be the channel response between the STx and SRx, PTx and SRx, STx and
    PRx, and PTx and PRx, respectively, defined as h s = h p = σ ss − − − √  g s ,
    h ps = σ ps − − − √  g ps , σ p − − √  g p , h sp = σ sp − − − √  g sp , (6) View
    Source where g s , g ps , g sp , and g p are the respective small-scale fading
    vectors, while the terms σ ss ,  σ ps ,  σ sp , and σ p are the corresponding
    large scale fading coefficients with values dependent on the propagation distance
    and environment. Fig. 1. System Model. Show All Unlike prior works [15]–[19] that
    require estimates of the cross channels h ps and/or h sp at the secondary receiver
    and the secondary transmitter, respectively, this paper considers a practical
    setting where the secondary users have no knowledge about any channel state information
    in the network. A. Signal Model We assume that the primary users transmission
    is done over a narrowband channel of bandwidth B Hz. For simplicity of exposition,
    we assume that both users are employing QPSK modulation, but other types of modulation
    can be accommodated. The basic approach we propose to recover the secondary signal
    is modulation-agnostic, and does not assume anything about the primary signal’s
    modulation, which can even be analog. Let x p ∈ C N and x s ∈ C N denote the digitally-modulated
    transmitted signal by the primary and secondary user, respectively, where | x
    p (n) | 2 =1 and | x s (n) | 2 =1 for n∈[N]:={1,…,N} . In writing down the discrete-time
    baseband-equivalent model, we shall assume, for simplicity of exposition, that
    the primary and secondary signals are synchronized at the symbol level– otherwise
    writing down the model is cumbersome. However, such an assumption is not required
    for our approach to work, and we shall later present an algorithm that can lock
    on the secondary user signal at the SRx. All our laboratory experiments are concerned
    with this asynchronous setup. The discrete-time synchronous baseband-equivalent
    model of the received signal, Y s ∈ C M s ×N , at the secondary receiver is given
    by Y s = α s − − √ h s x T s + α p − − √ h ps x T p + W s , (7) View Source where
    α s and α p are the transmit power of the STx and PTx, respectively. The term
    W s ∈ C M s ×N represents noise and it contains independent identically (i.i.d)
    distributed elements with each entry drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution
    with zero mean and variance σ 2 s . Similarly, the received signal at the primary
    receiver, Y p ∈ C M p ×N , is given by Y p = α s − − √ h sp x T s + α p − − √
    h p x T p + W p , (8) View Source where W p ∈ C M p ×N is the noise term at the
    primary receiver with i.i.d entries drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution
    with zero mean and variance σ 2 p . B. Our Goal The goal of this work is to show
    that, in the absence of channel state information at the STx/SRx and without any
    coordination between the primary and secondary users, seamless secondary underlay
    communication is possible without affecting the primary network performance. To
    do this, we will first present a simple secondary transmission protocol together
    with a data-driven (unsupervised learning-based) approach that allow i) the STx
    to transmit its signal at very low power so that it does not affect the detection
    performance at the PRx, thereby keeping the resulting interference close to the
    PRx noise floor (the PRx can reliably decode its signal even with one receive
    antenna), and ii) the SRx to reliably decode its intended signal at significantly
    low SINR (e.g., −40 dB). SECTION IV. Secondary Transmission Protocol In this section,
    we will present a simple transmission protocol that will assist the secondary
    transmitter to reliably communicate with its receiver over the same channel occupied
    by the primary network, and without degrading the primary user’s performance.
    The secondary transmission scheme is described as follows. If a secondary user
    desires to transmit in a channel occupied by a primary user, it simply transmits
    the same sequence twice at very low power– enough to be received above the thermal
    noise floor at the SRx, but far below what is required to be directly decoded
    in the face of possibly overwhelming interference by the PTx. The repetition of
    the secondary user’s sequence can happen at the symbol or block level; we assume
    block-repetition for simplicity of exposition. To do this, we write x s as two
    back-to-back repeated blocks, i.e., x s =[ s T s T ] T , where s∈ C N/2 is the
    transmitted QPSK symbols by the secondary user over each block. Partitioning x
    p =[ p T 1 p T 2 ] T in two blocks for convenience, the received signal at the
    secondary receiver in (7) can be rewritten as Y s = H s [ s s p 1 p 2 ] T + W
    s , (9) View Source where H s is an M s ×2 matrix that holds on the first column
    the channel vector containing the channel coefficients between the STx and SRx,
    h s , and on the second column the channel from the PTx to the SRx, h ps . Notice
    that the transmit power terms of both the STx and PTx have been absorbed in the
    respective channel vectors, for brevity. As noted earlier, the proposed transmission
    scheme can be interpreted as repetition coding [26], or equivalently as direct-sequence
    spreading of the secondary user’s transmission with spreading gain equal to two
    [27]. Treating this situation as CDMA or as an error control problem will not
    work, because the primary user dominates the received signal, and small spreading
    / coding gains cannot make up for the large power difference between the secondary
    and primary user. CDMA performance is known to suffer from the so- called near-far
    problem which is clearly the case for the setup considered herein. We will next
    present a low-complexity learning-based approach that allows the SRx to reliably
    decode its intended signal, s, even if the received SINR is significantly low.
    SECTION V. Secondary Signal Detection via CCA By exploiting the repetition structure,
    the SRx can split Y s and W s into two blocks, Y s =[ Y 1 Y 2 ] , and W s =[ W
    1 W 2 ] , for which we have Y 1 = Y 2 = H s  [s  p 1 ] T + W 1 , H s  [s  p 2
    ] T + W 2 (10) (11) View Source Now, given the two signal views in (10), CCA will
    be invoked to show that reliable detection of the secondary signal, s , is possible
    even at low SINR. To see how we can utilize CCA to identify the secondary signal,
    s , from Y 1 ∈ C M s ×N/2 and Y 2 ∈ C M s ×N/2 , we will use the so- called maximum
    variance (MAX-VAR) formulation of CCA [42]. That is min g, q 1 , q 2 ∑ ℓ=1 2 ∥
    ∥ Y T ℓ q ℓ −g ∥ ∥ 2 2 ,  s.t. ∥g ∥ 2 2 =1. (12a) (12b) View Source The MAX-VAR
    formulation is equivalent to the distance minimization in (5), since it can be
    shown that both formulations yield the same optimal solutions q ⋆ 1 and q ⋆ 2
    . The MAX-VAR formulation seeks to find a direction g∈ C N/2 that is maximally
    correlated after the linear projections of Y 1 and Y 2 on q 1 ∈ C M s and q 2
    ∈ C M s , respectively. In a recent work [37], we have shown that given two multi-antenna
    signal views that include one shared (common) component and multiple individual
    (“private”, not shared) components in each view, CCA can efficiently extract the
    common component up to scaling ambiguity no matter how strong the individual components
    are. One can see from the two signal views in (10) that each block (view) is subject
    to strong interference by the primary user, but, in general, the interference
    is different in the two blocks– thus there is a unique common subspace, namely
    (the span of) s that conveys the secondary transmission. Building upon our theoretical
    findings in [37], we will next show that our CCA interpretation applies, and under
    very mild conditions will recover s up to scaling, even if x p is several orders
    of magnitude stronger than x s . The following theorem, which is a slight modification
    of the results of [30], states the conditions for identifying the secondary transmitted
    signal s at the SRx. Theorem 1:In the noiseless case, if the matrices B ℓ :=[s,
    p ℓ ]∈ C N/2×2 , for ℓ∈{1,2} , and H s ∈ C M s ×2 are full column rank, then the
    optimal solution g ⋆ of problem (12) is given by g ⋆ =γs , where γ∈C , γ≠0 is
    the scaling ambiguity. Proof:The proof is provided in Theorem 1 in [37]. Note
    that the full rank condition on the matrices B ℓ needs the signals s and p ℓ to
    be linearly independent which is practically always the case for any reasonable
    “packet” length N , because these signals are drawn from statistically independent
    sources. On the other hand, the full rank condition on H s is in fact the more
    restrictive one as it requires i) the number of antennas at the SRx to be greater
    than or equal to the number of co-channel signals (two in our setting) and ii)
    the channel vectors to be linearly independent. The latter is realistic, these
    being statistically independent channel vectors from the PTx and the STx to the
    SRx. To further show how well our approach works in the presence of noise, we
    provide theoretical analysis of the correlation coefficient between the estimated
    and the transmitted secondary signal in the presence of noise, as N→∞ . We have
    the following result. Proposition 1:In the presence of additive white complex
    circularly symmetric Gaussian noise of variance σ 2 s (s for secondary Rx noise),
    as the packet length, N 2 , goes to infinity, the correlation coefficient between
    the optimal solution g ⋆ of problem (12) and the true signal s approaches ρ= |

    is relegated to Appendix. Note that we only provide a short version of the proof
    due to the space limitation. The detailed version of the proof, the experimental
    verification, and an insightful discussion highlighting the impact of SNR and
    the users’ channel correlation are deferred to the supplement. A. Time-Varying
    Channel Directions, Fading, and Intermittent Transmissions Although the two signal
    views in (10) implicitly assume that the channel is constant across the two secondary
    repetition blocks, our proposed method in fact works even if the two channel matrices
    are different [37]. Therefore, with block repetition, the coherence time needs
    to be only greater than one block duration. We will see in the experiments how
    this feature grants our proposed method robustness against time varying channels.
    B. Interference Cancellation? It is worth pointing out that if the primary user
    signal is order(s) of magnitude stronger and the primary channel remains constant
    (no intermittent transmissions, no time-division duplex, insignificant channel
    direction changes) then one can cancel the primary interference by simply projecting
    the received signal on the minor left singular vector of the matrix Y ℓ , thereby
    “revealing” the secondary transmission. This can only work when the spatial channels
    are time-invariant. In practice, the channel gains fluctuate over time, and even
    if the average secondary signal to interference ratio is low (e.g., −40 dB), there
    are times when it becomes relatively high (e.g., −20 dB). These fluctuations quickly
    degrade the subspace estimate, leading to complete failure to detect the secondary
    signal, as we will see in the laboratory experiments. C. Multiple Secondary Users
    Note that our theoretical results dictate that our proposed CCA approach can identify
    the secondary signal in a network with only one secondary user, and we have argued
    that finding the secondary user signal is tantamount to solving for a principal
    eigenvector which can be cheaply computed via the power method. Even with multiple
    secondary users, our recovery claim holds and receiver complexity is roughly the
    same, provided that i) each secondary receiver has enough antennas (as many as
    the maximum number of active users at any given time, see Theorem 1); and ii)
    there are no persistent and perfectly aligned collisions between any of the secondary
    users. In other words, no two secondary users transmit their packet pairs at the
    exact same times. With asynchronous wake-up type devices serving intermittent
    communication needs, this situation is highly likely. SECTION VI. Secondary Synchronization
    One critical issue that we always face in practice is synchronization. The overall
    synchronization task comprises time, carrier frequency offset (CFO), and phase
    synchronization. While effective solutions to these problems are well-established
    for classical communication modalities, here we are dealing with a secondary signal
    that is potentially buried under the primary one, which makes secondary time synchronization
    and CFO acquisition much more challenging. A standard receiver will naturally
    lock on the primary user, which means that the secondary signal will present itself
    with an unknown CFO and unknown start time within the received sequence. Fortunately,
    the presence of CFO does not destroy the alignment of the two copies of the secondary
    packet: owing to the temporal shift invariance property of pure complex exponential
    signals, the second copy is the same as the first except for a complex phase shift.
    Hence we can proceed with CCA and correct the CFO after recovering the CFO-modulated
    secondary packet. On the other hand, secondary timing acquisition is a challenge,
    due to the large power imbalance between the primary and the secondary signal.
    To deal with this problem, we propose a blind CCA-based algorithm that is practically
    effective in finding the start time of the secondary packet under such a large
    power imbalance between the two users. In practice, the secondary receiver receives
    a long sequence, Y ˜ s ∈ R M s × N ˜ where N ˜ >N . The goal is to find the sample
    index, k , so that we can extract the desired signal Y s from Y ˜ s , and then
    use the proposed method in Section V to decode the secondary user signal. By exploiting
    the repetition structure of the transmitted signal, we start with k=1 and construct
    the two views Y (k) 1 = Y ˜ s (:,k:N/2+k−1) and Y (k) 2 = Y ˜ s (:,N/2+k:k+N−1)
    followed by solving (2) to obtain the associated correlation coefficient ρ k .1
    Then, we store ρ k , set k=k+1 and repeat the previous procedure. If we hit the
    start point of the two copies of the same packet, then CCA of these “views” will
    yield its maximum correlation coefficient. In other words, the correlation coefficient,
    ρ k defined in (3), associated with each pair of canonical directions q (k) 1
    and q (k) 2 obtained by solving (5) at the k -th step, will be at its maximum
    only when we have all the N/2 symbols in both views. This is because, under the
    usual assumption that the secondary information sequence is uncorrelated, even
    if k is off by one, the two partial sequences will decorrelate. The higher N is,
    the higher the correlation peak we obtain as we will see in the experiments, but
    even moderate N , in the order of 128 symbols, can yield very good detection performance.
    Notice that the procedure utilizes the special frame structure that is designed
    to enable CCA, but is otherwise agnostic to the specific information sequence
    that is being sent by the secondary transmitter. In this sense, it is a blind
    synchronization strategy that leverages the power of CCA to enable reliable timing
    acquisition at very low SINR. The procedure is summarized as Algorithm 1. Algorithm
    1 Secondary Synchronization Show All The computational complexity of Algorithm
    1 is determined by the complexity of solving a series of CCA problems, which is
    equivalent to solving for the principal component (canonical pair) of (2) a number
    of times (equal to the search window size). The canonical pair can be cheaply
    computed via a power iteration. Further, each CCA problem requires inversion of
    correlation matrices of size M s × M s each– these inverses can be computed analytically
    since M s =2 . To minimize the search window length, one can start with a coarse
    estimate for the region with high correlation coefficient and then do a narrow
    search within a small window size to get the final start time index, as we will
    see in the experiments. Furthermore, if the secondary transmitter is continuously
    transmitting, we do not need to run the full Algorithm 1 for each received packet–
    we only need to do a narrow timing search to compensate for jitter. SECTION VII.
    Numerical Results In this section, we will evaluate the proposed method using
    both simulations and real experiments. We first present simulations to test the
    performance of the proposed method under different number of antennas, modulation
    schemes, and fading scenarios. Then, we present experiments using real radios
    to show how the proposed method works under practical considerations such as synchronization
    and hardware impairments. To benchmark the performance of the proposed CCA approach,
    we use the following baselines. SVD without interference: we will use the singular
    value decomposition (SVD) to estimate the channel direction during a period when
    the primary user is inactive, i.e., there is no interference from the primary
    user. To do that, we first exploit the repetition structure to construct the signal
    Y=[ Y T 1 Y T 2 ] T ∈ C 2 M s ×N/2 . Then, the secondary user signal can be estimated
    by projecting the received signal Y on the left principal vector. Note that our
    use of the SVD “baseline” without interference (which is more appropriately called
    an “oracle” method here) is purely to show how well the proposed method works–
    close to an oracle which operates in a fictitious interference-free environment.
    SVD with interference: we will use SVD to project away the interference subspace
    by projecting on the third principal component of the matrix Y to estimate the
    secondary signal. Notice that projecting on the first two components yields the
    subspace containing the primary user signals, p 1 and p 2 . A. Simulations We
    provide simulation results to assess the performance of the proposed CCA approach.
    We consider the underlay scenario shown in Fig. 1. The transmit power at the PTx,
    α p , is set to 20 dBm while the maximum transmit power at the STx, α s , is set
    to 10 dBm. The large scale fading parameters (path-loss) used in the simulation
    are set to σ 2 ss =−80 dB, σ 2 sp = σ 2 ps =−80 dB, and the additive white Gaussian
    noise power is set to σ 2 s =−88 dBm. The small scale fading parameters are modeled
    as circularly symmetric Gaussian random variables with zero mean and variance
    1/ M s − − − √ . Furthermore, the total number of samples collected at the SRx
    is assumed to be 1024, so the repetition is done over two blocks, each of length
    512 samples. We conducted 10 4 Monte-Carlo two-block-transmission experiments,
    each time drawing new s,p,W and H s . We assume that the PTx is sending a 32-QAM
    signal, while the STx is sending a QPSK signal unless stated otherwise. Since
    we assume digitally-modulated symbols at the secondary user, we will use the symbol
    error rate (SER) as a performance metric (but recall that our method can also
    work with analog transmissions). In the first experiment, we tested the proposed
    method under different modulation schemes. We varied the STx power from −8 dBm
    to 10 dBm which corresponds to the received SNR range in Fig. 2. For each value
    of the secondary SNR, we report the corresponding SER obtained by our proposed
    CCA method and the considered baselines. Fig. 2 shows the SER performance of the
    proposed method under QPSK and 16-QAM constellations. It is clear that the proposed
    method approaches the performance of the interference-free SVD baseline even for
    the higher order modulation case. Further, one can see that the performance of
    the SVD with interference breaks when the SNR increases (12 dB corresponding to
    16 dB power difference between the two users) due to subspace leakage that significantly
    deteriorates the detection performance. We will show later through real experiments
    that the gap between the proposed method and SVD with interference is even much
    larger due to the power fluctuations as will be explained later. Fig. 2. Secondary
    user performance under different modulation schemes. Show All Next, we simulated
    another experiment to see the impact of the number of antennas at the SRx. We
    varied the number of antennas ( M s ) from 2 to 6 while the secondary SNR is fixed
    at 11 dB (corresponding to 17 dB power difference between the two transmitters).
    One can see from Fig. 3 that increasing the number of antennas at the SRx brings
    the proposed method closer to the interference-free SVD. Note that there is no
    antenna gain here as the channel vectors are normalized with the number of antennas.
    The reason that the two curves (red and black) in Fig. 3 attain the same performance
    when M s exceeds 5 is that the two channels h s and h ps tend to be more uncorrelated
    when we increase the number of antennas. Fig. 3. Secondary user SER versus number
    of antennas at the SRx. Show All Finally, to show how changing the secondary channels
    across the two blocks affects the performance of the proposed method, we simulated
    another experiment with completely different channel vectors across the two blocks
    for both primary and secondary users. For each Monte-Carlo trial, each of the
    two channels for each user is randomly drawn from a complex Gaussian distribution.
    Fig. 4 shows that using different channels in the two blocks yields a roughly
    3 dB SNR gain. This is attributed to the fact that two different channels will
    result in a diversity gain. Such a gain increases the probability of seeing more
    uncorrelated channels ( h s and h ps ) in any of the views, and this naturally
    yields a better CCA solution as compared to the case with constant channels across
    the two blocks. Fig. 4. Secondary user performance with different channel across
    two blocks, with QPSK modulation. Show All B. Experiments In this section, we
    evaluate the performance of the proposed CCA approach for low-power secondary
    underlay communication in practice (for simplified simulations, see [1]). To do
    so, we have built a prototype of the proposed CCA underlay scheme using software
    defined radios (SDR). C. Experimental Setup Both the primary and secondary links
    are realized using USRP-2920 devices and general-purpose computers. The USRPs
    are used for radio signal transmission / reception, while the computers are used
    for baseband signal processing. The experimental layout is shown in Fig. 6. We
    used five USRPs: one for the primary transmitter, one for the primary receiver,
    one for the secondary transmitter, and two for the secondary receivers, see Fig.
    6. Each USRP is equipped with a single antenna. The two USRPs of the secondary
    receiver are connected together with a MIMO cable to synchronize the two receive
    radio frequency chains, as shown in Fig. 7(d). Fig. 5. Secondary user performance
    with different channel across two blocks, with 8PSK modulation. Show All Fig.
    6. Experimental Setup. Show All Fig. 7. (a) Primary Transmitter. (b) Primary Receiver.
    (c) Secondary Transmitter. (d) Secondary Receiver. Show All The locations of the
    PTx, PRx, STx, SRx are fixed throughout the experiments. The distances between
    the PTx and PRx, PTx and SRx, STx and PRx, and STx and SRx are 5, 3, 4.5, and
    4 meters, respectively. The transmit power of the PTx is set to the maximum possible
    value, as shown in Table I unless stated otherwise, while the transmit power of
    the STx is adjusted for low-power secondary transmission. The sampling rate for
    both users is set to 1 Mega samples per second (MS/sec), the signal bandwidth
    is 100 KHz, and the carrier frequency is 1.2 GHz. The PTx uses a block of 256
    QPSK symbols and the STx uses repetition over two blocks, each of length 128 QPSK
    symbols. The parameter settings for our experiments are summarized in Table I.
    TABLE I Parameter Settings for the Experiments 1) Signal Processing at the Transmitters:
    At each Tx, the constructed block is oversampled by a factor of 10, then the resulting
    oversampled signal is pulse-shaped using a square-root raised cosine (SRRC) with
    roll-off factor and amplitude set to 0.5 and 6, respectively. The pulse shaped
    signal is zero-padded with a number of zeros equal to one third of the packet,
    yielding a sequence of length 4020 samples. This results in a transmission rate
    of 128 Kbps for the primary user and 64 Kbps for the secondary user. The zero-padding
    (used to emulate intermittent packet transmission) is also used at the receiver
    side to measure the received SNR and SINR, as we will see later. Symbol generation,
    up-sampling, and pulse shaping are done in MATLAB. Then, the transmit data of
    each user is fed to GNU radio before being transmitted over the air. 2) Secondary
    Receiver: We use the proposed CCA algorithm in Section VI to detect both the secondary
    packet and the start of the 256 × 2 complex signal. After SRRC matched filtering,
    down-sampling to the symbol rate, and secondary synchronization, we construct
    the two signal views by separating the two back-to-back blocks, and then use CCA
    to recover the secondary signal. After solving the CCA problem (5), we average
    the two soft estimates of s obtained via Y H 1 q 1 and Y H 2 q 2 , before hard
    thresholding. In order to resolve the scaling ambiguity that is inherent both
    in the proposed CCA method and the SVD-based baselines, we assume that the first
    four secondary symbols are known at the SRx. Note that these symbols can be drawn
    from the packet header that contains the STx identification sequence. Remark 1:It
    is worth noting that for the second baseline (SVD with interference), we use our
    proposed blind method in Section VI to recover the secondary packet start time
    index at the SRx, thereby giving a big advantage to the SVD based method. The
    typical synchronization method that would be used with SVD is to allow the STx
    to transmit a long pilot sequence, long enough to make up for the large power
    difference between the two users. Then, we would use knowledge of this pilot sequence
    at the SRx to find the start time index of the secondary signal via cross-correlation
    / matched filtering. This would seriously reduce the transmission rate of the
    secondary user relative to our proposed blind method, especially for the setting
    considered herein where the secondary user is much weaker than the primary. Further,
    and perhaps worse, such training-based timing recovery requires the SRx to estimate
    the secondary CFO before (or together with) timing synchronization, which is in
    another serious complication given the low SINR and moderate SNR of the secondary
    user. 3) Primary Receiver: At the PRx, we use energy detection for the primary
    packet detection. Then, we use primary training symbols to detect the start index
    of the 256 × 1 received signal of the primary user. To decode the primary symbols,
    we use 10 training pilots to estimate the primary channel coefficient and then
    do the hard detection of the equalized signal. D. Performance Evaluation Since
    we assume digitally-modulated signals for both users, we will use the symbol error
    rate (SER) as a performance metric (but recall that our method can also work with
    analog modulation for the primary and the secondary user). In the first experiment,
    we test the performance of the proposed approach under different levels of primary
    interference at the secondary receiver. To do so, we fix the secondary transmit
    power to −18 dBm. This makes the corresponding measured average received SNR at
    the SRx equal to approximately 8 dB. We vary the primary transmit power from 0
    to 20 dBm in 5 dB steps, thus generating transmit power differences from approximately
    −20 dB down to a rather extreme −40 dB. To validate the power difference between
    the two users at the SRx, Fig. 8 shows the GNU radio spectrum analyzer at the
    SRx with the received signal strength level of the PTx and STx in addition to
    the noise level. The transmit power of the PTx is set to 20 dBm, and Fig. 8 shows
    close to 40 dB power difference between the two users. Furthermore, Fig. 9 depicts
    the squared samples of one of the received packets at the SRx after matched filtering
    with the SRRC, for primary transmit power set to 15 dBm. It is clear that part
    of the secondary transmitted packet overlaps with the padded zeros of the primary
    packet, showcasing the power difference between the two users. Further, the remaining
    zeros show the low received SNR range of the secondary user. Fig. 8. GNU radio
    spectrum analyzer showing 40 dB received power difference between the PTx and
    STx at the SRx. The received signal of the PTx is shown in red while that of the
    STx is depicted in purple, and the noise in blue. Show All Fig. 9. Squared samples
    of one of the received packets after matched filtering with the SRRC. Notice the
    overlap between part of the secondary packet and the zeros of the primary, and
    also the low SNR of the secondary. Show All To compute the received SNR and SINR
    of the secondary signal at the SRx, we exploit the padded zeros in both the primary
    and secondary signals to measure the noise power, the secondary signal power,
    and the primary signal power at the SRx. In particular, we estimate the probability
    distribution of the symbol energy across 1500 packets, each of length 400 symbols.
    From the distribution, one can estimate either two peaks or three peaks, depending
    on the overlap between the secondary (primary) and the zeros of the primary (secondary).
    For instance, Fig. 10(a) clearly shows one of the received packets in one of the
    channels for the 20 dB transmit power imbalance case. One can clearly see the
    three different energy levels: one for the (primary, secondary and noise), another
    for (secondary and noise), and one for noise only. Notice that the first level
    can also be primary and noise, but since the primary is very strong, treating
    the first level as (primary and noise) or (primary, secondary and noise) will
    have negligible impact on the SINR and SNR measurements of the secondary user.
    Fig. 10(c), shows the histogram of the collected data across 1500 packets for
    the 20 dB transmit power difference, where three distinct peaks are observed.
    In Fig. 10(b), however, one can see a complete overlap between part of the secondary
    signal and the padded zeros of the primary user for the 40 dB transmit power difference,
    and hence, only two peaks can be seen in the distribution shown in Fig. 10(d).
    Fig. 10. Example of the received primary user’s packets at the SRx after matched
    filtering with the SRRC for 20 dB and 40 dB transmit power difference. Plots a)
    and b) depict the symbol energy of the detected packet, for the two transmit power
    imbalance scenarios, while (c) and (d) correspond to the estimated probability
    distribution of the energy (in dB) of the detected symbols for the 20 dB and 40
    dB transmit power difference cases, respectively. Show All We use the data collected
    for the 20 dB transmit power difference to measure the energy levels corresponding
    to the three observed probability density peaks, see Fig. 10(c). We use these
    values to solve a system of linear equations (three equations in three unknowns)
    to compute the received SNR and SINR at the secondary receiver. We repeat the
    same procedure for the different transmit power difference cases to calculate
    the associated SINR and SNR values. Note that, since the secondary transmit power
    is fixed throughout this experiment, we observed approximately the same average
    energy level (peak value) for either the noise level or the (secondary and noise)
    level, across all the transmit power difference cases. However, as expected, we
    observed increase in the estimated energy level that corresponds to the primary,
    secondary and noise. To confirm this, one can see from Fig. 10(b) a complete overlap
    between part of the secondary signal and the padded zeros of the primary user
    for the 40 dB transmit power difference case, and hence, only two peaks can be
    seen in the distribution shown in Fig. 10(d). Notice that the energy level associated
    with the smallest peak (secondary and noise) in Fig. 10(d) is roughly equivalent
    to the energy level associated with the middle peak in Fig. 10(c), while one can
    easily see close to 20 dB increase in the highest peak (primary, secondary and
    noise) in Fig. 10(d) relative to Fig. 10(c). The measured SINR values for the
    different transmit power cases are reported in Table II. TABLE II Estimated Secondary
    SINR at the SRx Over the Two Receive Channels, Across the Different Transmit Power
    Imbalance Scenarios. The Measured Average SecondarySNR Is Around 8 dB In order
    to demonstrate the capability of our proposed approach to correctly decode the
    secondary transmission at very low SINR, we report the SER of the secondary user
    obtained by our proposed CCA method at five different levels of the (average)
    transmit power imbalance: from −20 dB to −40 dB (corresponding secondary SINR
    levels are reported in Table II). Fig. 11 depicts SER results obtained by our
    proposed CCA method, for all five levels of primary interference, and the corresponding
    SER curve obtained using the SVD-based method at the same SNR without any interference.
    The results are striking: CCA is remarkably insensitive to interference from the
    primary user. In particular, CCA achieves almost the same performance at power
    difference levels (−35,−30,−20,−25) dB. On the other hand, at the −40 dB level,
    the CCA performance degrades. This mainly happens due to the limited resolution
    of the analog to digital converter of our USRP for the wide dynamic range of the
    input signal– while the average SINR is −32 dB, there are several instances where
    it drops below −40 dB, and these occasional quantization errors ultimately dominate
    CCA performance. Despite that, CCA still achieves close to 10 −2 SER. Finally,
    one can see that CCA significantly outperforms the SVD method used for interference
    cancellation, even though the latter is in fact aided by the CCA frame structure
    to acquire timing– a benefit which it won’t have in practice. As shown in Fig.
    11, SVD performance breaks at 25 dB transmit power difference, where primary subspace
    estimation becomes very difficult, and hence interference cancellation does not
    work. Fig. 11. Secondary user detection performance at different average SINR
    levels. The measured average secondary SNR is approximately 8 dB. Show All Considering
    the primary user’s performance, we observed that the single-antenna primary receiver
    is completely insensitive to the secondary interference. Fig. 12(a) shows one
    of the received packets at the PRx (before down sampling), with the primary transmit
    power set to 0 dBm (minimum primary power in this experiment), while the secondary
    user is inactive. On the other hand, Fig. 12(b) shows one of the received packets
    at the PRx (before down sampling) when the secondary user is active, where there
    is approximately 70 % overlap between the two users’ packets. We observed that
    in the worst case setting, where the primary user power is fixed to its minimum
    level (highest interference from the secondary user), the same detection performance
    can be attained regardless whether the secondary user is active or not. This is
    due to the fact that the secondary interference is close to the primary’s noise
    floor, as one can see from Fig. 12(c) and Fig. 12(d), where the two smaller peaks
    in Fig. 12(c) and Fig. 12(d) correspond to the noise level and the secondary plus
    noise level, respectively. We observed that the SNR of the primary user is 28
    dB when the secondary user is inactive, while the primary user’s SINR is 25 dB
    when the secondary user is active. Fig. 12. (a) primary packet samples when the
    STx is inactive. (b) primary packet samples when the STx is active. (c) energy
    distribution when the STx is inactive. (d) energy distribution when the STx is
    active. Show All 1) Effect of Secondary SNR: We consider another experiment to
    see the performance of the proposed method under different SNR values for the
    secondary user. To do so, we fixed the primary transmit power to 10 dBm and varied
    the secondary transmit power from −23 to −17 dBm which corresponds to average
    SNR values between 2 dB and 10 dB, as observed. At each SNR value, we report the
    SER of the secondary user. Fig. 13 depicts the SER performance of the secondary
    user versus its SNR. It is obvious how well our proposed method works at very
    low SNR / SINR values. In particular, our method can achieve 10 −2 SER at 7 dB
    and closely approaches what is attained by the interference-free SVD baseline
    at low SNR values. Further, one can see that the SVD with interference completely
    fails at both the low SNR and high SNR regions, where in the latter, the secondary
    user becomes a bit more stronger and then accurate primary subspace estimation
    becomes more difficult as explained in the previous experiment. Fig. 13. Secondary
    user detection performance at different SNR. Show All On the other hand, we observed
    that the secondary user does not affect the primary performance, which remains
    the same as is attained when the secondary user is inactive. The same SER is observed
    at the PRx, even at the extreme case where the secondary transmit power is −17
    dBm (i.e., the highest interference to the primary). 2) Impact of Packet Size:
    We test the performance of the proposed method as a function of secondary packet
    size. The secondary and primary transmit powers are fixed to −20 dBm and 5 dBm,
    respectively. The measured average SNR at the secondary receiver is 7 dB. The
    primary packet length is set to 256 QPSK symbols. Fig. 14 shows the SER performance
    of the proposed approach versus the packet size of the secondary user. We observe
    a significant improvement in the secondary SER when the secondary packet length
    increases. This is due to the fact that increasing N renders the transmit sequences
    closer to being orthogonal and having low auto-correlation sidelobes, which improves
    the performance of CCA and secondary timing synchronization. We recently established
    a performance analysis of CCA in [37], where we showed that increasing the packet
    length yields higher canonical correlation coefficient, and hence a better estimate
    for the common signal. This suggests that transmitting longer secondary packets
    provides better secondary detection performance. On the other hand, one can argue
    that if the channel is fast time varying, then the higher the packet length, the
    higher the probability of each block being subject to channel variation, thus
    violating the presumed mode. Hence, in setting the secondary packet length one
    has to take into account the coherence time of the channel, in order to choose
    the optimal packet length for the secondary user. Fig. 14. Secondary user detection
    performance for different packet sizes of the secondary user. The packet length
    of the primary user is fixed to 256 QPSK symbols. Show All 3) Secondary Synchronization:
    Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm for finding the
    start time of the secondary packet. We use the same parameters as the previous
    experiment but the secondary packet is fixed to 256 symbols. Recall that the received
    packet length, before down-sampling, is 4020 samples. To find the start of the
    256 × 2 signal, we run Algorithm 1 with a step of 10 symbols on the received signal,
    which resulted in solving approximately a series of 40 CCA problems. Fig. 15 shows
    that the highest correlation coefficient is attained at symbols index 60. We then
    performed an additional narrow (fine) search over a window size of 10 symbols
    centered at the obtained symbol index from the wide search. Fig. 15. Secondary
    user synchronization using CCA. Show All SECTION VIII. Conclusion In this paper,
    we proposed a practical low-complexity data-driven spectrum sharing approach for
    an asynchronous underlay scenario involving a high-power primary user and a low-power
    secondary link. The proposed method allows the secondary user to reliably communicate
    over the same channel occupied by the primary, without any coordination, and without
    any channel state information. Our proposed solution is based on “repetition coding”:
    the secondary user transmits its signal twice at very low power such that it does
    not affect the primary user detection performance. Constructing two signal views
    at the SRx and applying CCA to these views, we showed that the secondary receiver
    can reliably decode its intended signal at moderate SNR even if it is buried under
    strong interference from the primary user transmission. We proposed a low-complexity
    unsupervised based approach that can resolve the crucial low-SINR synchronization
    issue at the secondary receiver. Laboratory experiments using a custom-built USRP
    testbed confirmed the efficacy of the proposed method in decoding the secondary
    signal at very low SINR in real world wireless environments. The proposed framework
    can guarantee reliable reception of the secondary underlay signal even under time-varying
    and intermittent interference from the primary user. Specifically, our theoretical
    results show that the secondary signal can be identified even if the primary channel
    is different across the two secondary signal blocks. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first spectrum underlay work that allows a low-power secondary user
    to occupy the channel with a time varying primary user in a realistic wireless
    environment, without i) requiring any knowledge about the primary network (waveform,
    modulation, channel, timing, etc.), ii) coordination between the primary and the
    secondary system, iii) long pilot sequences for acquisition and channel estimation
    for the secondary user. Appendix Proof of Proposition 1 Let us write the model

    1 = α 1 y s , for α 1 ∈C . Substituting b 1 back to equation (19) gives that ∥
    y s ∥ 2 = λ v s , while the expression for  q 1 now becomes q 1 = α 1 U (Λ+ σ
    2 s I) − 1 2 y s . Since R 11 = R 22 and R 21 = R 12 we can easily conclude that
    q 1 = q 2 . As a result, we can get that the solution of MAX-VAR, in terms of
    g , is given by g= Y T 1 q ∗ 1 = Y T 2 q ∗ 2 , with g satisfying ∥g∥= N/2 − −

    technologies has resulted in increased data traffic and created demand for additional
    radio spectrum. This growing demand for radio spectrum has resulted in spectrum
    congestion and mandated the need for coexistence between radar and interfering
    communication emitters. To address the aforementioned issues, it is critical to
    review existing policies and evaluate new technologies that can utilize spectrum
    in an efficient and intelligent manner. Cognitive radio and cognitive radar are
    two promising technologies that exploit spectrum using dynamic spectrum access
    techniques. Additionally, introducing the bio-inspired concept ‘metacognition’
    in a cognitive process has shown to increase the effectiveness and robustness
    of the cognitive radio and cognitive radar system. Metacognition is a high-order
    thinking agent that monitors and regulates the cognition process through a feedback
    and control process called the perception–action cycle. Extensive research has
    been done in the field of spectrum sensing in cognitive radio and spectral coexistence
    between radar and communication systems. This paper provides a detailed classification
    of spectrum sensing schemes and explains how dynamic spectrum access strategies
    share the spectrum between radar and communication systems. In addition to this,
    the fundamentals of cognitive radio, its architecture, spectrum management framework,
    and metacognition concept in radar are discussed. Furthermore, this paper presents

    radar 1. Introduction The exponential growth in the number of communicating devices
    and mobile users [1] introduces the need to increase the radio spectrum’s demand
    to support high-speed data networks. The Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
    [2] facilitates the utilization of radio spectrum assets and control radio emissions
    [3]. It allocates the radio spectrum to licensed users called Primary Users (PUs)
    for a long period and large geographic regions. However, a large portion of the
    allocated spectrum remains under utilized for long periods of time, resulting
    in spectrum holes. In order to address this issue, FCC has modified its spectrum
    policy which exploits the spectrum in more intelligent way through cognitive radio
    (CR) technology. The CR technology is viewed as an advancement of software defined
    radio (SDR) that can reprogram and reconfigure itself dynamically [4]. CR identifies
    the available channels and adjusts its transmitter and receiver parameters based
    on the variations in environmental parameters to utilize the spectrum more efficiently.
    The CR networks (CRNs) enable Secondary users (SUs) to access unused licensed
    spectrum opportunistically for its data transmission. The SUs can switch between
    the available spectrum in dynamic manner without interfering with PUs in CRNs
    using a technique called dynamic spectrum access (DSA) process [5]. Different
    sensing schemes such as energy detection (ED), covariance feature detection (CoFD),
    matched filtering detection (MFD), cyclostationary feature detection (CFD), and
    machine learning (ML) based detection have been devised to detect the presence
    of PUs [5], [6], [7], [8]. However, various factors such as noise uncertainty,
    shadowing, and multipath fading restrict the detection performance of single-user
    sensing [9]. These issues can be overcome by enabling cooperation among the CRs
    [10]. By incorporating the benefits of spatial and multi-user diversity, cooperative
    spectrum sensing (CoSS) optimizes detection accuracy and accomplishes high throughput
    in CRNs. To implement DSA, spectrum sensing, spectrum handoff, and interference
    management functions, various CRNs testbeds using SDR [11], GNU Radio [12], and
    Universal software radio peripheral (USRP) [13] have been proposed in [14], [15],
    [16], [17], [18]. The advancement in sensing technology through radar increases
    the bandwidth requirement of communication system, thereby generating demand for
    extra radio spectrum. To address this issue, FCC has modified its existing policy
    and permits communication systems to share spectrum with existing radar systems
    within fixed frequency bands (3.5–5 GHz) [19], [20]. However, bandwidth plays
    a key role in radar system to perform several operation such as target detection,
    localization, and classification. Radars must coexist with unlicensed emitters
    (known as RF emitters) to sustain the system performance in a congested electromagnetic
    environment (EME). The unlicensed emitters serve as RF interference (RFI) in radar
    systems that have been found to affect the performance in various application
    of radar [21]. In [22], a spectral coexistence method between radar and communication
    system which reduces the bit error rate (BER) of communication networks has been
    proposed. The DSA strategies utilize adaptation ability to reassign the spectrum
    and have been applied to many applications of wireless communication networks
    [23]. Most of the DSA applications of cognitive radar (CoR) are realized using
    a perception–action-cycle (PAC). The PAC is a feedback and control process that
    continuously observes the surroundings, analyzes data, and takes appropriate action
    based on the results. The CoR strategies are carried out in cognitive engine (CE)
    [24] to take a decision based on its prior experience and monitor its performance.
    The CE algorithms are designed to provide predictable and accurate performance
    levels. In order to employ the optimal CoR strategy for changing scenarios, an
    extensive feedback and control process is needed, called the best-of-breed method.
    It identifies when to use which CoR strategies and when to switch between them.
    An excepted, best-of-breed framework includes the bio-inspired idea of “metacognition”
    [25] which is defined as a higher-order thinking agent that actively monitors
    and regulates the cognitive processes or the behavior of multiple CoR strategies
    involved in learning. It allows CoR to work dynamically in the handling of high-dimension
    optimization problems in wireless systems. Although the concept of metacognition
    in radar has received less attention relative to metacognitive radio (MCR), MCoR
    has the potential to make the CoR more robust, reliable, and efficient. Table
    1 provides an overview of several survey papers related to CRNs’ applications.
    However, this review paper provides a better understanding of spectrum sensing
    with their state-of-art schemes and gives direction for further research on this
    area to enable CRNs. This paper discusses the recent advancement related to spectrum
    sensing and DSAs for CRNs and CoR. The prime contributions of this paper are as

    networks The term cognitive comes from the Latin word ‘Cognition’, which means
    to acquire knowledge and apprehension through guessing, resolving problems, remembering,
    learning, and decision making [34]. Joseph Mitola and Maguire [35] were the first
    to introduce the idea of CR in 1999, and further, it was extended by Iii [36]
    with the aim of exploiting unused portions of the radio spectrum. According to
    them, CR is viewed as SDR [37], as shown in Fig. 1, where two essential technologies:
    digital radio and computer software are combined [38]. They described CR as the
    combination of model-based reasoning with software radio technologies. SDR is
    a radio communication system where all the signal manipulation and processing
    is done in software instead of hardware. In Fig. 1, flexible RF hardware acts
    as an RF front-end circuit, used to down-convert or tune the signal to a lower
    frequency called an intermediate frequency (IF). This signal is then digitized
    using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) and passed to the channel and sample
    rate conversion blocks. The digital signal coming out from ADC has a fixed sample
    rate. Therefore, it is converted to a different sample rate based on the various
    wireless standards, known as the sample rate conversion process. The channelizer
    extracts the channels of interest from the received digitized RF bands and then
    forwards these channels to the baseband processor for further processing like
    demodulation, decoding, encryption, and source coding. The main issues of the
    baseband processor are the required amount of processing power and heat dissipation.
    Due to this reason, at the processing stage, it is required to incorporate general-purpose
    processors (GPPs), digital signal processors (DSPs), field-programmable gate arrays
    (FPGAs), and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) for a particular
    set of signal-processing needs in the digital transceiver architecture. Further,
    Simon Haykin provided a review on CR in 2005, and described it as “brain-empowered
    wireless communications” [4]. According to him, “CR is an intelligent wireless
    radio that can modify its transmitter parameters based on the interaction with
    surroundings for efficient utilization of spectrum”, with two main objectives
    of highly reliable communications and efficient utilization of the radio spectrum.

    Fig. 1. Software Defined Radio. 2.2. Cognitive radio characteristics and tasks
    The rapid growth in QoS and channel capacity requirements in the wireless network
    is limited by the lack of essential resources such as bandwidth and energy. As
    a result, researchers are giving their efforts to develop new communications and
    networking standards to utilize these limited resources intelligently and effectively.
    CR is the most appealing technology for the next-generation communication system
    to utilize the limited resources effectively. The primary function of CR is to
    detect white spaces in multiple dimensions such as time, frequency, and space.
    CR modifies its operating parameters such as frequency and time slot allocation,
    modulation and coding type, power control, and antenna parameters according to
    the interaction with the environment. CR acts as SUs that can reconfigure themselves
    dynamically to avoid any harmful interference with PUs using its cognitive capabilities,
    reconfigurability, and learning capabilities, [4], [9], [26]. Cognitive capability
    is defined as the ability of CR to sense and collect necessary information such
    as operating power, frequency, bandwidth, modulation, and coding type from the
    surrounding environment to identify the best available spectrum and white spaces.
    After detecting the best available spectrum from the collected information, CRNs
    utilize their reconfigurable capabilities. Hence, Reconfigurability is described
    as the ability of CR that can adapt and dynamically adjust their operating parameters
    based on the variations of sensed radio environment to accomplish the optimized
    performance in terms of maximum throughput, high spectral efficiency, minimum
    power consumption, and minimum interference. Learning capability is defined as
    the ability of CR to design and develop the models for making decisions based
    on environmental information. The aforementioned tasks are executed using signal
    processing and ML process in CRNs. Fig. 2 illustrates the cognitive cycle, which
    begins with passive sensing of radio-frequency stimuli and ends with action. The
    cognitive cycle mainly focuses on the three fundamental cognitive tasks [4]; •

    architecture With the advancement in CR technology, any authorized SUs can also
    access and utilize the unused spectrum temporally, which is assigned to PUs. The
    architecture of CRN is shown in Fig. 3 which consists of primary networks (PNs)
    as well secondary networks (SNs). In this architecture, multiple PNs coexist in
    the coverage area of a single CRN. These PNs operate in a licensed frequency band
    known as a licensed network. Each PN consists of many users, and each user can
    only access the spectrum band which is authorized to a specific network. The SN
    involves set of SUs with or without a base station. The SUs do not affect the
    PU transmissions due to the non-intrusiveness of PNs. As a result, the PNs make
    upper limits on the operations of CRNs in licensed bands in terms of maximum power
    levels to ensure that their authorized users will get the desired performance.
    At the other end, SUs are not authorized to utilize the predefined spectrum. However,
    SUs can access the licensed spectrum in an opportunistic fashion. In general,
    opportunistic spectrum access is done through a secondary base station (i.e. fixed
    infrastructure component) that acts as a central controller to the SNs. The CRNs’
    architecture can be classified in the four ways; 2.3.1. Distributed CR networks
    The distributed CRNs are without infrastructure-based networks where no base station
    is available. These networks consist of many SUs that communicate through point-to-point
    communication either in a licensed or unlicensed spectrum band. In the absence
    of a controlling unit, SUs collaborate their spectrum access decision to share
    the available spectrum possibilities among each other. Consequently, a global
    process is needed to decide on spectrum access. Wireless Network after Next (WNaN)
    military testbed of DARPA [39], Cognitive Radio Approach for Usage of Virtual
    Unlicensed Spectrum Bands (CORVUS) [40], and Next-generation Dynamic Access Network
    of DARPA [41], are some examples of such networks. 2.3.2. Centralized CR networks
    In this network, CR base station exists that monitors the transmission of SUs
    in both licensed and unlicensed bands. It collects the sensing information from
    various SUs and takes an optimal decision on spectrum sensing for all users. These
    networks mitigate the effects of fading, improve the detection efficiency, and
    support higher bandwidth. European Dynamic Radio for IP services in Vehicular
    Environment (EDRiVE) [42] and Spectrum Efficient Uni and Multi-cast Services Over
    Dynamic Radio Network in Vehicular Environments (Over DRiVE) [43] are some examples
    of such networks. Download : Download high-res image (406KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Architecture of CRNs. 2.3.3. Cluster-based CR networks
    A centralized unit known as a cognitive-enabled cluster-head (CR-CH) takes CR
    decisions for a small group of CR nodes referred to as clusters. It has various
    clusters, and each cluster has its own CR-CH [44]. Each sensor node of a cluster
    detects, collects, and transmits data to the CR-CH via ISM band. On the other
    hand, the CR-CH sends the detected data to a sink node in real-time over a licensed
    channel in an opportunistic manner [45]. However, for cluster-based CRNs, data
    processing methods including reliable sensing with the distributed medium access
    control, are proposed to achieve an improved and effective cluster-based operation.
    Like centralized CRNs, this network also has drawback of the failure of a single
    node and overhead increment. 2.3.4. Relay-assisted CR networks Relay-assisted
    CRNs can be centralized and distributed CRNs, where CR clusters do not have a
    cluster head. The cooperation among SUs is accomplished by using clustering schemes
    where SUs within clusters are self-coordinated [46]. SU can act as a relay for
    other users to improve sensing performance. When the sensing information is transferred
    by multi hops to reach the targeted receive node, all the intermediate hops are
    relayed. Thus, if both centralized and distributed networks are one-hop cooperative
    sensing networks, the relay-assisted networks can be considered multi-hop cooperative
    sensing [47]. The relay-assisted CRN increases throughput by reducing the path
    loss and by making cooperation among SUs or cooperation among SUs and PUs. In
    CRNs, mainly three types of relay strategies, such as amplify-and-forward (AF),
    decode-and-forward (DF), and compress-and-forward (CF), are used. Some important
    characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of aforementioned various CRNs are
    summarized in Table 2. Table 2. Brief description of the characteristics, strengths
    and weaknesses of CRNs. Type of CR network Methods Strengths Weaknesses Centralized

    Poor performance at low SNR Extra channel required for controlling 2.4. Paradigms
    of cognitive radio The PNs consist of multiple users which experience interference,
    when SUs access the frequency bands of same network in cooperative CRNs. An interference
    is a limiting factor whose value should always be below certain threshold. Therefore,
    four main CRNs paradigms named as; interweave, underlay, overlay, and hybrid,
    are considered to facilitate the efficient utilization of available resources
    to SUs. These paradigms depend on how PUs and SUs share the spectrum between each
    other [7], [48], [49]. These paradigms address the several issues like how the
    coexistence between PUs and SUs should happen and which SUs can occupy spectral
    opportunity. In the interweave approach, SUs can opportunistically access the
    vacant channel for data transmission and have mainly focus on the detection of
    white spaces. Fig. 4(a) illustrates that the coexistence between SUs and PUs does
    not exist. In the underlay approach, PUs and SUs can coexist with each other only
    if SUs have permission to transmit data below a certain threshold and can expand
    their signal over large frequency bands (see in Fig. 4(b)). The key benefit of
    this paradigm is that SUs are not required to wait for the transmission until
    the PUs have made the channel idle. Moreover, SUs can transmit data in poor network
    conditions even while PUs have access to the spectrum. However, SUs must be required
    to restrict their transmitted power to achieve a specific interference limit.
    Nevertheless, keeping the interference below a noise floor level at the primary
    receiver is a difficult task. SUs can access a wide range of frequency bands which
    makes it more appropriate. However, increased complexity is the disadvantage of
    this paradigm that makes the hardware implementation more difficult in CRNs. In
    the overlay approach, SUs must have complete knowledge about the PUs signal and
    its parameters. Fig. 4(c) illustrates how SUs and PUs can coexist and how SUs
    can access the vacant band. SUs must sense the spectrum before transmission of
    data, and detect the available spectrum that is not utilized by PUs. If SU fails
    to detect the available spectrum at the current slot, it will again sense the
    spectrum for the next time slot and keep going on. Whenever PU reappears on the
    current network, the SUs must leave the channel immediately. The SUs can start
    its data transmission at any power level without interfering with PUs, which is
    the main benefit of this approach. However, the requirement of complete knowledge
    about the PU’s signal is the main drawback of this scheme. In the hybrid approach,
    the characteristics of underlay and overlay paradigms are combined to exploit
    the underutilized and unused spectrum bands, which improves the efficiency of
    spectrum sharing and overall throughput of the wireless networks. It allows SUs
    to sense and detect the available spectrum in an opportunistic manner that optimizes
    transmission rate. Fig. 4(d) illustrates a hybrid approach, where SUs can transmit
    data in overlay mode at high power in the absence of PUs and transmit data in
    underlay mode at lower power in the presence of PUs. In [50] two novel methods
    have been presented to analyze and evaluate the performance of hybrid paradigms
    in AWGN channel and frequency selective fading channels. SUs can transmit data

    2.5. Spectrum management framework In CRNs, coexistence between PUs and SUs creates
    some critical problems. To address this problem, CR consists the following features
    that must be performed in spectrum management; • Interference Management: The
    CR can resolve the interference problems caused by PUs by switching its communication
    from one spectrum band to another before the appearance of PUs (Proactive approach)
    and after the appearance of PUs (Reactive approach) in a dynamic environment.
    • Awareness of Quality of Service (QoS): It is necessary to choose a significant
    frequency band among numerous bands in heterogeneous networks to achieve several
    requirements of QoS [9]. The SMF is an important feature of CRNs to address the
    challenges associated with the CR framework. The complete SMF is shown in Fig.
    5, which comprises four main stages; spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    sharing, and spectrum mobility. The initial stage begins with the arrival of SUs
    that sense the spectrum, detect the spectrum holes, and collect the information
    of surrounding parameters such as path loss, switching delay, channel capacity,
    etc. [51]. Once the spectrum holes are detected and necessary information is obtained,
    data transmission begins through a frequency channel. The stages of SMF with its
    features are discussed below [28], [52], [53], [54]; Download : Download high-res

    management framework. 2.5.1. Spectrum sensing Spectrum sensing is the first stage
    of SMF. It allows SUs to sense the channel, identify the available frequency bands
    in terms of its information (such as location and time duration), and detect the
    spectrum holes or white spaces in CRNs. The PU detection, sensing control, and
    monitoring of spectrum are the key features of spectrum sensing. The PU detection
    provides knowledge related to the presence or absence of PU in the channel. The
    sensing control explains how quickly SUs identify the white-space by reducing
    an interference that is generated by PUs. Several spectrum sensing methods to
    identify the vacant or unused channels have been discussed in [27], [55], [56],
    [57], [58], [59]. Spectrum sensing can be performed using various methods such
    as ED [60], [61], CFD [59], [62], CoFD [63], [64], [65], MFD [66] and intelligence
    techniques [32], [67], [68] to identify the unused bands. 2.5.2. Spectrum decision
    Spectrum decision deals with the analysis of spectrum band and decision making.
    It selects a portion of significant frequency band out of the available bands,
    and then SUs decide either to use this band or not. Several optimization methods
    can be used to achieve optimal decisions based on the surrounding environments
    [69]. It includes several features such as spectrum characterization, spectrum
    selection, routing protocol, reconfiguration, link delay [70], and operating frequency.
    The spectrum hole is characterized using several parameters such as channel interference,
    number of PUs, path loss, and received signal strength. The channel selection
    is challenging task in distributed CRNs due to many combinations of spectrums
    and routes between source and destination. The transmission parameters and routing
    protocol are to be reconfigured to obtain optimal spectrum decisions in CRNs.
    In [71], an application and event-based spectrum decision scheme is proposed to
    obtain maximum capacity and minimal variance for real-time application of CRNs.
    2.5.3. Spectrum sharing Spectrum sharing deals with the sharing of the available
    vacant bands, avoidance of collision, and interference among many CRs. It includes
    three major features such as spectrum access, selection of channels, and spectrum
    allocation. The spectrum allocation and power allocation deals with assigning
    of spectrum in cooperative or non-cooperative manner [72]. The authors of [73]
    have proposed game-theoretic auction schemes for spectrum sharing in CRNs. 2.5.4.
    Spectrum mobility Spectrum handoff occurs due to the coexistence of PUs and the
    movement of SUs in the same networks. Generally, SUs behave as visitors to the
    available spectrum. As the PUs reappear in dynamic environment, SUs need to release
    the spectrum immediately and switch to another frequency band. This process is
    refered as spectrum mobility. The main feature of spectrum mobility explains how
    spectrum handoff process can be performed and how to ensure connection management
    among SUs and PUs [73]. The spectrum handoff mechanism starts with the collection
    of handoff parameters, handoff initiation, and handoff execution. A proper connection
    management is required for seamless and efficient handoff in CRNs. However, connection
    management becomes challenging when no centralized unit is present in distributed
    CRNs. There are various spectrum handover techniques available in existing literature
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. In [28], authors presented comprehensive survey on spectrum
    handoff techniques and their technical aspects for spectrum mobility. 2.6. The
    concept of metacognition The term “metacognition”, a well-known topic in human
    learning [25], was first devised by Flavell in the year 1979, and has since been
    investigated extensively. Flavell defined metacognition as a type of higher-order
    thinking that actively monitors and regulates the cognitive processes involved
    in learning [78]. It can be summarized as “knowing about knowing” or “thinking
    about thinking“ or “learning about learning” or “cognition about cognition [79],
    [80], [81]. Metacognition system consists of four aspects; information acquisition
    related to the environment, monitoring of several cognition methods, selection
    of suitable methods to utilize the obtained knowledge, and transfer of learned
    information to new scenarios [80]. Metacognition explains an appropriate strategy
    selection when and how to employs it for the learning and problem-solving process.
    Moreover, metacognition plays an important role in CoR and CR due to its better
    ability to maintain, adjust, and direct a cognitive process. The metacognition
    allows CoR to work dynamically in handling high-dimension optimization problems
    in the wireless context, which makes CoR more robust, reliable, and efficient.
    2.7. Components of metacognition The metacognition process [82] consists of three
    interrelated components; metacognitive knowledge (MCK), metacognitive monitoring
    (MCM), and metacognitive control (MCC) or self-regulation (MCsR). This process
    serves as the master that observes and controls the function of the CE. MCK, which
    is used to begin the cognitive process, assumes that each CE makes its own decisions.
    For example, when the CE has to work in a low power situation, instead of a global
    description, it optimizes the performance and learning abilities of each CE for
    a specific scenario. MCM is the process of monitoring CE’s behavior by evaluating
    and analyzing its performance. For example, MCM helps in the selection of an appropriate
    communication approach for a CE by carefully evaluating channel conditions. MCC
    regulates the thinking of an agent and chooses different CEs depending on the
    radio’s performance. For example, if the CE does not have sufficient resources,
    such as power and time, to assess all the communication approaches, it must be
    needed to remain on the most suitable communication approach. Meta-strategic knowledge
    (MSK) is a part of MCK and can be described as knowledge related to the higher-order
    thinking strategies. The problem-solving ability, classification ability, establish
    and analyzing causal relationships ability, research questions formulation ability,
    hypotheses testing, or variables control ability are examples of such thinking
    strategies. Furthermore, MSK is divided into two sub-categories; 1. knowledge
    about tasks and 2. knowledge about strategies [82] as illustrated in Fig. 6. The
    knowledge related to each task and corresponding performance metrics is stored
    using a metacognitive process. The task category of MSK addresses the requirement
    of the task type, such as what task characteristics call to use the strategy or
    when to use the strategy. The strategy category explains the selection of strategies
    that will probably succeed in achieving the explicit cognitive goal, such as why
    and how to use a particular strategy. Thus, when, why, and how (WWH) to use a
    strategy is addressed in MSK and identified with what Flavell [25] called ‘knowledge
    about tasks’ and ‘knowledge about strategies’ as shown in Fig. 6. Genetic algorithm
    (GAs), fuzzy logic, AI, ANN, ML, RL, case-based reasoning, rule-based reasoning,
    and other techniques are examples of such strategies. The metacognitive engine
    (MCE) regulates the cognition process and improves the ability and efficiency
    of CoR by incorporating MSK with self-monitoring capability, resulting in key
    outcome confidence. Download : Download high-res image (218KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 6. Explanation of meta-strategic knowledge. 2.8. Metacognition
    engine The current CR systems experience some challenges such as self-adaptation
    capabilities and self-awareness [38], [83]. The MCE framework can address these
    challenges inherently. In [84], four different evaluation metrics are presented
    for quantifying the current level of knowledge and evaluating the performance
    of a wide range of different CE algorithms without concerning the radio capability
    and operating scenarios. MCE looks to be a general CE from the outside, giving
    predicted performance outcomes via confidence intervals. On the other hand, MCE
    consists of one or more CEs on the inside. In [84], the authors introduced two
    different implementations of MCE. The first MCE can switch between various CE
    algorithms based on the operating Channel scenarios. For such MCE, two classification
    algorithms are used that can differentiate or select best-suited CE algorithms
    for channel conditions. This MCE exhibits following characteristics [83]; • It
    knows the operating conditions at which individual CE performs well. • It knows
    the excepted performance of individual CE, and resulting in awareness of its performance
    during CE’s selection. • It automates the evaluation and selection of suitable
    CE for the operating scenarios. The second MCE algorithm can adjust its learning
    parameters about the operating conditions and the obtained knowledge state. This
    MCE helps in achieving better performance and a high learning rate as compared
    to individual CE. 3. Spectrum sensing and analysis in CR network The idea of using
    CR technology in different wireless networks is quite appealing due to the potential
    of CR in addressing frequency spectrum scarcity inadequacies. CR can adapt and
    modify its operating parameters such as frequency, time slot, transmitted power,
    and coding type based on the sensed information to utilize the radio spectrum
    effectively. Therefore, spectrum sensing and analysis must be needed to perform
    DSA in future communication system (FCS). In opportunistic spectrum access, SUs
    need to identify the presence of PUs and decide which portion of the spectrum
    is free or not. Different matrices are utilized to make such a decision. One metric
    is to measure the transmitted power at a certain distance from the transmitter.
    However, mobility makes this metric less reliable due to the emergence of new
    interference sources. In order to solve this problem, an interference temperature
    metric is introduced by FCC spectrum policy task force [2] to apply an interference
    limit that receivers can perceive. Generally, interference temperature is described
    as a measure of RF power available at the receiving antenna per unit bandwidth
    [4]. According to FCC, “Interference temperature limit gives a maximum amount
    of tolerable interference for a given frequency band at a specific location”.
    Therefore, the receiver must have an excellent spectral estimation of interference
    temperature. The spectrum efficiency in CRNs can be improved using interference
    fitting by sensing the power spectrum shape. 3.1. Spectrum sensing concepts and
    requirements Spectrum sensing is a key function of CR technology that allows SUs
    to sense and learn the channel properties. CR detects the temporarily white spaces
    and appearance of PUs on frequency channels to avoid harmful interference. The
    temporal white spaces are present for a limited duration when no PUs appear on
    the same network. The concept of spectrum sensing for CRNs is shown in Fig. 7,
    where three channels are mapped to three different networks, each operating at
    a unique frequency band. The SU-1 begins sensing of the channel of network-1,
    identifies free state of channel, detects spectrum hole, and initiates data transmission.
    When PU-1 appears on the same network, SU-1 stops its transmission and leaves
    the current channel immediately. This process goes on until SU-1 does not find
    out a free channel. Once the data transmission gets complete, SU-1 must leave
    the channel for further use by another user. In [7], the author has summarized
    the requirements of several parameters such as time, frequency, angle, code, and
    geographical space in spectrum sensing to decide which of these parameters to
    sense. The spectrum sensing is performed to allocate the spectrum occupancy in
    all dimensions (i.e. frequency, time, and space) and detecting the spectrum hole
    in CRNs [85], [86]. For example, multiple users can use the same frequency channel
    in the same coverage space simultaneously. Therefore, both the parameters frequency
    and time provide helpful information related to the allocation of channels. Because
    of these requirements, several spectrum sensing schemes are introduced that consider
    all the parameters and dimensions. In [85], a hybrid spectrum sensing approach
    and geolocation database framework are developed to identify the spatial–temporal
    spectrum hole in CRNs. The author of [86] proposed a mobile crowd-sensing approach
    to explore and exploit the TV white spaces (TVWS) or spectrum holes for device-to-device
    communication (D2D). This work aims to formulate a location-specific TVWS database
    that allows any D2D link to estimate its maximum permitted emission power in an
    unlicensed digital TV band. Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download

    of spectrum sensing The SU must be ensured about the status of an unutilized spectrum
    and the activity of PUs in CRNs before data transmission takes place. Therefore,
    various sensing techniques have been introduced in literature over the last decade
    to address the associated challenges. These spectrum sensing techniques can be
    divided into three categories (see Fig. 8); NBSS, WBSS, and CoSS. Narrowband sensing
    analyzes single frequency channel at a time. On another end, wideband sensing
    analyzes multiple frequencies channel at a time. These sensing schemes are discussed
    below; 3.2.1. Narrowband spectrum sensing schemes NBSS allows SUs to decide the
    availability of PU over a frequency band of interest. Let us consider two hypothesis
    and , which indicate the absence and presence of PU signal, respectively. NBSS
    schemes can be formulated as hypothesis testing problems to decide whether PU
    signal is present or absent. Mathematically, it is represented as; (1) (2) where
    n denotes the sampling time, y[n] represents the received signals, and w[n] is
    additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) i.e  , and p[n] is transmitted signal. The
    ED, CFD, CoFD, MFD, and ML-based detection are the type of NBSS schemes. Two matrices,
    named as probability of false alarm and probability of detection are considered
    to compute the performance of these schemes, and expressed as; (3) (4) Here, the
    probability of false alarm is the probability of detecting the presence of PU
    signal given that PU signal is actually not present . Thus, a minimum value of
    is preferred, which prevents the underutilization of transmission opportunities.
    Whereas the probability of detection indicates the probability of detecting the
    presence of PU signal given that PU signal is actually present . Thus, a high
    value of is desirable. Based on the classification, each spectrum sensing scheme
    is discussed below; Download : Download high-res image (261KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Classification of Spectrum Sensing schemes. • Energy Detection:
    ED is the most widely used sensing scheme due to its less computational complexity
    and ease of implementation. The receiver does not require any prior knowledge
    related to the PUs’ signal. This scheme is based on the identification of the
    central frequency and energy of the received signal. Fig. 9 represents the process
    of ED scheme, where the power of samples is computed and compared with the predefined
    threshold to decided the status of PUs signal. If the computed energy is greater
    than , the PU signal exists; otherwise, it does not exist. Mathematically, it
    is represented as; (5) Two probabilities matrices are considered to measure the
    performance of detection; (6) (7) The detection probability ( ) indicates the
    presence of PU, which is highly desirable, whereas ( ) denotes the absence of
    PU, which is less desirable. Low detection performance and more detection time
    to detect the weak PU signals are the main limitation of this scheme. In addition,
    it cannot differentiate between the signal samples and noise samples which results
    in highly noise uncertainty [87], [88]. However, researchers have proposed several
    methods to improve the detection performance using dynamic threshold [89], [90].
    ED schemes experience various problems such as fading effect [91], [92], non-linearity
    of receiver [93], [94], and noise uncertainty [95] in hardware implementation.
    In [15], a hardware testbed including SDR, GNU Radio, and USRP, is proposed to
    perform ED-based spectrum sensing, which helps in the understanding of underutilized
    spectrum band and its importance in CRNs. The authors of [96] also designed an
    SDR based hardware testbed which includes GNU Radio as a software platform and
    USRPN210 as a hardware platform to implement ED-based spectrum sensing for 16-QAM
    and 64-QAM transceivers. • Cyclostationary Feature Detection: The concept of CFD
    was first presented in [97]. This scheme depends on the certain characteristics
    of received signals. For example, in communication models, the statistics of transmitted
    signals such as carrier frequency, modulation rate, coding type, symbol rate,
    and pilot signals are periodic due to their periodicity properties, which refer
    to as cyclostationary features. This scheme can distinguish between the noise
    and signals by estimating the spectral correlation function of the signal. Unlike
    an ED scheme, CFD scheme converts the time-domain feature into a frequency-domain
    feature before performing a hypothesis test. CFD scheme can be used as a first
    order detector to utilize the periodicity in the mean of the received signal,
    whereas it can be used as a second order detector to utilize the periodicity in
    the autocorrelation function (ACF). The received signal is cyclostationary if
    the average and autocorrelation of the signal follow the periodicity properties.
    The cyclic autocorrelation function (CAF) of received signal is expressed as (8)
    Where, E[.] represents the expectation operator, represents the time offset, and
    represents the cyclic frequency. Since modulated signals follow the periodicity
    property and noise is wide sense stationary (WSS), the CAF also exhibits periodicity
    in the presence of a primary signal. Thus, CAF can be computed using Fourier series
    expansion known as cyclic spectrum density (CDS) and mathematically represented
    as; (9) The concept of CFD scheme is explained in Fig. 10, where ADC digitizes
    the received signal and computes N-point FFT of these samples. These samples are
    correlated with each other and then averaged over the N-samples are computed.
    This average is then fed to the feature detector to obtain the presence and absence
    of PU via conducting hypothesis testing at the receiver. (10) (11) This scheme
    does not require any computation of noise variance and can distinguish between
    noise and primary signal. As a result, this scheme becomes robust to noise uncertainty
    and provides better detection at a low SNR value. This scheme has a high detection
    rate ( ) and less false alarm rate ( ). However, it has several limitations, such
    as higher power consumption, longer sensing time, and high computational complexity
    compared to ED scheme. A maximum cyclic autocorrelation selection (MCAS) based
    spectrum sensing method has been proposed in [98], [99], where the presence and
    absence of PU is detected by comparing the peak and non-peak of CAF. • Matched
    Filter Detection The matched filter is a linear filter used to sense the availability
    of the spectrum. It can maximize the output signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the
    signal being detected with respect to the noise. The equation of MFD is expressed
    as; (12) Here, is an unknown signal which is convolved with the impulse response
    of the matched filter to maximize the SNR. MFD scheme demodulates the received
    signal , due to which it is required to have detailed knowledge about the PU’s
    signaling parameters, thereby making this scheme optimal for wide sense stationary
    noise. A matched filter can correlate the prior knowledge of PU signal with the
    received signal to identify the availability of PU over a frequency band [100]
    to maximize the SNR in the presence of additive stochastic noise. However, the
    performance of the detector will degrade if the correlated information is incorrect.
    The MFD scheme is illustrated in Fig. 11, where received signal is digitized using
    the ADC. The received samples are then correlated with the pilot samples to determine
    the decision metric, then compared with the threshold to identify the status of
    PU signal by conducting hypothesis testing at the receiver end. If the output
    of the samples is lower than a threshold, then the PU corresponds to hypothesis
    , otherwise corresponds to . The decision metric is expressed as, (13) (14) (15)
    Where, represents the number of samples, is the received sample signal, and denotes
    pilot samples. In [101], dynamic threshold based MFD scheme is proposed to improve
    the efficiency of detection. The MFD schemes have an advantage of optimal detection
    due to the need for few samples. A dedicated receiver is required to demodulate
    each signal which increases the computational complexity. As a result, it becomes
    a challenging task in hardware implementation. In addition, this scheme is susceptible
    to time synchronization error at low SNR values [102]. • Covariance based feature
    detection CoFD scheme detects the availability of the PU signal by using singular
    value decomposition (SVD) and sample covariance matrix of the received signal
    . Generally, the received signal and noise signal have the different statistical
    covariance matrices which can be used to differentiate the desired signal (i.e
    presence of primary signal) from the noise [103], [104]. If the AWGN channel is
    considered, the correlation among the noise samples would be zero at different
    time instances. On other end, the correlation of the signal samples should be
    greater than zero if the data symbol duration is higher than time separation [105],
    [106]. The process of CoFD scheme is shown in Fig. 12. The eigenvalues of the
    covariance matrix are computed using the singular value decomposition (SVD) method.
    Then, the ratio of the maximum eigenvalue ( ) to minimum eigenvalue ( ) is computed
    using random matrix theory [107], [108], and compared with the pre-determined
    threshold level to decide the presence of primary signal between two hypotheses.
    The sample covariance matrix of received signal is estimated by following expression;
    (16) where denotes the samples, and represents smoothing factor. An analysis of
    the covariance matrix-based detection over frequency-selective channel to identify
    the effect of multipath propagation and obtain a high-performance gain has been
    presented in [109]. However, the performance of CoFD scheme degrades in fast time-varying
    fading channels than slow time-varying fading channels. As the smoothing factor
    and overall correlation in the decision metric increases, the detection rate improves.
    As a result, it gives a new insight into spectrum sensing for CRNs and has been
    used in IEEE standard 802.11af to exploit the TV white space or spectrum holes.
    Since the threshold value is independent of SNR, this detection scheme is robust
    to noise uncertainty. In addition, it does not need any prior knowledge about
    the primary signal, noise, and channel. A mean-to-square extreme eigenvalue method
    for a blind primary signal detection without heavy cost has been proposed in [110].

    spectrum sensing The WBSS schemes are applicable only when the signal has a higher
    bandwidth as compared to the channel’s coherence bandwidth (i.e., follow Shannon’s
    sampling law). For example, WBSS schemes are used to exploit spectral opportunities
    in entire ultra-high frequency (UHF) TV band (i.e., 300 MHz–3 GHz) [6], [33],
    [115]. The WBSS schemes split the wide spectrum into many narrow bands and perform
    sensing sequentially. However, they take more time in the detection of PUs. Another
    approach uses multiple sensors to sense the number of narrow bands parallelly
    and perform joint detection called multiband joint detection (MBJD). However,
    this approach is also not feasible due to sensor synchronization requirements
    and hardware costs. On the basis of sampling frequency, WBSS schemes are categorized
    into two ways; Nyquist WBSS and Sub-Nyquist WBSS, which are discussed below; Nyquist
    wideband spectrum sensing. The Nyquist-based WBSS schemes usage standard ADC that
    operates at the Nyquist rate, use to sample the wideband signal. Then it follows
    signal processing approach to identify the available unused band and detecting
    spectrum hole. The sampling spectrum must follow Shannon’s Nyquist criteria stating,
    “The sampling rate must be greater than twice the maximum frequency of a signal
    to eliminate the effect of aliasing.” However, this scheme has several drawbacks
    such as high sensing delay, high computational complexity, more hardware cost,
    and high power consumption, which are undesirable in future communication models
    [116]. To address the aforementioned challenges, several Nyquist-based WBSS schemes
    are discussed in [117]. Taehun et al. [118] proposed a wide-band sensing method,
    where observations across all sub-bands are considered to perform spectrum sensing.
    Several Nyquist-based WBSS schemes, such as wavelet-based detection (WBD), multi-band
    joint detection (MBJD), and filter bank detection (FBD) with their merits and
    demerits are discussed below; Download : Download high-res image (56KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 13. Block diagram of wavelet based detection.
    • Wavelet detection: The wideband spectrum detection can be considered as an edge
    detection problem that identifies singularities near the boundaries of the frequency
    channel. The detected singularities provide essential information related to the
    frequency locations of sub-bands. A wavelet transform (WT) method is a powerful
    tool to detect and analyze the singularities in signals. In [119], a wavelet-based
    approach has been proposed to perform wideband spectrum sensing by splitting the
    frequency band into multiple sub-bands. This scheme detects the irregularities
    in sub-bands and determines the presence and absence of PUs at the receiver end.
    The process of a WBD scheme is illustrated in Fig. 13. This scheme has reduced
    latency as compared to single-band detection. However, dividing each band into
    multiple bands results in some latency, which can be minimized by sensing the
    multiple bands jointly using a filter bank. This approach has many challenges
    such as high sampling rate due to high-resolution ADC, and hardware complexity
    [120], [121]. • Multi-band joint detection: The MBJD schemes can be performed
    using serial sensing, parallel sensing, and wideband sensing. This scheme detects
    the presence and absence of PUs over multiple sub-bands. The process of MBJD is
    illustrated in Fig. 14, where a received wideband signal is sampled using a high-speed
    ADC that operates at a high Nyquist rate. The sampled signal is then fed to the
    serial-to-parallel converter to split into multiple segments and transform into
    a frequency domain using FFT. The energy of the received signal for each band
    is computed in the frequency domain using power spectral density (PSD) [117],
    [122], [123], [124] and then compared with a predefined threshold to decide the
    absence or presence of PU. The probability of detection ( ) and probability of
    false alarm ( ) of each band is computed to evaluate the performance. The main
    aim of this scheme is to find the optimal point that can provide sufficient throughput
    gains, maximize detection rate ( ), and minimize false alarm rate ( ) by optimizing
    the threshold jointly. In [123], WBSS scheme-based MBJD is discussed to find an
    optimal threshold vector, which leads to an efficient utilization of the unoccupied
    spectral segments without interfering with the PUs. In [125], a periodic sensing-based
    multiband sensing-time-adaptive joint detection scheme has been proposed to detect
    the activity of PUs over multiple non-overlapping narrowband channels, which enhanced
    the network’s throughput and reduced sensing time. An optimal MBJD scheme to jointly
    detect the PU over multiple frequency bands has been presented in [122]. This
    scheme has reasonable complexity, but it has limitations of high power consumption
    and an unaffordable sampling rate. To address these limitations, an adaptive multiband
    spectrum sensing scheme has been introduced in [126] that eliminates the significant
    portion of the available channel in the exploration phase, identifying the multiple
    white spaces among available channels in the detection phase. • Filter-bank detection:
    The FBD scheme is a simplified version of multi-taper spectrum estimation (MTSE)
    [127] that estimates the PSD in WBSS [128]. The aim of the FBD scheme is to concentrate
    maximal energy in the given bandwidth. With this scheme, CR utilizes the given
    information to identify the status of the spectrum, whether it is free or occupied.
    When the number of samples is large, FBD is preferred, whereas MTSE is preferred
    when the number of samples is small [129]. Thus, FBD approach [33], [130], [131]
    is one possible way of estimating PDF that can enable an efficient implementation
    of band pass filters (BPFs) by using a poly-phase decomposition of the prototype
    filter. Several filter bank based applications exists in the literature to perform
    spectrum sensing [33], [132], [133], [134], [135]. The process of FBD scheme is
    illustrated in Fig. 15, which comprises a bank of prototype filters (i.e., low-pass
    filter, and each filter has a fixed center frequency [129]. The output of each
    filter is sampled using a Nyquist sampler to compute the energy of the received
    signal for each band using PSD. Further, narrowband sensing is performed to identify
    the presence and absence of PU for each band. Since each filter needs a cutoff
    frequency to block and pass the desired frequency, using several different types
    of single-band detectors is a challenging problem. As a result, the complexity
    and the realization cost of the receiver increased. Sub-Nyquist wideband spectrum
    sensing. The Sub-Nyquist based WBSS determines spectral opportunities over the
    wide-band and refers to the process of obtaining the wide-band spectrum with sampling
    rates lower than the Nyquist rate [136], [137], [138], [139], [140]. In [141],
    compressed sensing is proposed to reconstruct the sensed spectrum for frequency
    bands that are assumed to be underutilized. Therefore, compressed sensing accelerates
    the PU signal detection in wide-band sensing, resulting in an excellent problem-solving
    approach for reconstructing the wide-band signal. Fig. 16 represents the process
    of a sub-Nyquist-based WBSS, where sub-Nyquist sampling is performed to obtain
    some measurements. With these measurements, a signal is reconstructed using inverse
    discrete Fourier transform (IDFT). Further, frequency band localization examines
    sub-bands, followed by spectrum hole detection to decide the presence of PU. The
    CSS, one of the important sub-Nyquist-based WBSS schemes, has been investigated
    as a low-cost WBSS scheme for CRNs in [29], [30], [142], [143], [144], [145],
    [146]. It reduces the hardware implementation cost and speeds up the acquisition
    in CRN. The CSS uses an acquisition and reconstruction-based model to combine
    sampling and sensing processes [146]. The process of CSS is illustrated in Fig.
    17, which comprises three steps; sparse representation, measurement, and sparse
    recovery. In the CSS, each sample is chosen according to its linear functions,
    which results in reducing the data acquisition time. Thus, the CSS is described
    as an effective signal acquisition scheme that reduces the high dimensional signals
    with few measurements. These high dimensional signals must be sparse in a given
    domain. If the signal is not sparse in a given domain, it must be made sparse
    by projecting the signal on an appropriate basis using sparse representation.
    Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and wavelet transform are examples
    of sparse representation techniques. In the measurement process, only a few measurements
    are considered from sparse signals and multiplied with a sensing matrix to compress
    the sparse signal. These compressed signals are retrieved using isometric property-based
    recovery schemes, and then the original sparse signal gets reconstructed [30],
    [144], [147]. Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size

    approach. The CSS is categorized into two ways; distributive sensing and jointly
    sensing. In distributive CSS, data is collected from every node, and sampling
    is performed separately based on the sensing matrix while the signal’s recovery
    is performed jointly. In jointly CSS, the measurements and reconstruction of signals
    are done using the same sensing matrix. Due to the less sparsity of the wideband
    spectrum, CSS helps in improving the reconstruction rate and lowering the wideband
    signals’ complexity. In [148], a cyclic feature detection-based CSS scheme is
    proposed to sense a wideband spectrum. The CSS is divided into two main types;
    one-bit compressive sensing and multi-bit compressive sensing. Download : Download

    spectrum sensing scheme. • One-bit compressive sensing: Most of the communication
    systems need a quantization step before signal processing step which results in
    multi-level quantization errors (MLQE). Therefore, one-bit CS is one possible
    solution to minimize the MLQE [136], [149], [150], [151], [152], [153], [154],
    [155]. A quantizer acts as comparator, which performs one-bit quantization to
    attain level (zero level). Fig. 18 represents the framework of one-bit CS, which
    comprises three stages; sparse representation, one-bit quantization, and sparse
    recovery. This scheme keeps the sign information of measurements and does not
    provide any amplitude related information that minimizes the hardware implementation
    cost. Thus, it requires a sensing method which can compensate for the loss of
    amplitude information. Therefore, in [149], authors imposed a unit -sphere energy
    constraint on the reconstructed signal to reduce the optimization search space
    significantly and enhance recovery performance. One-bit CS reconstruction methods
    can be divided into three categories; Bayesian, regularized, and penalty-based
    algorithm [153]. In Bayesian algorithms, a PDF is applied to the sparse signal
    and noise vector to maximize the likelihood function and acquire the appropriate
    hyper-parameters, which helps in recovering the original sparse signal [155],
    [156], [157]. In the regularized algorithm, a regularization term is added to
    the optimization model to identify the sign violations [158], [159], [160]. In
    a penalty-based algorithm, the penalty function is minimized to retrieve the original
    sparse signal [161], [162], [163]. • Multi-bit compressive sensing: A multi-bit
    CS (MBCS) is used to obtain the sparsity of a wide-band signal. Only a few measurements
    are required to sample high-dimensional signals rather than accessing entire signals.
    The MBCS minimizes the number of measurements that are required to obtain the
    sparse signals. However, this scheme has limitation of noise uncertainty to achieve
    high dimensionality signals. It relies on two principles; sparsity and incoherence.
    Sparsity deals with the requirement of signal that must be sparse in some domains.
    At the same time, the incoherence property that is applied through the isometric
    property is enough for sparse signals. The MBCS comprises three main stages; spars
    representation, sparse measurement, and sparse reconstruction. In sparse representation,
    signals are projected as sparse signals because CS is applied only to sparse signals.
    In sparse measurements, only a few measurements are taken and multiplied with
    the sensing matrix to retrieve the sparse signals. A sensing matrix can be classified
    into two main classes; random and deterministic. The random matrix is created
    using independent or identical distributions such as Uniform, Bernoulli, and Gaussian
    distributions. The deterministic matrix is generated using Chirp, Toeplitz, and
    Circulant sensing. However, the utilization of the measurement matrix in signal
    recovery increases the complexity of the system. Therefore, sparse recovery schemes
    are investigated to reduce the complexity. These schemes are divided into three
    categories; Bayesian, Greedy, and convex and relaxation iterative schemes [29],
    [30]. The convex and relaxation iterative schemes usage optimization techniques
    such as norm minimization and gradient descent to reduce sparse recovery challenges.
    The greedy schemes such as matching pursuit and orthogonal matching minimize the
    processing time and provide solutions iteratively. Bayesian algorithms use Bayesian
    models to gain more attention in sparse signals and finding the optimal solution.
    In [164], the author proposed a Bayesian spectrum sensing scheme where central
    unit is associated with multiple SUs that sense the channel, collects the sensed
    information, and transfers the data to the FC. Based on the collected sensed information,
    it makes a global decision to determine the presence of PU. This process maximizes
    detection rate , and minimizes false alarm rate to utilize the spectrum efficiently.
    The comparison of aforementioned WBSS schemes with their merits and demerits is
    summarized in Table 4. Table 4. Advantages and Disadvantages of WBSS. Wideband

    one-bit compressive sensing. 3.3. Cooperative spectrum sensing Multipath fading
    effects, shadowing, and noise uncertainty degrades the performance of spectrum
    sensing. If the SNR value of a received primary user is significantly less, an
    SNR threshold exists, below which reliable detection is not possible. When there
    is a massive demand for spectrum holes detection, SU must sense the licensed spectrum
    at regular time intervals until it able to find the unoccupied channels, which
    leads to increased access time, scanning overhead, and poor detection efficiency.
    As a result, researchers have investigated the CoSS schemes to address aforementioned
    issues and explain how cooperative sensing can improve spectrum sensing reliability
    and optimize collaborative gain and overhead. CoSS [183], [184] is a crucial technology
    that allows SUs to perform spectrum sensing in a cooperative manner to utilize
    the spectrum efficiently. This scheme considers the benefit of spatial diversity
    and multi-user diversity for enhancing sensing reliability, minimizing false alarm
    rate , and maximizing detection rate ( ). In [185], three main problems related
    to CoSS, such as cooperation method, cooperation overhead, and cooperative gain,
    are identified that need to be addressed. Fig. 19 represents the process of CoSS,
    where each SU performs local sensing and exchanges its sensed information to a
    standard receiver known as FC. The FC can be a base station or a WLAN access point
    that makes a global decision based on the obtained binary decisions of each SU
    to determine the absence or presence of PU. SUs use a soft fusion algorithm (SFA)
    and a hard fusion algorithm (HFA) to transfer sensed information to the FC [186],
    [187], [188]. In HFA, SUs transfer only one-bit information to the FC, which decide
    the availability of PU by comparing the received energy with a predefined threshold
    level. An OR-rule, AND-rule, Majority-rule, and linear-quadratic combining rule
    are the examples of HFAs. The SFAs are implemented using equal gain combining
    (EGC) and maximum normalized energy (MNE). In [188], a CoSS sensing method is
    proposed, where exact energy levels are estimated at each CR devices, which are
    then forwarded to FC to decide the presence and absence of PUs. Further, in [189],
    an optimal linear fusion approach is proposed to perform distributive CoSS through
    semi-definite programming. In this approach, the performance of the likelihood-ratio
    test detector is compared with an optimal linear detector, which yields better
    performance and minimizes the complexity under the conditions of reasonable SNR
    levels. In [190], an SNR estimation-based adaptive CoSS scheme is introduced to
    maximize the detection performance and minimize the sensing cost by selecting
    different sensing schemes adaptively during the local sensing phase. In [191],
    the authors propose transmit and relay-based CoSS schemes for minimizing the probability
    of reporting error over Rayleigh fading channels. In [187] an SDR-based testbed
    using USRP N210s and RTL-SDRs, is proposed to implement CoSS using soft and hard
    fusion approaches in an indoor library environment with different sensing capabilities
    like RF characteristics and sampling rate. Download : Download high-res image

    model for CRNs. 3.3.1. Classification of CoSS Depending on how cooperative SUs
    transfer their sensing information in CRNs, the CoSS can be classified into three
    categories; centralized, distributive, and relay-assisted [183], [192]. In centralized
    CoSS, FC directs all cooperative SU to perform local sensing individually in the
    chosen frequency band of interest. FC collects all local sensing data from each
    user, combines it, and makes a sensing decision to determine the presence and
    absence of PUs using HFAs and SFAs. In distributive CoSS, the SUs communicate
    among themselves, interchange their local sensing information without any central
    unit, and converge to make a global decision to identify the status of PUs using
    some criterion. If the criterion is not satisfied, SUs transfer the sensed information
    to other users, and this process goes on until its convergence, and a decision
    is obtained. The distributive CoSS scheme has many issues such as high power consumption,
    power overhead traffic, and more sensing time. In relay-assisted CoSS, the SUs
    operate in the same frequency band, cooperate, and transfer the information using
    amplify-and-forward protocol. SUs sense and detect the channel by itself. During
    the sensing of the spectrum, if any appearance of PU occurs, SU must release the
    channel immediately. In this scheme, both the sensing and reporting channels are
    not absolute, which means a SU who may suffer from a poor reporting channel has
    observed a strong sensing channel. If SU has a robust reporting channel, it can
    work as a relay to help in exchanging the sensed data to FC from weak SUs. The
    SU, which has reporting channel and sensing channel, can complement and help each
    other in improving sensing performance. 3.3.2. Machine learning techniques in
    CoSS ML is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI), defined as the ability of
    the system to make intelligent decisions from experience without being explicitly
    programmed. The ML-based sensing schemes detect the available frequency channels
    by implementing detection process as a classification problem. The classifier
    may be supervised or unsupervised that decides between two states of each frequency
    channel. Both classifiers extract the features as an energy vectors from the given
    data to train the classifiers and identify available frequency channels. The ML-based
    CoSS schemes can be categorized into three classes; supervised learning (SVM and
    weighted-KNN), unsupervised learning (K-mean Clustering), and RL (QL and TL).
    These schemes perform classification and regression tasks by designing ML models
    in two phases: the training phase and the testing phase. In unsupervised CoSS,
    the feature extraction algorithm extracts features from given data, then fed them
    to the ML model. This model divides data into different clusters, and each cluster
    contains a centroids. These centroids are compared with a predefined threshold
    to decide the status of the channel’s availability. In supervised CoSS, features
    with their labels are fed to an ML model for training purposes. The training process
    helps in finding a decision boundary that can classify data into some classes.
    Based on this boundary, a decision is taken for identifying the status of the
    available frequency channel. In reinforcement learning, a reward function for
    each state–action pair is determined in such a way that the maximum reward is
    achievable. This algorithm tries to solve specific energy consumption and throughput
    problems using an optimal CoSS policy to attain maximum rewards. Various papers
    related to the application of AI and ML in channel selection, spectrum sensing,
    spectrum handoff, and routing process for CRNs have been published in [26], [27],
    [193], [194], [195], [196]. The first application of ML and pattern recognition
    in CoSS has been introduced in [32], where various ML algorithms namely; supervised
    (e.g. SVM, weighted KNN) and unsupervised (e.g. K-means clustering, GMM) are implemented.
    The performance of each technique is quantified by estimating several parameters
    like average time, sample classification delay, and region of convergence curve.
    In [197], author implemented pattern classification schemes (SVM and weighted-KNN)
    to perform CoSS in CRNs by computing the energy level at each CR device. These
    energy levels are considered as feature vectors, which are then fed to the classifier
    to determine the available frequency channel, whether it is free or occupied.
    The classifier divides the presence or absence of PU into positive and negative
    classes accordingly. In [193], authors discussed various learning methods such
    as game theory (GT), RL, neural networks (NNs), hidden Markow model (HMM), and
    support vector machine (SVM) for CRNs, and classified them into two categories;
    feature classification and decision making. The strengths and limitations of aforementioned
    intelligent schemes are summarized in Table 5. In [198], a two-step ML model is
    proposed to perform spectrum sensing in CRNs. In the first step, the K-means approach
    determines the status of PU. In the second step, an SVM classifier assigns the
    new input data to one of the specified classes of the K-means approach used in
    the first step. Due to optimized decision regions in feature vector space, the
    ML-based CoSS schemes have better detection performance as compared to traditional
    CoSS. However, CoSS schemes experience cooperation overhead problems that lead
    to more sensing time, security issues, and more power consumption. Consequently,
    good CoSS schemes are needed to improve the cooperative gain and control the cooperative
    overhead. In [199], a novel ML-based CoSS method is proposed to minimize the cooperative
    overhead by keeping the collaborative gain unchanged. Here, the concept of user
    grouping was added to the ML-based model that maximizes the detection rate. The
    authors of [200] have proposed Bayesian learning-based CoSS scheme to improve
    cooperative overhead and sensing accuracy under both perfect and imperfect sensing
    reports. The clustering-based CoSS is performed in two ways; inter-cluster CoSS
    and intra-cluster CoSS. In this scheme, the cluster head (CH) is decided based
    on the sensing information of individual cluster members, which is then transferred
    to the FC to make a global decision using Bayesian fusion. Further, RL schemes
    [201] are used to improve the performance of spectrum sensing in dynamic CRNs.
    Generally, RL schemes like Q-learning [202], T-learning [203] and multi-arm bandit
    (MAB) [204] are applied in dynamic surrounding to maximize the rewards. In [205],
    authors proposed an RL-based CoSS approach for CR users to determine the scanning
    order of channels and selection of neighboring partners. The Q-learning algorithm
    determines the scanning order of channels which minimizes scanning overhead and
    access delay. The author also proposed a discounted upper confidence bound (D-UCB)
    based cooperation partner selection algorithm to improve the detection efficiency.
    The author of [16] proposed an RL and TL algorithm-based testbed using GNU Radio
    and USRP to implement spectrum handoff mechanism in real-time CRN, and achieve
    an optimal solution. In order to study the interference management in cognitive
    femtocell networks, an Q learning approach based testbed, includes GNU Radio and
    USRP, is also proposed in [18]. An overview of CoSS using different methods are

    [214] CoSS Deep learning and convolutional neural network (CNN) A CNN-based deep
    cooperative sensing, where multiple users have cooperation, is proposed to detect
    PU, which may occupy multiple bands at same time. 4. Estimation of primary user
    activity The licensed users’ network can operate in any spectrum ranging, depending
    on the different wireless technologies involved [215]. Since wireless technologies
    use a wide variety of spectrums, a single PU activity model cannot capture the
    PUs’ activities of all wireless technologies. Thus, the modeling of PU activity
    is needed so that SU can predict the future profile of PUs by learning ability
    from their past spectrum utilization. PU activity modeling also plays a vital
    role in developing communication protocols for CRNS. For instance, once we know
    that a PU prefers a specific channel and tends to utilize it for an extended period,
    that channel is less likely to be accessible for an SU. Thus, sensing on that
    channel would not be preferred. Thus, PU activity modeling improves CRNs’ performance
    and effectively utilizes the spectrum. Various PU activity models have been proposed
    to estimate the PU activity in dynamic spectrum access [215], [216], [217], [218],
    [219], [220], [221]. In [215], the author provides a comprehensive survey on the
    PU activity modeling for CRNs, where various PU activity models have been classified
    in various classes such as Markov processes, ON/OFF processes, Queuing theory,
    and time series. In [218], the author investigated the performance of ED-based
    spectrum sensing in terms of and for opportunistic spectrum access scenarios with
    the help of SU. Here, the PU signal is assumed to be dynamic that can switch from
    active to inactive (i.e., ON to OFF) transmission at random time instances and
    modeled as a two-state random process using a Markov chain. The PU activity is
    supposed to be independent of the sensing intervals of SU. However, no assumption
    is considered related to the number of PU signal changes during the sensing interval.
    But, in [220], multiple status switching for PU signal during the spectrum sensing
    interval is considered, which causes significant degradation in the sensing performance.
    When SUs have sufficient information about the PUs’ traffic distributions, they
    can reduce the delay time between the channel switching from ON to OFF state or
    vice versa. In addition to this, they predict the behavior of PUs to limit interference
    or identify an appropriate PU channel sensing sequence. As a result, SUs must
    estimate the traffic distribution of PU and correctly classify the PU traffic
    from a set of possible distributions such as Exponential, Poisson, Binomial, and
    Gamma distributions [217]. However, in [219], PU traffic classification is performed
    using a maximum likelihood classifier and multi-hypothesis sequential probability
    ratio test classifier to estimate PU activity (busy) and inactivity (idle) periods.
    In [216], the authors proposed a method to formulate the problem of spectral power
    allocation as a potential function that uses parameters derived from the behavioral
    analysis of the PU’s activity. The proposed method aims to reduce channel reallocation,
    reduce interference between PUs and SUs, and increase available spectrum opportunities
    in CR wireless sensor networks. 4.1. The classification of PU activity model The
    classification of PU activity models used in CRN is shown in Fig. 20, where classes
    are categorized based on the Markov process, ON/OFF process, Queuing theory, and
    Time-Series process. These activity models are briefly discussed below; Download

    Classification of primary user activity model. 4.1.1. Markov process-based PU
    activity models Markov process is a stochastic random process that describes a
    sequence of possible events where the probability of each event depends only on
    the state attained in the previous event. When the process is in the state , there
    is a fixed probability that it will next be in state , which is expressed as,
    (17) In this activity model, generally two states, namely 0 and 1 are considered,
    which indicate the non-occupancy and occupancy of the spectrum by PUs. When PUs
    do not occupy the spectrum, SUs are allowed to access the spectrum. In literature,
    different types of Markov process-based PU activity models are used, such as the
    Two-state Markov chain, Three-state Markov chain, Hidden Markov chain, and Semi-Markov
    models. 4.1.2. Queuing theory-based PU activity model In literature, M/G/1 and
    Bernoulli’s process-based model are used for modeling PU activity in CRNs [215].
    The M/G/1 queuing theory model is an extension of the M/M/1 queuing theory model
    that represents the queue length in a system with a single server. The M/G/1 queuing
    process can model the activity of PUs with an arrival rate of packets per seconds
    and service time of , where represents the average medium access delay. Bernoulli
    process is a finite or infinite sequence of binary random variables that take
    only two values, either 0 or 1. In CRNs, the PU activity can be modeled using
    Bernoulli process where the channel has mainly two states 0 and 1. State 0 represents
    the non-occupancy of PU, whereas state 1 represents the occupancy of PU. 4.1.3.
    ON/OFF periods-based PU activity models ON/OFF periods based PU activity can be
    modeled using the ON/OFF and block activity models. The ON/OFF model is widely
    used as a two-state Markov chain model where ON state corresponds to a Busy state
    and OFF state corresponds to an Idle state. The Block activity model is developed
    to capture the random ON/OFF periods of PU activity, where each block is split
    into parallel Gaussian-Mixture channels [222]. In this model, PU channels are
    assumed to be under-utilized, and transmission of PUs and SUs are considered to
    be slot synchronous. During Slot time, a channel can be in one of the ON or OFF
    states [223]. 4.1.4. Time series-based PU activity models When the radio spectrum
    is sampled at the fixed time interval, time series analysis can be used to analyze
    the spectrum occupancy in the GSM network using an Auto-Regressive Integrated
    Moving Average (ARIMA) model [224]. Here, the Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) model is
    used to analyze the GSM downlink band occupancy data due to the randomness in
    seasonal patterns from one cycle to the next. 4.1.5. Miscellaneous PU activity
    models In addition to the aforementioned PU activity models, some more models
    such as Bayesian-based, Machine Learning-based, Energy and Power detection-based
    spectrum occupancy, and First-difference filter clustering-based model are also
    used to determine the PU activity in CRNs. In CRNs, Bayesian models are used to
    model probabilistic spectrum utilization dependencies. In [225], [226], the authors
    proposed an approach that enables several CR devices to observe the available
    pattern of PUs and used the Bayesian technique to estimate the distribution of
    PU activity patterns. The learning-based model such as ANN, multilayer perceptron,
    SVM, RNN, and deep learning predicts the future idle times of PU activity in CRNs
    to access the dynamic spectrum efficiently. The ED-based schemes are mainly used
    for sensing the spectrum. At the receiver end, a threshold detector is used to
    compare the output with a predefined threshold to detect the presence or absence
    of PU. In power-based detection for spectrum occupancy, power is allocated to
    a spectrum band to determine the activity of PU, whether it is present or not.
    5. Metacognitive strategies for spectrum sensing and spectrum sharing Due to spectrum
    scarcity, the coexistence between radar and wireless communication has recently
    received a lot of research attention. In this context, a metacognitive radio (MCR)
    framework for efficient utilization of spectrum has been proposed in [227]. In
    this model, cognitive communication system senses the channels continuously and
    obtains the channel state information (CSI). Further, the concept of MCR is enlarged
    to a broad MCE, which can be applicable to wide range of applications [83]. In
    these studies, only first three aspects of metacognition such as the acquisition
    of knowledge, monitoring, and appropriate methods selection are considered. However,
    the fourth aspect (i.e. transferring of learned knowledge to a new environment)
    along with first three aspects of metacognition in radar framework has been considered
    in [228]. Fig. 21 illustrates the operation of MCE, where six steps explain the
    entire process. • First, the past experiences and learning results are used as
    prior information to generate an expected performance estimation. • Second, the
    prior information and chosen CEs’ real-time data are fed to a performance characterization
    module to update knowledge metrics and performance of CE. • Third, the most suitable
    CE for each operating scenario is determined by comparing the available CEs using
    the Best Cognitive Algorithm Classification (BCAC). • Fourth, the radio’s operating
    objective and the current channel conditions update the current operating scenario.
    • Fifth, the MCE chooses the most suitable CE strategy based on previously collected
    MCK to update the present operating scenario. • Sixth, the selected CE algorithm
    controls the communications link so that the operating conditions will not change.
    Once the link adaptation gets complete, the CE feeds its performance data to the
    characterization block to update CE’s performance and knowledge metrics, and then
    this process is repeated. Download : Download high-res image (216KB) Download

    Metacognitive radar for DSA Metacognition explains how the spectrum is shared
    between radar and communication systems, which is an important concern related
    to additional bandwidth demand for the growing wireless communication industry.
    However, the coexistence between radar and communication system takes place in
    both cooperative and non-cooperative manner. In non-cooperative coexistence, spectrum
    is accessed dynamically in real-time which creates spectral scenario awareness
    of EME. A fundamental MCoR model (see Fig. 22), built on software-defined radar
    (SDRadar), is proposed in [229]. The objective of this model is to perform DSA
    between radar and communication systems. It employs three components; MCoR-knowledge,
    MCoR-monitoring, and MCoR-control to form an engine similar in [230]. The MCoR-knowledge
    describes the learning capabilities and performance of each CoR strategy to a
    specific scenario and also highlights when and how the strategy is executed for
    an observed situation. The MCoR monitoring process is used to classify the operating
    scenarios based on the surrounding observations using different CoR strategies
    such that the appropriate CoR strategy provides better results. The MCoR-control
    describes how to regulate the learning process to implement CoR strategies. The
    MCoR-control task reviews the efficacy of specific CoR strategies, during operation
    of radar and identified at what time switching takes place to a new strategy.
    In Fig. 22, passive sensing collects the sequence of I/Q time-domain samples within
    frequency band at which radar operates. However, the radar must remain turned
    off during the sensing period while passive sensing is performed. The given spectrum
    is discretized into number of points which are represented as . The power spectra
    for frequencies is computed using Fourier transform. This process is repeated
    times on non-overlapping data to make a set of non-overlapping power spectra.
    Once the spectral category is determined, a subset of CoR strategies is chosen
    to implement radar. The MAB problem-based formulation is developed to achieve
    convergence to the most advantageous CoR strategy, which provides great radar
    performance over time. The MAB problem [231], [232] is used to study the problem
    of exploration v/s exploitation, and trade-off between them is balanced by RL
    techniques. In exploration, MCoR engine sequentially samples the CoR strategies
    to measure performance. Based on the measured performance, exploitation selects
    the most appropriate strategy, which can yield the best performance. The spectrum
    is continuously monitored in the exploitation phase to change activity in each
    coherent processing interval (CPI). The performance of radar is evaluated based
    on several metrics like signal-to-interference plus noise ratio (SINR), probability
    of detection, radar range, etc. In [233] jointly maximizing SINR metric evaluates
    the radar performance, and range resolution is determined by multi-objective optimization.

    Fig. 22. Block diagram of metacognitive radar for DSA. Various MCoR models based
    on SDRadar have been proposed in [229], [233], [234] to perform dynamic spectrum
    sharing between radar and communication systems. In [233], authors proposed spectrum
    sensing multi-optimization (SS-MO) scheme to solve the issue of DSA using SDRadar.
    This radar contains a source computer and USRP to sense, analyze, and take a decision
    inside the CPI. In [234], CoR, built on a SDR platform, designed to perform spectrum
    sharing in real-time using a PAC process. 5.2. Cognitive radar strategies Several
    CoR strategies for DSA have been investigated in [229], [231], [232], [233], [234],
    [235], [236], [237], [238], [239], [240], [241], [242], [243], and each one has
    its pros and cons for different spectrum conditions. In [244], [245], authors
    investigated how CoR modifies waveform parameters in order to maximize target
    tracking and recognition. Martone et al. [246], provides the current state of
    research and advancement in RF coexistence between radar and communication systems
    with their dual functionality in spectrum sensing. The concept of coexistence
    for radio and radar is a two-step process that has been intensively explored in
    [247], where EME needs to be characterized first using spectrum sensing and then
    followed by schemes that can dynamically access the spectrum. The ED, MFD, and
    spectral correlation sensing schemes are used to detect the activity of other
    RF sources, which tried to access the same band that is assigned to radar [248].
    In [233], author proposed a bioinspired filtering scheme to minimize the computational
    complexity of SS-MO, and also proposed an alternative of weighted sum multi-objective
    optimization (SWMO) scheme as Fast-SWMO (FSWMO) that can refine the spectral information
    by clustering low-and-high power interference regions. Radio and radar can use
    the refinement techniques [249] for any RF application. However, refining techniques
    cannot accomplish the optimal performance due to the avoidance of the SWMO optimization
    criterion. The FSWMO strategy combines the multi-objective optimization with refinement
    methods to accomplish an optimized solution with less complexity. Further, several
    CoR strategies such as fast spectrum sensing (FSS), stochastic approach, RL-approach,
    spectral notching, and game theoretic approach are executed in the exploitation
    phase [229] to achieve effective spectrum sharing. The aforementioned CoR strategies
    can alter the radar waveform from pulse to pulse and from CPI to CPI, and formulated
    as PACs which consists of three steps; • RF spectrum sensing • Power spectrum
    processing • Decision making and suitable action execution 5.2.1. Fast spectrum
    sensing FSS strategies discretized power spectral into “sub-bands” to generate
    refined spectral data on which each CoR strategy depends [233]. FSS determines
    the low-power RFI and high-power RFI regions and each region corresponds to sub-band.
    These sub-bands represent a new and refined power spectra that replaces the spectrogram
    with labeled input of each CoR technique. In this strategy, the average power
    spectrum is initially computed from the spectrograms to identify available sub-bands.
    The FSS strategy mitigates RFI and processes sensed spectrum during radar operation
    [233], [234]. The radar monitors the EME in passive manner between pulses to determine
    the sub-bands within the CPI and generate a power spectra. The center frequency
    and instantaneous bandwidth of available sub-bands are then chosen for radar operation.
    However, the FSS processing and passive sensing stages, used for spectrum categorization
    and radar operation, are the same, but they occur at different time instances.
    The FSS facilities efficient processing and minimal latency during radar operation,
    resulting in fast implementation of PAC. This strategy has an advantage of not
    being influenced by interference sources or RFI signal modulation. FSS can be
    used in either MCoR monitoring process or MCoR Control operations, and both. 5.2.2.
    Stochastic approach The stochastic approach is used to mitigate RFI during spectrum
    sharing. This approach estimates the probability of available frequency sub-bands
    using an alternating renewal process (ARP) model [235]. The ARP model is trained
    very quickly compared to others and considers RFI statistics over a short interval.
    This model is trained from the information of spectrogram, creating sub-bands
    statistics based on the parametric and non-parametric variations. This model computes
    the likelihood of available frequency band for a given spectral environment. This
    function computes the probability of unused frequency sub-bands depending on the
    identified RFI states. The edges of the unused frequency sub-bands are identified
    using a threshold. The non-overlapping sub-bands above the threshold are then
    concatenated to obtain the maximum available bandwidth. 5.2.3. Reinforcement learning
    The RL method considers the surrounding of CoR as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
    The MDP is basically a mathematical tool that guides the process of ML using human-defined
    rewards [250]. Several factors (i.e., set of states and actions observed by the
    radar, the state transitions, and the reward function) are used to characterize
    the MDP process. This reward function maps the states and actions pairs to numeric
    rewards value. The main objective of RL approach is to determine a policy , which
    a radar can use to take action based on observable states. This policy can be
    determined directly using a dynamic programming approach and indirectly using
    a function approximation. In [239], MDP approach is proposed to resolve the coexistence’s
    issue between radar and communication, and applied Deep-QL to accomplish radar’s
    optimal performance. However, the dimensionality of MDP is very high due to the
    large state space. This dimensionality of the simulated learning issue is reduced
    in [239], but it requires a sufficient training period. Once the training period
    gets completed, learned behavior can choose the CR waveform with minimum complexity.
    5.2.4. Spectral notching This strategy notches the transmit waveform at certain
    frequencies instead of changing the central frequency and bandwidth. It uses spectral
    shaping optimization to create a random FM waveform with a fixed modulus in the
    time domain. This technique includes an enforced spectral mask having notches
    based on the response of FSS. The depth of the notch is determined by specific
    shaping optimization scheme and the number of required iterations. RF spectrum
    can be exploited without notched regions over the entire bandwidth, which is the
    key benefit of this strategy. 5.2.5. Game theoretic approach This approach is
    used to examine the interaction between an intelligent target and an intelligent
    MIMO-radar so that it can make a decision in conflicted and cooperative environment
    between rational players. In [251], several performance objectives are modeled
    as different games based on the knowledge present at the jammer and radar about
    each other, and then MCoR chooses the most suited approach among all for the scenario.
    6. Impact of user/node mobility in wireless communication networks Spectrum management
    mechanism ensures data transmission by controlling operation efficiency between
    the primary and secondary networks. Mobility management is an important factor
    in wireless communication networks where different nodes, such as drones, mobile
    IoT nodes, smart devices, etc, coexist and share spectrum with other RF systems.
    Different wireless networks such as Mobile ad-Hoc networks (MANETs), Wireless
    mesh networks (WMNs), Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), Unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs)-aided networks, Vehicular CR networks (VCRNs) exists, where node or user
    mobility plays a vital role in optimizing the design and performance of wireless
    communication networks. When the mobile user changes its location from one node
    (or cell) to another, it needs an effective network management operation to support
    the communication [28]. The number of handoffs due to this user mobility is proportional
    to the velocity of users and the intensity of base stations (BSs). Depending on
    the movement of the mobile device, handoffs may be of two types: (i) inter-system
    handoff or vertical handoff and (ii) intra-system handoff or horizontal handoff.
    User mobility directly impact the following aspects in wireless networks [252];
    • Location management such as location area planning, data location strategies,
    and database query load. • Resource management aspects like multiple access approaches,
    channel allocation approach, network capacity estimation, signaling and traffic
    load estimation, user’s quality of services, etc. • Radio propagation aspects
    like interference level, signal strength variation, and call dropping rate. MANET
    is a self-configuring network of mobile nodes linked together through wireless
    links to form an arbitrary topology. The mobile nodes are free to move randomly.
    Hence, the network’s wireless topology is unpredictable and may change rapidly.
    In [253], user mobility is used as a network transport mechanism for sending packets
    between nodes and allowing devices to make better routing decisions in MANETs.
    This user mobility provides minimal latency and significantly improves memory
    and power efficiency. In a realistic scenario, when user mobility is considered,
    the average received power acts similar to shadowing effects and influences performance
    metrics such as bit error rate, capacity, outage performance, and physical layer
    security [254]. Furthermore, as wireless communication moves to the millimeter
    band, the influence of user mobility becomes more prominent as cell radius reduces
    due to significant path losses. In [255], the author described the impact of random
    user mobility on ED-based spectrum sensing and the performance of communication
    systems over fluctuating two ray fading (FTR) channels. UAV communications mainly
    occur in unlicensed spectrum bands of 2.4- and 5.8-GHz, where UAVs may suffer
    from security threats and attacks that affect the transmission of confidential
    information. Due to the increase in the number of wireless devices, the unlicensed
    spectrum is becoming overcrowded, and UAVs will experience a shortage of spectrum.
    Thus, sharing the licensed spectrum used for cellular communications with UAVs
    can significantly improve communication performance [256]. UAV communication can
    share its spectrum band with terrestrial communication networks, known as air-grounded
    spectrum sharing [257]. However, air-grounded spectrum sensing has several challenges
    like location uncertainty, energy consumption uncertainty, and security due to
    UAV’s mobility. Since user locations affect the large-scale path-loss of communication
    links, the location uncertainty results in channel uncertainty. 7. Research challenges
    and future direction CR technology has a potential to play a vital role in the
    next generation “smart-radio” and future generation networks (e.g., 5G and 6G)
    to optimize the spectrum utilization dynamically. CR works in various radio environments,
    where it may have partial or complete CSI, or sometimes it is unknown about the
    surrounding. Additionally, several factors such as quantization errors, channel
    estimation errors, and variations in channel create a problem in achieving adequate
    CSI. In this paper, we have presented state-of-the-art survey about research on
    spectrum sensing in CRNs. Still, specific challenges need to be addressed, which
    are described next. 7.1. Narrowband sensing The ED schemes suffer from a fixed
    threshold problem because noise has a tendency to change randomly with time in
    such channels. Due to fixed threshold, it cannot detect the weak signals below
    a certain threshold. Furthermore, CoFD-based schemes need significant processing
    power that is not available in mobile devices. The MFD schemes are impractical
    because prior knowledge related to PU signals is not always available. Further,
    advanced sensing schemes like CFD can accomplish a high detection rate, but they
    suffer from high complexity. Therefore, more research is needed to minimize the
    complexity so that these schemes will become appropriate to implement on real-time
    hardware. 7.2. Wideband sensing High-speed computing processors, high sampling
    rate and high-resolution ADCs are required to perform WBSS. With such requirements,
    maintaining complexity and minimum computation cost is a challenging task. Several
    challenges such as high latency, detection reliability, and wideband RF-front
    end are also associated with WBSS. In order to minimize latency, SUs must use
    wideband architectures that can explore multiple frequency channels at the same
    time. Moreover, SUs must have the information related to PU transmission and sense
    the spectrum at regular intervals, which necessitates a low-complexity approach
    that can save power, but its realization is a challenging task. The receiver sensitivity
    is a critical aspect for accomplishing reliable detection. However, achieving
    a better receiver sensitivity using wideband architectures is a challenging task.
    In order to accomplish high sensitivity, a high dynamic range standard ADC, followed
    by digital processing, is an alternative method to perform WBSS. However, standard
    ADC consumes more power which is a challenging task. Designing of low complexity
    wideband RF front-end is also another challenge due to the requirement of a large
    number of elements and the need for timely presetting of filter bandwidth. 7.3.
    Compressive sensing The significant challenges related to CS are hardware implementation,
    exact and approximate sparsity level estimation, design of sensing matrix, noise
    uncertainty, recovery uncertainty, and RIP proof. For sparsity estimation (SE),
    the signal must be in sparse nature. However, signals can be approximately sparse
    in practical scenarios [146], [258], [259]. In SE, achieving prior information
    to consider the number of measurements in a highly dynamic wireless environment
    is challenging. Moreover, SE can increase the sensing time and complexity of compressive
    wideband sensing (CWS). Unknown sparsity level [260] will be used to perform CWS
    in future CR systems. However, developing blind sub-Nyquist WBSS is challenging
    because no prior information related to wideband signal sparsity for spectral
    reconstruction is available. The sensing matrix design or the number of measurement
    selections is another challenging task. However, implementation of the random
    matrix in practical scenarios is also challenging due to its unstructured nature
    and randomness in its elements. As a result, the design is highly complex, costly,
    and needs more storage. Therefore, WBSS schemes are required to choose an appropriate
    number of measurements intelligently without knowing the sparsity level beforehand.
    It can be considered as an open research area that needs to be investigated. Noise
    uncertainty is another challenging task in WBSS schemes due to requirement of
    fixed threshold detector [261], [262]. In addition to noise uncertainty, interference,
    channel uncertainty, and imperfections could also degrade the performance of CSS
    schemes in real scenarios. Therefore, WBSS based future research must be focused
    on improving the detection performance. The CSS schemes also have a high reconstruction
    time. Therefore, it is required to investigate the impact of skipping the recovery
    process on the detection performance to reduce the reconstruction time. Future
    communication systems are expected to operate at very low SNR values where CSS
    techniques are usually inappropriate. In this context, extending existing work
    done to estimate efficiency [263], [264] can be regarded as a future research
    scope. The limitations of conventional CSS can be overcome using one-bit CSS.
    However, the applications of one-bit CSS in WBSS require more research. 7.4. Cooperative
    spectrum sensing The CoSS schemes have various challenges such as PU hidden problem,
    sensing time, security, and decision fusion in spectrum sensing. PU hidden problem
    occurs due to the multipath fading, shadowing effects, and noise uncertainty.
    As a result, SU cannot detect the presence of PU.  Sensing time duration is another
    challenge because spectrum sensing must be performed within a specific time interval
    to perceive the activity of PU. The specified constraint restricts the execution
    of classical spectrum sensing schemes and creates a real-time design problem for
    CRNs [7].  Security issue is also a challenge of CoSS that has constantly grown
    interest. In CRNs, a malicious user can modify its parameters, hide its original
    identity, and take the form of an existing PU signal in a hostile environment
    to deceive the spectrum sensing schemes. The behavior of this user is refereed
    to as PU emulation (PUE) attack [265]. The spectrum sensing data falsification
    attack [266] is another attack, where a malicious user provides a negative report
    to the FC or other users to make confuse about the presence of PUs and disrupts
    the final decision. Thus, new sensing techniques must be required to strengthen
    the security of CRNs and make them more resistant to malicious attacks. Decision
    fusion is an important challenge in cooperative detection. In CoSS, collecting
    sensed information from the neighboring SUs is a challenging task because any
    SU in a CRNs could refuse to collaborate with the FC. 7.5. Metacognitive radar
    challenges The main aim of federal agencies (FCC and NTIA) is to provide fast
    and efficient reliable communication services that require some standards and
    rules. However, designing a radar system to meet these requirements is challenging
    task for radio developers. This design constraint may limit the ability of planned
    radar products to identify and locate frequency dependent targets, which results
    in performance degradation. The lack of frequency spectrum flexibility reduces
    the detection and target tracking ability of radars in time-varying and congested
    situations. Further, FCC has released of spectrum band to mobile and fixed wireless
    communication both [267], but still it is a challenging task to implement these
    regulations and find out which frequency range will be affected. The radar itself
    can cause interference, which is a well-known issue with ultrawideband radars
    interacting with external RF sources [268]. Joint radio and radar spectrum sharing
    methods have been investigated to coexist within a specific frequency band of
    interest to address the challenge of accurate estimation of RFI [269]. Bandwidth
    sharing methods are one of the possible solution to permit radar to access more
    bandwidth as required within the specific frequency band [270]. Future radars
    must have an ability to detect and avoid RFI from other sources and adaptation
    ability to change the frequency in real-time with QoS. When no cooperation policy
    exists, there may be a possibility of interference between the communication systems
    and radar transmissions directly or indirectly due to coexistence of multiple
    users within allotted fixed spectrum. However, it is not always clearly realized
    how various services might interfere. To address these challenges, advanced technologies,
    such as adaptation and mitigation of emissions in the time, frequency, space,
    polarization, and coding domains, might be possible for better spectrum utilization
    for the coexistence of diverse services. In [239], radar environment is considered
    as MDP and used DQN methods to demonstrate how radar can select the optimized
    action depending on offline training data. However, the computational complexity
    grows exponentially as the number of states, actions, and memory increases. For
    large states, convergence is a challenging task because of not finding an optimal
    policy. Thus, the DL approach enables RL to scale the decision-making problem
    such as high dimensional states to solve these challenges, which can be considered
    for future scope. In radar, high-range operation is a challenging task due to
    the attenuation in rainy and cloudy environments. In [246], authors considered
    both cooperative and non-cooperative coexistence between radar and communication
    system. Some autonomous methods are required in non-cooperative radar sharing
    to access real-time spectrum in dynamic environments that are challenging. The
    DSA techniques use auxiliary information (i.e., spectrum sensing data) and automatically
    allowed radar to adjust its parameters with changing environments. The PAC implements
    the DSA strategies that propose specialized waveform diversity. However, strategy
    selection for changing scenarios and real-time radar performance is a challenging
    task in CoR. The growing demand for additional bandwidth requirements is also
    a challenging task in the radar system. This issue is resolved by introducing
    metacognition in the radar system on a SDRadar platform. However, while implementing
    CoR on a SDRadar platform, a trade-off between bandwidth and reaction time is
    required, which is also a challenge. This trade-off is analyzed using different
    DSA strategies like FSS, stochastic approach, RL approach, and spectral notches.
    However, these strategies also have some challenges. In [234] FSS approach experiences
    co-channel interference during its implementation in a wireless environment. This
    interference may occur when the frequency hopping waveform is not combined with
    a specified spectral mask. Designing radar signals in a spectrally congested environment
    is another challenging task. This issue can be resolved by adding spectral notches
    to the radar waveform [271]. This spectrally compatible waveform reduces RFI to
    other RF emitters and maximizes the available bandwidth. However, the appropriate
    estimation of the bandwidth of this waveform is another challenge. Further, several
    challenges are associated with the systematic evaluation of CEs’ performance.
    Firstly, an inappropriate selection of several parameters, including channel characteristics,
    operational objectives, learning methodologies, and radio abilities, affects CE’s
    performance. Secondly, an appropriate selection of CoR strategy to evaluate the
    performance of CE effectively in given scenarios (i.e., operating objectives and
    channel conditions) is also a challenging task. A “learning curve” methodology
    that represents the learning rate of CEs graphically can address this challenge.
    The detection of the operational environments and their correlation also affects
    the performance of CE. Predictability is also a challenge for CoR, when it operates
    in a given operational range. 8. Conclusion CR and CoR is a key technology to
    handle the challenges related to spectrum access. Spectrum sensing process is
    an important aspect of CR and CoR which detects an available vacant spectrum in
    an opportunistic manner. This survey compiles a study of various spectrum sensing
    methods and DSA methods in wireless networks. This paper highlights the most recent
    advancements and challenges in CR technology related to different spectrum sensing
    methods. It includes the fundamentals of CR, different paradigms of CR, complete
    SMF, and a detailed classification of spectrum sensing schemes. The increased
    awareness of spectrum sensing opens up new possibilities and also poses new challenges.
    To address these challenges, AI and ML-based spectrum sensing methods have been
    summarized with their strengths and limitations. This paper also describes the
    progression of CR engines from cognition to metacognition. The latter is explored
    in CoR and will play a vital role in next-generation wireless networks such as
    5G and 6G, where the DSA approach is used to share the spectrum. Radar and communication
    system spectrum sharing is still in its early stages of development but it can
    grow tremendously over the next decade. This paper discusses several challenges
    associated with CEs and provides a solution to address these challenges. Apart
    from this, it also explains the complete details of MCE components with their
    operations. Overview and scope for future work on various CoR strategies used
    for spectrum sharing and radar coexistence in dynamic environments has been presented.

    : Various spectrum sensing techniques have emerged to enhance the exploitation
    of the spectrum, including matched filter based detection (MFD), cyclostationary
    feature detection (CFD), waveform-based detection (WBD), eigenvalue-based detection
    (EBD), and energy detection (ED) [2]. These techniques are generally classified
    according to the information required to operate [3,4]. For example, those that
    require specific data from the signal waveform are called information-based techniques.

  description: The Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) has been developed to fulfill the
    high needs of future wireless communication systems (5G). Rapid use of wireless
    communication services has made a huge demand for spectrum and bandwidth allocation.
    Proper spectrum sharing and efficient usage of spectrum are the two ways to meet
    the necessary demand. This Cognitive Radio Technology makes use of these two ways
    to improvise the bandwidth utilization and achieve better quality of services.
    To maximize the spectrum utilization, the Cognitive Radio is adapted with various
    other combining techniques. By properly designed with Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA), multihop cognitive radio is the best approach to provide better bandwidth.

    Abstract: The Cognitive Radio Network (CRN) has been developed to fulfill the
    high needs of future wireless communication systems (5G). Rapid use of wireless
    communication services has made a huge demand for spectrum and bandwidth allocation.
    Proper spectrum sharing and efficient usage of spectrum are the two ways to meet
    the necessary demand. This Cognitive Radio Technology makes use of these two ways
    to improvise the bandwidth utilization and achieve better quality of services.
    To maximize the spectrum utilization, the Cognitive Radio is adapted with various
    other combining techniques. By properly designed with Dynamic Spectrum Access
    (DSA), multihop cognitive radio is the best approach to provide better bandwidth.

    Coimbatore, India SECTION I. INTRODUCTION Conventional wireless devices rely on
    a policy known as \"static spectrum access\" when the licensed user is making
    use of radio frequency spectrum that has already been allotted to them. Unlicensed
    bands of the ISM (Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) [1] spectrum are set aside
    to promote the development of wireless technology. The Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) has stated that licensed spectrum bands are being used in an
    inefficient manner (FCC). To meet the demands like high bandwidth availability
    and better usage of spectrum by unlicensed users, Proposals have been made for
    Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). Primary Operator (PO) and Secondary Operator (SO)
    are both unlicensed users in this proposed Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). If PO
    is not using the channel, this unlicensed user may access the principal operator''s
    spectrum [5]. So equipping the SO in the physical layer along with Cognitive Radio
    (CR) is the major requirement of DSA and thereby CR has to check for the availability
    of PO in the channel [6]. Periodic sensing has to be carried out to prevent the
    PO from transmission of SO [5]. The spectrum of PO which is available temporarily
    is determined as Spectrum Opportunity (SOP) or white space. When the main operator
    is absent, the [specific secondary operator] may take up the area that would otherwise
    be occupied by the primary operator [6]. In resolving the spectrum shortage in
    recent years, many new technologies like Small Cell Technology (SCT), Smart Antennas
    (SA), Spectrum Agility (SA), Millimeter Wave Technology (MWT), Spectrum Sharing
    and Regulatory (SSR) models have been developed [8]. Radio Knowledge Representation
    Language (RKRL) is a new language used by Software Defined Radio (SDR) to boost
    wireless system flexibility. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and
    the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) regulate the allocation and use of
    radio spectrum. By dynamically switching between unoccupied spectrum, CRT takes
    advantage of accessing locally unused spectrum [7]. To connect an enormous number
    of heterogeneous objects, many challenges are being faced by next generation communication
    technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and VANET paradigm. To overcome
    these difficulties, new radio technologies and network architectures must be developed
    to cater to a wide range of future devices with high connectivity needs.. Radio
    communication systems'' frequency spectrum assignments must take bandwidth and
    an applicant''s needs into account in order to reveal an efficient spectrum use.
    The CRT must be adopted and controlled properly in order to achieve high reliability
    and performance. Its agnostic paradigm for communications makes Cognitive Radio
    an attractive option for the Internet of Things. If you''re dealing with a lot
    of busy traffic, you''ll find this advanced paradigm ideal. In wireless access
    networks, collisions and excessive congestion are common when diverse items are
    linked through radio channels. Cognitive Radio eliminates these issues. Cross-layer
    spectrum-aware routing is the primary goal of this study. Increasing throughput
    while reducing latency and overhead are all goals of the new system. In order
    to make advantage of the available spectrum gaps, the routing protocols must be
    aware of them. It is possible to foresee these gaps in the spectrum in advance,
    allowing for more rapid and dynamic decision-making. Consequently, the forecast
    should be more precise and trustworthy. Predictor-based routing is intended to
    withstand the dynamic nature of spectrum mobility and node mobility [34]-[38].
    SECTION II. COGNITIVE RADIO TECHNOLOGY The heterogeneous wireless architectures
    of Cognitive radio network along with DSA results in high bandwidth provision
    to mobile users. However, the CR network has issues owing to the dynamic nature
    of the available spectrum, which has a wide range of QoSdemands.Such challenges
    are addressed by improving various spectrum management functions that results
    in a new network paradigm [9]. The cognitive and reconfigurability capabilities
    of cognitive radios are what allow these radios to be used in today''s contexts.
    For cognitive radio, this means the ability to sense and gather information about
    various aspects of the surrounding radio environment, such as how well a transmission
    is performing and the type of network it is connected to, as well as its geographic
    location and security policies, in order to make the best possible spectrum use
    and transmission method decisions [10]. As a result, the best available spectrum
    band is allocated to secondary users thanks to cognitive capabilities and dynamic
    sensing of the cognitive radio environment. The ability to adapt the rapidly changing
    operational parameters in the radio spectrum to achieve optimal performance is
    termed as Re-configurability. This enables the radio to dynamically adapt and
    program based on the radio spectrum environment. Such dynamically programmed CRs
    transmit and receive upon various frequencies and utilize various transmission
    technologies with its configured hardware design [9]. This enables the CR to achieve
    the highest possible performance in terms of channel availability by combining
    cognitive capabilities with reconfigurability. Cognitive radio users make active
    use of the licenced spectrum via the following functions: spectrum sensing, spectrum
    decision-making, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility [10]. Spectrum sensing
    is a critical feature of CR since it ensures that secondary operators utilize
    only the unused section of the spectrum.Aspects of spectrum sensing, such as sensing
    control, are performed. Coordination of PO detection [10]. In spectrum decision,
    the secondary operators have the capability to decide the available spectrum from
    a huge amount of spectrum available depending on the best QoS. This decision can
    be made successfully by spectrum reconfigurability and spectrum selection based
    on the information available [11]. Efficient spectrum sharing has to be made depending
    on the need of the user and cost incurred in the spectrum usage. Based on architecture,
    behavior of the spectrum and spectrum access technique, spectrum sharing are classified
    [11]. The spectrum sharing in CRN can be designed as centralized or decentralized.
    There are many different criteria and measurements for spectrum allocation that
    are sent to a centralized body, which builds an allocation map of available bandwidth.
    No central authority exists in the spectrum sharing scheme. If the PO needs the
    channel, then the SO has to leave the channel even if the SO is using the channel.
    This progress of switching the channel during communication is known as spectrum
    mobility [11]. Spectrum handoff and connection management are the two important
    functions performed by spectrum mobility. Proactive and reactive spectrum sharing
    are the two major spectrum handoff mechanisms. In proactive spectrum sharing,
    switching is made faster because before the start of transmission, the SO selects
    their target channel and when an undesirable condition occurs, hand off is performed.
    Whereas the reactive spectrum handoff does not target the channel but selects
    the target channel only when link failure happens [12]. The algorithm is less
    complex but results in significant degradation in the QoS of on-going transmission.
    Thus it is mostly adopted when the primary user triggers the spectrum usage. SECTION
    III. SYSTEM MODEL The core network and the cognitive radio network make up the
    system.Itis referred to as a licenced network since the government has given the
    main users authorization to operate in a certain spectrum band. Main base stations
    control the majority of user activity in infrastructure-based primary networks.
    The anticipated presence of unlicensed users on the primary network should have
    no effect on the operations of primary users. The system is composed of two networks:
    the core network and the cognitive radio network. It is referred to as a licensed
    network since the government has given the main users authorization to operate
    in a certain frequency band. Main base stations control the majority of user activity
    in infrastructure-based primary networks. The activities of main users should
    be unaffected by the projected presence of unlicensed users on the primary network.
    The Cognitive radio network includes secondary users who do not have a license
    to operate in a licensed frequency. As a consequence, CR users'' operating models
    must have additional features in order to share the licenced frequency band.One-hop
    connections are provided to all users of the CR network via the base stations.
    Additionally, spectrum brokers are included in this CR network to help distribute
    the available resources among many CR networks [13]. The Cognitive radio network
    includes secondary users who do not have a license to operate in a licensed frequency.
    As a consequence, the operating model must have additional features in order for
    CR users to share the permitted frequency band. All users of the CR network are
    connected in a single hop through the base stations.Additionally, spectrum brokers
    are included in this CR network to help distribute the available resources among
    many CR networks [13]. CR network can be of two types namely infrastructure based
    and infrastructure less i.e. Ad-hoc. Diagrammatic representation of CR ad hoc
    network architecture is shown in Fig. 1. In multihop CRN architecture, the ‘M’
    PO operates in a specific licensed band for communicating with primary receivers
    and ‘N’ Secondary Operators. Once the data is made available, the SO start their
    communication through unlicensed bands in a perfect manner. Each SO is associated
    with the Data Communication channel (DTC) for data exchange and Common Control
    channel (CCC) for control information exchange. Control channels are used for
    transmitting negotiation, synchronization and control packets. The SO can improve
    their probability of data delivery through the following process. Exploiting the
    spectral occupancy for deploying adaptive spectrum sensing.Choosing the appropriate
    intermediate relay nodes for reliable data forwarding. Decision on the choice
    of the channel selection among the available channel list. Fig. 1 Ad-hoc network
    architecture for cognitive radio Show All A. Cross Layer Model: Figure 2 depicts
    the suggested work''s consideration of cross-layering between the lowest three
    levels of CRN, which is one of the most significant requirements of CRN. In the
    physical layer, a variety of tasks including spectrum detection, data transfer,
    and control packet receipt take place. The requirement is to keep the false alarm
    rate Pf to 0.1 and the probability of detection Pd to 0.9 in order to safeguard
    the PO from SO transfer. The minimum sensing time per channel and the number of
    channels to be detected determine the sensing length. The amount of time it takes
    to collect data for each channel is dependent on the kind of sensor being used.
    Energy detection (ED) is thought to be a co-operative sensing approach because
    of its reduced computational and implementation needs.. To determine whether or
    not there is transmission on the detecting channel, ED compares the signal power
    to a predetermined threshold. As a result, the ED approach fails to distinguish
    between PU and SU as the cause of channel activity [4]. Due to this, the transmission
    of SUs during the sensing interval is halted. [9] At the conclusion of each sensing
    phase, the physical layer provides the Spectrum Decision Block (SDB) with a collection
    of idle channels from distinct spectrum bands. For each wireless channel, a new
    set of physical layer characteristics (e.g., transmission power, bandwidth, carrier
    frequency) must be set to match the spectrum used. The physical layer receives
    extra input from the SDB, in the form of reconfiguration parameters. All accessible
    channels are considered to have the same transmission power. One-hop neighbors
    and their channels are listed at the network layer. As well as physical distance,
    CRN''s topology is determined by the presence or absence of common channels between
    nodes. SDB collects data from three levels in this manner and utilizes the channel
    selection algorithm to choose the optimal channel for each hop along the journey.
    The network layer utilizes the channel selection to construct the route, and the
    link layer uses it to establish the reconfiguration settings for the physical
    layer. Fig. 2 Cross Layer Model Show All The process of making a spectrum choice
    must be carried out in a variety of circumstances. Phases of route discovery,
    route maintenance, and increased channel availability are all included in this
    process. SECTION IV. SPECTRUM PREDICTOR MODEL 1. Genetic algorithm based back
    pack neural network(GA-BPNN): BPNN is basically a neural structure that eliminates
    the error rate in the backward distribution ratio. This BPNN along with GA will
    result in an optimized neural structure with minimized error rate [14],[15]. The
    predictor is trained to predict under known input-output values and tested with
    dynamic inputs to test its accuracy. The predictor makes use of the recent PU
    Channel status information i.e. utilization information and predicts the future
    condition of the spectrum which are under consideration. Based on the result of
    the predictor, spectrum sensing is performed only on those frequency channels
    which are predicted to be idle [16]. Fig. 3 GA-BPNN predictor model Show All BPNN
    is designed with the configuration as p-l-m (i.e) input layer configured with
    p neurons, output layer with m neurons and intermediary layers known as hidden
    layers with l neurons [20]. The input and the output of the input layer/output
    layer is given as x1, x2, x3,…..xp and y1, y2, y3,…..yp respectively as shown
    in Figure 3. Back propagation algorithm is considered to be an expensive algorithm
    with respect to computational time [21]. This leads to investigating algorithms
    that result in less computational time and also converge faster to the global
    solution in the search space. 2. Gravitational Search Genetic Algorithm(GSGA):
    GSA suffers from premature convergence susceptible to local optima. The population
    of GSA loses its ability to explore the search space to find the global maxima.
    A combination of the global searching power of GA and the local searching power
    of GSA yields a solution in the shortest amount of time possible. The velocities
    and accelerations of the particles are used to keep them current [22]. GSA is
    then joined with GA to generate GSGA, which executes GA''s mutations, selection,
    and crossovers on GSA''s population of genetic material. As a result, the population
    is likely to be skewed in terms of solution diversity. Convergence is determined
    by the standard deviation of the fitness function and the maximum number of iterations.
    A population-based approach employs the algorithm, which makes use of a variety
    of particles of varying masses. In order to find the particle''s optimum position
    in the search space based on gravitational force, the masses communicate information.
    GSA is founded on Newton''s theories of gravity and motion. F d xy (t)=G(t) M
    ax (t)X M by (t)/ D 2 xy A x (t)= F d xy (t) M x (t) (1) (2) View Source Where
    MaxMax is particle x coupled with an active mass of gravitational attraction.
    MbyMby is the passive gravitational mass linked to y. G(t) is the gravitational
    constant, Dxy is the Euclidean distance, Ax(t) is the acceleration, and Mi(t)
    is the inertial mass in this equation. Four attributes of particles in the GSA
    are specified: their position, their inertial mass, their active gravitational
    mass, and their passive gravitational mass [27]. In BPNN, weight adjustment is
    solved using the particle''s position, and the particle''s gravity and inertia
    masses are calculated using a fitness function. Because each atom has a solution,
    the approach is led by suitably modifying the gravitational and inertial masses.
    The heaviest mass attracts the most attention since it provides the best answer
    in the search space. The predictor model finds the available free channel list
    that can be used by the sensing module. The Back Propagation algorithm suffers
    from terminating at local maxima and to minimize the error, gradient descent search
    technique is employed. Genetic Algorithm results in a better solution that finds
    the global maxima by the principle of \"Survival of the fittest\". The capability
    of the GSA algorithm is to share the knowledge about the solution with others
    and be able to find the best global solution. The GSGA algorithm will be deployed
    in each secondary user node for the system model considered. In the proposed simulation,
    50 to 150 nodes are considered and the GSGA is deployed for varied nodes with
    maximized epochs. The secondary operator performance is improved with the aid
    of GSGA algorithm by accurately predicting the future channel occupancy status.
    The secondary user improvement is given by the Equation 3 [27]. To decrease the
    time used by the spectrum sensing module, the suggested approach only selects
    and senses the idle channel.To decrease the time used by the spectrum sensing
    module, the suggested approach only selects and senses the idle channel. Hence
    the total energy spent for spectrum sensing is reduced by the amount of energy
    spent per busy channel for the idleness and is given by the Equation 4. S O improve
    =(( C WP − C WOP )/ C WOP )∗100 S O energy =( C WP − C WOP )∗energy per channel
    (3) (4) View Source CWOP represents the number of unpredicted channels that have
    been detected and in multi-channel scenarios, the number of channels that are
    detected CWP following prediction using GSGA model for a certain time period.
    This method eliminates the need for considerable past data on the PU channel''s
    state throughout the forecast procedure. Based on the mass attraction principle
    in GSA the convergence speed of the algorithm is improved and due to the GA operators,
    the entire search space has been explored for the solution within a short duration.
    The model predicts the spectrum available for the secondary users to improve their
    sensing results with reduced time and energy. Simulations are used to evaluate
    the model''s accuracy, and the results reveal that the suggested method is more
    accurate at forecasting channel occupancy. SECTION V. SIMULATION RESULTS AND PERFORMANCE
    EVALUATION The data selection for training and testing ensure the properties of
    stratification and homogeneity. Accuracy may be quantified using a variety of
    different metrics, including true positive, true negative, false positive, and
    false negative measurements. The proposed predictor is compared with the BPNN
    model. The following metrics are used for the performance analysis. S n =True
    Positive Rate(TPR)= True positive True positive+False negative False Positive
    Rate(FPR)= False positive False positive+True negative S p =1−FPR= TP FP+TN Positive
    Predictive Value(PPV)= TP TP+FP False Discovery Rate= FP FP+TN Success Rate= TP+TN
    TP+TN+FP+FN View Source The suggested GSGA model''s correctness is evaluated using
    the Root Mean Square Error (MSE), Recall, Precision, Fall-out, and Overall success
    rate. MSE is a commonly used statistic to evaluate models [28]. The difference
    between the model''s predicted value and the goal value is used to calculate it.
    Fig 4. Performance comparison between GSGA and BPNN Show All Figure 4 shows the
    comparison of GSGA with BPNN based on Root Mean Square values. It is noticed that
    the GSGA model outperforms the BPNN model with the least amount of error. Fig
    5. Channel occupancy of BPNN and GSGA over target value. Show All The Figure 5
    clearly depicts that BPNN achieved channel prediction nearer to the actual value.
    The figure stands as a justification in proving that the proposed GSGA based BPNN
    computation for the channel prediction is more close to the actual value of the
    prediction than BPNN in most of the test cases. Figure 6 depicts the graphical
    representation of the suggested channel usage effectiveness. As a result, the
    GSGA protocol is expected to provide better channel usage than existing protocols
    like BPNN. As a result, it is obvious that the suggested GSGA protocol has a lower
    packet delay, a higher delivery ratio, a lower packet loss rate, and a better
    throughput than BPNN and standard protocols, indicating superior performance.
    Fig 6. Comparison of channel utilization Show All The spectrum awareness is achieved
    through the predictor models to improve the performance of the secondary users
    by reducing the time in sensing the busy channels. Cross layer information exchange
    is implemented to accommodate the spectrum knowledge sharing between sensing and
    routing modules. Spectrum aware routing among secondary users with better spectrum
    utilization and optimized route selection with enhancement in the performance
    of the Multihop cognitive radio networks has been achieved. SECTION VI. CONCLUSION
    To attain higher throughput with minimum delay and overhead, spectrum aware routing
    protocols have been proposed with a cross layering method. In multihop Cognitive
    Radio Network, the proposed model also employs maximum channel utilization. Our
    proposed predictor model namely GA-BPNN and GSGA helps in predicting the available
    idle channels before the sensing of Secondary Operators. This SO makes use of
    the predicted channel for their data communication. Overall success rates of prediction
    are stimulated between the proposed GSGA and other conventional prediction algorithms.
    The simulated results show the exact channel availability status. Our proposed
    GSGA model depicts the status of the channel at higher accuracy than the conventional
    BPNN with faster speed of convergence. Routing protocols are also designed to
    maintain the routing functionality. In BPNN, the optimal nodes are selected based
    on GA algorithm to move the data from source to destination and also to control
    the flooding of data packets. BPNN protocol shows better performance in terms
    of higher throughput, low delay and better channel utilization but raises overhead
    issues. This drawback of overhead issues is majorly handled by GSGA routing protocol.
    This GSGA makes efficient searches to fix the best root available and ranks all
    the other channels. When a channel is unavailable, this rating is useful. When
    compared to BPNN and other traditional approaches, the GSGA performance study
    indicates improved throughput and channel usage. Authors Figures References Citations

    IEEE Conference Location: Chennai, India SECTION I. Introduction (Heading 1) Wireless
    Communication provides a reliable communication in networking. The advanced Wireless
    communication is the 4G expertise. The next generation network is named as 5G
    technology. Cellular phones, Global position system transceivers, Isolated Controls,
    ZigBee, and Wireless Fidelity, etc. are explicit of the radio link systems. The
    demand on Wireless communication increases day by day, which leads to network
    traffic. The cellular user''s upsurges unconventionally, have occasioned in a
    substantial necessity for quicker speeds. Just the pertinentfoundations consumers,
    often stated as users, have admittance to the complete band in this position.
    For the secondary users it is not possible to use that spectrum. Not much of the
    spectra is utilized most of the times. A few of the spectra frequencies range
    are empty, lightly populated, under or over utilized. Band administration is inflexible
    when it comes to dealing upon each Connectivity provider who is given a single
    licensing in a specific band. Finding unoccupied frequencies in the spectra to
    implement new services and enhance prevailing ones is tough. To incredulous this
    dispute, Cognitive Radio Networks has been introduced. It is a technology that
    has the facility to intellect the ecological circumstances, and is absolutely
    aware of its purposeful capabilities and operating constraints [1]. This performance
    appears like an auspicious resolution for perceiving and exploiting the accessible
    vacant spectrum. Cognitive Radio Systems can comprehend various languages of Wireless
    networks and it can acclimatize itself to the situation for forthcoming verdicts.
    The CR is a development through an enlightening field of investigation, wherever
    any device can unpredictably detect the usual circumstances, and the inter relate
    strictures might be recognized suitably. The first sectors of CR systems are indispensable
    establishments and psychological officialdoms. The vital association encompasses
    of the primary client (PU), and the psychological organization contains the supplementary
    client (SU). Cranium clients of the association are illustrious as the sanctioned
    clients, and the clients at the subsequent level are apparent as the unrestrained
    SU. Cognitive Radio Networks consists of two components named as Principal networks
    and Perceptive networks. The Principal network contains of primary users, and
    the Perceptive networks contains of tributary users (SU). The principal users
    are deliberated as accredited user and the ancillary users are deliberated as
    un accredited user. The CR network overlays the technique for ancillary users
    to exploit the unused spectra bands of the principal users [5]. The assembly of
    CR expertise trusts on Software-defined radio (SDR). CRN delivers prospects for
    Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). DSA is a procedure that delivers a virtuous concert
    of communication for the entire grid scheme. SECTION II. Literature Survey Ananda
    kumar and Uma maheswari [2] [3] functioned over a data allotment classical for
    scattered obstruction discovery frameworks. In this model, every person ID in
    the organization utilizes total whole (CUSUM) alongside its nearby information
    and relates a nearby commencement to patterned if inconsistency consumes remained
    illustrious. Unique advantage of exploiting CUSUM calculation stood which can
    burn-through fewer registering possessions, creating it truthfully sensible for
    the potentials of reserve inhibited. Swami and Zaho [7] investigated the spectra
    assignment method and suggested four quantities to illustrate together present
    moment and extended haul range conferral execution; that connects upkeep likelihood,
    the quantity of range handover, exchanging postponement, and non- finishing likelihood.
    The probability mass capacity and a normal numeral of spectra handing over were
    inherent expansion through scrutinizing and settled band admission procedures.
    Spectra assignment methods were anticipated to consider the essential and optional
    client''s conjunction and backing for portrayal and improvement of cognitive radios
    organization. Akyildiz et al. [17] in born possessions and stream investigation
    trial of range association in cognitive radio systems were overviewed. Specifically,
    that analyzed innovative spectra association functionally, for example, spectra
    detecting, spectrum tenacity, spectra involvement, and spectra adaptability. Numerous
    examiners were by and by associated with building up the communication innovations
    and mannersneeded for CR organizations. Be that as it may, to achieve spectra
    receptive announcement, more research is fundamental alongside the band zone.
    Mishra et al. [18] proposed that power appreciation is a straightforward and important
    detecting technique that was customarily consumed by Cognitive Radio; nevertheless,
    detected exposition potency would be corrupted by the subordinate conventional
    SNR. The situation taken was revealed that an organization of steady cognitive
    radio with various disappearing situations since the objective can obligate a
    superior possibility of recognizing the principal user on the off chance that
    they embraced agreeable range detecting. Every CR detected PU self-governing and
    afterward progressed its noticed energy measurement to an organizer which can
    consolidate all contracted insights from cognitive radios by choice or information
    combinationthrough the occurrence of principal user. SECTION III. CRN Architecture
    Framework CR systems and framework Cognitive radio networks are the two types
    of CR network infrastructure as shown in Fig. 1. During a framework-based CRN,
    the Cognitive userdoes have a ground station (BS) that is a centralized control
    component in cellular systems; thus, the CR user is quite well regulated by a
    MAC device. The CRN allows users to connect with one another on either legal or
    unregulated bands inside an ad hoc manner in the infrastructure-free CRN. According
    to FCC, bandwidth seems to be either under-utilized or congested in certain bandwidths.
    The cognitive radios propose a robust customizable adaptive resource mechanism.
    In this method, the system discovers the surroundings on its own and meets the
    person''s requests, allowing the connection settings to be changed. A common CRN
    climate comprises of various Primary Radio Networks (PRNs) that coincide inside
    the equivalent geological zone of a solitary CRN. An essential organization is
    a current organization that is authorized to work in aspecific range band. Henceforth,
    an essential organization is likewise alluded to as an authorized organization.
    Fig. 1. Crn architecture Show All Essential organizations can either be founded
    on a unified foundation or circulated specially appointed in nature. The clients
    of an essential organization can just access the range authorized to this specific
    organization. Essential clients have need with regards to range get to and work
    as they are the sole clients of their authorized range. Consequently, essential
    clients don''t furnish any sort of participation with the optional organization.
    SECTION IV. Hand Over Procedures for CRN The handover procedure in a cognitive
    radio network is an effective process is shown in radio cycle of CRN as given
    in the Fig. 2. During a handover procedure the unlicensed user has to empty the
    frequency band as soon as the licensed user comes to occupy it. This process forces
    the termination of the unlicensed user. At the time of the handover the interference
    is likely to occur between the frequency''s spectrum. An effective handover strategy
    is likely to be effective between the channel handover procedure duration and
    the activities of the users. It is a time-consuming procedure. First the handover
    request details are sent by the user and the radio environment is checked. The
    connection is been established and the initialization process takes place by a
    user activity tracker. Then the channel behavior is been observed by a channel
    handover manager. The waiting process takes place in between if there is any error
    in the connection. This can even lead to the termination of the connection. If
    not so, then the user activity coordinator is been initiated by resetting the
    connection. The structure will change according to the surroundings of the stations.
    This will increase the output of the lessening of the assignment technique. The
    stages in the abdication technique in cognitive radio network are spectrum management,
    spectrum utilization and spectrum sharing. Fig. 2. Crn radio cycle Show All A.
    Spectrum Management Today the wireless systems are considered by a stationary
    spectra strategy. The limited obtainability of the spectra and incompetence in
    the spectra procedure dictate the new announcement pattern. The greatest challenge
    in the cognitive radio network is incorporation of utility in numerous sheets
    of the etiquette stack which consents the intellectual radio systems to interconnect
    with consistency over a vibrant or operative band situation. Spectra slums are
    one of the spectacles that can be effortlessly pragmatic when the accredited users
    are obtainable and obtain the data. In real time application the intellectual
    wireless has to portion a frequency amongst a principal bringer and a principal
    receiver. There is some detection which we need to focus on: Non-Cooperative Detection
    This method is useful in ensuring the cognitive network organizes rendering to
    the indication it sanities and the information that is statistically and informatively
    pre-encumbered. Accommodating Recognition The perceptive radio recognizing is
    accomplished by the various radio systems inside the rational system. Spectra
    Handover The intellectual radio disperses the evacuate spectra from principal
    handler to subordinate user. The spectra organization diminishes the interfering
    among the principal subordinate operator. A ration of anomalies and complications
    transpire while apportioning the band. B. Spectra Exploitation The spectra exploitation
    is asymmetrically disseminated that can origin difficulties in the apportionment
    of spectra and organization. Every time an accredited handler is perceived formerly
    the intellectual radio evacuates the frequency. This progression is christened
    as spectra flexibility or handoff. The LEO satellite is recycled to resolve the
    problem of agilityof spectra. C. Spectra Allotment The unused spectra are dispensed
    to the subordinate user by the intellectual radio from the principal user as extended
    as it prepares not use it. This is called as spectra allotment. There are two
    types of spectra partaking. Triggered spectra allotment: The accessibility of
    wireless spectra accessibility with low signal strength is what causes the interfering
    temperature will raise above its pre-determined levels. In underlying dynamic
    spectra, the licensed handheld radios can detect undesirable signals that are
    below distortion and disturbance level in order to spread the unregistered transmission
    more than a wide squad of spectra. Overlay spectrum sharing: The unlicensed users
    utilize a spectrum ofband for the fraction of time where this band is under-utilized
    by the licensed users in Overlay Spectrum sharing technique. SECTION V. Threshold
    Optimization Rapid increase in demand for wireless communication leads to allowing
    more unlicensed users to transmit their signals in to principal manipulators licensed
    bands to progress the exploitation of spectrum. Discovery of Principal user constructed
    on subordinate user develops very multifaceted when the SNR value develops negligible
    as the frequency band upsurges. To evade this problematic, cooperative spectra
    identifying can be pragmatic with CUSUM process. For examining the gesture efficiency
    AWGN is additional to signal. A. Spectrum Sensing Approach As per the survival
    of principal user in a spectra and promptly departure the incidence band is the
    determination of subordinate operator. The goal of principaluser is circumventing
    the meddling to qualified users. There are two spectra sensing tactics: Shortest
    frequency-dominion methodology - Shortest signal-created spectra apportionment
    is conceded. Indirect time-domain methodology Spectra – apportionment achieved
    expending autocorrelation of the gesture. Energy Detection over AWGN Channels.
    Shortest frequency-dominion methodology - Shortest signal-created spectra apportionment
    is conceded. Indirect time-domain methodology Spectra – apportionment achieved
    expending autocorrelation of the gesture. Energy Detection over AWGN Channels
    It conveys the preliminary signals from all principal users. By adding all conventional
    signals at the handset, the signal variety is intended. The energy spectra compactness
    of signals is appraised by utilizing periodogram occupation. At last, the typical
    energy in a signal is intended by charming the integration of the PSD over a convinced
    incidence band. B. Energy Detection Over AWGN Channels It conducts the preliminary
    signals from all principal users. By addition all conventional signals at the
    receiver, the signal choice is considered. The energy spectra density of signals
    is projected by expending periodogram occupation. At last, the average energy
    in a signal is intended by captivating the integration of the PSD over a convinced
    frequencyensemble. C. Probabilities of Detection Following parameters are used
    for spectrum sensing: Recognition probability (Pd) - designates that the accredited
    user is obtainable. This feature would be at its supreme as it shelters the principal
    user from meddling. False alarm probability (Pfa) - designates the principal user
    is inattentive. This feature ought to be at its lowest in order to upsurge the
    spectra exploitation. D. SNR Selection The ratio of SNR obtained is referred as
    signal-to-noise. The formula: SNR=P/[sigma(n)]^2 where sigma is standard power
    on auto-correlation. Assortment of Inception Bases on low power to noise ratio,
    inception of the principal user can be designated. Thus the inception value attained
    needs enrichment to condense thepower to noise ratio assessment which would be
    due to ecological influences. E. Cooperative CUSUM Algorithm It is the performance
    used for inspection rehabilitated detection; hence the invented procedure everything
    on the origin of stations power to noise ratio taxation. Perceived power to noise
    ratio can monitor variations in assessed power to noise ratio, that sources lessening
    of intrusion to licensed users and upsurge in spectra convention of subordinate
    user. SECTION VI. Simulation and Results Cooperative CUSUM algorithm is a spectrum
    sensing algorithm, has the abilityto monitor the detection changes in the frequency
    spectrum. It is achieved for implementing the handover process in CR. For 1000
    number of channels, channel allocation is achieved by band imperfect AWGN along
    through the discrepancy equals 1. Then the A WGN signal with power to noise ratio
    tenets are engaged as both positive and negative values like 15db and −15db respectively.
    Cooperative CUSUM algorithm implementation depends on the establishing of collective
    amount of optimistic and destructive fluctuations in the spectra, and also it
    dealsthe handover with the help of SNR changes of the channel in the spectrum.
    In CRN, Spectrum allocation, and accessingis the critical process. Here frequency
    access of the SU and the handover is achieved successfully, without any interference
    between the PUs and SUs. Show All A. Algorithm Implementation The proposed approach
    is analyzed by the following parameters such as Likelihood of fabricated alarm
    vs Likelihood of detection and Likelihood of fabricated alarm VS Likelihood of
    unexploited detection, for SNR value of −15db as shown in Fig. 3 and 4 respectively.
    It analyzed the availability and the presence of PU. When the communication channels
    are more, Likelihood of missed detection and Likelihood of false alarm is high
    andis low for less number of channels. The error rate has been implemented by
    comparing the test statistics value and the threshold value. Due to high error
    rate, the constant value of pf=0.05 is taken to analyze the obtained SNR, while
    calculating the PSD of the signal. Estimated by the following matrices SNR vs
    Probability of detection and SNR vs Probability of missed detection as shown in
    Fig. 5 and 6 respectively. It is analyzed that False alarm value decreases for
    CRN channels. Fig. 3. Probability of detection vs. false alarm Show All Fig. 4.
    False alarm vs. missed detection probability Show All The persistent value of
    fabricated alarm Pf= 0.05 is taken to decrease the attained SNR while scheming
    Power spectral density. SNR values must be superior than or equal to −15 dB to
    become least number of CR''s in accommodating CUSUM spectra. Fig. 5. Probability
    of Missed detection Vs. SNR Fig. 6. Probability of missed detection vs. SNR Show
    All B. Cooperative Cusum Analysis The SUs keep on searches the spectrum hole by
    the detecting the power of the channels. After recognizing a spectra hole, it
    is assigned to SU, and when principal user attains, subordinate user has to conferral
    the assigned spectra to it without instigating interfering between the principal
    user and subordinate user. It is obtained from the results as shown in Fig. 7.
    When the SNR value changes, Pf value also changes, and it becomes low for less
    probability uncovering. The likelihood of unexploited recognition and likelihood
    of fabricated alarm befits low for the CUSUM approximation. Fig. 7. Threshold
    optimization based on cusum Show All SECTION VII. Conclusion Enhancement in conventional
    spectra sharing is anticipated as desire for available band has risen significantly
    and licensed bands have been used incompetently. Unregistered users would be able
    to exploit available spectra from across licensed spectra on aquasi-basis with
    spectrum sharing, which is thought to address the spectra scarcity. Only with
    advent of AWGN, we investigated the power identification and spectra sensing abilities
    using various approaches including such FTT on the inside of the spectra. In addition,
    we predicted the SNR value at different criteria. The suggested collaborative
    CUSUM technique is centered on achieving better network performance after handover.
    The ability of CRN to operate continuously while shifting bandwidths back and
    forth duration has been demonstrated. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics

    February 2024 1 Introduction Recent decades have witnessed rapid growth in the
    number of wireless devices, which has greatly enhanced the demand for spectrum
    bands. Like any other natural resource, the availability of frequency spectrum
    is also limited. Previously, in spectrum regulation, the fixed spectrum access
    policy was adopted where a fixed portion of the spectrum is allocated to a group
    of users. Thus, they have the license to use that particular frequency band whenever
    they want. Several studies on actual spectrum measurement [1,2,3] have revealed
    that most of the licensed frequency bands experience a very small amount of utilization
    most of the time. In fact, in the report [1] published by Federal Communications
    Commission (FCC) in November 2002, the Spectrum Policy Task Force noted that:
    “In many bands, spectrum access is a more significant problem than physical scarcity
    of spectrum, in large part due to legacy command-and-control regulation that limits
    the ability of potential spectrum users to obtain such access.” Therefore, we
    need to enhance spectrum utilization by enabling opportunistic frequency reuse
    to maintain the sustainable growth of wireless technology. This has highly motivated
    the design and practical implementation of cognitive radio [4,5,6], which confronts
    the spectrum shortage by increasing the opportunistic usage of frequency bands.
    In contrast to the traditional listen-and-talk protocol, cognitive radios make
    use of the listen-before-talk protocol, which means they can continuously adapt
    their transmission parameters with the surrounding environment where they are
    functioning. In general, there are three stages of work that enable cognitive
    radios to achieve this adaptability: spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) and data transmission. Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) mainly consider two
    types of users: the primary users (PUs) and the secondary users (SUs). The PUs
    own frequency bands and thus they are licensed to access the spectrum anytime
    they wish. However, when the PUs are not active, the corresponding channels remain
    idle which leads to poor utilization of spectrum resources. The key concept behind
    CRNs is to lend these channels temporarily to the SUs or the unlicensed users
    with the condition that they will evacuate the channels as soon as the PUs are
    reactivated. Thus proper spectrum hand-off is essential in CRNs and this necessitates
    the monitoring of each PU’s idle/active state by the SUs through spectrum sensing.
    Once the spectrum sensing is done, the idle channels need to be assigned to the
    SUs to ensure dynamic spectrum access. This is not a trivial task as it involves
    competition among the SUs for the channels. Finally, each SU can send the data
    packets through the frequency band allocated to it. Throughout the whole process,
    the PUs’ concern that the interference caused by the SUs might affect its own
    transmission must be taken into account. Again, though the PUs have a higher priority
    in CRNs over the SUs, some performance guarantees must be provided to the SUs
    so that they can benefit from the opportunistic spectrum usage. The conflicts
    among the PUs and the SUs in CRNs have been addressed in existing literature from
    different viewpoints. In particular, the game-theoretic approaches have attracted
    the attention of many researchers, as the game theory has been widely accepted
    as a tool for analyzing interactions among multiple rational agents, each one
    having its own motive. The concepts of non-cooperative games and Nash equilibrium
    have been applied [7, 8] to the CRNs to determine optimal strategies on behalf
    of the PUs and the SUs. Also, the choice of Nash equilibrium, Pareto optimality,
    and evolutionary dynamics has been studied in existing works [9, 10]. Bargaining
    games and coalitional games are generally explored for resource allocation [11]
    and distributed spectrum sensing in CRNs [12]. For channel assignment and spectrum
    leasing, various types of auction games and matching theory have been used [13,14,15].
    The survey paper [16] summarizes the contributions of many other research works
    at the intersection of game theory and CRNs. In this paper, we want to focus on
    the applications of the Stackelberg game to model the dynamic interactions between
    the PUs and the SUs in CRNs and discuss some recent works published since 2010.
    Unlike other duopoly models where the agents make decisions simultaneously, the
    Stackelberg game considers two types of players—a leader and a follower. The leader
    takes action before the follower reserving the first mover’s advantage. Thus a
    similarity can be observed immediately between the Stackelberg game and the working
    of CRNs assuming the PUs are the leaders and the SUs are the followers. The optimal
    strategies can be achieved by investigating this framework. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows: Sect. 2 provides a brief introduction and mathematical
    formulation for the general Stackelberg framework. The contributions of the research
    work focusing on the power and spectrum allocation in CRNs using the Stackelberg
    game have been discussed in Sects. 3 and 4 respectively. Section 5 describes various
    difficulties and future scopes in tackling the problem of resource allocation
    for CRNs applying the Stackelberg framework. Section 6 concludes the paper. Fig.
    1 System model of CRN Full size image 2 Preliminaries In economics, the Stackelberg
    game is a duopoly model of the strategic interactions between two firms. The leader
    firm makes the first move and then the follower firm takes its action. The feature
    that makes Stackelberg game distinct from other duopoly models such as the Cournot
    game and Bertrand game is the sequential decision-making of the firms. Let us
    consider the leader firm outputs \\(q_l\\) quantity of a product and the follower
    firm outputs \\(q_f\\) quantity. If the function \\(\\varPi (.)\\) determines
    the market price, then the price of the product is \\(\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\). We
    assume \\(C_l(q_l)\\) and \\(C_f(q_f)\\) to be the cost functions of the leader
    and the follower firm respectively. Thus, the profit of the leader firm is revenue
    minus cost: $$\\begin{aligned} U_l(q_l)=\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\cdot q_l - C_l(q_l),
    \\end{aligned}$$ (1) and the profit of the follower firm is given by: $$\\begin{aligned}
    U_f(q_f)=\\varPi (q_l+q_f)\\cdot q_f - C_f(q_f). \\end{aligned}$$ (2) The solution
    of the Stackelberg game can be obtained by finding out the subgame perfect Nash
    equilibrium. The leader first anticipates the best response of the follower and
    then chooses its own action. Then the follower observes the leader’s move and
    plays its best strategy. This is called backward induction method. To maximize
    \\(U_f(q_f)\\), we differentiate (2) with respect to \\(q_f\\) and set it to zero.
    $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{\\partial U_f}{\\partial q_f}=\\frac{\\partial \\varPi
    (q_l+q_f)}{\\partial q_f}\\cdot q_f +\\varPi (q_l+q_f)-\\frac{\\partial C_f(q_f)}{\\partial
    q_f}=0. \\end{aligned}$$ (3) Let us assume the solution of (3) is \\(q_f^*(q_l)\\).
    Substituting it in (1) and maximizing \\(U_l\\) with respect to \\(q_l\\), we
    obtain the best strategy of the leader by solving (4). $$\\begin{aligned} \\begin{aligned}
    \\frac{\\partial U_l}{\\partial q_l}=&\\frac{\\partial \\varPi (q_l+q_f^*(q_l))}{\\partial
    q_f}\\cdot \\frac{\\partial q_f^*(q_l)}{\\partial q_l}\\cdot q_l+\\frac{\\partial
    \\varPi (q_l+q_f)}{\\partial q_l}\\cdot q_l\\\\&+\\varPi (q_l+q_f^*(q_l))-\\frac{\\partial
    C_l(q_l)}{\\partial q_l}=0. \\end{aligned} \\end{aligned}$$ (4) Fig. 2 Applications
    of Stackelberg Game in CRNs Full size image With this general introduction to
    the Stackelberg game, we will proceed to examine how it has been applied for resource
    allocation in CRNs. In Fig. 1, we show the fundamental system model of a CRN with
    one PU and one SU. The SU utilizes the idle spectrum band when the PU is inactive,
    whereas the PU is concerned about the interference caused by the SU. Thus, there
    are two types of resources that require proper allocation in CRN: the transmission
    power of the PU and the channel bandwidth leased to the SU. Thus we can divide
    the research works on the applications of Stackelberg games in two broad categories
    (Fig. 2): (i) the works concentrating on the power allocation problem and (ii)
    the works concerned about the spectrum allocation problem in CRNs. Some of the
    works reviewed in this paper consider conventional CRNs whereas other works explore
    heterogeneous system models with different users having different demands and
    functioning under various types of protocols. It is evident that the resource
    allocation problem becomes far more complicated under such heterogeneous settings.
    However, it is more practical since the emerging 5G/MIMO technology facilitates
    this type of system models and also the spectrum utilization is greatly accentuated
    in such systems. 3 Stackelberg Framework for Power Allocation in CRNs In this
    section, we discuss how the problem of power allocation has been addressed in
    several recent works. Generally, the PUs in CRNs impose a penalty on the SUs for
    the interference caused by them provided that the maximum allowable interference
    is constrained by some upper limit determined by the PUs. Thus the PUs gain a
    net payoff from the SUs by setting an interference price. On the other hand, the
    SUs make a profit proportional to their throughput minus the cost of interference
    to the PUs. Thus they participate in a Stackelberg game where both the parties
    try to maximize their own payoff. Table 1 describes this general setup. The authors
    in [17,18,19] have considered this kind of a framework. Table 2 compares all the
    works on power allocation presented in this paper. In [17], a CRN with one PU
    and multiple SUs has been investigated. There are multiple frequency tones available
    to be shared among the SUs. The authors have proved the existence of a unique
    Nash equilibrium in case of weak interference among all users and provided a distributed
    algorithm to compute the optimal strategies. The channel model does not include
    fast fading or shadowing effects and the perfect channel information is considered
    to be available at primary and secondary nodes in the network which is a serious
    drawback of this work. The revenue function considered here is piece-wise linear
    which simplifies the optimization problem. The main contribution is to provide
    a general framework for applying the Stackelberg game to CRNs. However, the case
    of multiple PUs is not explored. Thus here all the frequency bands are owned by
    a single PU which reduces the flexibility and opportunistic gain utilized by cognitive
    radios throughout the network. Finally, the complexity of the algorithm rapidly
    increases with the number of SUs and thus the scalability of the scheme is quite
    restricted. Table 1 Setup of Stackelberg Game for Power Allocation Full size table
    A price-based power allocation model for CDMA-based CRNs has been proposed in
    [18] considering a single PU and multiple SUs in the system. Similar to [17],
    an interference power constraint to the PU has been considered but this work is
    more general in the sense that the primary and secondary networks are separated
    here. Thus the two types of users are served by different base stations (BS).
    The utility for the PU is non-concave which makes the maximization problem hard
    to solve. Using the variable substitution method, the authors have transformed
    the non-concave problem into an equivalent convex optimization. Finally, an algorithm
    of linear complexity in the number of SUs is provided to calculate the optimal
    values. However, the work does not consider an ad-hoc cognitive radio system and
    is only limited to the slow-fading environment. Again, the discussion about the
    practical implementation of the scheme raises few questions. The PU is assumed
    to have complete knowledge about channel gain which is impractical. Again, the
    channel state information from the SUs to the BS is sent to the PU as feedback
    which increases communication overhead in the control channel. Furthermore, there
    is no defense mechanism to enable the system protecting the PU and innocent SUs
    against some arbitrary intrusion by malicious SUs. The authors in [19] have developed
    a joint precoding and power allocation scheme for a cognitive cellular system
    equipped with fractional frequency reuse (FFR). There are various traditional
    techniques for frequency reuse. However, FFR outperforms those methods by redistributing
    spectrum bandwidth between the cell-edges and cell-centers and thus reduce the
    interference among the users on edge. It can potentially contribute to efficient
    spectrum sharing among the interior users also. To implement FFR in this work,
    typically the primary base stations are deployed at the cell centers and the SUs
    are distributed in cell centers and edges. A Stackelberg game has been formulated
    to maximize the SUs’ utility reserving a higher priority for the QoS and data
    transmission requirements for the PU. The proposed scheme has been shown to improve
    overall bidding strategies, resulting in a more efficient spectrum auction. However,
    this work considers only a single PU and hexagonal cell instead of complex network
    topology. The argument behind this is that any complex topology can be divided
    into multiple regular portions. This directly limits the work since it does not
    consider a spatial point process distribution of the nodes in the network. An
    analysis treating multiple PUs as leaders might be interesting for heterogeneous
    networks. Table 2 Comparison of different power allocation schemes using Stackelberg
    Game Full size table In [20], the authors have investigated a CRN where the PU
    can adjust its transmission power to meet its minimum rate requirement. The PU
    first jointly optimizes power allocation and its interference price in this scheme.
    Then the SU maximizes its utility as a follower. Additionally, an incentive-based
    method has been considered so that the PU and the SU cooperate with each other
    in their power allocation and thus keep the social welfare optimum. Finally, the
    work has been extended from the single SU to multiple SUs scenario to achieve
    enough flexibility in system modeling. The Stackelberg equilibrium is obtained
    by a distributed algorithm which does not use perfect channel state information
    assumption. To find its equilibrium strategy, the PU employs Brent’s method which
    is an iterative procedure to solve single-variable optimization without taking
    derivative of the objective function. The most important contribution of this
    work is to optimize the social welfare in order to mitigate the monopolistic pricing
    mechanism of the PU. However, for multiple SUs scenario, the social optimum is
    unstable and hence the authors consider an incentive-driven functioning of the
    scheme to motivate the SUs in participating in the Stackelberg game. The system
    design in this work relies on several real-world assumptions that contribute to
    the potential impact of the scheme. An interference pricing-based resource allocation
    strategy has been discussed in [21], where a single primary base station (PBS)
    collects revenue from the SUs in the network. The authors have introduced uniform
    and non-uniform sensing-based interference pricing schemes for the SUs, which
    respectively allow channel access at the same and different prices for the users.
    The joint PBS revenue and SU utility maximization problem is formulated as a Stackelberg
    game. Also, a maximum tolerable interference limit is set to restrict SU transmission
    power. The proposed resource allocation strategy is studied under two different
    imperfect spectrum sensing scenarios in CRNs namely the sensing-based spectrum
    sharing (SBSS) and the opportunistic spectrum access (OSA). In SBSS, the SUs cause
    interference when they correctly identify the active status of PBS; whereas, in
    OSA, the interference happens due to incorrect spectrum sensing and misdetection
    of the PBS to be idle. Experimental result shows that a higher PBS revenue and
    SU throughput can be achieved in SBSS compared to what is observed in OSA. However,
    none of the previous works consider multiple PUs which is a common criticism of
    the former methods. The authors in [22] have argued that the single PU setting
    does not exploit the full potential of cooperation over the whole network and
    hence this work explores a network with multiple PUs. In this model, the SUs work
    as relays to the PUs and a Bayesian framework has been employed to evaluate whether
    an SU is trustworthy or not. This provides necessary protection against dishonest
    or malicious SUs that can damage the PUs performance. The Stackelberg game is
    formulated to obtain optimal transmission power and spectrum access time of the
    SUs. Two types of cooperation have been studied involving the utility maximization
    of the PUs and the cluster formation of SUs to maximize total spectrum access
    time across all the channels. There are several interesting contributions of this
    work. The cooperation between PUs and SUs have considered in a per time-slot basis
    where the SUs relay the packets of PU and transmit their own packets with the
    remaining amount of resources. An SU can increase its utility by being trustworthy.
    Furthermore, the authors have considered a weight matching problem to assign each
    SU to a suitable PU as a relay. Also, the competition between multiple SUs for
    gaining access to a particular channel is modeled. However, the proposed scheme
    seems to be too much complicated for practical systems. Specifically, it is difficult
    to achieve proper cooperation between the PUs and the SUs over multiple channels.
    Also, this work assumes perfect channel state information is available which is
    not very realistic for practical implementation. In [23], the authors have investigated
    cross-layer design for physical and network layer in energy harvesting CRNs. They
    have considered various practical constraints including the random changes in
    harvested energy, data generation, and channel state. In the network, each PU
    harvests energy from its surroundings and also can buy power from the grid. But
    SUs have only harvesting capabilities. The goal of the users is to minimize individual
    buffer delay during transmission. The PUs are protected and prioritized over the
    SUs by a signal-to-interference constraint. A stochastic Stackelberg game has
    been proposed in a single PU-multiple SUs framework first and then the extension
    of algorithms to multiple PUs scenario is provided. If the PUs have the SUs’ private
    information, they can anticipate SUs’ response to their own strategies by solving
    a stochastic mathematical program with complementarity constraints (SMPCC). However,
    assuming that the private information of SUs is unavailable to the PUs, the authors
    have developed a Nash Equilibrium-based re-Optimization (NEO) algorithm and verified
    its convergence theoretically. An online algorithm is also designed namely Greedy
    one-slot Game (GoG), which requires information from the current transmission
    slot only. Furthermore, the NEO algorithm has been adapted as a bi-Layer re-Game
    (biLG) algorithm for multiple PUs scenario. The authors in [24] have studied a
    cooperative cognitive wireless powered communication network (CWPCN) with a cognitive
    base station (CBS), multiple SUs, and wireless powered PUs. They have modeled
    the interaction between the CBS and the PUs as a Stackelberg game. Thus, in contrast
    to other works, CBS acts as a leader here and the PUs are the followers. The action
    profile for the CBS is to determine the price for energy transferred to PUs whereas
    the PUs decides the transmission power of the CBS. The Stackelberg problem formulation
    is convex and thus can be solved by the interior point method. However, note that
    this paper does not consider the stochastic nature of channel state and energy
    harvesting. Also, their problem formulation between single CBS and multiple PUs
    is equivalent to the single PU-multiple SUs scenario and thus does not investigate
    the complexities of a practical network model. For heterogeneous wireless networks,
    energy efficiency is a critical issue due to increasing restrictions on energy
    consumption by the transmitters spatially distributed over the network. The resource
    allocation and dynamic spectrum utilization for femtocell cognitive radios have
    been addressed in [25]. Two types of femtocells are considered namely the standalone
    femtocells which are too far away from each other to experience the co-tier interference
    and the collocated femtocells suffering from the interference power. The spectrum
    band of each macro user is shared by several standalone and collocated femtocells.
    The utility functions for two types of femtocells are defined as the energy efficiency
    minus the cost of transmission. However, this work does not provide details about
    the discrimination between the standalone and the collocated femtocells. In real-world
    systems, the difference between these two types of users might not be clear and
    thus one might need to consider some geometric constraints among the randomly
    deployed nodes. Also, the penalty charged for interference to the macro base station
    (MBS) is the same for the standalone and the collocated femtocells which could
    have been different as the standalone femtocells will cause less interference
    than the collocated femtocells due to their distant position from the BS. Finally,
    the backward induction method is used to solve the Stackelberg game and the uniqueness
    of the solution is justified. In the follow-up work [26], the authors consider
    a similar system model with quadratic utility function for the BS and propose
    a low complexity gradient assisted binary search algorithm to solve the Stackelberg
    game. The utility for the SUs is measured as the revenue gained from energy-efficient
    transmission minus the cost. Assuming a linear demand structure for spectrum bands,
    the utility for the BS is defined. However, this assumption is not justified properly.
    Additionally, a utility for the primary network has been considered in terms of
    the revenue gathered by leasing the spectrum bands. Next, a three-stage Stackelberg
    game has been formulated where first the primary network broadcasts spectrum prices
    to cognitive BS, then cognitive BS receives the channel state information from
    the SUs and finally, the spectrum bands are bought for transmission. The Stackelberg
    equilibrium is obtained using the gradient iteration algorithm which converges
    to near-optimal solutions in finite steps. The main limitation of this work is
    that it is essentially a centralized scheme that depends on feedback passed from
    the SUs to the BS. Thus, the communication overhead in the feedback channels is
    too high and the practical implementation of such a system lacks scalability.
    Also, the assumption of perfect channel information is not realistic. The authors
    in [27] introduce a two-stage Stackelberg game between the spectrum providers
    and SUs in the heterogeneous cognitive system. The spectrum providers equipped
    with distributed cloud computing facilities keep track of idle frequency bands
    in cellular, satellite or WiMAX networks distributed over certain geolocations.
    If an SU wants to transmit data, it first sends its location to the spectrum provider
    in order to obtain information about vacant channels in its location. Two subgames
    are defined for the power allocation among the SUs and the price selection among
    the spectrum providers. The solutions of these games are obtained by finding out
    the best response of the players. This work allows the SUs to opportunistically
    access multiple idle bands simultaneously. Also, it assumes a distributed setup
    among the agents in the network which is an immediate advantage. However, the
    interference among the SUs is not taken into account for the mathematical formulation.
    Also, the spectrum providers are assumed to contain perfect information about
    the location of free channels and the SUs. This is quite impractical from the
    point of view of users’ privacy concerns in the network. Again, considering the
    fact that the spectrum bands belong to different types of wireless networks, their
    availability cannot be homogeneous and hence the spectrum providers should determine
    the price charged to the SUs based on the particular identity of a channel. 4
    Stackelberg Framework for Spectrum Allocation in CRNs In this section, various
    proposed schemes using the Stackelberg game will be discussed for spectrum allocation
    in CRNs. Table 3 illustrates the general setup for formulating the game and Table
    4 describes all the works on spectrum allocation that we present in this survey.
    The SUs, in general, pay a price for spectrum access which constitutes the revenue
    gathered by the PU. This price depends on the amount of spectrum leased to the
    SUs. The spectrum pricing mechanism has been modeled in various works such as
    [28,29,30], considering the monopoly of the PU which implies that the PU can increase
    the price anytime to make the SUs’ net payoff zero. Table 3 Setup of Stackelberg
    game for spectrum allocation Full size table The authors in [28] proposed a four-stage
    spectrum pricing and allocation scheme. A CRN with a virtual network operator
    is considered along with a group of users. The backward induction of the four-stage
    Stackelberg game has been introduced in this network. The fourth stage deals with
    spectrum allocation formulating a game between the SUs and the operator and maximizing
    the utility. The third stage is focused on the optimal pricing of the spectrum
    bands on behalf of the operator. The net revenue is maximized in this stage with
    respect to the per-unit price. Optimal leasing and sensing are discussed in the
    second and first stages respectively where the maximum of revenue is obtained
    with respect to the leased and sensing bandwidth. The mathematical formulation
    is simple which allows the authors to incorporate the spectrum sensing and dynamic
    spectrum access in their model simultaneously. The most significant observation
    made by this work is that the spectrum resource can be obtained through low cost
    and uncertain spectrum sensing. A proper trade-off can be made between the expected
    profit and variation of realized profit by choosing the proper sensing realization
    factor. Finally, the authors show that when this factor is unknown, it can be
    estimated using the machine learning algorithm. However, there are several limitations
    to this work. First, no interference between the SUs has been taken into account.
    Also, perfect sensing outcome has been assumed which is not practical. Again,
    the assumption of perfect channel state information is too ideal. Another problem
    is whether the four-stage backward induction is possible in the real-world since
    this sequential decision making requires a synchronous mode of operation. For
    example, in a large-scale network, the operator may need to decide how much spectrum
    bands should be leased before obtaining the sensing results. Finally, a more generalized
    network model should consider multiple operators which are absent in this work.
    In [29], a pricing-based spectrum trading mechanism has been developed. The authors
    have constructed a spectrum market with the monopoly of one PU first and then
    extended it to multiple PU scenario where each PU can sell the idle portion of
    their frequency bands to the SUs. After spectrum sensing, the SUs can access the
    channel randomly and this has been modeled as slotted ALOHA and carrier sensing
    multiple access (CSMA). A \\(\\alpha\\)-fair utility is used for the secondary
    nodes whereas, the utility of the monopoly PU is defined as the total revenue
    collected from the SUs constraining their expected number of successful transmission
    according to the price paid. The Pareto optimal solution is obtained that maximizes
    the SU throughput maintaining the corresponding budget constraint. Next, when
    multiple PUs enter the market, the problem is formulated as a three-stage Stackelberg
    game. In the first and second stages, the PUs determine the available spectrum
    opportunities and pricing for the spectrum bands. The final stage assigns the
    SUs to the PUs according to their demand. Similar to [28], the backward induction
    starting from the final stage has been implemented here. Though this work has
    incorporated various practical design constraints, there are few open issues.
    The spectrum utilization is quite poor under slotted ALOHA. If the slotted ALOHA
    is replaced by a more complicated spectrum access method, the mathematical analysis
    will be restricted for large-scale approximations only. In that case, the methodology
    developed in this work may not be feasible in real-world systems. Thus, further
    investigation is required considering heterogeneous spectrum owners and multiple
    SUs. In the follow-up work [30], the authors consider a similar system model and
    provide a Pareto-optimal solution. Exploiting the decentralized structure of this
    solution, the SUs can compute spectrum access probabilities locally and this motivates
    the authors to formulate a distributed algorithm. As the contention among the
    SUs results in frame collisions in slotted ALOHA and the channel utilization suffers,
    the system model with CSMA techniques has been implemented as well and the improvements
    in the revenue for PUs under CSMA are explored due to the increased cooperation
    and awareness among the users. In the case of multiple PUs, the Stackelberg framework
    has been utilized assuming both the PUs and the SUs to be rational and selfish.
    The Nash equilibrium is computed as the intersection between the best-response
    functions of the players. This work does not consider heterogeneous PU which might
    be an interesting extension of this scheme. Also, perfect channel sensing is considered
    in this work. Again, to calculate the optimal spectrum pricing, the PUs collect
    budget information from the SUs. This can create a potential problem if the SUs
    are not truthful in reporting their actual budgets. One can utilize a VCG price-setting
    where the truthful reporting would be the dominant strategy as the departure will
    always hurt the utility of an agent. Finally, the scalability of this work needs
    to be explored because the computation overhead might increase with the number
    of PUs and SUs in the market and also with fading and shadowing effects in the
    interference-limited networks. Table 4 Comparison of different spectrum allocation
    schemes using Stackelberg game Full size table The authors in [31] have proposed
    a joint optimization scheme integrating the Stackelberg game and matching theory.
    Considering PUs and SUs as selfish and rational agents, spectrum leasing price
    and spectrum allocation factor can be dynamically handled using the low-complexity
    decentralized framework offered by the matching theory. The payoffs for PUs and
    SUs are first maximized in a Stackelberg interaction and then the one-to-one stable
    pairing between them is facilitated via a stable marriage algorithm. Thus, both
    the pairing problem and spectrum pricing problem are dealt with simultaneously.
    In this work, the authors have considered a network with single primary and cognitive
    base stations and multiple PUs and SUs. The users access the channel using time-division
    multiplexing. In each frame, there are three phases: spectrum leasing, SUs acting
    as PUs’ relay, and SU transmission. The SUs have to pay price for causing interference
    in the relay transmission phase and using spectrum in the SU transmission phase.
    However, this work does not consider channel state fluctuations. Also, it is not
    explained how the joint optimization will be performed in an online setting. Numerical
    results demonstrate that the matching framework has significantly improved the
    overall spectrum efficiency. In [32], the authors have explored spectrum allocation
    in Cognitive Radio-based Neighborhood Area Network (NAN) for Smart Grid communication
    with heterogeneous user terminals (UTs). The goal is to maximize the utility of
    the NAN gateway by differential pricing of UTs. The problem can be formulated
    as a Stackelberg game and the subgame perfect equilibrium can be achieved by the
    backward induction method. There are 4-stages of the Stackelberg game: Sensing
    stage, Leasing stage, Differential pricing stage, and Spectrum allocation stage.
    First, the NAN gateway determines the amount of available spectrum by sensing.
    Then, the spectrum that will be leased is decided based on sensing results from
    the first stage. Next, the differential pricing is set according to the demand
    of UTs. Finally, each UT maximizes its utility by selecting an optimal amount
    of spectrum. Observing the structure of the solution, the authors have also provided
    some insights into real-world pricing techniques. The authors in [33] have introduced
    a recall-based CRN with heterogeneous primary spectrum owners and multiple SUs.
    PUs are served at the primary owners based on a first-come-first-served rule.
    It has been assumed that the PUs arrive as a Poisson process and when the spectrum
    bands are idle, the primary owners lease those bands to the SUs. Due to the random
    arrival of the PUs, there might be a sudden demand for spectrum by the primary
    owners and therefore, the primary owners reserve the right to recall back a portion
    of the spectrum given to the SUs. This prevents degradation in the overall utility
    of the primary owners. In order to lease the spectrum bands to the SUs and to
    recall them back if necessary, the authors have proposed a two-stage solution.
    The first stage involves a combinatorial spectrum auction where the primary owners
    report idle spectrum bands to a centralized spectrum broker. The SUs also send
    their sealed bids to the broker. Finally, the sellers and the bidders are grouped
    to maximize social welfare. To make sure that some dishonest SU does not benefit
    from the auction, VCG pricing mechanism has been applied in this work which makes
    truthful bidding the dominant strategy. Once the SUs are selected for leasing
    the channels, we move to the second stage of the recall-based pricing game. Here
    the utility of the SUs is defined as the net throughput minus the price to be
    paid to the primary owners plus the compensation received by the SUs if its spectrum
    band is recalled. The primary owner needs to provide this compensation to every
    selected SU in the auction if their spectrum band is suddenly taken back. Thus,
    the utility of the primary owners is measured by the revenue gathered minus the
    compensation provided to the SUs. The spectrum allocation scheme developed in
    this work is thorough yet easily implementable. The simulation results also show
    significant enhancement in spectrum efficiency due to the proposed scheme. A heterogeneous
    cognitive sensor network has been considered in [34]. The sensor nodes in the
    network opportunistically convey their readings to the next hop when the spectrum
    is idle until the sink has been reached. Also, the actor nodes in the network
    are equipped with renewable power sources and programmed to act on the sensed
    outcome. Thus the Stackelberg game in this network is defined with the actors
    as followers and the BS as the leader. The utility of the actor node is defined
    as the throughput achieved over the minimum rate requirement minus the cost of
    accessing the idle spectrum bands. On the other hand, the base station accumulates
    the revenue from the actor nodes and also maximizes the payoff for the licensed
    nodes. Thus the game is formulated with these two sets of utility functions and
    the backward induction method is used to solve this game. A closed-form solution
    is available without considering the spectrum access strategy of licensed users.
    But if the max rate access principle is taken into account, the formulation becomes
    complicated. The max rate principle states that the licensed users will connect
    to the BS that provides them the best data rate. Thus it adds some additional
    constraints to the utility maximization problem of the Stackelberg game. Indeed,
    the optimization can no longer be solved analytically and the authors propose
    a numerical algorithm to solve the problem. The major contribution of this paper
    is to utilize the Stackelberg framework in the context of wireless sensor networks.
    However, the scheme described in this work is centralized and hence can be difficult
    to implement in reality. In [35], the author has proposed a joint spectrum allocation
    and pricing scheme for cognitive multi-homing networks. The hierarchical game
    theory framework is adopted to model the heterogeneous cognitive network as an
    oligopolistic market. The spectrum pricing and subchannel allocation have been
    considered under both constant and variable bit rate. The Stackelberg game is
    formulated with the primary operators as leaders and the secondary mobile terminals
    as followers. The product of utilities of the mobile terminals is maximized via
    a bargaining framework. Once optimal spectrum allocation is achieved, a Bertrand
    game is defined to obtain the spectrum prices for the primary network operators.
    Thus there are two distinct levels in this scheme. The solution of the bargaining
    game accommodates various desirable properties such as Pareto optimality, independence
    of irrelevant alternatives, invariant under affine transformation, etc. Again,
    the Bertrand game is solved by obtaining the subgame perfect Nash equilibrium
    strategy in terms of spectrum prices. Finally, the joint spectrum pricing and
    allocation algorithm is developed using the backward induction method. Also, the
    signaling overhead and complexity analysis for this algorithm have been included
    in this work. However, perfect channel information is assumed here. Also, the
    spectrum pricing policy could have been elaborated based on the heterogeneous
    nature of the primary operators in the network. Furthermore, instead of considering
    flawless channel sensing, a more realistic scenario might be explored incorporating
    quantities like the probability of misdetection and false alarm, etc. The authors
    in [36] have constructed a joint pricing and decision-making scheme for serving
    the heterogeneous user demand in a CRN with two primary operators, multiple PUs
    and SUs. The concept of virtual queues has been utilized where the SUs wait before
    dynamically accessing the free channels. This work considers a four-queue system
    supporting two kinds of service priorities for the POs. Again, in addition to
    single-band spectrum sharing between POs and SUs, multiband spectrum handover
    is also investigated where each PO has multiple idle channels to lease to the
    SUs. This has been formulated as M/M/s queueing system. Introducing a pre-emptive
    resume priority (PRP) M/M/1 queueing model, the authors have defined the utility
    of the SUs as the service value minus the cost. The cost has two parts. The fixed
    part is due to admission into the queue of a particular PO and the variable part
    is proportional to the waiting time in the queue. The solution to the decision-making
    problem of the SUs has been obtained as the Wardrop equilibrium. The spectrum
    pricing has been implemented using a Stackelberg framework. For single-band sharing,
    the backward induction was enough to solve the game. In the case of the multiband
    spectrum sharing, the POs must decide the number of channels to lease as well
    as the price and hence the problem becomes complicated. The global particle swarm
    optimization algorithm has been used to solve this problem. This work can be easily
    extended for multiple POs competing against each other. The authors have provided
    extensive simulation results to demonstrate the performance of this scheme. Other
    queueing models can also be investigated assuming imperfect spectrum sensing by
    the SUs. 5 Research Challenges and Future Directions Stackelberg game is very
    popular for modeling the resource allocation problem in CRNs. However, there are
    several challenges in applying this framework for practical wireless systems.
    Let us first consider the power allocation problem. The proper interference modeling
    is at the heart of the optimal power analysis. One particularly important tool
    for interference design is stochastic geometry. But often it makes the mathematical
    expression complicated. This becomes a problem while solving the Stackelberg game.
    Another challenge is to estimate the channel. Under multipath fading and large-scale
    shadowing environment, one must consider the outage probability and the ergodic
    capacity of the users to formulate the utility functions. Otherwise, the game
    formulation becomes unrealistic for actual design purposes. Again, the spectrum
    allocation problem has gained much attention due to rapid growth in the demand
    for frequency bands. The key issue here is how to set the spectrum prices. Often
    a linear demand function on behalf of the SUs has been implemented which is too
    simple. Most of the works so far illustrate a uniform valuation of spectrum bands.
    Considering a heterogeneous primary network, the price design must recognize the
    diversity among the population of primary nodes. Also, we may need to prioritize
    different categories of PUs. The auction-based games such as English and Dutch
    auctions, seal-bid auctions, etc might be useful for setting up the spectrum cost
    by bidding over the users. Another aspect of resource optimization is the nature
    and functioning of the algorithm. A centralized algorithm may converge to the
    global optima. However, it is very difficult to implement in practice due to the
    huge amount of information it needs to process. Often, in reality, we do not care
    about optimal solutions. A satisfactory outcome with some performance bound is
    good enough most of the time. Hence, distributed algorithms will be preferred
    over centralized ones in many situations. Distributed algorithms also require
    less information to process and hence the communication overhead between several
    cooperating nodes is greatly reduced. Finally, the heterogeneous networks and
    MIMO systems have been widely popular these days. The cognitive radio, being a
    promising future technology, has many scopes in these domains of research. Two
    main design parameters namely energy and spectrum efficiency are critical for
    multiple antenna communication. Several constraints make resource allocation a
    truly challenging problem in cognitive MIMO networks. Stackelberg games can be
    applied in such situations to prioritize the set of primary users over secondary
    nodes to facilitate opportunistic spectrum usage while protecting licensed users.
    Therefore, all these new interesting directions might be explored in the future
    to develop resource allocation schemes for adaptive efficient wireless networks
    equipped with cognition and self-organizing ability. 6 Conclusion In this paper,
    we have investigated the recent literature on the applications of the Stackelberg
    game for resource allocation in both homogeneous and heterogeneous Cognitive Radio
    Networks (CRNs). A comprehensive review of the related works has been presented
    broadly separating in two categories. The first category deals with the power
    allocation problem among the users in the network and the second category contains
    the spectrum allocation schemes between the primary and secondary nodes. The main
    issue while obtaining optimal strategies corresponding to Stackelberg equilibrium
    is to reduce the computation overhead and required information in order to facilitate
    the flexibility and scalability of the scheme for practical system design. However,
    we mention the advantages and drawbacks of each individual work elaborately and
    also provide some insights about possible improvements. Finally, we have discussed
    potential future research directions for applying the Stackelberg game in order
    to allocate network resources in upcoming advanced fifth-generation networks and
    design modern cognitive systems with better spectrum efficiency and performance
    guarantees. Availability of data and material All data and material available.

    QC, Canada SECTION I. Introduction Cognitive Radio Networks (CRNs) have been proven
    to be the most promising approach towards efficient spectrum utilization in wireless
    communication industry [1]. Their main goal is to create autonomous systems that
    continuously monitor the spectrum, decide, and act upon accordingly [2]. Autonomous
    systems are referred to intelligent systems capable of operating without human
    intervention [3]. They are unltimately aiming to implement brain-inspired systems
    capable of operating with a human counterpart without imperative instructions
    [4]. The most critical and time-consuming part of CRNs is the spectrum sensing
    process, in which the shared spectrum is used by an unlicensed Secondary User
    (SU) as long as its imposed interference on the receiver of the licensed Primary
    User (PU) is below an acceptable level. The absence of PUs is necessary to assign
    certain white spaces to SUs. Nevertheless, once PUs launch their transmissions,
    SUs should vacate the spectrum. The spectrum allocation and vacation cycle must
    be completed quickly so that CRNs can operate at the highest performance and productivity
    levels, otherwise an interference between the PU and SU occurs. In fact, the quick
    detection of the PU is critical since violation of the detection on time will
    cause an interference to the PU. However, due to the spectrum shortage and transmission
    power constraint of mobile devices, recent CRNs have been recognized as green
    communication technologies [5]. In this regard, the main objective of spectrum
    sensing at energy limited SUs is to detect and identify the signal of the PU in
    a noisy environment with a high precision rate and as quick as possible [6]. This
    issue motivates researchers to come up with the fast signal processing algorithms
    to achieve an easy software implementation with the focus on efficient signal
    classification schemes. One of the promising platforms for such classification
    scheme implementation is the FPGAs. These reconfigurable hardware devices provide
    suitable infrastructures to embed autonomous systems. However, one downside to
    utilizing FPGAs is their large reconfiguration time [7]. Nevertheless, since PUs’
    signal modulations in CRNs are rarely prone to change with respect to the reconfiguration
    time of FPGAs, the slow reconfiguration will not cause serious problem to the
    whole system. Literature Review: Spectrum sensing for signal classification is
    categorized into transmitter-based and machine learning-based approaches. In the
    transmitter-based case, the main goal is to detect the weak signal transmitted
    by PUs. Considering the fact that the transmitter-based spectrum sensing method
    depends on the noise level and prior knowledge of PU signals, it suffers from
    high complexity and computational capacity. Therefore, the focus of recent research
    works [8], [9], [10] have been shifted to machine learning-based models. Reference
    [11] investigated the use of Genetic Programming (GP) in combination with K-Nearest
    Neighbor (KNN) for modulated signal classification. The authors in [12], [13]
    employed deep learning to classify modulated signals in low SNRs in CRNs. They
    achieved a high degree of accuracy to differentiate the signals, however, the
    complexity of resource utilization of such a system is high due to the use of
    convolutional neural network, leading to a reduction in the speed of signal classification
    process. The authors in [14], [15], [16] used deep learning to classify different
    modulations using spectral correlation function for extracting features. Since
    the spectrum sensing process needs to be performed fast, there have been some
    studies on the spectrum sensing implementation in FPGA. The authors in [17] implemented
    a cyclostationary feature detector only for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing
    (OFDM) signals in CRNs. In [18], an automatic modulation recognition implementation
    was introduced using spectral features. They achieved an overall accuracy rate
    of 90% in signal classification which might not be an acceptable rate in CRNs.
    The authors in [19] designed an FPGA IP core to speed up the classification process
    in CRNs. They utilized the Support Vector Machine (SVM) to effectively implement
    a high speed classification algorithm. This scheme, however, is only applicable
    for specific digital modulations that use complex symbols from a constellation.
    Contribution: Increasing the performance of spectrum sensing in terms of speed
    and resource efficiency motivated us to design a novel machine learning-based
    processing algorithm that boosts the signal classification process with the minimum
    accuracy rate of 98:2%. The proposed scheme in conjunction with linear SVM is
    designed and implemented in Xilinx Virtex-6 XC6VLX240T FPGA. The designed algorithm
    benefits from the advantage of employing only shift registers instead of multiplication
    blocks in the SVM classifier that significantly enhances the speed of signal classification.
    Experimental results show that given the feature vector, our proposed approach
    is capable of classifying a blind modulated signal within only 3 ns in the classifier
    block in CRNs which corresponds to over 300 million signals per seconds throughput.
    In contrast to conventional schemes (e.g., [17], [19]), our proposed algorithm
    is independent of type of modulation, therefore, it can be applied to variety
    of signal classification process. SECTION 2. System Model and Problem Description
    We consider a CRN consisting of K primary users indexed by P U 1 ,…,P U K and
    M secondary users denoted by S U 1 ,…,S U M . For indicating the transmitter and
    receiver pair at PUs, we use notation ( T P U j ,  R P U j ) , and ( T S U i ,  R
    S U i ) to represent the opportunistic SUs transmitter and receiver pair. We assume
    both SUi and PUJ operate in the same frequency band restricted by the CRN regulation.
    Indeed, in the absence of PUJ, opportunistic SUs are allowed to fill the shared
    spectrum [20]. However, the active SUs must vacate the spectrum once the PUJ starts
    the transmission, hence, the main task of each R S U i is to recognize T P U j
    ’s signal from other T S U k ’s signals, k≠j , to occupy the spectrum hole [21].
    In addition, various green modulation schemes, including M-PSK, M-FSK, and M-ASK,
    M=2,4,… , are chosen for transmission and signal classification. We employ five
    spectral features namely (i) the maximum value of the spectral power density of
    the normalized-centered instantaneous amplitude, (ii) the standard deviation of
    the absolute value of the centered non-linear component of the instantaneous phase,
    (iii) the standard deviation of the centered non-linear component of the direct
    instantaneous phase, (iv) the standard deviation of the absolute value of the
    normalized-centered instantaneous amplitude, and (v) the standard deviation of
    the absolute value of the normalized-centered instantaneous frequency [22]. The
    segment size which is the number of samples from which features are extracted
    is set to Seg=2048. To include non-linearity to the hyperplane, a set of non-linear
    selective features is evaluated from the original five features (similar to applying
    non-linearity to logistic regression classifier) to construct our feature space
    denoted by R d , where d=11 . To avoid interference in CRN, the signal classification
    process needs to be quick. Toward this goal, one approach is to use the SVM classifier
    which is one of the mostly used algorithms in classification. SVM is capable of
    finding the best hyperplane with sufficient margin to discriminate against each
    class. Despite most recent literature (e.g., [23]), we apply linear kernel in
    our work since hyperplane parameters are easily extracted and stored for constructing
    the decision function. Moreover, linear kernels have low computational cost in
    comparison to the non-linear ones, and also they show a much better performance
    when adopted with our feature mapping method. Suppose there are L modulations
    for classification which are known for all SUs. It is also assumed that the dataset
    numbers are equal for all classes. The training dataset is indicated as {( X (t)
    1 , Y (t) 1 ),…,( X (t) N , Y (t) N )},t=1,…,M ,, M, where N is the number of
    training set, X (t) i ∈ R d , and Y (t) j ∈{−1,1} . Since our case is a multiclass
    classification, the one-vs-one method is used. For our L modulation class, L(L−1)
    2 classifiers are constructed. The class of an unknown signal is done according
    to the maximum voting scheme, where each classifier votes for one class. Assuming
    two arbitrary classes, the SVM objective is to find the decision function d(X)∈
    R d by calculating the SVM Wolf’s dual problem given as max α n { ∑ n=1 N α n
    − 1 2 ∑ n=1 N ∑ m=1 N α n α m Y (t) n Y (t) m k( X (t) n , X (t) m )} s.t. ∑ n=1
    N α n Y (t) n =0,0< α n <C,, (1) View Source where α n is the Lagrangian multipliers
    and k( X (t) n ,  X (t) m ) is the kernel function produced by the dot multiplying
    of mapping functions represented as ⟨ϕ( X (t) n ).ϕ( X (t) m )⟩ . By applying
    linear kernel k( X (t) n ,  X (t) m )=⟨ X (t) n . X (t) m ⟩ and solving (1) using
    quadratic programming, the parameters of the hyperplane for constructing the decision
    function is derived as W (t) = ∑ α n >0 α n Y (t) n X (t) n and w (t) 0 = Y (t)
    s − ∑ α n >0 α n Y (t) n X (t ) T n X (t) s , where (s) indicates a support vector
    sample. Hence, the decision function d(X) for classifying a new feature vector
    is represented by d(X)=sign( w (t) 0 + W (t ) T X (t) ). (2) View Source We will
    further use (2) and the derived hyperparameters and revise them to construct a
    faster efficient decision function suitable for FPGA implementation. SECTION 3.
    Proposed Signal Classification One of the most time consuming parts of machine
    learning algorithms such as linear SVM is the multiplication of their parameters
    with the feature (input) vector. In this paper, we design an Arithmetic Shifter-Based
    SVM (ASB-SVM), in which the multiplications is replaced by only shifters with
    the use of a new preprocessing method. ASB-SVM speeds up the classification process
    with a negligible reduction in the overall accuracy rate of the system performance.
    Fig. 1 illustrates the block diagram of the designed scheme for signal classification
    located at each SU’s receiver. In the proposed algorithm, the classifier’s input
    has been multiplexed with multiple preprocessed blind modulated signals. This
    will help take advantage of our designed fast performance classifier as will be
    demonstrated further throughout the paper. 3.1. Proposed two multipliers feature
    mapping method There are two popular types of feature scaling: i) standardization
    (zero-score normalization) where the feature space is rescaled so that each feature
    vector has the mean value of 0 and standard deviation of 1, and ii) Min-Max normalization
    where the feature data is mapped into any arbitrary scale. Feature scaling will
    help learning algorithms to work more efficiently. It is common to scale the data
    between 0 and 1 or-l and 1 which can be accomplished by x s i =a+ ( x i −min(
    X i ))(b−a) max( X i )−min( X i ) , (3) View Source where i=1,…,d , a and b denote
    minimum and maximum values of the scale, xi indicates ith feature value and Xi
    is ith feature vector. The objective of our two multipliers feature mapping method
    is to map data in the power of two. The main reason for this mapping procedure
    is that it is possible to replace the multiplication of input and parameter vector
    by a shift register which is performed much faster than multiplication and uses
    fewer energy. In this scheme, data is first scaled between 0 and 10 using (3).
    This helps data to be scattered through the feature space. The scaled data is
    mapped to the smallest near integer value using floor function ⌊⋅⌋ . Fig. 1. Block

    final stage of this process is accomplished through converting the values of feature
    space Z d to power of two, leading to creation of new feature space Z ^ d . The
    visualization of the scheme is illustrated in Fig. 2. Hence, the mapping process
    can be expressed as X ^ s = 2 ⌊ X S ⌋ , where X s =[ x s 1 ,…, x s d ] . Training
    the classifier with the new feature space Z ^ d gives the opportunity to substitute
    multiplications with only shifters since shifting the parameter vector W with
    Xs is the same as multiplying W with X ^ s (e.g. 8×w= 2 3 ×w≡(w arithmetic right
    shift by 3)). The same procedure in Section 2 for training the Multiplication-Based
    SVM (MB-SVM) classification is applied to obtain the hyperparameters of the ASB-SVM
    classifier using new training set ( X s i ˆ , Y j ) . Due to the fact that the
    input vector is in the order of power two, the decision function in (2) can be
    rewritten as d(X ) new  =sign( W ˆ <<< X map ), (4) View Source where X map =[⌊0,
    x s 1 ,…, x s d ⌋] denotes the feature vector, W ˆ =[ w 0 , W] indicates the hyperparameter
    vector, and the notation ⟨<<<⟩ is the elementwise arithmetic shift. Algorithm
    1 summarizes the whole procedure of our proposed system for signal classification.
    Note that the designed classifier specialized for FPGA implementation is trained
    in a supervised manner. It autonomously performs the signal classification once
    it is fully trained. Therefore, if the classifier is required to adapt to a new
    context such as a new signal modulation, its corresponding training data will
    still be required. this constraint, however, does not culminate in a challenging
    task since signal modulations are synthetic and can be readily generated and manipulated
    to procure the new training data. Remark 1:One possible problem that can be emerged
    with this mapping technique is the overlapping of different class data in the
    new feature space Z d . To address this issue, we numerically tested whether any
    mapped sample has overlapped with another sample from different classes. The result
    showed that the more feature space we have, the less it is possible for the mapped
    sample to be overlapped with a sample from another class. Moreover, the problem
    can be avoided if classes are separable with enough margin. In the case of the
    aforementioned modulations for classification, there was not any overlapping of
    different sample classes as the number of our features is sufficient enough and
    the data set classes have a tolerable margin in feature space R d . Fig. 3. One
    out of fifteen blocks of the ASB-SVM classifier. Show All Remark 2:It should be
    noted that there is another approach for effectively applying digital multipliers,
    called Canonical Signed Digit (CSD) multipliers. In the CSD method, a constant
    value is converted in such a way that its representation has minimum non-zero
    of “1”s. Therefore, its multiplication with an arbitrary input corresponds to
    utilization of minimum adders/substrators and shifters. Nevertheless, our proposed
    scheme with no adders/substrators, and by using only shifters in the multiplication
    block of the ASB-SVM implementation is able to perform faster than CSD multipliers.
    3.2. FPGA implementation To demonstrate the advantage and credibility of the proposed
    approach, we have implemented both MB-SVM and our designed ASB-SVM classifiers
    on Xilinx Virtex-6 LX240T FPGA and evaluated its hardware performance in terms
    of speed, accuracy and resource utilization. The dataset is constructed in MATLAB/SIMULINK
    environment. The training phase is done using MATLAB Classification Learner. Since
    our model is inherently a signal processing design, we have utilized MATLAB HDL
    Coder toolbox for efficient implementation. We have chosen the 16 bits fixed-point
    data format for value representation in the design. Fig. 3 illustrates one of
    the 15 blocks for the modulation classification with its corresponding input and
    output signals (according to L(L−1) 2 ). As can be seen from Fig. 3, the multiplications
    are replaced by arithmetic shift units that get two value: w which is the parameter
    value of the classifier and s that specifies how many shifts must be applied to
    w. The corresponding results are then accumulated through the adder tree. The
    classifier is pipelined in each stage to ensure the data flow credibility and
    high performance. The output of the adder tree summation is then compared with
    zero for further decision making in the voting scheme. 3.3. Results and Comparison
    Table 1 shows the average accuracy of our proposed and the conventional approaches
    for signal classification which is verified in Simulink environment. As can be
    observed from Table 1, the overall accuracy of ASB-SVM is 9S.2% in comparison
    to 9S.9% from MBSVM classifier which is a negligible loss. From Table 2, it is
    seen that the number of LUT slice is reduced over 30% and the speed of the classification
    is increased by 45% without using multiplication. Moreover, our proposed ASB-SVM
    classifier is more accurate than the proposed system used in [18], [19], and also
    is capable of classifying a blind modulated signal within only 3 ns in the classifier
    block in a CRN which corresponds to over 300 million signals per seconds throughput
    and beats the HISTO-SVM proposed in [19] in terms of speed and overall accuracy
    in signal classification. Furthermore, the proposed HISTO-SVM in [19] is only
    applicable for modulated signals that has constellation characteristic which limits
    the utilization of such classification for other modulation schemes in CRNs. Moreover,
    comparing our designed system to deep learning-based shemes, the hardware implementation
    is more feasible specially in realtime applications and also it is not constrained
    to specific modulations. Table 1 Average Accuracy of the SB-SVM-Based and the
    Traditional SVM-Based Scheme For Various SNR Levels. Table 2 A Comparison of Resource
    Utilization. SECTION 4. Conclusion We proposed the Arithmetic Shifter-Based SVM
    (ASB-SVM) architecture for realtime signal classification in a CRN, which is independent
    of the modulated signals. ASB-SVM benefits from replacing multiplications with
    shifters in its structure which enhances the speed of signal classification. Our
    designed scheme achieved over 30% resource reduction and 45% increase in speed
    in comparison to MB-SVM method. The classification of the modulated signals can
    be executed in parallel using multiple ASB-SVM classifiers. Such a design can
    boost the classification speed at the cost of more resource utilization. Furthermore,
    the proposed classifier is trained in a supervised manner. Our future direction
    is to promote a signal modulation classification with an unspervised learning-based
    classifier where the implementation can still benefits from shifters instead of
    multipliers. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Prediction

    IEEE Conference Location: Brno, Czech Republic SECTION I. Introduction Current
    static radio spectrum management policies through their highly inefficient spectrum
    use are introducing an artificial spectrum scarcity problem. Several surveys on
    radio spectrum occupancy have observed that most of the allocated spectrum is
    not fully used [1]. In particular, measurements provided by the FCC in several
    American cities have shown large variations in the intensity of spectrum use below
    1 GHz frequency [2]. Additional measurements have been conducted by the Shared
    Spectrum Company in the USA on the frequency range 30 MHz and 3 GHz [3]. The associated
    analyses have assessed an average occupancy in the observed locations of around
    5.2%, with a maximum occupancy of 13.1% in New York City and a minimum occupancy
    of 1% in rural areas. In Europe, several measurement campaigns conducted in Germany,
    Spain, Netherlands, Ireland, France, and Czech Republic show a better situation
    [4], ascertaining a higher spectrum occupancy when compared with USA, but still
    rather low if considered alone. For instance, in the Aachen area of Germany, spectrum
    occupancy is estimated to be 32% in the range between 20 and 3000 MHz. Such discrepancies
    between spectrum allocation and actual usage prove the artificial nature of spectrum
    scarcity as caused by spectrum management policy, not reflecting the actual availability
    of usable radio spectrum. To deal with the spectrum allocation congestion and
    spectrum scarcity problems, the Cognitive Radio (CR) technology has been proposed.
    CR is a technology that allows unlicensed users, namely Secondary Users (SUs),
    to opportunistically utilize already licensed bands left unused by licensed users
    [5]. Such frequency bands are named spectrum holes (or white spaces) and are defined
    as multidimensional regions within time, space, and frequency [6]. Through the
    opportunistic access provided by this technology it is possible to improve the
    efficiency of the spectrum utilization and, in perspective, to allow next generations
    of mobile networks to access radio spectrum bands. A pre-requisite of CR is the
    coexistence with current telecommunication technologies and licensed legacy users,
    namely Primary Users (PU), in the shared spectrum. The reallocation of radio spectrum
    has become an important question and auction design is both answer and efficient
    solution. In particular, in the context of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) and CR
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users, see [7] and
    references therein. Here, our focus is to provide a systematic survey on auction-based
    methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks (CRNs). The existing survey
    works on CR have focused on various (cooperative and non-cooperative) methods
    for searching spectrum holes by means of spectrum sensing techniques, summarizing
    the advantages and disadvantages of each algorithm and their challenging problems.
    References [8] and [9] provided a survey of resource allocation algorithms from
    the aspects of adopted approaches, criteria, techniques, and network architectures.
    Reference [10] presented an up-to-date survey of spectrum decision in CRNs based
    on spectrum characterization, spectrum selection, and CR reconfiguration. In [11],
    spectrum access schemes were reviewed, while in [12] the concept of dynamic spectrum
    sharing, was investigated for different network topologies, features, challenges,
    and probable use cases. Reference [13] provided a comprehensive survey of CR,
    full-duplex communication and Long Term Evolution (LTE) on unlicensed spectrum,
    as well as the multiple spectrum sharing techniques. Reference [14] outlined the
    spectrum sharing mechanism for the next generation cellular networks to overcome
    the energy crisis, and the spectrum sharing between satellite telecommunication
    networks and terrestrial has been surveyed in [15]. More recently, [16] provided
    a comprehensive survey on full spectrum sharing in CR networks towards the fifth
    generation (5G). Compared with previous survey papers, our survey aims at presenting
    an overview of spectrum allocation techniques based on auctions mechanisms in
    CR networks. The contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i)
    we outline the characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing,
    as well as the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework; (ii) we introduce
    the economic properties of conventional auctions, and then we present a comprehensive
    taxonomy of auction-based methods applied to spectrum allocation in CR networks,
    as well as their characteristics, and implementation issues. The organization
    of this paper is as follows. Section 2 elaborates on the background and motivation
    of radio regulations, shared spectrum, dynamic spectrum access, and CR technology.
    In Section 3, we present the basic frameworks of auction theory, while in Section
    4 we briefly introduce auctions for radio resources. Spectrum auctions are fully
    reviewed in Section 5 along with a discussion on performance metrics in Section
    6. Our conclusions are finally drawn in Section 7. TABLE I. Policy options for
    primary and secondary users SECTION II. Radio Spectrum Regulations and DSA In
    the context of radio spectrum regulation, it is necessary to distinguish between
    trading, as a transfer of spectrum usage rights, and liberalization, as a weakening
    of the restrictions and limitations associated with spectrum usage rights related
    to technologies and services. The report of the Spectrum Policy Task Force of
    the FCC defines spectrum regulatory mechanisms, highlighting three different models
    [17]: a command-and-control model; an exclusive use model; an open access model.
    The most used one is the command-and-control model, which refers to the licensed
    spectrum for shared usage and unlicensed spectrum. In addition, for primary and
    secondary users of the radio spectrum, it is possible to identify different regulatory
    options as summarized in Table 1, see [18]. It is interesting to note that if
    a PU has enough flexibility, it may choose to grant secondary access instead,
    by creating a secondary market to rent the unused portion of the spectrum. This
    approach can guarantee an adequate QoS for the SUs. As a consequence, auctions
    have been recently used in the context of radio resource management. Cognitive
    Radio technology is able to execute dynamic spectrum access (DSA). Actually, it
    is a form of wireless communication that allows the secondary user or the cognitive
    user to extract information from the radio environment and to identify idle channels
    [19]. Secondary users must respect specific power constraints when the primary
    users are present according to three different ways of accessing the spectrum
    band: spectrum interweave, spectrum overlay and spectrum underlay. Spectrum interweave
    means that unlicensed users can access the spectrum when the primary users are
    not transmitting, but they are obliged to leave when the licensed users require
    to transmit. In spectrum underlay, instead, the unlicensed users and the primary
    users transmit simultaneously with the constraint imposed on the latter to maintain
    interference below a certain threshold. Finally, in spectrum overlay, the unlicensed
    users can access the spectrum, but they have to contribute to primary users’ transmission.
    Table 2 lists the spectrum access techniques and their characteristics. TABLE
    II. Spectrum Access Techniques The DSA is performed by Cognitive Radio technology
    through the following functions: spectrum sensing, spectrum allocation, spectrum
    access and spectrum handhoff [20]. As for spectrum sensing, it allows the secondary
    users to identify the spectrum holes in the licensed bands. Once the radio environment
    has been sensed, spectrum allocation determines the spectrum distribution to unlicensed
    users. The third function of Cognitive Radio, that is spectrum access, determines
    the way in which the secondary users access the licensed bands. Spectrum access
    must execute in such a way the licensed users do not suffer from interferences
    caused by secondary users’ transmission. Figure 1 illustrates the four main functions
    of Cognitive Radio technology Finally, in the context of DSA and Cognitive Radio
    technology, auctions enter in the phase of spectrum allocation since a market
    relationship is created between spectrum owners and cognitive users. SECTION III.
    Auctions for Radio Resources The reallocation of radio spectrum has become an
    important issue and auction design is both an answer and an efficient solution.
    Fig. 1. Cognitive Radio Functions Show All In auctions for radio resources, the
    primary users play the role of spectrum sellers and the secondary users play the
    role of spectrum buyers. The most used auctions in radio spectrum selling are
    the single-sided auctions, the double-sided auctions, the online auctions and
    the dynamic auctions. It is important to highlight that an auction could be online
    and combinatorial, as well as double-sided, online and combinatorial, and so on,
    so there are many ways in which an auction can be designed. In addition, other
    types of auctions are interested in building a framework that discriminate among
    the secondary users. In particular, as shown by [21]–[22], this discrimination
    tries to promote an energy efficient use of the resource by encouraging those
    users with a lower transmission power. It is important to note that an auction
    can be performed in a centralized or in a distributed manner. In the first case,
    the presence of an intermediate operator is not required, while in the second
    case, the intermediate operator is present. Double-sided auctions are generally
    performed in a centralized manner. According to this classification, different
    auction models will be considered in this survey. The classification is useful
    to describe the problems faced by these kinds of mechanisms, since auctions for
    radio resources present several problems to deal with. One problem is designing
    an auction mechanism that could take into account the reusability of the radio
    spectrum. Actually, due to the fact that the spectrum is a shared resource, reusability
    has to be granted among non-conflict buyers. The second problem deals with the
    channel quality, since it is important to consider that different channels correspond
    to a different transmission quality, therefore, the assumption of homogeneous
    channels for buyers should not be taken into account. The third problem is the
    degradation of the QoS of licensed primary users, in fact it is often assumed
    that the allocated spectrum is occupied only by the winning secondary users. Spectrum
    usage becomes problematic if demand for spectrum from primary users increases.
    The problem of avoiding degradation of the QoS of primary users is addressed by
    introducing the possibility of recalling the channel, in fact the idea of recalling
    the channel imposes a priority in the services of primary licensed users. Other
    problems arise in the design of online auctions, in fact this type of mechanism
    does not allow to have a complete information of the bid and ask prices, information
    easily available in offline auctions. Others arise in the design of online auctions,
    in fact this type of mechanism does not allow to have a complete information of
    the bid and ask prices, information easily available in offline auctions. Finally,
    the last problem concerns the properties that an auction model should have to
    discourage untruthful behaviour and create incentives for both buyers and sellers
    to take advantage of the auction. Let us note that the radio spectrum differs
    from conventional commodities, in the sense that it can be used by several users
    at the same time. This feature is called reusability and gives buyers the ability
    to use the radio resource simultaneously. The possibility of re-use of the radio
    resource should be granted to non-conflicting buyers, which means that they do
    not interfere with each other, so re-use of the spectrum requires modelling the
    relationship of interference among buyers through a conflict graph. A. One-sided
    Spectrum Auctions One-sided spectrum auctions are characterized by the presence
    of one spectrum seller and multiple buyers. Authors in [23] consider the problem
    of spectrum recalling, i.e., the possibility granted to the PUs of getting back
    a quantity of spectrum when they require to transmit. The authors propose a recall-based
    auction framework called RSSA that enables the possibility of preserving the QoS
    of primary users. Within the framework of the RSSA, the second-price sealed-bid
    auction is used for the determination of the payment and this mechanism is shown
    to satisfy the properties of individual truthfulness and rationality. The bids
    of the secondary users are presented to maximize their utility and each of them
    has an evaluation equal to the Shannon Capacity when the recall of the channel
    is not considered. The channel’s valuation decreases when the spectrum seller
    declares the quantity of recalled channels. The idea in [23] is to introduce a
    risk factor that can assess how much SUs react to the possibility of channel recall.
    It can be seen that SUs with a higher risk factor value are less averse to the
    risk of channel recall and, as a result, their bid will be higher ensuring a higher
    probability of winning. The authors in [9] use the same idea of channel recall
    proposed by [23] but allowing the presence of multiple winners. The auction is
    still one-sided, and the proposed framework is called RMSA. In the RMSA framework,
    the presence of multiple winners helps the spectrum seller in increasing revenues,
    in fact, since the demands of secondary users are independent of the number of
    channels that can be auctioned, it is common that the channels auctioned cannot
    be fully used by a single winner. The Vickrey-Clarke-Groves (VCG) mechanism can
    be used in the payment scheme since the presence of multiple winners commutes
    the problem into a combinatorial auction. The VCG mechanism guarantees the properties
    of efficiency, truthfulness and individual rationality. Under RMSA, the number
    of recalled channels cannot be calculated by the secondary user as it depends
    on both his own demand and that of other secondary users. In this context, it
    is possible to define a stability factor that has a different meaning from that
    of the risk factor, in fact the stability factor is determined by the activity
    of primary users. A large value of the stability factor indicates a more stable
    service for secondary users since the primary users are not recalling back the
    allocated spectrum. In the RMSA framework, the VCG mechanism guarantees that truthful
    bidding is a dominant strategy, so once the buyers submit their true values for
    the channels, the winners can be obtained by solving an optimization problem.
    The authors in [23] assume that spectrum allocation is made in units of channel.
    On the contrary, the authors in [24] propose a one-side auction framework with
    a variable bandwidth spectrum allocation, that can grant the secondary users with
    a more flexible use of the spectrum. B. Double-sided Spectrum Auctions The double-sided
    auction is the most popular mechanism used for allocating radio spectrum and its
    popularity is due to the greatest adaptability to the real market conditions [25].
    They are characterized by the presence of multiple competitive buyers and sellers.
    In addition, they need the presence of an auctioneer playing the role of an intermediate
    operator among the agents. In a double-sided auction, buyers submit their bid
    prices, which represent the maximum willingness to pay and, similarly, sellers
    submit their ask prices, representing the minimum price at which they are willing
    to sell the item. After collecting the bid and the ask prices, the auctioneer
    clears the market through a price decision. The double auction model has to guarantee
    the property of individual rationality, truthfulness and ex-post budget balance
    property. The latter requires that the auctioneer’s profit, defined as the difference
    between buyers’ payments and sellers’ revenues, to be positive in order to provide
    incentives to start the auction [25]. A double auction model should also guarantee
    the property of economic efficiency which means that all the efficient trade should
    be executed. These properties cannot occur in the same double auction model, due
    to the fact that there is always a compromise between the properties of economic
    efficiency and budgetary balance. The execution of all trade between buyers and
    sellers leads always to a budget deficit and this turns into a negative profit
    for the auctioneer [26]. The trade reduction mechanism is used in double auctions
    to determine the winners and the corresponding payments. Moreover, this mechanism
    is proved to satisfy the properties of individual rationality, truthfulness and
    ex-post budget balance. In addition, the trade-reduction mechanism sorts the buyers’
    bids and the sellers’ asks, respectively, in a non-increasing and in a non-decreasing.
    Each buyer pays bk and each seller receives sk and the profit of the auctioneer
    is given by the difference between the payments made by the buyers and those received
    from the sellers [26]. In particular, the trade-reduction mechanism finds the
    efficient trade quantity k such that bk ≥ sk. The first k-1 sellers and buyers
    are the winners of the auction [27]. As highlighted by [28], the trade-reduction
    mechanism allows for a separation between the allocation decision and the payment
    decision and the idea is to maintain the property of individual rationality, truthfulness
    and ex-post budget balance by eliminating the least profitable transaction. Therefore,
    the bids that have been removed become the reference prices, that is, the buyers
    pay the bidding price of the removed buyer and the sellers are paid by the asking
    price of the removed seller. Another mechanism of great importance is the McAfee
    mechanism. This mechanism works in the same way as the trade reduction mechanism,
    but there is a difference in the determination of the clearing price. In the McAfee
    setting, the clearing price is set as b k+1 + s k+1 2 if the price is in the interval
    [bk, sk], otherwise the trade reduction mechanism is applied. Most of the existing
    works on double auction for spectrum allocation make use of the trade reduction
    mechanism for winner’s selection and payment’s determination. C. Online Spectrum
    Auctions Spectrum auctions can be performed in offline or in online patterns.
    The offline auctions are also known as periodic auctions. In periodic auctions,
    the bid and ask prices can be submitted only in a certain period. The online auctions
    are characterized by the absence of a bidding period, in fact bid and ask prices
    arrive continuously and the auctioneer has to take the allocation and the payment
    decision immediately. The decision between offline and online auctions is strictly
    affected by the buyers’ and sellers’ preferences. Buyers and sellers prefer online
    auctions when they are impatient and need an immediate allocation of the item.
    In online auctions, the secondary users transmit a request to the auctioneer.
    The request is composed by the willingness to pay of the secondary user, the demanded
    channels, the arrival time, the departure time and the job length. The authors
    in [29] design a truthful online combinatorial auction called TRADE. In TRADE,
    the challenges of online auction mechanisms are highlighted. One of these challenges
    is to avoid the pre-emption effect. The pre-emption effect arises when the auctioneer
    interrupts the execution of a current request to meet new requests [30]. The authors
    in [29] highlight that the pre-emption effect must be avoided for two reasons:
    the partial usage of the channel is not charged and the pre-empted secondary user
    is discouraged to participate in the following auctions. Most of the existing
    works on online auction mechanisms make the same assumptions: the pre-emption
    effect is not allowed, the secondary users submit their truthful job lengths and
    their requested channels. Sometimes, it can be assumed that the secondary users
    lie only in submitting a longer time duration for using the channel. The online
    auctions mechanism are always compared in terms of performance with the offline
    auction mechanisms and the reference point is always the VCG mechanism. In the
    TRADE mechanism, the channels are considered identical, the auction is sealed-bid
    and private and the rejected requests of secondary user can be reconsidered for
    future time slots. TRADE considers the reusability of the radio spectrum and a
    conflict graph is used to represent the interference relationship between secondary
    users, but this time the interference relationship depends on location, time-periods
    and requested channel. TRADE mechanism is proved to satisfy the property of individual
    rationality and truthfulness. The authors in [30] propose an online double spectrum
    auction called TODA, in which the auction is sealed-bid and private, the channels
    are assumed to be identical and the reusability of the spectrum is considered.
    As usual, the secondary users who interfere with each other cannot use the same
    channel. In TODA, the interference relationship is present among primary users
    and among secondary users, but only the conflict between secondary users is considered.
    In both TODA and TRADE, the conflict between secondary users depends on locations
    and requested time periods. In TODA, the interference between secondary users
    can be seen under two different models: the protocol interference model and the
    physical interference model, while in TRADE, only the protocol interference model
    is considered. The interference pattern of the protocol considers two secondary
    users as interferers if they are in each other''s interference field. The physical
    interference model admits the simultaneous use of the channel when the SINR is
    in accordance to a certain threshold. Differently from TRADE, TODA assumes that
    the rejected requests cannot be reconsidered for future time slots. TODA satisfies
    the property of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget balance.
    The authors in [31] propose an online double auction mechanism called SALSA that
    is similar to TODA in its assumptions. SALSA is proved to be truthful, individually
    rational and ex-post budget balance. In [9], the problem of spectrum allocation
    is also modeled using an online double auction called VIOLET. In VIOLET, both
    the activities of primary users and secondary users are uncertain, and the auctioneer
    has the role of granting the spectrum usage to the secondary users, taking into
    account the higher access priority of primary users. In VIOLET, the spatial reuse
    of the spectrum is granted to non-conflict secondary users and the conflict relationship
    is modeled by a conflict graph which is known to the auctioneer. The non-conflict
    secondary users are put into groups, like in TRUST, and the usual trade reduction
    mechanism is applied to select the winners and the corresponding payments. VIOLET
    satisfies the properties of truthfulness, individual rationality and ex-post budget
    balance, so it resists to market manipulation. D. Dynamic Spectrum Auctions Some
    spectrum auctions can be considered as dynamic, in the sense that, some parameters
    are dynamically adapted to improve the performance of the mechanism. The authors
    in [32] propose an auction mechanism for femtocells where a reserve price is established.
    The reserve price increases in every auction round by a step size. This step size
    is not fixed but varies accordingly to the utility of each secondary users. The
    authors in [26] propose a double auction framework for spectrum allocation in
    which the auctioneer can learn from historical data on previous auctions rounds.
    After this learning process, the auctioneer can help both primary users and secondary
    users in deciding their bidding strategy. The authors in [33] propose an auction
    framework for spectrum allocation performed in a distributed manner. The auction
    is first-price and sealed-bid but some advances are proposed in in terms of the
    bid scheme. A learning algorithm is introduced to help the secondary users in
    deciding the participation to the auction. In this framework, the bid strategy
    of each secondary users depends on the bidding history. The authors in [34] propose
    an adaptive auction framework for spectrum allocation called DEAL, in which the
    characteristics of spectrum channels vary in time and space and also the valuation
    is different. In DEAL, some parameters in the auction are dynamically adapted
    to improve the mechanism’s performance. Besides, the reserve price is based on
    secondary users’ bids, but the secondary users can influence the reserve price
    by reporting untruthful bids. Moreover, in DEAL, the reserve price is adapted
    on previous bids instead of current ones, to avoid the submission of fake bids.
    SECTION IV. Auction Efficiency and Performance Metrics The spectrum auctions are
    employed in radio resource management to improve the spectrum utilization. An
    auction may have either the objective of allocating the item to the highest value
    buyer or to maximize the seller revenue. In auctions for radio resources, these
    two objectives are also taken into account with regard to increasing spectrum
    use. In order to see if the auction design has reached the predefined objectives,
    some performance metrics are employed in spectrum auction, one of the most applied
    performance metrics being the spectrum utilization ratio. In VIOLET, the arrangement
    of non-conflict buyers into groups guarantees the spectrum reusability. The spectrum
    utilization ratio in VIOLET is defined as the ratio of total winning users, both
    primary and secondary, over the whole spectrum. The spectrum utilization ratio
    is lower without the auction because the spectrum usage is granted only to primary
    users. The use of auction can increase the spectrum utilization ratio allowing
    the use of the radio resource also to non-conflict secondary users. The spectrum
    utilization ratio is also evaluated in TASG framework with the same conclusions
    shown in VIOLET. In TODA, the performance of the mechanism is evaluated in terms
    of social efficiency which is defined as the sum of the truthful valuations of
    all winners, while the social efficiency is evaluated for comparison with the
    offline VGC mechanism. The same is made for SALSA, also considering the efficiency
    of the mechanism in terms of revenue, the revenue efficiency being defined as
    the total payment of winners. SECTION V. Conclusion This paper has presented a
    review on auction-based methods applied to radio spectrum allocation in CR networks.
    The characteristics of radio spectrum regulation and spectrum sharing have been
    highlighted along with the advantages of a dynamic spectrum access framework.
    The evidence indicates that spectrum allocation design along with well-managed
    spectrum have become critical for developing mobile services, broadcasting, and
    broadband access. Incumbents and new entrants increasingly resort to wireless
    technologies to modernize and expand their facilities. Only tinkering at the margin
    with existing spectrum management practice is no longer enough. In this regard,
    policies to provide additional spectrum for mobile broadband services are generally
    viewed as drivers that would stimulate technological innovation and economic growth.
    Increasing the amount of spectrum available to support new mobile technologies
    is one step toward meeting future demand for mobile services. Authors Figures

    Notes Abstract Cognitive radio (CR) has evolved as a novel technology for overcoming
    the spectrum-scarcity problem in wireless communication networks. With its opportunistic
    behaviour for improving the spectrum-usage efficiency, CR enables the desired
    secondary users (SUs) to dynamically utilize the idle spectrum owned by primary
    users. On sensing the spectrum to identify the idle frequency bands, proper spectrum-allocation
    mechanisms need to be designed to provide an effectual use of the radio resource.
    In this paper, we propose a single-sided sealed-bid sequential-bidding-based auction
    framework that extends the channel-reuse property in a spectrum-allocation mechanism
    to efficiently redistribute the unused channels. Existing auction designs primarily
    aim at maximizing the auctioneer’s revenue, due to which certain CR constraints
    remain excluded in their models. We address two such constraints, viz. the dynamics
    in spectrum opportunities and varying availability time of vacant channels, and
    formulate an allocation problem that maximizes the utilization of the radio spectrum.
    The auctioneer strategises winner determination based on bids collected from SUs
    and sequentially leases the unused channels, while restricting the channel assignment
    to a single-channel-multi-user allocation. To model the spectrum-sharing mechanism,
    we initially developed a group-formation algorithm that enables the members of
    a group to access a common channel. Furthermore, the spectrum-allocation and pricing
    algorithms are operated under constrained circumstances, which guarantees truthfulness
    in the model. An analysis of the simulation results and comparison with existing
    auction models revealed the effectiveness of the proposed approach in assigning
    the unexploited spectrum. Keywords: cognitive radio; dynamic spectrum access;

    opportunities 1. Introduction The regulation of radio spectrum usage is guided
    by a conventional procedure called static spectrum assignment that permits licensed
    users to access portions of the spectrum on a long-term basis. However, reports
    from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [1], an independent agency of
    the United States, reveal that a significant section of the licensed spectrum
    remains underutilized by its legitimate owners, both spatially and temporally.
    Such occurrences create spectrum opportunities (or spectrum holes) in the network.
    On the contrary, recent advances in wireless and mobile technologies have led
    to insufficiency of the radio spectrum, creating new challenges in resource management.
    Therefore, with an intention to dynamically exploit the unused spectrum of licensed
    users or primary users (PUs), cognitive radio (CR) [2,3,4] presents itself as
    a promising technology that uses dynamic spectrum access (DSA) [5] techniques
    and enables the opportunistic use of the spectrum holes by unlicensed users or
    secondary users (SUs) while preventing any destructive interference with the PUs.
    To facilitate dynamic spectrum allocation, one of the key elements in CR networks
    is spectrum sensing, during which SUs can discover their spectrum opportunities
    over a wide range of frequency bands. Once the free channels are known amongst
    the SUs, there arises a need to design a proper spectrum-allocation mechanism
    so that unused channels can be fairly distributed according to the demand of the
    SUs. Although spectrum allocation has been widely explored by several researchers
    in recent years, unfortunately, their work has ignored certain CR constraints
    that need to be considered in order to achieve allocation patterns with enhanced
    spectrum utilization. Different allocation models [6,7] have been developed for
    CR networks (CRNs). Amongst them, auctions are well-known market-based mechanisms
    that can efficiently manage the scarce radio resource. Several auction-based models
    have been designed for CRNs, but none of these approaches incorporate the network
    constraints that appear in CRNs. As such, there can be situations where these
    models result in a degraded performance in terms of spectrum utilization. An auction
    [8,9] is the process of selling goods to relevant bidders with the return of some
    monetary profit. Conventional single-sided auctions are being conducted worldwide
    by government bodies to assign the spectrum to the wireless service providers
    (WSPs) who submit the highest bid values [10]. However, an auction designed for
    a CR network differs from such conventional auctions. The prime intention of conventional
    auctions is to earn high income in exchange for the leased spectrum. However,
    auction theoretic models for CRNs are designed to boost the spectrum utilization,
    without concentrating much on the auctioneer’s revenue. Both single-sided auctions
    and double-sided auctions are applicable in a CR environment. In a single-sided
    auction, the primary owner (primary base station) of a network takes up the role
    of auctioneer and earns a monetary profit. The primary owner (PO) leases the channels
    left vacant by the PUs in the network. These available channels, being the auctioned
    items, get bid for by the SUs, who act as bidders. However, when the POs of the
    network take part in the auction as sellers and they compete amongst themselves
    by submitting ask values for their channels, this formulates a double-sided auction.
    A third party acts as the auctioneer who decides the clearing price based on the
    bid values and ask values received from the SUs and POs, respectively. However,
    a PO in a double auction can sell its channel only when its ask value is less
    than the winning bid value. Otherwise, the channel from the PO remains unassigned.
    In this paper, we focus on a single-sided auction mechanism that is being deployed
    for spectrum allocation in CRNs, as shown in Figure 1. We consider a sealed-bid
    auction where bidders (SUs) privately communicate their bid values to the auctioneer;
    no bidder can realize the bid values of another bidder in the game. As such, there
    appears no information exchange among the SUs, which thereby reduces the communication
    overhead. Additionally, an auction formulation designs the model in such a way
    that every participant gets an equal opportunity to win the game, and bidders
    submitting higher valuations have a greater chance of picking up the auctioned
    item. In today’s scenario, CR technology can be integrated with the 5G network,
    where the flexibility in spectrum utility provided by CR can help to achieve higher
    capacity in such networks [11,12]. Including auctions in designing radio spectrum
    allocation can impart better coordination with PUs while availing the dynamic
    spectrum in 5G networks, since PUs themselves are willing to lease their spectrum.
    Additionally, operators in such a network may not want to communicate due to security
    reasons. Here, auction mechanisms are worthwhile since operators need to convey
    their bids only to the auctioneer. Similarly, IoT-based applications [13,14] can
    also be addressed with CR. With the heavily increasing demand of IoT objects,
    it can be seen that in the near future, the allocation of the spectrum to these
    objects will become inadequate. In such an environment, spectrum-allocation mechanisms
    in CR could help the IoT objects to intelligently access the unused spectrum.
    As such, CR would provide a helping hand to different IoT-based healthcare applications,
    environmental applications, in-home applications, etc. Figure 1. Single-sided
    auction in cognitive radio networks. 1.1. Motivation Most of the existing auction-based
    approaches for CRNs deploy a double-sided auction that primarily concentrates
    on earning a good revenue for the sold channels. However, when a double auction
    is implemented, based on its allocation condition, there can be some channels
    that are left unassigned even when there are SUs who are looking for the underutilized
    channels. Such a condition restricts the use of the radio spectrum. Thus, to enhance
    the spectrum utilization, a single-sided auction becomes favourable, where all
    the channels can be allocated while abiding by the network constraints. Additionally,
    the strategy of monetary bid submission may not be suitable for formulating the
    spectrum-allocation problem in a CRN. When monetary amounts are used for bidding,
    it is not always necessary that the bidder with the highest bid value who wins
    the auction makes the best use of the assigned channel for its transmission. Instead,
    if bids are submitted in terms of a particular channel characteristic, such as
    the bandwidth, data rate, etc., then we can achieve a better usage of the spectrum
    bands. Apart from these points, there are certain network challenges that need
    to be addressed while allocating a channel in a CRN. One such challenge is the
    variation in the spectrum opportunities (SOPs) of the SUs. The dynamics in SOPs
    may not allow every SU to sense all the free channels as available. Accordingly,
    before bidding for the channels, the channel set available at each SU should be
    studied so that every winning SU receives a channel that is actually available
    at the SU. Another challenging issue in CRNs is related to the channel-availability
    time. If a PU wants to reclaim its channel that is currently being used by an
    SU for its transmission, then the SU immediately vacates the channel, which in
    turn disturbs the transmission of the SU. Since only one channel will be assigned
    to an SU in this model, there arises the need to look for the availability time
    of the channels offered for auction so that an SU can look for only those channels
    whose availability times will be longer than the time duration for which the SU
    needs the channels. Otherwise, if an SU wins a channel and, while it is using
    the channel, the SU’s transmission gets interrupted due to the PU activity, then
    this wastes the spectrum given to that particular SU, resulting in reduced spectrum
    utilization. Prior work on auction-based models in CRNs have not covered the issues
    related to the dynamics in SOPs and varying channel-availability time, due to
    which spectrum utilization as well as network throughput becomes affected. Hence,
    motivated by these observations, we planned to develop an efficient allocation
    mechanism for CRNs that could address the challenges that we have explored. In
    this paper, we propose a sequential auction-based multi-winner (SAMW) spectrum-allocation
    framework where the PO serves as the auctioneer and decides a noncooperative auction
    game among SUs (bidders). It extends the work carried out in [15], which discusses
    an allocation mechanism that applies a concurrent bidding policy to auction heterogeneous
    channels. The authors in [15] proposed a multi-winner auction mechanism where
    channels differ with respect to their maximum allowable transmission power, and
    to achieve a better performance in spectrum utilization, all the available channels
    are auctioned simultaneously so that each SU can choose its most preferred channel.
    In this work, we consider that the channels offered for auction are homogeneous,
    due to which sequential bidding becomes favourable for bid submission. To perform
    the spectrum-sensing process, we assume that the sensing result of every SU is
    available to us through the basic energy detection method [16]. Moreover, with
    the radio spectrum being interference limited and reusable among geographically
    separated users, this work enables multiple noninterfering bidders to share a
    single idle channel at a time. Such a condition facilitates an increase in spectrum
    utilization along with the revenue earned by the auctioneer. Furthermore, the
    proposed model ensures truthfulness for preventing any kind of manipulation of
    the bid values. This makes every SU bid a true valuation, while the SU is completely
    unaware of any other bidder’s bidding strategy. To evaluate the performance of
    our proposed model, we conducted simulation experiments in the MATLAB platform.
    The experimental results for our model are compared with some existing work to
    analyse the performance improvement. 1.2. Contribution This paper makes the following
    key contributions: With the channels being homogeneous, we apply the sequential
    bidding strategy for collecting the bids since the bid values from SUs can be
    improved in each round, which will in turn improve the spectrum utilization. The
    process of sequential bidding allows every channel to be auctioned one after another,
    and once an SU obtains its access to a channel, the SU–channel pair cannot further
    participate in the allocation process. Bids from an SU are decided in terms of
    the rate of data transfer that can be applied over the auctioned channel. There
    can be different bid values from an SU for each auctioned channel, even though
    the channels are homogeneous. This is because the bid values from an SU are determined
    while studying the dynamics in the SOPs of the SU and the availability time of
    the auctioned channels. Existing auction models with homogeneous channels allow
    an SU to submit a uniform bid value for every channel that is auctioned. Such
    an assumption ignores the network constraints that can appear in a CRN. A sealed-bid
    single-sided auction framework is adopted to address the spectrum-allocation problem,
    where the channel distribution is restricted to a single-channel-multi-user allocation
    constraint, which declares that each user (SU) can obtain, at most, one channel
    at a time, but a channel can be assigned to multiple non-interfering users at
    the same time. We developed two algorithms, a group-formation algorithm and spectrum-allocation
    algorithm, to plan the winner-determination strategy. Then, we developed a pricing
    algorithm that charges the winning bidders in the return of their respective assigned
    channels. 1.3. Organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section
    2 reviews the related work. The proposed spectrum-auction model is elaborately
    discussed in Section 3, where the subsections refer to the system model, the challenges
    that can arise in CRNs, the proposed auction mechanism, and proof of the auction
    properties, respectively. Section 4 provides the performance evaluation with a
    discussion of the simulation results. Finally, Section 5 provides the conclusion
    and future directions. 2. Related Work Many spectrum-sharing approaches deploying
    different allocation models, such as graph theory [17,18], game theory [19], evolutionary
    theory [20], and so forth, have been proposed for CRNs. Apart from these, auction
    theory provides a different perspective for spectrum allocation where PUs themselves
    lease their unused channels temporarily to the desired SUs. The authors in [21]
    formulated a bandwidth auction for both single-PU and multi-PU scenarios. A dynamic-updating
    algorithm plans the spectrum-assignment pattern, which can be achieved with the
    Nash equilibrium. Kash et al., in [22], define bucketing and ironing techniques
    for developing a scalable strategy-proof auction mechanism for spectrum sharing
    amongst shared and exclusive-use bidders. A bipartite graph-based auction model
    was developed in [23] where SUs and channels form the two vertex sets. Finding
    a maximal weight matching in the bipartite graph defines the winner-determination
    strategy to assign one channel to only one SU. Then, to obtain the revenue of
    the auctioneer, the authors used the general Vickrey Clarke Groves (VCG) auction.
    In [24], Amraoui et al. designed another single-sided auction scenario with a
    first-price auction and English auction. The first-price auction picks the highest
    bidding user for channel allocation. However, in the English auction, multiple
    rounds are executed to obtain the winning bidder. Two online-auction models for
    sharing randomly available spectrum are discussed in [25]. Gao et al., in [26],
    discuss the problem of maximizing the primary owner’s (auctioneer) revenue. Channels
    are characterised by their channel capacity, and for the bidding process, quality–price
    combinations are taken up such that a feasible contract can be achieved to provide
    a fair channel allocation. Another multi-item-based auction mechanism is proposed
    in [27] that allows every SU to obtain a single channel at a time. The algorithm
    developed to share the spectrum uses the first-price auction model, allowing the
    highest-paid bidder to win. A bandwidth or power auction is discussed in [28],
    where homogeneous resources are sequentially auctioned by following a second-price
    auction. The authors in [29] focus on revenue generation for the auctioneer by
    using the concept of virtual valuation during bid submission, and a suboptimal
    solution was defined to formulate the revenue-maximization problem. Another single-channel-allocation-based
    auction model is discussed in [30], where the channel-availability time is taken
    into consideration for deciding the bid value, and adjacent channels get assigned
    to non-interfering SUs such that each SU obtains a single channel at a time. Similarly,
    VERITAS, in [31], was designed as a truthful single-sided buyer-only auction to
    manage the dynamic spectrum market, which further aims at improving the spectrum
    utilization. Several double-auction models have also been designed to resolve
    the channel-allocation problem. A double-auction mechanism that models spectrum
    reuse as an SINR model was deployed in [32]. This approach primarily aims at optimizing
    the profit and energy across the network and allows every SU to be assigned only
    one channel. In [33], PreDA uses the concept of the preference list (based on
    SINR values) to gather bids from the SUs. The formation of virtual groups encourages
    channel reuse in the model along with multi-channel allocation. Another double-auction
    model was proposed in [34], where both the seller and buyer sides are decoupled
    to organize the spectrum separately. On the buyer side, graph partitioning and
    the further merging of the subgraphs determines the allocation pattern. Consecutively,
    the sellers follow a traditional method to decide the winners and their respective
    revenue. In the auction model developed in [35], both the PU and the SUs are allowed
    to share a common channel constrained to a threshold limit of the interference
    temperature. TAMES, in [36], involves a multi-seller-multi-buyer double auction
    that creates spatial reusability via an interference graph with sequential grouping.
    In [37], another online-auction model named LOTUS was designed that introduces
    the concept of the interference discount. An adaptive-auction mechanism is discussed
    in [38], where two different auctions, a local auction and global auction, are
    implemented with an intention to improve the revenue of the sellers. In [39],
    an auction is carried out in a cooperative CRN to resolve both spectrum allocation
    and relay allocation by proposing two different auction schemes. Another relay-based
    auction model is introduced in [40], which performs relay selection using a Vickrey
    auction and uses both decode-and-forward and amplify-and-forward protocols for
    sharing the spectrum. Table 1 compares the existing research that uses auctions
    for spectrum allocation in CRNs. Table 1. Literature study on auction models used
    for spectrum allocation in cognitive radio networks (CRNs). A literature survey
    on auction designs unveiled that single-sided auctions have not been extensively
    studied in CRNs. In a practical scenario, a cellular network conducts the single-sided
    auction, where a base station acts as the auctioneer. When the idle channels of
    the users are auctioned among the SUs (of an ad hoc CRN), the spectrum utilization
    can be significantly improved with the single-sided auction, and revenue is drawn
    by the network provider. Additionally, the survey shows that the existing approaches
    have not incorporated certain network constraints of CRNs, which need to be investigated
    in further research work. The dynamics in the SOPs and differences in the availability
    time of the unused channels are two such network constraints, which when integrated
    in the auction model, can provide a better spectrum usage as well as being able
    to increase the network throughput. This study developed an auction mechanism
    with sequential bidding that permits channel reusability while taking into account
    both the network constraints. 3. Auction Model for Spectrum Allocation in CRN
    This section provides an elaborate discussion of our proposed model. Additionally,
    challenges that appear in CRNs and proofs of auction properties are discussed
    in this section. 3.1. System Model We assume there is a network with both primary
    and secondary users. Primary users allow opportunistic access to their free channels
    to secondary users through a single-sided auction model. True valuations are submitted
    as bid values while abiding by the availability time constraint of the channels.
    Winner determination and payment strategies are carried out by the auctioneer
    with an aim to improve the overall spectrum utilization. Spectrum allocation applies
    the channel-availability constraint among the SUs and single-channel-multi-user-allocation
    constraint for spectrum reuse to achieve an efficient allocation mechanism. A
    cognitive radio network consisting of N SUs (bidders), 𝒩 = {1,2,3, ..., N}, coexists
    with a primary network. PUs are willing to give away a total of M idle channels,
    ℳ = {1,2,3, ..., M}, among N SUs, where it is assumed that 𝑁>𝑀 . The PO auctions
    the channels left unused by PUs while allowing them to be reused by non-interfering
    users and, in return, earns a revenue. To communicate with the auctioneer, a dedicated
    common-control channel (CCC) in the licensed band [41] can be utilized amongst
    the SUs along with the OFDMA access mechanism. Now, to discover the channel availability
    for each SU, spectrum sensing needs to be carried out before triggering the allocation
    process, where the same set of channels may not be available to every SU. Such
    a variation in the SOPs of the SUs arises due to differences in SU capabilities
    [42]. This constructs a channel-availability matrix, 𝐶= { 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 | 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1}}
    𝑁×𝑀 , where 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 if SU i senses channel j and finds it to be available; otherwise,
    𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 . According to the channel-availability constraint, a channel j can be
    assigned to an SU i only if 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 . The interference relationship among geographically
    separated SUs is represented using an interference matrix, 𝑋= { 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 ∈{0,1}}
    𝑁×𝑁 , where 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 if SUs i and k cannot be assigned the same channel simultaneously
    since they are interfering; otherwise, 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =0 . Moreover, the SUs in this model
    look for channels with higher channel-availability time, since due to particular
    PU activity, a free channel may become reclaimed by the licensed user, which seems
    to disturb the data transmission of the SU. The availability time of a channel
    can be estimated during the sensing phase accordingly, as in [43]. In [43], every
    channel is configured as an ON–OFF model where the OFF phase specifies the time
    period in which the owner leaves the channel unused. It is during this period
    when the SUs can utilize the channel without causing any interference to the owner.
    Thus, with 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) being the channel-availability time for a channel j, SU i submits
    its bid for channel j only when the channel requirement time of SU i for channel
    j, 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) , is less than or equal to 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . For every SU who senses channel
    j as available, 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) is approximately similar. In this model, we assume that
    the transmission time and propagation delay together give the channel requirement
    time, 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) . The distance to the receiver and propagation speed provide the
    propagation delay for the SU i. To obtain the transmission time, the size of the
    message transmitted by the SU i and data rate over channel j need to be used.
    As such, on auctioning a channel, the bid value determined by an SU for the channel
    is the data rate that the SU uses for its transmission over the channel. Another
    consideration is for homogeneous channels, where all the available channels are
    similar in their characteristics. In the literature, when channels are homogeneous,
    authors consider that an SU chooses a uniform valuation of all the channels. However,
    in this model, the bid submitted by an SU i for each channel j differs with respect
    to 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . Now, on auctioning a channel j, the SU i decides the valuation for
    the channel, given as 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Initially, when channel j is auctioned, the 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)
    of SU i is obtained by taking the channel capacity of j (the channel capacity
    is same for all the channels). Accordingly, 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is decided as per the following
    conditions. If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 =0 , since the channel is unavailable at the
    SU. If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) > 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 = 0. With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) will increase and cannot proceed towards 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)
    = 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 = the channel capacity. With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) > 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) . If 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1 and 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) < 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) , then 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 < the channel capacity,
    but 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is chosen such that the condition 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) ≥ 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗) continues to hold.
    For instance, consider a channel C1 with a channel capacity of 4.2 bps and 𝑇 𝐴(1)
    of 2.806 s. Three SUs, S1, S2, and S3, have message sizes of 10, 8, and 12 bits
    and propagation delays of 0.30, 0.20, and 0.45 s. Thus, 𝑣 11 =4.07 (10/4.07 +
    0.30 = 2.757 < 2.806), 𝑣 12 =3.50 (8/3.50 + 0.20 = 2.485 < 2.806), and 𝑣 13 =0
    (12/4.20 + 0.45 = 3.30 > 2.806). Therefore, for S3, the condition cannot be satisfied
    even on submitting 4.2 as the bid. Moreover, 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 is decided only when 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1
    . To represent the channel assignments among SUs, a channel-allocation matrix
    𝐴= { 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 | 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1}} 𝑁×𝑀 is used, where 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 if SU i gets access to channel
    j; otherwise, 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =0 . With the allocation constraint stating that one SU can
    acquire, at mos,t one vacant channel at a time, the rows of the allocation matrix
    become imposed on ∑ 𝑀 𝑗=1 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ≤1 , ∀𝑖 ∈ 𝒩 . Now, the SUs look to submit their
    bid values for the valuated channel wherein 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 represents the bid given away
    by SU i to get access to channel j. Every SU, constrained to the sequential-bidding
    condition, submits the valuation as its bid value, which assures a truthful auction.
    As such, when channel j is auctioned among SUs, a bidding vector 𝐵 𝑗 is built
    up such that 𝐵 𝑗 = { 𝑏 𝑗1 , 𝑏 𝑗2 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑁 }, where bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 is given
    by Equation (1). 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨       𝑣 𝑗𝑖 0 if ∑ 𝑞=1 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑞 =0 otherwise
    (1) Therefore, for M channels, the bidding vectors formed during the sequential
    strategy are 𝐵 1 , 𝐵 2 , ..., 𝐵 𝑀 . Incorporating a sealed-bid auction game in
    the model takes bid values as private information from the bidders. Thereafter,
    once a channel is allocated to the winner SUs, every winner SU i has to pay a
    price, 𝑝 𝑖 , to the auctioneer. P = { 𝑝 1 , 𝑝 2 , ..., 𝑝 𝑖 , ..., 𝑝 𝑁 } represents
    a price vector where 𝑝 𝑖 is the expense incurred by SU i on acquiring a particular
    channel. However, during the implementation of the pricing strategy, situations
    may arise where the PO may receive zero payment from a winner SU. To enable the
    PO to earn a minimal payment for its leased channels, we consider that the PO
    sets a reserve price on auctioning each channel sequentially. 𝑟 𝑗 represents the
    reserve price for channel j when the channel is auctioned in the jth round, and
    𝑟 𝑗 can be obtained using Equation (2). 𝑟 𝑗 ≤min{ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ∈ 𝐵 𝑗 }s.t. 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠0, 𝑟
    𝑗 ≠0 (2) Thus, when channel j gets assigned, the PO earns at least the reserve
    price 𝑟 𝑗 as its revenue. The utility earned by an SU is the difference between
    the valuation of the user for a channel and the price paid on acquiring the channel.
    The utility, 𝑢 𝑖 , of an SU i for a channel j can be represented as shown in Equation
    (3). 𝑢 𝑖 ={ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 − 𝑝 𝑖 0 if 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 otherwise (3) After leasing all the available
    channels, the auctioneer earns a revenue, ℛ , which includes the total price paid
    by the winner SUs and can be given by Equation (4). ℛ= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑝 𝑖 (4) The proposed
    approach tries to enhance the spectrum utilization, 𝒮 𝑢 , where 𝒮 𝑢 can be interpreted
    as the sum of the winning bid values from the SUs for all the assigned channels.
    With the channel allocation 𝐴= { 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 } 𝑁×𝑀 obtained from the bids submitted to
    the auctioneer, the spectrum utilization, 𝒮 𝑢 , can be given by Equation (5).
    𝒮 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 (5) Figure 2 shows a diagrammatic representation
    of the system model, where three channels, C1, C2, and C3, are auctioned among
    eight SUs, S1 to S8. Following the sequential-bidding strategy, when channel C1
    is to be allocated, the auctioneer receives bids from S1, S2, S3, and S5 and thereby
    assigns the channel to S1 and S3. For channel C2, even though S1 finds C2 to be
    available, it cannot bid for C2 since it has already been allocated the channel
    C1. Similarly, S1, S2, S3, and S7 cannot bid for C3. Figure 2. Diagrammatic representation
    of system model. To provide an efficient channel allocation, the proposed approach
    aims at maximizing the spectrum utilization across the network. Therefore, the
    problem for efficient channel allocation can be stated as an optimization problem
    as shown in Equation (6). Maximize 𝒮 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 subjectto (𝑖)
    𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =0,if 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =0 (𝑖𝑖) 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 + 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 ≤1,if 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 (𝑖𝑖𝑖) ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ≤1,∀𝑖 (𝑖𝑣)
    ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =𝑛,0≤𝑛≤𝑁,∀𝑗 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∈{0,1};𝑖,𝑘∈𝒩;𝑗∈ℳ (6) According to Equation (6),
    the channel-availability constraint (i), interference constraint (ii), and single-channel-multi-user-allocation
    constraint (iii) and (iv) are considered while designing the auction mechanism
    so that the spectrum utilization efficiency can be boosted in the CR network.
    Auction Properties The auction properties that are used for the single-sided auctions
    are as follows: Individual rationality: An auction is individually rational if
    no winning bidder pays a price that is higher than the bid value submitted for
    the auctioned item that it won. This implies that every winner will have a non-negative
    utility. Thus, when 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 =1 , the winning SU i pays a payment 𝑝 𝑖 where 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥
    𝑝 𝑖 . Truthfulness: An auction is truthful if no bidder can improve its utility
    by submitting a bid value that is different from its true valuation, 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 , no matter how other bidders bid for the item. Truthfulness is important to
    avoid market manipulations of the bid values to ensure an efficient auction. Bidding
    the true private valuation maximizes the bidders’ utility. 3.2. Challenges This
    section discusses the issues that arise when CR constraints are excluded in the
    spectrum-auction model, and the second-price auction for multi-winner allocation.
    3.2.1. Dynamics in SOPs In a CRN, every SU may not sense all the free channels.
    A channel available at one SU may become unavailable at another SU. This occurs
    due to the different hardware constraints faced by an SU during the sensing process
    [43]. Such a constraint also affects the channel-allocation process because if
    an SU bids for a channel that is not available with it and, going by the winner-determination
    strategy, if the SU wins the channel, then the channel will again remain unused,
    as the SU cannot perform any transmission. This degrades the spectrum utilization
    as well as the network throughput. Previously designed auction models for CRNs
    consider that an SU bids for all channels without having any prior knowledge on
    the channel availability of the SU. Additionally, some work considers that all
    the channels are available to each SU, which is generally not a practical scenario
    in CRNs. Thus, to absorb such a CR constraint, an SU has to initially sense its
    available channels before starting the bidding process. 3.2.2. Channel-Availability
    Time In a CRN, a channel allocated to an SU may become unavailable due to the
    return of the PU who leased the channel. Such a situation disturbs the transmission
    process of the SU. In an auction model, to avoid bidding for such channels, the
    SU needs to study the channel-availability time of every available channel. Thereafter,
    the SU bids for the channel only when its availability time is more than the time
    that the SU requires to transmit over the channel. None of the existing auction
    models for CRNs have incorporated this constraint while modelling the channel-allocation
    problem. Due to this, a winner SU may have to vacate its channel before completing
    its transmission, and this thereby results in a wastage of the assigned radio
    spectrum. Hence, excluding such a constraint can adversely affect the spectrum
    utilization as well as the network throughput. 3.2.3. Second-Price Auction The
    second-price auction (or Vickrey auction) [8] provides a truthful design model
    for single-unit auction scenarios that allows single-winner allocation (an auctioned
    item given to, at most, one bidder). When the second-price auction is being deployed
    to lease an item, the bidder with the highest bid value wins the item and pays
    the highest losing bid. This guarantees an optimal and truthful allocation of
    the auctioned item. Now, when sequential bidding is applied for bid collection,
    every channel is auctioned one by one in multiple rounds, and this relates to
    a single-unit auction in each round, where a second-price auction can be used
    to obtain an optimal allocation. However, such an auction is not suitable for
    multi-winner allocation, where one channel can be assigned to multiple non-interfering
    users. Therefore, on extending the second-price auction for channel reuse, we
    should be able to map different non-interfering SUs to one channel. To implement
    a simple framework (called the general sequential auction (GSA)) with the reusability
    feature, we assume that for the auctioned channel, the bidder with the highest
    bid is declared as a winner. Then, we move to the bidder having the second-highest
    bid. If the bidder does not conflict with the winning SU and satisfies the allocation
    constraint, then they too get included in the winner list. Otherwise, the third-highest
    bidder is picked up. This process repeats till the last SU in the list is reached.
    Such a method can lead to a group of non-interfering SUs for each channel. However,
    here, we may not obtain the group having a high total valuation for the channel,
    and this can reduce the use of the spectrum bands. Thus, the challenge in our
    proposed model is to choose the groups of SUs that can give a high total valuation
    and, thereafter, improve the overall spectrum usage. 3.3. SAMW Model The auction-based
    spectrum-allocation model SAMW tries to allocate the licensed spectrum efficiently
    in a CR environment. SAMW follows the procedure of the second-price auction by
    integrating spectrum reuse, where it maps a group of non-interfering SUs to a
    channel and maintains the economic properties. The PO auctions the available channels
    in decreasing order of their channel-availability times in M (the total number
    of channels) different rounds, allowing one channel in each round. That is, 𝑇
    𝐴(1) ≥ 𝑇 𝐴(2) ≥ 𝑇 𝐴(3) ≥...≥ 𝑇 𝐴(𝑀) An SU i who cannot win the auctioned channel
    in the jth round will decide to submit a higher bid in the (𝑗+1) th round. Bidders
    increase their bids so that their chances of winning the (𝑗+1) th channel increases.
    Moreover, such a strategy helps to improve the overall spectrum utilization along
    with the PO’s revenue. However, in cases where 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) = 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1) and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = the
    channel capacity, the SU i has to submit the same bid as in the jth round, i.e.,
    𝑏 (𝑗+1)𝑖 = the channel capacity. Again, when 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) ≠ 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1) and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = the
    channel capacity, the SU i cannot bid for the (𝑗+1) th channel since 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗+1)
    will be less that 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖(𝑗+1)) . For instance, let SUs, S1, S2, and S3, be the
    three bidders in the game where interference exists between S1 and S3, and S2
    and S3. Consider two channels C1 and C2 with channel capacities of 42 bps and
    availability times 𝑇 𝐴(1) =2.60 s and 𝑇 𝐴(2) =2.80 s, respectively. Both channels
    are available to all three SUs. Figure 3 and Figure 4 provide a diagrammatic view
    of this example. With sequential bidding, C2 is auctioned in the first round,
    and the bids are 𝑏 21 =3.32 , 𝑏 22 =3.71 , and 𝑏 23 =4.11 . Consider that S3 wins
    the channel C2. Now, in second round, remaining SUs will increase their bid values
    so that they can get the channel. 𝑏 11 =3.69 and 𝑏 12 =3.85 are the bids for C1.
    Thus, with multi-winner allocation, both S1 and S2 win C1, and the spectrum utilization
    obtained is 11.65. Now, let us consider concurrent bidding where all the channels
    are auctioned simultaneously. As such, every SU bids for all its available channels,
    giving 𝑏 11 =3.16 , 𝑏 12 =3.87 , and 𝑏 13 =3.56 for channel C1 and 𝑏 21 =3.32
    , 𝑏 22 =3.71 , and 𝑏 23 =4.11 for channel C2. The SUs S1 and S2 win channel C1
    and the SU S3 wins channel C2, giving an overall spectrum utilization of 11.14.
    Therefore, with homogeneous channels, sequential bidding is preferable since the
    bid values increase in each round, which always increases the spectrum utilization.
    However, no such strategy for bid submission can be applied in concurrent bidding.
    In the proposed model, on auctioning a channel j in the jth round, a bid vector
    𝐵 𝑗 gets formed and the PO sets a reserve price 𝑟 𝑗 based on the bids in 𝐵 𝑗 .
    Finally, when a channel is allocated to the winner SUs, the SUs and the channel
    can no longer take part in the further allocation process. Figure 3. Sequential
    bidding for homogeneous channels. Figure 4. Concurrent bidding for heterogeneous
    channels. Three different algorithms are carried out to solve the channel-allocation
    problem in the SAMW model. They are the group-formation algorithm, spectrum-allocation
    algorithm, and pricing algorithm. Figure 5 shows a flowchart representation of
    the proposed auction process, which implements the three algorithms on auctioning
    each channel. Initially, on starting the auction for a channel j, SUs decide their
    respective valuations for the channel and thereafter submit their bid values according
    to Equation (1). Furthermore, the three algorithms are carried out to decide the
    winners and the payment for the channel. Figure 5. Flowchart representation of
    the proposed auction process. 3.3.1. Group-Formation Algorithm This algorithm
    (Algorithm 1) forms groups of non-interfering SUs such that a common channel can
    be assigned to a group. It is executed for every auctioned channel one by one,
    where a winning bid value and a winner set of SUs are computed for every SU who
    bids for the channel. This constructs a winning-value vector, 𝒲 , and a winner-group
    vector, 𝒮 , which holds the winning bid value and winner set of SUs, respectively,
    for every SU bidding for the channel. Now, on auctioning a channel j, every SU
    computes a winner-deciding matrix, Z, one by one, given as 𝑍= { 𝑧 𝑖𝑘 } ∣𝒩∣×∣𝒩∣
    , where for the ith row, 𝑧 𝑖𝑘 = 𝑧 𝑖𝑙 = 1 implies that SUs k and l can be taken
    together for assigning the auctioned channel. For each SU i ∈𝒩 , matrix Z is initialized
    to 0, after which different SU combinations that include SU i are computed for
    the auctioned channel j while taking into account the interference and channel-availability
    constraints. Then, from Z, the SU combination that gathers the highest total valuation
    for the given channel is considered for further action. However, if ties occur
    for the total valuation, any one of the SU combinations is randomly picked. A
    winning-value vector 𝒲= { 𝑤 𝑖 } 1×∣𝒩∣ is built up, where 𝑤 𝑖 is the highest total
    valuation obtained from Z for SU i, and 𝑤 𝑖 = 0 when 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 = 0, which implies that
    SU i has no bid for channel j. To begin with, 𝑤 𝑖 is initialized to 0, ∀𝑖∈𝒩 .
    Additionally, a winner-group vector 𝒮= { 𝑠 𝑖 } 1×∣𝒩∣ , where 𝑠 𝑖 ⊆ {1,2,3, ...,
    N}, is constructed that holds the SU combination corresponding to the valuation
    entered in 𝑤 𝑖 . This implies that every element of 𝒮 is itself a vector of SUs,
    where initially, ∀𝑖∈𝒩 , 𝑠 𝑖 is taken to be empty. Once the algorithm completes,
    we get the groups that can participate in the auction process for channel j. For
    the computational complexity of Algorithm 1, we find that for every ith iteration
    of the outermost loop, the two inner loops run N times each. For every qth iteration
    of the first inner loop, there appears another inner loop that runs N times. Then,
    for every kth iteration, there can be (𝑁−1) runs to check for interference conditions
    in l∈SUList in the algorithm. Similarly, for every gth iteration of the second
    inner loop, another innermost loop runs N times. Hence, the overall time complexity
    for Algorithm 1 is computed to be O( 𝑁 4 ). 3.3.2. Spectrum-Allocation Algorithm
    With Algorithm 2, spectrum allocation is carried out for the auctioned channel.
    After 𝑤 𝑖 values are determined for all the SUs who bid for the channel j, we
    implement Algorithm 2, which picks the SU combination corresponding to the maximum
    total valuation in 𝒲 , and this accordingly updates the allocation matrix for
    channel j. For the computational complexity, there can be N runs for updating
    the allocation matrix, giving the time complexity as O(N) for Algorithm 2. 3.3.3.
    Pricing Algorithm On acquiring the channel j, every winning SU i needs to pay
    a price 𝑝 𝑖 to the auctioneer. If SU i remains unassigned, then 𝑝 𝑖 =0 . Otherwise,
    to compute 𝑝 𝑖 , Algorithm 3 is executed. A group of SUs who are interfering with
    SU i but not with other winners of channel j are gathered in 𝒟 . 𝐵 𝑗 ̃ holds the
    respective bids 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 , ∀𝑘∈𝒟 . Thereafter, Algorithm 1 takes 𝐵 𝑗 ̃ and 𝒟 as input
    to compute the highest total valuation from 𝑊 ̃ = { 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ } 1×∣𝒟∣ . If 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ =𝑚𝑎𝑥(
    𝑊 ̃ ) , then the payment 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑤 𝑖 ̃ . Otherwise, if ∄𝒟 satisfies the conditions
    for payment, then 𝑝 𝑖 is the reserve price, 𝑟 𝑗 , set for the channel. O( 𝑁 2
    ) gives the computational complexity for Algorithm 3. In brief, the proposed auction-based
    approach for spectrum allocation deploys a sequential-bidding policy that tries
    to proffer channel reuse while restricting to channel-availability and interference
    and allocation constraints, and eventually trying to enhance the overall spectrum
    utilization across the network. 3.4. Proof of Auction Properties Theorem 1. SAMW
    is individually rational. Proof of Theorem 1. For the proposed mechanism to be
    individually rational, every winner SU i has to pay a price 𝑝 𝑖 on wining a channel
    j such that 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 when 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 = 1. According to the payment strategy in Algorithm
    3, SU i, on wining channel j, pays a price 𝑝 𝑖 from 𝒟 . There appears a group
    of SUs, 𝒢 , in 𝒟 , such that 𝑝 𝑖 = ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ . Here, ∀h ∈𝒢 , 𝑥 𝑖ℎ =1 and 𝑥 𝑓ℎ
    =0 ∀𝑓∈𝒩 , where f is a winner SU of the channel j other than SU i. Moreover, ∑
    ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ gives the highest total valuation in 𝒟 for channel j, where ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏
    𝑗ℎ ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Otherwise, if there is no such 𝒟 to get the payment, then 𝑝 𝑖 is the
    reserve price and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑟 𝑗 according to Equation (2). As such, the 𝑝 𝑖 from
    SU i for channel j cannot be greater than bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , which in turn provides non-negative
    utility to SU i, i.e., 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 0.    □ Lemma 1. Given 𝐵 𝑗 = ( 𝑏 𝑗1 , 𝑏 𝑗2 ,...,
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ,..., 𝑏 𝑗𝑁 ), bids submitted by SUs on auctioning channel j. If SU i wins
    the auction for channel j by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , then it also wins the channel by bidding
    𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 (provided that all other conditions remain same). Proof of Lemma
    1. On auctioning channel j, an SU i wins the channel by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , which incurs
    the highest total valuation along with the other non-interfering winners for the
    channel. If ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 such that 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 =0 , this implies that 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 =1 (other
    winners are non-conflicting with SU k). Otherwise, if 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , then SU i
    cannot win with 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, submitting 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 will again allow SU i to
    win the channel. Additionally, if ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 such that 𝑎 𝑘𝑗 =0 , this implies
    that SU k interferes with some winner SU of channel j (other than SU i), which
    would a provide lesser or equal valuation for the channel. On bidding 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 >
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i still wins the channel j irrespective of 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 or 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 <
    𝑏 𝑗𝑘 since the inclusion of 𝑏 ′ 𝑗𝑖 among the winning bid values increases the
    highest total valuation for the channel. □ Theorem 2. SAMW is truthful. Proof
    of Theorem 2. Let 𝑢 𝑖 and 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 represent the utility when SU i bids its true
    value 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and an untruthful bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 for a channel j, respectively. The
    proposed mechanism is truthful when no SU i can improve its utility 𝑢 𝑖 by submitting
    a bid value 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≠ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 for channel j, i.e., 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 (provided that all other
    conditions remain same). Case 1: 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 By Lemma 1, it cannot be true that
    bidder i wins the auction by bidding 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 but loses when it bids 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 since 𝑏
    𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, the three subcases that can arise are: (1) When SU i loses the
    game by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 ; the utility obtained is 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 = 0 as
    per Equation (3). (2) SU i wins on bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 but loses for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , which gives
    a utility 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . With 𝑝 𝑖 and 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 being the payment for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑏 𝑗𝑖
    respectively, 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑢 𝑖 = 0. For 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 to lose, there can be a situation where
    ∃ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 1, such that the total valuation including 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 is higher
    than or equal to that including 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Additionally, there can be another situation
    where there appears a group of SUs, 𝒢 , such that ∀h ∈𝒢 , 𝑥 𝑖ℎ = 1, and 𝑏 𝑗ℎ <
    𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , but ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Since 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 wins the game, this implies
    that 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 or 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = ∑ ∀ℎ∈𝒢 𝑏 𝑗ℎ , following Algorithm 3. Hence, this
    gives 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . (3) When SU i wins by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , this provides
    𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . With 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 winning the game, there may appear a bid 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 ≥ 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and
    𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 0 such that in one situation, SU k wins the channel j along with SU i,
    whereas in another situation, SU k cannot win the channel j even when 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 0
    because SU k interferes with a winner SU of channel j other than SU i, which yields
    a higher total valuation for the channel. On bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i still wins, giving
    a payment 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , where 𝑝 𝑖 is the payment for 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , since the highest
    valued group in 𝒟 is less than or equal to 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 . Additionally, with 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 = 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 and 𝑥 𝑖𝑘 = 1, when SU i wins the channel and SU k loses, 𝑝 𝑖 = 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 if SU k
    is not interfering with other winners of channel j. Otherwise, 𝑝 𝑖 ≤ 𝑏 𝑗𝑘 . With
    𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , SU i wins by paying 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , giving 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . Case 2: 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 < 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 By Lemma 1, it cannot be true that bidder i wins the auction by bidding 𝑏 𝑗𝑖
    but loses when it bids 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 since 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 > 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 . Thus, the three subcases that
    can arise are: (1) For proving that SU i loses the game by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and
    𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , the same analysis as provided in Case 1 is used, which gives 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′
    𝑖 = 0. (2) When SU i wins with 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 and loses with 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 , 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 = 0. However,
    according to Theorem 1, 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 0, which states that 𝑢 𝑖 ≥ 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 . (3) When SU i
    wins by bidding both 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 and 𝑣 𝑗𝑖 , a similar situation arises as discussed in
    Case 1. However, for 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 to win, 𝑏 𝑗𝑖 ≥ 𝑝 𝑖 , where 𝑝 𝑖 is the payment for 𝑣
    𝑗𝑖 . This gives 𝑝 ′ 𝑖 = 𝑝 𝑖 , and accordingly, 𝑢 𝑖 = 𝑢 ′ 𝑖 .  Algorithm 1: Group-formation
    algorithm.  Algorithm 2: Spectrum-allocation algorithm.  Algorithm 3: Pricing
    algorithm. This completes the proof that a bidder cannot improve its utility by
    submitting a bid value that is different from the true valuation. □ 4. Performance
    Evaluation To evaluate the performance of SAMW, a MATLAB-based simulation was
    carried out as described in this section. We consider a CR environment with a
    PO acting as the auctioneer, who handles multiple bidders (SUs) that are randomly
    distributed in an area of size 800 × 800 m. We assume that the sensing data are
    obtained through an available robust sensing process, and this provides the set
    of free channels to each SU. Interference among the SUs was modelled by applying
    the distance-based criterion [44]. The channels available were taken to be GSM
    channels with a bandwidth of 200 KHz and channel capacity of 270 Kbps. First,
    we examined the proposed approach, SAMW, by comparing it with a general sequential
    auction (GSA), which applies a second-price auction with channel reuse as described
    in Section 3.2.3. Additionally, we compared SAMW with VERITUS [31]. VERITUS was
    chosen among the existing approaches since it is a single-sided model that also
    aims at improving the spectrum utilization, identically to SAMW. We considered
    that VERITUS abides by the network constraints and accordingly gathers the bids.
    However, in VERITUS, bids are submitted at once for all the channels since the
    channels are auctioned concurrently. Additionally, each SU will request only one
    channel according to the allocation constraint. Two different network scenarios
    were deployed, where in one scenario, the number of channels was varied as {4,6,8,10,12,14},
    keeping the number of SUs unchanged at 40, and in the other scenario, the number
    of SUs was varied as {20,30,40,50,60}, keeping the number of channels unchanged
    at 6. Then, we also explored the confidence intervals at the 95% confidence level
    for all the scenarios. Second, we compared SAMW (which allows spectrum reuse)
    with a simple second-price auction, which follows single-winner allocation. This
    explored the change in spectrum utilization with and without spectrum reuse. Third,
    to show the influence of the dynamics in SOPs and differences in channel-availability
    time in CRNs, we compared our model with VERITUS, where in VERITUS, none of the
    network constraints were incorporated (as in the actual model) to frame the model.
    For each type of scenario, we ran the simulation for 500 rounds to take the average
    values for each performance metric. The performance metrics used for evaluating
    SAMW are as follows: Average utility, ( 𝐴𝑣 𝑔 𝑢 ): This is the ratio of utility
    obtained by all the winning SUs to the total number of participating SUs, as expressed
    in Equation (7). 𝐴𝑣 𝑔 𝑢 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑢 𝑖 𝑁 (7) User satisfaction ( 𝑈 𝑠 ): This is
    the ratio of the winner SU count for all the available channels to the total number
    of participating SUs, as expressed in Equation (8). 𝑈 𝑠 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑀 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑎 𝑖𝑗
    𝑁 (8) Spectrum utilization ( 𝒮 𝑢 ): This computes the total winning bids from
    the winners as expressed in Equation (5). Revenue ( ℛ ): This gives the total
    earning of the auctioneer as expressed in Equation (4). Successful user ratio
    ( 𝒮 𝑟 ): This metric is used to show how the two network constraints can have
    an affect on the performance of the designed model. 𝒮 𝑟 is the ratio of the number
    of winning SUs who can complete their transmission to the total number of winning
    SUs in the model. 𝒮 𝑟 = ∑ 𝑖=1 ( 𝑇 𝐴(𝑗) > 𝑇 𝑅(𝑖𝑗)) 𝑁 ∑ 𝑗=1 ∧( 𝑐 𝑖𝑗 =1) 𝑀 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 ∑
    𝑀 𝑗=1 ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 𝑎 𝑖𝑗 (9) Discussion In Figure 6a–d, we show the plots for the performance
    metrics obtained by varying the number of channels. In Figure 7a–h, the confidence
    intervals for the performance metrics shown were obtained at the 95% confidence
    level by considering two different cases, four channels with 40 SUs and 12 channels
    with 40 SUs. These two cases represent the upper limit and the lower limit, respectively,
    for the graphs Figure 6a–d along the x-axis. From Figure 6a and Figure 7a,b, we
    can observe that with an increase in the number of channels, the spectrum utilization
    increases for all the approaches. This is due to the greater availability of spectrum
    resources, which allows a higher number of users to access the spectrum. The performance
    of the GSA is degraded as compared to that of SAMW because in the GSA, when a
    channel is auctioned, it starts by picking the highest-bidding SUs sequentially
    while restricting to network constraints. However, such an approach may not provide
    the highest-valued group for each channel, and this thereby decreases the use
    of the spectrum in the GSA. However, when the number of channels increases and
    gets closer to the number of SUs, then the GSA can outperform SAMW in certain
    cases. This occurs because a bidder who is chosen as a winner for a channel during
    SAMW may not be considered as a winner on auctioning the same channel with the
    GSA. This bidder then submits a higher valuation for another channel in the GSA,
    which when acquired by the bidder, improves the spectrum utilization. Additionally,
    VERITUS shows a decrease in its performance as compared to SAMW because in VERITUS,
    bids for all the available channels are collected concurrently, and the allocation
    process proceeds without considering the highest-valued group for every channel.
    Similarly, the revenue earned by the auctioneer increases with an increase in
    the number of channels as shown in Figure 6b and Figure 7c,d since a higher number
    of items are now available for auction. The payment algorithms are different in
    all three approaches. In the GSA, we pick the next-highest bidder for payment.
    In VERITUS, the next-highest bidder is picked while taking into account certain
    constraints in the model. In SAMW, we follow Algorithm 3 for payment, where SUs
    interfering with the winner are taken along with other different considerations.
    Thus, the revenue earnings with SAMW greatly depend on the interference status
    of the users in the network. Now, going by the payment algorithm in SAMW, we can
    find several winning bidders paying the reserve price, which thereby deteriorates
    the revenue in SAMW as compared to in the GSA and VERITUS. However, the use of
    the reserve price in SAMW helps the auctioneer to earn at least a minimal payment
    (always greater than zero) for each leased channel, which further improves the
    overall revenue. From Figure 6c and Figure 7e,f, we find that SAMW shows a greater
    improvement in average utility as compared to the other two approaches. This is
    accounted for by the payment algorithm taken up in SAMW, which creates high utility
    values (Equation (3)) amongst the winners. Similarly, user satisfaction shows
    a rise in performance as observed from Figure 6d and Figure 7g,h due to the greater
    availability of channels. When the number of channels is greater, a higher number
    of SUs can use the spectrum for their transmission. SAMW shows good results due
    to the allocation method applied in SAMW as compared to GSA and VERITUS. Figure
    6. Spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction for sequential
    auction-based multi-winner (SAMW), general sequential auction (GSA), and VERITUS
    with respect to number of channels. Figure 7. Confidence intervals at 95% confidence
    level for spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility and user satisfaction
    for 4 channels with 40 secondary users (SUs) and 14 channels with 40 SUs Figure
    8a–d display the plots for the performance metrics when we vary the number of
    SUs. Corresponding to these plots, we obtained the confidence intervals for the
    performance metrics at the 95% confidence level as shown in Figure 9a–h. Two different
    cases were considered while computing the confidence interval, 20 SUs with six
    channels and 60 SUs with six channels. These two cases represent the upper limit
    and the lower limit, respectively, for the graphs Figure 8a–d along the x-axis.
    In Figure 8a and Figure 9a,b, the spectrum utilization shows a rise in its performance
    upon increasing the count of SUs. This is because, with an increase in the number
    of SUs, there appears a higher number of bidders who can acquire the auctioned
    channel, and along with that, the range of bids gathered for the auctioned channel
    gets wider. However, the use of spectrum is comparatively less in the GSA and
    VERITUS. This is accounted for by the allocation methods deployed for both the
    approaches, where they do not look for the highest-valued group of bidders for
    each channel. Similarly, the revenue improves in all the three approaches since
    the number of buyers gets increased for an auctioned item. However, due to the
    payment algorithm designed in SAMW, the revenue gathered in SAMW is computed to
    be less compared to that for the GSA and VERITUS, which can be seen from Figure
    8b and Figure 9c,d. Then, from Figure 8c,d and Figure 9e–h, we can observe that
    the average utility and user satisfaction curves tend to decline with an increasing
    number of SUs. This is because, for same number of channels, more SUs claim to
    get access to the channel, incurring an increase in competition amongst the users.
    However, this decline appears to be moderate due to the implementation of channel
    reuse in the model. A performance comparison shows that SAMW outperforms the other
    two approaches to achieve good results in both the metrics. Figure 8. Spectrum
    utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction for SAMW, GSA, and
    VERITUS with respect to number of secondary users. Figure 9. Confidence intervals
    at 95% confidence level for spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility and
    user satisfaction for 20 SUs with 6 channels and 60 SUs with 6 channels. In Figure
    10a,b and Figure 11a,b, SAMW is compared with the second-price auction, which
    allows single-winner allocation for every auctioned channel. SAMW performs channel
    reuse where multiple non-interfering SUs can be simultaneously given a common
    channel. However, in the other approach, one channel can be assigned to only one
    bidder, whoever bids the highest. Under the two network scenarios deployed for
    simulation, we can infer that both the spectrum utilization and revenue show much
    improved performance for SAMW due to its reusability feature. Figure 10. Spectrum
    utilization and revenue for SAMW and second-price auction with respect to number
    of secondary users. Figure 11. Spectrum utilization and revenue for SAMW and second-price
    auction with respect to number of channels. Then, to show the impact of the two
    network constraints, i.e., the dynamics in the SOPs of SUs and varying availability
    time of channels, we obtained the curves shown in Figure 12a,b. Here, we simulated
    VERITUS such that it did not include any of the network constraints, according
    to [31]. Then, when we performed channel allocation in VERITUS, there could be
    some winning bidders who could not complete their transmission due to the constraints
    arising in the CRN. However, since SAMW makes up the model by incorporating such
    constraints, in SAMW, every winner SU can complete its transmission over the assigned
    channel, which can be viewed in both the figures. Accordingly, the spectrum utilization
    improves in SAMW because there is no wastage of the spectrum. Figure 12. Successful
    user ratio for SAMW and VERITUS. Hence, the results obtained through the network
    simulations state that the proposed auction model SAMW proffers an improved utilization
    of the unused radio spectrum, which in turn helps to settle the spectrum-scarcity
    problem. For the practical implementation of the auction model, we can use CR-related
    standards such as IEEE 802.22 (Wireless Regional Area Network) [45], IEEE 802.11af
    (Wi-Fi over TV whitespace) [46], etc. There should be practical infrastructural
    support and spectrum usage policy for running auctioneers, bidders, and auction
    centre functionality in the deployed network environment. 5. Conclusions In this
    paper, we propose SAMW, a single-sided sequential-bidding-based auction mechanism
    that enables spectrum reuse. On auctioning homogeneous channels, SUs offer different
    bid values according to their spectrum availability. Compared with existing research
    on CRNS, this model addresses two concerning issues surrounding CRNs, viz. the
    dynamics in the spectrum opportunities among SUs and varying availability time
    of channels, which further influence the bid-submission process. Winner determination
    and pricing strategies are carried out by the auctioneer to determine the winners
    and their respective payments. Truthful bidding strategies are used so that any
    kind of manipulation with the bid values can be avoided. Finally, the simulation
    results demonstrate that SAMW outperforms the GSA model as well as the VERITUS
    model in terms of spectrum utilization, revenue, average utility, and user satisfaction,
    which altogether enhance the network performance in a CRN. For future work, we
    would like to design a multi-channel-multi-winner-allocation scheme for CRNs by
    incorporating the CR constraints. Another future initiative could be to develop
    an energy-efficient approach that formulates an auction to allow channel allocation
    in a CRN. We can think of reducing the communication cost and computational cost
    or managing the number of phases in the auction process to achieve an energy-efficient
    solution for the spectrum-allocation problem. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction As we
    know in today''s world communication has become very effective tool in one''s
    life. Wireless communication is considered as one of the most successful contribution
    to the mankind. It is one of the fastest growing technology which has applications
    in all the fields such as medical, military, etc., and in future, it is believed
    to bring remarkable changes in the upcoming fields like virtual reality, deep
    learning, internet of things, etc. With the rise in radio devices and technologies,
    there is a huge surge in demand for the available radio spectrum which is becoming
    increasingly crowded due to underutilization of available spectrum. Presently,
    the available radio spectrum is distributed to licensed user or Primary user (PU)
    as a fixed frequency bandwidth, which is only utilized when the users use it at
    that time and free in the remaining of the time. Due to underutilization and inefficient
    use of available spectrum, hence the concept of cognitive radio is set forth.
    Cognitive Radio (CR) is an intelligent radio which can sense, learn and adapt
    to different situations concerning wireless communication and technology. Secondary
    user (SU) is an unlicensed user who can temporarily use the unused spectrum of
    primary users with the help of CR network. CR network detects the best available
    free channel in the communication media and tune the CR parameters according to
    it and allocate them to the secondary users without any interference which is
    caused during allocation and deal location of spectrum. when the primary user
    is inactive or underutilized, the CR network detects it and allocate it to the
    cognitive (secondary) users without any interference or noise and provides best
    quality of service, and if PU needs its allocated bandwidth then CR deal locates
    it from the SU in real time and allocates it to PU and at the same time it searches
    for the suitable idle channel of another PU and allocate it to the SU. The cognitive
    radio performs functions like spectrum sensing, management, mobility and sharing
    [1]. In Spectrum sensing, the CR network detects the available free channels,
    in order to use them effectively. Spectrum Management is the process of selecting
    the channels which can fulfil the communication requirements. Spectrum Mobility
    deal locates the channels from SU without any interference, if PU needs them and
    in spectrum sharing, a fair chance is given to all cognitive users to use the
    available spectrum. Lately, many evolutionary techniques such as Genetic Algorithm
    and swarm-based techniques such as Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Particle Swarm
    Optimization (PSO), Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO), Bat Algorithm (BA), etc. which
    gaining more popularity in solving search based and other complex problems. They
    are preferred because they can solve complex problems in real time and very efficiently.
    Genetic Algorithm (GA), Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), and Particle Swarm Optimization
    (PSO) are used for solving spectrum allocation problem in cognitive radio network
    by authors Zho et.al [1] and considered frequency accessibility matrix and the
    intrusion as limitations and these methods have shown better performance than
    the color sensitive graph coloring algorithm. Liu [2] used Maximal Independent
    Set [MIS] theory to solve spectrum allocation problem. Spectrum utilization, fairness
    and communication overhead are considered as constraints. The author achieves
    lowest communication overhead on the network. Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), GA
    and PSO with limitation as spectral interference is considered by the author Pradhan
    [3], and proved ABC is superior over PSO and GA methods. The main drawbacks of
    this paper are size of cognitive radio and the acceptable interference power of
    licensed user (primary user), puts constraints on transmission power of cognitive
    user and restriction on the cognitive engine design. Ant colony system (ACS) and
    graph coloring problem (GCP) are used to find a solution to the frequency allocation
    issue by author Koroupi [4]. The Results are compared with the PSO and color sensitive
    graph coloring (CSGC) algorithm. ACS and GCP showed better results when compared
    with PSO and CSGC. But the running time is slightly higher. Simulated annealing
    approach and spectrum migration model have been considered by author''s Liu et.al
    [5] to determine the optimal spectrum assignment solution. Capacity, rate requirement
    and interference are considered as constraints. The algorithm performs better
    than the random and the greedy migration approaches. Bin Hou et al. [6] have applied
    an Improved GA method for spectrum allocation. Power consumption, user rate and
    a fairness of spectrum distribution are considered as constraints to exploit the
    transfer rate of a system. It showed better results compared with the simple genetic
    algorithm. Seshadri et.al [7] have used PSO for solving frequency allocation problem
    and identified the parameters influencing the resource sharing issues in cognitive
    radio networks. The main advantage of this paper is larger the number of particles
    and higher the rehearsals rises the suitability of the variables. Binary Particle
    Swarm Optimization (BPSO) and GCP algorithms are used by author''s Snehal et.al
    [8] for finding a solution to the problem of frequency assignment in cognitive
    radio network. Noise, bandwidth and channel availability are considered as parameters.
    It overcomes the problem rises due to disparity between the spectrum properties
    and the facility demands. Improved network and fairness reward can be achieved
    compared to another algorithm. Jamal [9] has approached the problem through G
    A method. Considered limitations, like population size, cross over, the amount
    of generations and the mutation rate. For radio channel allocation problem, it
    showed better results and it also takes less execution time. It endorses the real-time
    sharing of cognitive radio spectrum. To exploit the overall transfer rate of the
    system, with limitations such as bit error rate, total power usage and individual
    transfer rate are considered by authors Mishra S et al. [10] to solve spectrum
    allocation problem by using PSO method. The authors obtained the optimal solution
    and also achieved higher transfer rate by using a smaller number of iterations.
    SECTION II. Problem Formation In the entire spectrum only a part of it is being
    used and the rest is getting wasted which leads to the sub-optimal use of the
    spectrum. Hence, spectrum allocation is to determine a way in which the alternative
    resources can efficiently utilize the rest of the spectrum which is not used and
    also takes care that when the primary user can use their spectrum without any
    kind of interference due to sharing process. The aim of the paper is to exploit
    the overall assignment rate of the system by considering parameters such as entire
    power usage, individual allocation rate and bit error rate (BER). The above parameters
    are considered to make sure the distribution of spectrum among the users are fair
    and to make sure it is energy efficient with minimum BER. Each user is allocated
    with a subcarrier and, Multiple Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (MQAM) and transmission
    power of each subcarrier is determined. A spectrum allocation of each users to
    the subcarriers is denoted as S= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ S 11 ⋮ S M1 ⋯ ⋱ ⋯ S 1N ⋮ S MN ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥
    (1) View Source Where, s MN =( A mn ,T P mn ) A mn and T P mn represents MQAM
    modulation order and transmission power for the M th user and N th subcarrier.
    The overall transfer rate of the system is given by OTR= B ∗ ∑ N n=1 ∑ M m=1 U
    mn (2) View Source Where, B refers to the subcarrier bandwidth. The system has
    M cognitive users and N subcarriers. Spectrum utilization factor is given by U
    mn ≅0.5∗lo g 2 A mn (3) View Source Which is often characterized by the probability
    of spectrum hole utilization and is defined as the successful data transmission
    by the secondary user in the given transmission time provided as spectrum hole
    is currently declared and there is no interference to primary users during the
    transmission. Bit Error Rate (BER) of the scheme is given as E mn =  E=avg( E
    mn );  ∀ m,n  such that  A mn ≠0 [ 4 log 2  Amn ][1− 1 log 2  Amn − − − − − −
    − − √ ]erfc[ 3∗ log 2 Amn∗TPmn (Amn−1)∗N − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √
    ] (4) View Source The amount of an information stream received over a channel
    due to changes caused by interference, bit synchronization errors or distortion
    is the amount of bit errors. The bit error rate (BER) is the quantity of bit errors
    per unit time. Higher the MQAM modulation order higher the average bit error rate.
    Where, erfc is the complementary error function. Overall transmission power of
    the system is represented as OTP= ∑ N n=1 ∑ M m=1 T P mn  ;  ∀ mn  such that  A
    mn ≠0 (5) View Source Higher the MQAM modulation order greater the system transfer
    power will be needed. To exploit the overall transfer rate of the scheme, following
    conditions are considered: Transfer rate of individual should be larger than lowest
    transfer rate of any user: B ∗ ∑ N m=1 U mn ≥T R min (6) View Source Where, T
    R min is the lowest transfer rate for any user in Kbits/s. Average BER across
    the system should be less than maximum permissible BER. E≤ E max (7) View Source
    Where, E max is the maximum permissible BER. E is the average BER across the scheme.
    The overall transmission power of the system should be less than the maximum overall
    power usage of the scheme. OTP≤ O P max (8) View Source Where, O P max is the
    maximum overall power usage of the scheme. OTP is the overall transmission power
    of the system. The equation (6) represents the fitness function. SECTION III.
    Technique Particle Swarm Optimization Particle Swarm Optimization is a nature
    inspired Metaheuristics algorithm which is inspired by the behaviour of swarm
    searching for food. Kennedy and Eberhart are the first to propose PSO in the year
    1995. This algorithm makes use of social behaviour and dynamic movement of birds,
    fish and insects. When the swarm of birds disperse from one place to another in
    search of food, the bird which is nearer to the food source detect it and inform
    the birds closer to it. Information sharing and cooperation is essential among
    the birds to detect the food source. According to PSO, when a bird travels from
    one place to another it is considered as an optimal solution and the food they
    search is considered as global optimum of the whole search. Personal best is the
    highest optimal value obtained by an individual bird and the Global best refers
    to the highest optimal value obtained by the swarm of birds. In PSO, birds are
    considered as particles, each particle in the population is evaluated based on
    some fitness function set by the programmer based on the problem. The positions
    and velocities of each particle are calculated for every iteration and their personal
    best and global best are updated according to it. Personal best and global best
    ensure that the particle exchange information among themselves and move towards
    the local optimum and global optimum of the solution. III. Algorithm 1. Initialize
    the secondary users (population) and subcarriers with arbitrary positions and
    velocities. 2. Find the fitness function of each secondary user with subcarrier.
    3. Find and update personal best (Pbest) and global best (gbest) of all secondary
    users (particles). 4. Compute and update the velocity of each secondary user with
    subcarrier. 5. Compute and update the position of each secondary user with subcarrier.
    6. Find the best fitness function 7. Update the fitness function as global best.
    8. Stopping criteria reached (if false go to 2) 9. End Velocity of the particle
    is defined by V new i =w∗ V old i + a 1 ∗ r 1 ∗(pbes t old i − P old i )+ a 2
    ∗ r 2 ∗ (gbes t old i − P old i ) (9) View Source Position of the particle is
    defined by P new i = P old i + V new i (10) View Source Where, P old i is the
    position of ith user with subcarrier in the previous iteration, P new i is the
    position of ith user with subcarrier in the current iteration, V old i is the
    velocity of ith user with subcarrier in the previous iteration, V new i is the
    velocity of ith user with subcarrier in the current iteration, r 1 and r 2 are
    random values between 0 and 1, w is the inertia weight, a 1 is the accelerating
    factor of local information and a 2 is accelerating factors of local and global
    information. In this paper, spectrum allocation of users to the subcarrier using
    PSO algorithm is considered. A population of users with a subcarrier is taken
    which is shown in the matrix S in Eq. (1). The fitness function of each user with
    subcarrier is determined by using Eq. (6). For each allocation of user to the
    subcarrier, personal best and global best are determined and then new velocities
    and positions are evaluated and updated. This procedure is repetitive till the
    assignment of spectrum which provides the highest overall transfer rate, with
    the limitations of overall power usage, BER and individual transfer rate, i.e.,
    the best allocation is determined. The flow chart in Fig. 1 signifies the steps
    of the projected method. Fig. 1 Proposed PSO algorithm Show All SECTION IV. Experimental
    Setup MATLAB tool is used for the execution of the proposed mechanism on a laptop
    having Intel i3 core processor and 8GB RAM. The number of iterations = 100. The
    number of users = 50. The available carriers = 1000. The sub carrier bandwidth,
    B=15 kHz , 30 kHz, 60 kHz. The MQAM modulation order, Amn=[ 16 32 64128 256] The
    minimum transfer rate, TRmin=64 Kbits/s . The maximum permit BER, Emax=0.0004%
    . The highest overall power usage, OPmax=90 W . SECTION V. Results and Discussions
    The simulation outcomes are shown in Fig. 2–11. The simulation results obtained
    shows a higher overall transfer rate of the system with faster execution time
    using PSO algorithm. The overall transfer rate increases in parallel with increase
    in modulation order, total system bandwidth i.e., increase in subcarriers or subcarrier
    bandwidth. At around 60 iterations, the proposed approach coincides, which makes
    this approach more efficient and faster. Since the sharing of information among
    the secondary users i.e., cognitive users take place resulting in more than one
    optimal solution which is more preferable than the previous one. We have taken
    values of number of iterations, TTR and time taken and plotted graphs for different
    bandwidth a) Total Bandwidth = 30 MHz Fig. 2 Number of iterations vs. time taken
    Show All Fig. 2 shows the plot of number of iterations v/s time taken by each
    user to converge towards available spectrum, i.e., with the subcarrier, it is
    found that it takes only 0.04 seconds. This attribution is due to the fact that
    the secondary users exchange information among them continuously till they obtain
    the available subcarriers. Fig. 3 Total system transfer rate vs. time taken Show
    All Fig. 4 Total system transfer rate vs. no. of iterations. Show All Fig. 3 and
    4 shows the overall transfer rate v/s time taken and number of iterations respectively,
    it is seen that the overall transfer rate increases with time and number of iterations,
    it converges around 60 iterations, which makes it a fast and an efficient method.
    This is happening due to the fact that the cognitive users are exchanging information
    among them, thereby interpreting every successive generation a more ideal one
    than the earlier. b) Total Bandwidth = 60 MHz Fig. 5 No. of iterations vs. time
    taken Show All Fig. 6 Total system transfer rate vs. time taken Show All Fig.
    5, 6 and 7 shows the plot of number of iterations v/s time taken, overall transfer
    rate of v/s time taken and overall transfer rate v/s number of iterations for
    a bandwidth of 60 MHz. It is seen from the plots that as the bandwidth increases
    the overall transfer rate of the system also increases and time taken for each
    iteration is also more. This is due to the fact that as the number of iterations
    increases, the time taken to converge by the cognitive user towards the available
    subcarriers also increases, because of large bandwidth optimal searching of available
    subcarriers also increases. The procedure is repeated for a system bandwidth of
    120MHz, the respective outcomes of the simulation are shown in the fig. 8, 9 and
    10. Fig. 7 Total system transfer rate vs. no. of iterations Show All c) Total
    Bandwidth 120 MHz Fig. 8 No. of iterations vs. time taken Show All Fig. 9 Total
    transfer rate vs. time taken Show All Fig. 10 Total transfer rate vs. no. of iterations
    Show All Fig. 11 No. of iterations vs. time taken Show All Fig 12: Overall transfer
    rate v/s no. of users Show All Fig. 11 and 12 shows the number of iterations v/s
    time taken and Overall transfer rate v/s the number of users, it is found that
    the proposed scheme provides larger assignment rates. Table 1: Overall transfer
    rate for different system bandwidth Table 1 provides the summary of overall transfer
    rate for different system bandwidth, it seen that as the system bandwidth increases
    the overall transfer rate of the system also increased. The simulation outcomes
    show that a larger assignment rate is obtained with a quicker execution time by
    making use of PSO approach. The users are taken as particles in PSO algorithm
    and modulation order is initialized randomly to the users which is allocated with
    a subcarrier and total transfer rate is found out with respect to the modulation
    order. Hence the PSO technique is a tangible and quick approach to achieve spectrum
    sharing in cognitive radio networks. SECTION VI. Conclusion Spectrum sharing approach
    using PSO for the cognitive radio networks has been designed under the constraints
    of overall power usage, bit error rate and specific allocation rate. Due to the
    implementation of information exchange mechanism in the proposed PSO technique,
    it offers a larger allocation rate instantaneously with smaller amount of rehearsals
    to determine a finest result. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics

    Location: Gandia, Spain SECTION I. Introduction The recent majority of handled
    mobile devices, such as smartphones, enables the inter-connectivity among mobile
    users without the support of Internet infrastructure. The widespread use of such
    applications can lead to a fruitful growth of various wireless networks as well
    as a dramatic increase in the demand for radio spectrum [?], [1]–[4]. Currently,
    the available spectrum is at its limit. Consequently, CR has appeared as a new
    design prototype given its opportunistic access to the unoccupied licensed frequency
    bands. This releases the spectrum from restrictions of authorized licenses and,
    at the same time, improves the spectrum utilization efficiency. A typical CRN
    environment consists of N different types of PRNs and one or several CRNs. The
    PR and CR networks geographically co-exist within the same area. In terms of network
    topology, the diagram below shows that we have many primary radio networks (PRNs)
    with unused band channel [4]–[6]. In addition, there are many cognitive radio
    networks (CRNs), each with many SUs. The main concern here is cost since each
    different case of SUs has a different pricing ratio [7]–[11]. Furthermore, we
    know that there are few Internet service providers (ISPs) because they are limited
    with resources of spectrum. There are four types of market structure that are
    classified according to competition among Telecom companies. The first is Perfect
    Competition, which means that there is a large number of Telecom Companies in
    the market. In other words, the market is open, without limitations or barriers
    to entry. Perfect Competition is a term for an industry where competition is stagnant
    and relatively non-competitive. The second type of market is the Pure Monopoly,
    in which there is only one Telecom Company in the market (e.g., the market is
    restricted with only one company and there are barriers to entry). In simple terms,
    it is a market structure where one company is the single source for a spectrum
    and there are no close substitutes for the spectrum availability [7]. The third
    type of market structure is called Monopolistic Competition, whereby there are
    many Telecom companies with resources of spectrum [12]. Those companies hold market
    power through spectrum differentiation. The last type is Oligopoly, a market structure
    in which a few firms are producing a spectrum. The term Oligopoly derives from
    the Latin ‘olígoi’ – meaning “few”, and ‘pōléō’ – meaning “to sell”. So, translated,
    it means ‘few sellers’. So, translated, it means ‘few sellers’. When there are
    few firms in the market, they may collude to set a price or output level for the
    market with the purpose of maximizing industry profits [13–15]. SECTION II. Related
    Work On Crn Pricing Models There are three models to classify the possible cases
    in our assumption for CRNs with PRNs: Few Primary Radio Network (PRNs) with one
    cognitive Radio Network (CRN). Few Primary Radio Network (PRNs) with two cognitive
    Radio Network (CRNs). Few Primary Radio Network (PRNs) with few cognitive Radio
    Network (CRN). Fig. 1. Possible Market Models for the coexistence between the
    PRNs with CRNs. Show All Previous research has mostly dealt with spectrum pricing
    in CRNs to provide optimal pricing strategies for using spectrum without dealing
    with the channel assignment problems [5]. The first scenario (few PRNs to One
    CRN) was studied an economical aspect of accessing PRNs channels with maximize
    the profit of CRNs which is called CR revenue (total price paid by secondary users
    to the cognitive radio network) subtracted the total cost by the CRN to the PRN
    to utilize there channels. In other words, the objective was to serve the largest
    number of secondary users with highest possible CRN profit. The competition here
    then is among SUs in “stage (3) “toward one CRN in “stage (2) “objected to the
    PRN. The second scenario (Few PRNs to two CRNs) is considered an Oligopoly since
    the competition is between two CRNs to utilize the unused channels among the PRNs
    depending on the primary radioactivity level, in parallel with competition among
    the SUs to utilize the CRNs channel. If higher primary radio utilization results
    in higher price rent for CRNs, then the charging for secondary users will be increased.
    SECTION III. Possible Market Models with Network Models In this section, we provide
    a detailed description of different types of network models and compare them to
    market models from business and the real world. The different models are shown
    in Figure 1. First, we consider a model with many primary radio networks but only
    one cognitive radio network. The competition among secondary users to access the
    unused spectrum of the many PRNs is called in business point of view pure monopoly
    (Figure 2 shows the different levels of spectrum access competitions between CRNs,
    PRNs, and SUs). In a monopoly, one company is the single source for a spectrum
    and there are no close substitutes for the spectrum. Pure monopolies are relatively
    rare. In order for a provider to maintain a pure monopoly, there must be barriers
    preventing competitors from entering the market, such as resource control and
    economies of scale. Second, we consider two CRNs (i.e., CRN-a or CRN-b). Each
    network is connected to multiple SUs. The CRNs attempt to opportunistically exploit
    multiple PRN spectrum resources. The access to the spectrum resources provided
    to CRN-a and CRN-b are based on the PRNs’ activities (see Figure 3). The scenario
    Few (PRNs) to two (CRNs) is an Oligopoly. Here, the competition is primarily,
    between two CRNs to utilize the unused channels among the PRNs depending on the
    primary radio activity level. This alongside competition among the SUs to utilize
    the CRNs channel. Higher primary radio utilization results in higher price rent
    for CRNs, which increases the charging for secondary users. Oligopoly is a market
    structure with a few number of firms, none of which can keep the others from having
    significant influence. The concentration ratio measures the market share of the
    largest firms. A monopoly consists of one firm, while an oligopoly consists of
    two or more firms. It is worth mentioning that a duopoly is a special case of
    oligopoly when the number of firms is two. The number of firms in an oligopoly
    must be low enough such that the actions of one firm significantly influence the
    rest of the firms. Rather than taking prices from the market, firms in an oligopoly
    set prices, whether collectively—in a cartel—or under the leadership of one firm.
    Profit margins are thus higher than they would be in a more competitive market.
    The conditions that enable oligopolies to exist include high entry costs in capital
    expenditures, legal privilege (license to use wireless spectrum or land for railroads),
    and a platform that gains value with more customers (such as social media). The
    main issue for these firms is that each of them has an incentive to cheat; if
    all firms in the oligopoly agree to jointly restrict supply and keep prices high,
    then each firm stands to capture substantial business from the others by breaking
    the agreement. Such competition can be managed through prices, or with the individual
    company expanding its own output brought to market. The Nash equilibrium state
    for oligopolies is reached when costs and benefits are so balanced that no firm
    wants to break from the group. This can be achieved by contractual or market conditions,
    legal restrictions, or strategic relationships that legally hold cheaters accountable.
    Companies in an oligopoly benefit from price-fixing, setting prices collectively,
    or under the direction of one firm in the bunch rather than relying on free-market
    forces. Our objective to distribute the spectrum depends on CRN requirements based
    on quantity of users and the price of spectrum. Our assumption is to control the
    number of served users (referred to as quantity) with fixed price to maximize
    the total profit for CRNs. This can be done based on imposing certain quality
    of service requirements.. Otherwise, we have to use the principle of fair allocation
    for distributing the channels. The quality of service is a function of price and
    quantity: as the number of users increases, the quality of service decreases.
    If we increase the price, then the quality of service will be improved with high
    probability. Thirdly, we consider the model with few CRN with multiple spectrum
    resources and secondary users. This scenario is considered as a perfect competition
    market. This type of markets is not applicable in real Telecom industry because
    the frequency spectrum is a very limited resource, and hence the number of possible
    firms with a spectrum shares is very limited. Fig. 2. Network diagram of PRNs
    coexisting with CRNs. Show All SECTION IV. Discussion and Conclusions The purpose
    of this paper was to examine the channel assignment problem in two CRNs with the
    target of serving the largest number of SUs with few PRNs at a lower price subject
    to the established in advanced rate demand requirements. This objective was sought
    while keeping in mind the time-varying nature of channel conditions and the spectrum-utilization-dependent
    cost of accessing PR channels. This type is referred to as oligopoly, which can
    be applied in real-life scenarios. This is divided into two strategies that focus
    on the price of spectrum and the quantity of service. Price of Spectrum: an oligopoly
    occurs when there are few spectrum resources in an industry. Examples of oligopolies
    include ISP companies. All Internet service providers have spectrum resources,
    so they can charge higher prices because consumers have fewer choices. They can
    also manipulate their prices, which is a common strategy used by mobile companies
    since they can raise prices in certain locations to drive people to less crowded
    areas. The price of oligopoly is controlled by the few spectrum resources in an
    industry. In oligopolies, there are a few Telecommunication companies. Therefore,
    they can set their own prices based on their inter-dependant behaviours. Also,
    if their spectrum is better than the rest, they could charge more. If there are
    too many spectrum resources in one company, this result in a monopoly. Quantity
    of Service: The quality of service is, in general, inversely proportional with
    the increased number of served secondary users. This is because by increasing
    the number of served SUs, the amount of available unlicensed channels will be,
    with high probability, decrease. Hence, the chances of providing high quality
    of service will be reduced. On the other hand, if the number of secondary users
    is decreased, then the quality of service provided to each user can be improved
    as the available channels are utilized by less number of SUs. Fig. 3. Network-market

    static spectrum assignment policy allocates large chunks of spectrum to licensed
    users (or primary users) on a long term basis. This permits only authorized users
    to use these frequency bands. On the other hand, extensive deployment of wireless
    applications creates shortage of radio spectrum. To deal with this discrepancy
    in spectrum usage, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) [1] studied the licensed
    spectrum and declared that most of the statically assigned bands remain underutilized
    by their owners both spatially and temporally. This encourages the unlicensed
    users (or secondary users) to dynamically utilize the idle spectrum (spectrum
    holes) by incorporating a new technology called Cognitive Radio (CR) [2], [3].
    To efficiently redistribute the radio resource, CR uses dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) techniques [4] which initially senses for spectrum holes and then enables
    the secondary users (SUs) to opportunistically use the spectrum holes causing
    no interference to primary users (PUs). A key functionality of CR is to fairly
    allocate the free channels amongst the coexisting SUs [5], [6]. Several spectrum
    allocation models have been designed [7], [8] to distribute the unused spectrum
    which can significantly improve the spectrum utilization. Auction-based model
    [9] provides a different perspective in channel allocation where spectrum holes
    being the auctioned item are bid by SUs with appropriate valuation. Both single-sided
    auction and double-sided auction can be deployed for spectrum allocation in CR.
    In single-sided auction, a primary owner (primary base station) of the network
    performs as auctioneer who auctions the channels from the PUs and also earns a
    financial benefit. But, in double-sided auction, primary owners (POs) of the network
    participate as sellers and they compete amongst them to sell the channels left
    unused by their respective PUs. Spectrum broker (SB) takes the role of auctioneer
    in a double-sided auction. Fig. 1 shows a double auction model in cognitive radio
    network (CRN). Although, there can be situations where some channels may remain
    unassigned in a double-sided auction, but such an auction framework provides a
    more practical scenario since POs themselves get involve to earn a better monetary
    profit by submitting ask values for their channels. In today’s world of 5G technology
    [10], double-sided auction anticipates a better flexibility in spectrum usage,
    where to obtain an increased network capacity, unused licensed channels can be
    temporarily leased amongst users with the consent of the POs. Also, auction ensures
    a secured communication since bids/asks from buyers/sellers are announced only
    to the auctioneer and there needs to be no information exchange amongst the network
    operators. Therefore, in our proposed model, we develop a double auction mechanism
    where POs compete amongst them by submitting ask values to the auctioneer to sell
    their channels, whereas SUs submit bid values to get access to their preferred
    channels. Applying sealed-bid policy helps to reduce the communication overhead,
    where both SUs and POs privately submit their values to SB. Moreover, auction-based
    allocations are widely accepted because every participant gets an equal opportunity
    to win and SUs with high bid value have a greater chance to get their desired
    channels. FIGURE 1. Double-auction in cognitive radio networks. Show All Auction
    formulation in CR networks needs to address different network constraints. Dynamics
    in spectrum opportunities (SOPs) amongst SUs is an important constraint in CRN.
    Previous research works [12]–[20] on double auction does not tackle this issue
    due to which all idle channels remain available to every SU during channel allocation.
    Such an assumption does not exhibit a practical scenario in CRN. Another constraint
    can be to allow geographically separated SUs to take advantage of spectrum reuse
    since spectrum auction is much different from the conventional auction which offers
    an item to only one bidder. Spectrum reusability helps to boost the spectrum utilization
    as well as increases the profit of sellers. Some of the existing double auction
    mechanisms consider that a PU contributes only a single channel for the auction
    [12], [15], [19], [23]. But, if more than one channel is vacant, then it is more
    likely to constraint a PU to sell all its idle channels at a time. Applying multi-channel
    allocation can be a good approach in CRN because this enhances the network throughput.
    Also, multi-channel allocation helps in situations where the PU wants to return
    back to its channel and the SU using that channel releases it and switches to
    its other assigned channels avoiding any disturbance during its data transmission.
    Even so, there can be a situation where an SU gets only one channel and on vacating
    the channel, the transmission of the SU gets disturbed. To overcome such a situation
    and to reduce the switching overhead, it is necessary to consider the availability
    time of the channels kept for lease. None of the existing works on double auction
    incorporates this network constraint which can thereby degrade the network performance.
    Homogeneous channel condition in most of the auction models [12]–[19] allows a
    bidder to submit a uniform bid for all available channels. However, considering
    the channels to be heterogeneous in their quality proffers a more realistic scenario
    and this necessitates an SU to submit different bids for different channels. Also,
    ask values for the channels can differ from a particular PO. To prevent any market
    manipulation of the bids and asks, the auction mechanism demands a truthful winner
    determination algorithm such that no bidder/seller can improve its utility with
    an untruthful bid/ask. Hence, motivated by these observations, we develop a double
    auction model which includes the discussed network constraints to achieve an effectual
    spectrum allocation. In this paper, we propose a multi-channel multi-winner sealed-bid
    double auction mechanism to model the spectrum allocation problem in CRN. It extends
    the work carried out in [11] which designs a double auction framework that allows
    spectrum reuse with single channel allocation of the homogeneous channels. In
    our proposed model, POs participate in the game to obtain a monetary profit where
    they report ask values to the SB for leasing their vacant channels. SB acting
    as the auctioneer collects asks from POs and bids from SUs and consequently decides
    a clearing price with the winner determination and pricing strategies to achieve
    an efficient allocation. Both multi-channel allocation and multi-winner allocation
    for spectrum reuse have been applied in this model. Since we consider that the
    channels are heterogeneous with respect to their maximum allowable transmission
    power, so every SU can decide a different bid value for each channel according
    to the channel availability of the SU. In the seller side, a PO can lease multiple
    channels which are kept idle. According to the PO’s willingness to obtain a monetary
    amount, it sets the ask value which can also be different for each channel that
    it wants to auction. Hence, bid values and ask values submitted to SB are channel-specific.
    Every SU maintains a preference list of its available channels based on which
    bids are decided by the SU. The bid from an SU is made in terms of the rate of
    data transfer to be used over the requested channel. Dynamics in SOPs among SUs
    and differences in availability time of the channels influence the bid submission
    process. To enable spectrum reuse, a channel-specific bidder group formation algorithm
    is proposed where for every channel groups of non-interfering SUs are formed.
    Then, the winning group for each channel is determined using a spectrum allocation
    algorithm. The developed auction model guarantees truthfulness and individually
    rationality at the auctioneer. Network simulations are carried out to validate
    the performance of the proposed model by comparing it with an existing auction
    model called PreDA [22]. The proposed double auction model makes the following
    key contributions. With the channels being heterogeneous, a preference list of
    the available channels is maintained at each SU while imposing the network constraints,
    viz., dynamics in SOPs and differences in channel availability time, in the model.
    Then based on its preference list, an SU decides the bid values by obtaining the
    rate of data transfer to be used over the available channels. Monetary form of
    bidding, as observed in literature, may not allow a good use of the idle radio
    spectrum. In this auction model, every SU in a group is considered during the
    allocation process. This intends to increase the spectrum utilization, although
    one or more SUs in a group may obtain zero utility (no profit). All winning sellers
    and auctioneer can earn a monetary benefit from the auction. In the proposed model,
    we mainly focus on spectrum utilization and on a minimal revenue to be earned
    by the sellers and the auctioneer. However, we only plan a non-negative profit
    for both the sellers and the buyers. This double auction model dynamically decides
    on the number of rounds based on situations. In the initial round, all channels
    are auctioned together. In case some channels remain unassigned, subsequent auction
    rounds can be used to lease such channels. Also, the leftover availability time
    of an allocated channel can be auctioned in the next round so as to improve the
    overall utilization of our resource. The rest of the paper is organized as follows.
    In Section 2, we present the literature review. The proposed mechanism is described
    in Section 3 which contains an illustration of the system model, the auction mechanism
    and auction properties. Section 4 discusses the performance evaluation of the
    model and finally we conclude the paper in Section 5. SECTION II. Related Works
    Spectrum allocation can be mentioned as one of the most explored area in the domain
    of spectrum management. Recent studies on wireless network have come up with different
    solutions to resolve the spectrum allocation problem. To enable a fair channel
    allocation in D2D networks, authors in [39] proposed a distributed allocation
    mechanism with the blind rendezvous method which persuades collision-free concurrent
    communication. Another such approach has been designed for cognitive Internet
    of Things (IoT) in [40] which takes upon a bio-inspired algorithm to carry out
    resource allocation amongst the users. In this paper, we concentrate on operating
    with ad hoc cognitive radio networks for their efficacy in spectrum utilization.
    To overcome the spectrum scarcity problem, researchers have applied different
    allocation models, viz. game theory [25], graph theory [26], evolutionary theory
    [27], auction theory and so forth, to design spectrum sharing mechanisms for CRN.
    This paper focuses on auction theoretic models for their effectiveness in channel
    allocation. Auction models deployed are either single-sided or double-sided. Single-sided
    auctions include SUs as bidders and the PO as auctioneer who leases the channels
    of PUs. Authors in [28]–[30] proposed different single-sided auction scenarios.
    PO auctions the channels and earns a revenue. However, in a more realistic scenario,
    POs (as sellers) play a part in the auction game together with SUs (as buyers)
    and SB (as auctioneer). This formulates a double-sided auction which enables the
    POs to acquire their desired range of profit value from the bidders. One of the
    primary double auction mechanism is the McAfee auction [31] which leases homogeneous
    items amongst bidders while satisfying the economic properties for single-unit
    allocation. Also, it does not allow spectrum reuse. Zhou et al. in [12] proposed
    TRUST as the first truthful double auction which allows spectrum reuse and extends
    the McAfee auction to decide winning sellers and buyers and their respective payments.
    TRUST makes every PU sell only a single channel where these channels are homogeneous.
    Also, an SU can request for only one channel in TRUST. SMALL has been introduced
    as another strategy-proof double auction in [13] which considers a single seller
    and initially permits single channel allocation along with spectrum reuse. Interfering
    SUs are modeled using a conflict graph to form buyer groups. Winner selection
    and price charged are decided based on group bids computed from the buyer groups.
    Further, SMALL extends its work for multi-channel allocation of the homogeneous
    channels. Another double auction mechanism that supports multi-channel request
    from both buyers and sellers is True-MCSA in [14]. To enable spectrum reuse of
    the auctioned channels, formation of buyer groups and splitting them into virtual
    buyer groups (VBG) is carried out. For different design goals, two different bidding
    policies are generated to decide bid for each VBG. Thereafter, winner determination
    and pricing strategies use the McAfee auction which guarantees truthfulness in
    the model. In [15], both buyer side and seller side are decoupled to perform spectrum
    allocation separately. Buyer side uses the graph partitioning process to create
    sub graphs for spectrum reuse where pricing is computed in each sub graph. Merging
    combines the resulting sub graphs. On the seller side, traditional pricing design
    is used to sell one channel from each seller. The main goal of this approach is
    to auction the channels such that it achieves truthfulness and budge balance.
    Wang et al. proposed DOTA in [16] as another double auction which takes care of
    both range request and strict request of SUs. Sellers/buyers can sell/bid multiple
    channels along with reusing the channels. Similarly, a multi-unit truthful double
    auction framework with spectrum reuse characteristic is proposed in [17] which
    aims at improving the user satisfaction degree. However, heterogeneous channel
    condition and dynamics in SOPs are not reflected in [17]. A locality based spectrum
    auction is performed in [18] where a seller auctions one channel in each round
    and designs the allocation with or without prior knowledge about bid distribution.
    Zhang et. al. developed another auction mechanism in [19] which allows PUs along
    with the SUs to share the auctioned channels. Interference temperature maintains
    a threshold level to prevent the interference from the SUs to the PUs so that
    both of them can simultaneously utilize the channel. Every PU leases a single
    idle channel during the auction process in [19]. Authors in [20] and [21] introduced
    double auctions with heterogeneous spectrum in terms of channel frequencies. As
    such, even though all channels are available to the SUs, an SU may be interested
    in a part of the spectrum. STRUCTURE in [20] applies a bid-dependent buyer group
    formation algorithm to enable spectrum reuse while allowing a truthful single-channel
    allocation among SUs. Similarly, in [21], TAMES designs a multi-seller-multi-buyer
    double auction where the heterogeneous interference graph for spatial reusability
    is grouped using sequential grouping. Then, the allocation and pricing rules decide
    the winning sellers and buyers which satisfy all the economic properties. Khairullah
    et. al introduced PreDA in [22] as another double auction mechanism for heterogeneous
    channels. A preference list is built up based on the SINR values of channels and
    bids from SUs are submitted considering this preference list. Multi-channel allocation
    and spectrum reuse are incorporated by forming virtual groups of non-conflicting
    SUs. Moreover, the CR constraint of dynamics in SOPs has been attained in PreDA.
    TAHES in [23] is a single-round multi-unit double auction which incorporates the
    constraint for dynamics in SOPs in the model. TAHES facilitates spectrum reuse
    of its heterogeneous channels, but it permits only single-channel allocation of
    SUs and allows each seller to contribute only a single channel. A truthful double
    auction in [24] aims at optimizing the profit and energy of CRN, where spectrum
    reusability is modeled using SINR model and each SU can demand only one channel.
    A relay based double auction is proposed in [32], where to use the homogeneous
    channels, SUs are grouped according to their relay access and the interference
    between them. Another relay based auction model that uses both decode-and-forward
    and amplify-and-forward relay protocols for spectrum sharing is proposed in [33]
    where Vickrey auction is used to decide the relay selection. Apart from these
    approaches, two online double auctions are discussed in [34] and [35]. TODA in
    [34] uses a complete graph to represent reusability of its homogeneous available
    spectrum. Whereas, LOTUS in [35] uses the concept of interference discount to
    design the bid submission process. Hence, the state-of-art on channel allocation
    in CRN unveils several auction mechanisms working under different network scenarios
    to effectively lease the idle spectrum. Table 1 lists some of the double auction
    models discussed in literature. TABLE 1 Existing Double-Auction Mechanisms for
    CRN Now, although the existing double auction mechanisms in CRN have managed to
    resolve the channel allocation problem, but authors in these works have not incorporated
    one or the other network constraint discussed above. The proposed double auction
    mechanism encompasses all the explored network constraints to enable a better
    use of the dynamically available channels. Also, previously designed auction models
    take the bid value from SUs as some monetary amount since they are more interested
    in acquiring a good benefit from the market. But, CRN focuses mainly on utilizing
    the spectrum. With the monetary bidding strategy, a bidder with the highest bid
    value, on winning the channel cannot assure that he will make the best use of
    the assigned channel in terms of its channel characteristic, such as, channel
    capacity, data rate, bandwidth etc. In case we apply monetary bidding in our proposed
    model (the way it has been applied in other existing works) where the highest
    paid group wins, then there may arise some SUs in the group who will not abide
    by the network constraints taken up in this model. This will not allow those SUs
    to complete their transmission, resulting in a wastage of radio spectrum. Hence,
    with these motivations, we plan to develop a multi-channel allocation with spectrum
    reusability where the bid value from an SU is given in terms of the rate of data
    transfer which the SU shall use over the auctioned channel. Also, channels from
    the POs are considered to be heterogeneous which results in channel specific bid/ask
    values. SECTION III. Double Auction Mechanism This section discusses the challenges
    arising due to CR constraints, the detailed system model and the double auction
    mechanism deployed to allocate channels in CRN. The economic properties which
    make the proposed model economically robust are also analyzed in this section.
    A. Challenges 1) Dynamics in Spectrum Opportunities Due to differences in SUs’
    capabilities, the whole set of free channels may not be available to every SU.
    This gives rise to dynamics in spectrum opportunities amongst the SUs. In CR network,
    if each SU bids for all the available channels, then there may arise situations
    where an SU wins a channel which is actually unavailable at the SU. As such, the
    SU cannot transmit. This reduces the utilization of the radio bands as well as
    hampers the network throughput. To overcome such a constraint on spectrum availability,
    SUs should identify and maintain the list of free channels available to them using
    spectrum sensing process. This will eliminate SUs’ bidding for the auctioned channels
    which are not accessible or available to them. Now, when the auction process starts
    and a channel is being auctioned, an SU can bid for the channel and possibly win
    the channel only when the channel is found to be available or accessible to the
    SU. 2) Channel Availability Time In CRN, a channel assigned to an SU may be reclaimed
    by the licensed owner of the channel. This necessitates the SU to immediately
    vacate the channel and switch to another free channel if available. Meanwhile,
    if the SU was transmitting over the released channel, then the transmission gets
    interrupted until it gets the next channel. When an SU is being assigned more
    than one channel, the return of a PU has no adverse effect, except the inclusion
    of a switching overhead. But, when an SU gets only one channel and it has to leave
    the channel in the midway of its transmission, then this lowers the network throughput
    and an efficient utilization of the channel cannot be provided. So, to overcome
    such a constraint, every SU needs to know the availability time of the channels.
    This prevents an SU to bid for a channel whose availability time is less than
    the time for which the SU requires the channel. As such, the SU acquires a channel
    which it can use to complete its transmission. Also, this reduces the switching
    overhead in the network. B. System Model In the designed model, we consider a
    cognitive radio network that coexists with a primary network. Here, spectrum broker
    acts as auctioneer, N number of SUs, N={1,2,3,…,N} , are the bidders requesting
    for channels and M number of POs, M={1,2,3,…,M} are the sellers who compete to
    lease their unused channels. When a channel is said to be available from a PU,
    it implies that the channel is completely free as in interweaved CRN [2], and
    it is not being shared with the legitimate PU. Each PO q contributes k q number
    of channels which are vacant, and along with decides on a maximum transmissible
    power limit for every channel. Therefore, total number of channels available for
    the auction are Y=( k 1 + k 2 +…+ k q +…+ k M ). We assume that N>Y . To communicate
    the bids and asks to the auctioneer, we take a dedicated licensed common control
    channel (CCC) [36] which can be used with OFDMA access mechanism. Now, since we
    consider that the auctioned channels are heterogeneous in quality, the set of
    channels from a PO q is given as Λ q ={ q 1 , q 2 ,…, q j ,…, q k q } , where
    q j is the j th channel of PO q . All the channels are maintained in a vector
    K which is given as follows. K={ 1,…, k 1          Λ 1 , ( k 1 +1),…,(
    k 1 + k 2 )                          Λ 2 ,…, (( k 1

    model permits geographically separated SUs to share a common channel simultaneously
    which in turn improves the spectrum utilization and the revenue. To determine
    the interference relationship between two SUs, we apply the distance-based interference
    mechanism which has been used in [12], [14], [23]. An interference matrix, X={
    x ik ⏐ x ik ∈{0,1} } N×N , maintains the interfering SUs such that, x ik =1 if
    SUs i and k cannot get the same channel simultaneously, otherwise x ik =0 . Before
    starting the allocation process, every SU senses for its available channels. During
    the spectrum sensing phase, different hardware constraints may arise resulting
    in different SU capabilities [37]. Due to such constraints, every SU may not be
    able to sense all the free channels which gives rise to dynamics in SOPs. Every
    SU informs the auctioneer about their spectrum availability. This constructs a
    channel availability matrix at the auctioneer, C={ c ij ⏐ c ij ∈{0,1} } N×Y .
    c ij =1 when a channel j∈K is available at SU i . Otherwise, c ij =0 implying
    that SU i will not bid for channel j since SU i cannot sense it. To avoid interruption
    in data transmission of SU due to PU’s arrival, channel availability time should
    be taken into consideration. For a channel j∈K , T A(j) represents its availability
    time which is obtained during the sensing process [38]. The OFF period in the
    ON-OFF model in [38] specifies the duration for which the channel remains available
    without any interruption from the legitimate owner. During this period, an SU
    can use the channel to complete its transmission. For all SUs who can sense the
    channel j , T A(j) gives an approximately similar value. Further, an SU i determines
    the channel requirement time for a channel j as T R(ij) when c ij =1 and accordingly
    it bids for the channel only when T A(j) is greater than or equal to T R(ij) .
    This helps to reduce the switching overhead due to PU activity. Also, an SU who
    is assigned a single channel can carry out its transmission without any disturbance.
    To obtain the channel requirement time T R(ij) for channel j , SU i takes the
    transmission time and propagation delay. Message size of SU i and data rate used
    over channel j gives the transmission time. Here, we consider that the data rate
    used by SU i to transmit over the channel j forms the bid value offered by SU
    i for channel j . Then, the propagation speed and distance to receiver gives the
    propagation delay. Channels auctioned are heterogeneous with respect to their
    maximum allowable transmission power. This implies that SUs cannot transmit over
    a channel j with power more than λ j . Due to heterogeneous channel conditions,
    bid values from SUs and ask values from POs will be channel-specific. Now, to
    compute the channel capacity (Shannon’s capacity) of channel j , SU i uses Eq.
    1. Ψ ij =W log 2 (1+ λ j ⋅ P L(i) I i + σ 2 ) (1) View Source Channel bandwidth,
    W , and noise variance, σ 2 , are identical for all channels. P L(i) is the path
    loss factor between SU i ’s transmitter and receiver and I i is the interference
    from primary network. However, Ψ ij is obtained only when c ij =1 . Otherwise,
    if c ij =0 , then Ψ ij =0 . So, the channel capacities of the available channels
    for SU i can be given as: Ψ ˜ i ={ Ψ i1 ≥ Ψ i2 ≥…≥ Ψ iy },s.t.0≤y≤Y View Source
    Now, using the channel capacity, Ψ ij , SU i obtains the channel requirement time
    of channel j . Then, depending on the channel capacity and the difference between
    availability time and requirement time of the channel, an SU decides on the number
    and the order of the channels in its preference list. In the list a more preferred
    channel will be assigned a higher valuation than a less preferred channel. If
    for an SU i , T R(ij) > T A(j) , then there is no bid for channel j and it is
    excluded from the preference list of SU i . SU i decides its preference list as
    per the following conditions: If Ψ ij > Ψ ik , then channel j is preferable over
    k . If Ψ ij = Ψ ik and ( T A(j) − T R(ij) )=( T A(k) − T R(ik) )=0 , then both
    channels are equally preferable. If Ψ ij = Ψ ik and ( T A(j) − T R(ij) )<( T A(k)
    − T R(ik) ) , then channel j is preferable over k . And accordingly, the preference
    list of channels for SU i is: γ i ={1,2,3,…,y},s.t.0≤y≤Y View Source Now, to compute
    the valuations of the channels, SU i uses its preference list of channels, such
    that, for two consecutive channels { j , k } ∈  γ i , valuation of channel k is
    computed before channel j where k=j+1 . This implies that we will first compute
    the valuation of the least preferred channel y∈ γ i . Then the valuations of the
    channels {y−1,y−2,…,3,2,1}∈ γ i are computed in order. For a channel j∈K , v (b)
    ji represents the valuation from SU i . To get the valuation of channel j when
    T A(j) ≥ T R(ij) , one of the following condition is applied by SU i . When channel
    j is preferred over channel k (such that k=j+1 ), then Ψ ij ≥ v (b) ji ≥ Ψ ik
    . When both channels j and k (such that k=j+1 ) are equally preferable, then Ψ
    ij = Ψ ik = v (b) ji . Eq. 2 computes the valuation v (b) ji of channel j for
    SU i . For the least preferred channel of an SU, we directly apply Eq. 2 to get
    its valuation. For a channel which is not included in the preference list of SU,
    valuation is equal to 0 since such a channel shall satisfy one of the first two
    conditions of Eq. 2. v (b) ji = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ ⎪ 0 0 Ψ ij < Ψ
    ij if  c ij =0 if ( T R(ij) > T A(j) ) if ( T R(ij) = T A(j) ) if  T R(ij) < T
    A(j) , but  v (b) ji is chosen  s.t.  T A(j) ≥ T R(ij) continues to hold (2) View
    Source c ij =0 implies that channel j is not available at the SU, so SU i has
    no valuation for channel j . The computation of channel requirement time for the
    channel is carried out only when c ij =1 , so that valuation for the channel can
    be determined. When channel requirement time computed using the channel capacity
    becomes greater than the availability time, SU i does not submit any bid for the
    channel. This helps to avoid interruption in the transmission process of the SU.
    But, when both requirement time and availability time are same, then channel capacity
    becomes the valuation. This is because, if the SU chooses a data rate (less than
    channel capacity), then the requirement time increases and the constraint for
    channel availability time gets violated. And lastly, when the requirement time
    is less than the availability time, then we choose a data rate as the valuation.
    But, here again we have to check whether the chosen value for data rate (to be
    used for computing the requirement time) satisfies the availability time constraint.
    This accordingly proceeds to give us a data rate which assures the channel availability
    time constraint to yield a productive network performance. Now, with truthful
    bidding strategy, the bid value decided by SU i for a channel j , b (b) ji , is
    equal to the valuation v (b) ji . So, on receiving bids from the SUs, a bid vector
    is formed for each channel j , which is given as, B (b) j ={ b (b) j1 , b (b)
    j2 ,…, b (b) ji ,…, b (b) jN } . Considering all channels, we get a bid matrix
    B= { B (b) 1 ; B (b) 2 ;…; B (b) Y }. B= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ b (b) 11 … b (b)

    the channel allocation among SUs, a channel allocation matrix is used, A={ a ij
    ⏐ a ij ∈{0,1} } N×Y , where a ij =1 if channel j has been assigned to SU i , otherwise
    a ij =0 . On winning a channel, the SU needs to make a payment to auctioneer.
    Since, multi-channel allocation enables an SU to acquire more than one channel,
    so a bidder payment matrix, P (b) , is created such that it holds the payment
    paid by every SU for the channels which it won. P (b) ={ p (b) ij } N×Y where
    p (b) ij represents the payment from SU i when a ij =1 for channel j∈K . p (b)
    ij =0 when channel j is not assigned to SU i . Total payment paid by SU i is given
    by ρ (b) i = ∑ Y j=1 p (b) ij , ∀i∈N . Utility of an SU i , u (b) i , on winning
    a channel is the difference between true valuation of SU for the channel and payment
    paid by SU for the channel. So, u (b) i ˜ represents the total utility of SU i
    on winning its desired channels which can be obtained using Eq. 3. u (b) i ˜ =
    ⎧ ⎩ ⎨ ⎪ ⎪ ∑ j=1 Y a ij v (b) ji − ρ (b) i 0 if  ∑ Y j=1 a ij ≠0 otherwise (3)
    View Source If an SU i remains deprived from channel allocation, then both ρ (b)
    i = u (b) i ˜ =0 . Now, with an allocation A={ a ij } N×Y obtained for the auctioned
    channels in different auction rounds, spectrum utilization, S u , can be defined
    as the sum total of winning bid values of SUs for the assigned channels and is
    expressed in Eq. 4 [11], [29]. Spectrum utilization gives a measure of the total
    data rate that has been allowed over the used channels. S u = ∑ j=1 Y ∑ i=1 N
    b (b) ji a ij (4) View Source In the seller side, POs compete amongst them and
    submit ask values to the auctioneer for their idle channels. This allows them
    to obtain certain financial gain as sellers. Every PO q decides a valuation, v
    (s) qj , for its channel j such that q j ∈  Λ q . Since the channels are heterogeneous,
    the valuation for every channel in Λ q can be different. Considering truthfulness
    in the model, the ask value of PO q for its j th channel, b (s) qj , is equal
    to the valuation v (s) qj . So, by collecting the ask values from all POs, we
    get an ask vector H which is given as follows. H={ b (s) 11 ,…, b (s) 1  k 1 

    W q , in formed for each PO q such that W q ={ w q1 ,…, w qj ,…, w q k q } , where
    w qj represents the number of non-interfering SUs who are assigned channel j of
    PO q . Also, the payment earned by a PO q on selling its channel j is given as
    p (s) qj . As such, we get a seller payment vector, P (s) q , for each PO q where,
    P (s) q ={ p (s) q1 ,…, p (s) qj ,…, p (s) q k q } . If w qj =m , ( 0≤m≤N ), then
    p (s) qj is the payment earned from m number of SUs who won the channel j of PO
    q . But, if w qj = p (s) qj =0 , then this implies that channel j could not be
    assigned to any SU in the network. So, total payment earned by a PO q is given
    as ρ (s) q = ∑ k q j=1 p (s) qj , ∀q∈M . Again, to find the utility of a PO q
    on selling a channel, u (s) q , difference between the payment earned by the PO
    for the channel and its valuation for the channel is taken. So, total utility
    of PO q , on selling all its channel, u (s) q ˜ , can be computed using Eq. 5.

    double auction mechanism where heterogeneous channels are auctioned by POs so
    that SUs in the CRN can fulfill their spectrum requirement while abiding by the
    constraints which become apparent in CRN. C. Auction Mechanism In the proposed
    model, an auction is being designed where the bidders and the sellers submit their
    bids and asks respectively to the auctioneer. At the start, POs submit ask values
    along with the maximum allowable transmission power for their respective channels
    to the auctioneer (SB). SB announces the maximum allowable transmission power
    of all auctioned channels, and the SUs, while abiding by the power limits, offer
    their bid values to SB. And then, based on these values, the auctioneer decides
    the winners. Initially, one round is used with the aim to auction all the channels
    together by the auctioneer. But, if some channels remain unassigned after deciding
    the winner per channel, the auction proceeds to the next round by allowing the
    SUs and POs to resubmit their bids and ask values respectively for such channels.
    This is primarily done to allow an increase in the overall spectrum utilization
    and to allow more allocation chance to the SUs. Also, another round of auction
    can be carried out for those assigned channels which have some leftover availability
    time. In this case, the SUs can utilize the leftover availability time of those
    channels while abiding by the channel availability time constraint. Fig 2 gives
    a diagrammatic representation of the proposed double auction model. Following
    steps are carried out by the auctioneer for the proposed model. FIGURE 2. Diagrammatic
    representation of proposed double auction model. Show All 1) Winner Determination
    SB carries out the winner determination strategy to obtain the winning SUs who
    can acquire their preferred channels and winning POs who can temporarily leased
    their unused channels. Two algorithms are developed to determine the winners for
    each channel. In the first algorithm (group formation algorithm), we carry out
    the group formation process where groups of non-interfering SUs are formed for
    each channel. In this process, for each channel, groups are formed by taking those
    SUs together who have a bid for the given channel and who can transmit over the
    given channel without causing any interference to each other. A number of such
    groups of non-interfering SUs for each channel are formed separately due to the
    constraints specified in the model. Thereafter, for each group (formed for a channel),
    a group bid is computed based on the bid values of the group members. Finally,
    the spectrum allocation algorithm is applied to allocate the given channel, which
    takes the group bid values as its input. To carry out the group formation process
    (Algorithm 1), every channel j∈K is taken one-by-one to form a group vector G
    j =( g j 1 , g j 2 ,…, g j z ,…, g j ∣ G j ∣ ), where g j z represents the z th
    group in G j such that all members in g j z can be given channel j which in turn
    facilitates spectrum reuse. To construct the group vector for channel j , we take
    every SU i one after another and check the bid matrix. If bid from SU i for channel
    j is 0, we move to the next SU since SU i cannot be included in any group. Otherwise,
    we get all possible combinations of SUs who can form groups with SU i while considering
    the interference amongst the SUs. Moreover, on applying the algorithm to form
    G j , if a group is formed which is similar to a group that already exists in
    G j , then the newly formed group is discarded so as to avoid duplication of groups
    in the group vector. For instance, there are 4 SUs (SU 1, SU 2, SU 3, SU 4) and
    one channel C1. SU 2 has no bid for the channel and there is interference between
    SU 1 and SU 3, SU 2 and SU 3. According to the algorithm, we take every SU i one-by-one.
    Since, SU 1 ( i=1 ) bids for the channel C1, so we start with SU 1. Now we look
    for the groups where SU 1 will be one of the members. For this, we take every
    SU k∈{1,2,3,…,N} to get an SUList for each k . When k=1 , SU i= SU k , so SU 1
    gets included in the SUList, i.e., SUList = {1}. Now to check for the other SUs
    which can be included in the SUList for k=1 , we take the SUs sequentially from
    SU 2 to SU 4. SU 2 has no bid for C1, so it cannot be in the list. SU 3 interferes
    with SU 1, so it cannot be in the list. However, SU 4 gets included, so SUList
    = {1, 4}. Once all the SUs are checked for k=1 , we obtain the complete SUList
    for k=1 . Now, since G 1 is empty, so G 1 = {{1, 4}}. Next for k=2 , k=3 and k=4
    , the same SUList = {1, 4} is obtained and this will not be included in G 1 .
    Then, we take SU i=2 and there is no bid from SU 2. So, we go for SU i=3 . Here,
    SUList = {3, 4} gets formed for k=1 , k=2 , k=3 and k=4 . Since, this is not present
    in G 1 , so G 1 = {{1, 4}, {3, 4}}. Then we move to SU i=4 where for k=1 , SUList
    = {1, 4}, for k=2 , SUList = {3, 4}, for k=3 , SUList = {3, 4}, for k=4 , SUList
    = {1, 4}. This keeps G 1 unchanged, and finally the group vector obtained for
    the channel is G 1 = {{1, 4}, {3, 4}}. Algorithm 1 Group Formation Algorithm Show
    All Once the group vector G j is obtained for the channel j , a group bid has
    to be computed for each group in G j . For a group g j z ∈ G j , group bid, μ
    j z , is taken from one of the members in g j z . If SU h∈ g j z has the lowest
    bid value amongst all the SUs in g j z , then μ j z can be obtained from the bid
    value submitted by SU h , i.e., b (b) jh . So, group bid for group g j z can be
    computed as given in Eq. 6. μ j z =min{ b (b) jh |h∈ g j z }.| g j z | (6) View
    Source However, if there appears two or more minimum bid SU in the group, then
    the bid from any one of the SU is randomly picked to compute the group bid. In
    a few double auction models discussed in literature [12]–[14], [21], [22], it
    has been found that when a group bid is decided, the member with minimum bid value
    in the group is excluded from the group. This reduces the number of SUs who can
    be assigned the channel, which in turn reduces the spectrum reuse and spectrum
    utilization. Also, when a group has only one member, such a group cannot participate
    in auction since the lone member gets excluded in this case. No such member exclusion
    is performed in our model while computing the group bids. This improves the use
    of the radio spectrum and the possibility of allocating a channel gets higher
    due to greater group bid values. For computational complexity of Algorithm 1,
    we find that for every i th iteration of outermost loop, the first inner loop
    runs N times and for every k th iteration of first inner loop, the second inner
    loop again runs N times. Then, for every q th iteration of the second inner loop,
    the third inner loop runs (q-1) times. So, we get the following. T(N)= = = = N
    2 [(1+2+…+(N−1))+(N+y)] N 2 [( N(N+1) 2 −N)+(N+y)] ( N 4 + N 2 y) O( N 4 ) View
    Source To carry out the spectrum allocation process for a channel j (Algorithm
    2), SB takes the group vector G j and the corresponding group bid vector θ j =
    ( μ j 1 , μ j 2 ,…, μ j z ,…, μ j ∣ G j ∣ ), where μ j z is the group bid of g
    j z . Now, if channel j∈K is the d th channel of PO q , then we take the ask value
    b (s) qd for the channel from PO q and compare it with the highest value in θ
    j . If the group g j z has the highest bid amongst all groups in G j , and μ j
    z is greater than or equal to b (s) qd , then the channel gets assigned to all
    members of g j z . Otherwise, the channel remains unassigned. However, if there
    appears two or more groups having the same highest group bid value, then in such
    case, we get the total bid value of each group by computing the summation of bids
    of every member in a group. Amongst them, the group which gives the highest total
    bid is considered as the winning group. But again, if more than one group shows
    a similar total bid value, then we go for the random selection of any one group
    (having the highest total bid) to be declared as winner. So, this process repeats
    for every channel present in K to get the allocation pattern. For the computational
    complexity of Algorithm 2, we find that there can be (N+y) groups ( y is some
    constant number) with maximum group bid and for every f th group, there can be
    ( N -1) SUs to compute the sum. Also, N number of SUs can win a particular channel.
    So, we get the following. T(N)= = [((N+y)(N−1))+N] O( N 2 ) View Source Algorithm
    2 Spectrum Allocation Algorithm Show All 2) Payment Now, once the channels get
    assigned to their respective winner SUs, every winning SU has to pay a price to
    the auctioneer. On allocating a channel j∈K to the members of a group g j z ,
    the auctioneer earns the group valuation δ j z as its profit. According to the
    truthful bidding strategy, valuation of SU i for channel j , v (b) ji , is equal
    to the bid b (b) ji . Consequently, SB computes δ j z using Eq. 7. δ j z =min{
    v (b) jh |h∈ g j z }.| g j z | (7) View Source The group valuation computed is
    equal to the group bid. Now, according to Eq. 7, every winning SU i in g j z pays
    a uniform price. That is, p (b) ij = min{ v (b) jh |h∈ g j z }, which is the minimum
    valuation offered by some SU h in g j z . As such, payment from SU h is its own
    valuation which results in zero utility for SU h . Also, any other SU having a
    valuation equal to SU h will have a zero utility. An SU i who cannot win channel
    j , does not make any payment for the channel, i.e., p (b) ij =0 . Subsequently,
    a winning PO q on selling its channel j to the SUs of a group g j z earns a payment
    from the auctioneer. Auctioneer obtains the valuation from PO q for the channel
    which is equal to the ask value. This valuation is then given as the payment to
    the winning PO. That is, p (s) qj = v (s) qj and this gives a zero utility to
    the PO. So, every winning PO obtains a zero utility. Also, when PO q cannot sell
    the channel, it receives zero payment. Such a payment strategy guarantees truthfulness
    in the model, where all SUs in a group are considered for winner determination.
    Also, it helps the auctioneer to earn a monetary benefit as its revenue. In previously
    discussed auction models [21], auctioneer does not earn a revenue. In the proposed
    model, we allow every winning seller and the auctioneer to earn a minimal monetary
    benefit, which showcases a more practical scenario in auction. However, we only
    concentrate on obtaining a non-negative utility amongst the buyers and the sellers
    since our main focus is to improve the spectrum utilization. And finally, auctioneer
    computes its revenue by taking the difference between the payment earned from
    the winning SUs and the payment paid to the winning POs. Revenue r qj obtained
    on selling channel j from PO q to a group g j z is given using Eq. 8. But, if
    the channel remains unsold, then r qj =0 . r qj = δ j z − v (s) qj (8) View Source
    3) New Auction Round After completing one round of auction where all the channels
    are auctioned together, we may find one or more unassigned channels. Also, for
    a channel that has been assigned to a group of non-interfering SUs, the leftover
    availability time (in excess to SU’s requirement) of the channel gets wasted.
    So, to utilize these resources, subsequent auction rounds can be carried out.
    For a channel j which remains unassigned, the new round of auction starts by allowing
    the SUs and the PO to resubmit their bids and ask values respectively for the
    channel. To increase the chance of channel allocation in the new round, the PO
    decreases the channel’s ask value with respect to the previous round. However,
    every PO sets a reserve value below which it cannot decide its ask price to sell
    the channel. Another channel k , which has been allocated to a group of SUs, can
    also participate in the subsequent auction round. The leftover availability time
    of the channel can be utilized by the SUs who could not win that channel in any
    of the previous rounds. For channel k , T A(k) in the new round is equal to the
    difference between T A(k) of previous round and T R(ik) , where SU i is a winner
    of channel k in previous round whose channel requirement time is maximum among
    all winners of the channel. The PO resubmits the ask value and the maximum allowable
    power limit for the channel to the auctioneer. Then, an SU l bids for channel
    k in the new round only if it has not been assigned channel k in any of the previous
    rounds and along with it adheres to the network constraints. The preference list
    of the participating SUs decides their bid values. Then, the winner determination
    and payment steps are executed in the new round and this accordingly updates the
    allocation matrix A . The auction stops when for the auctioned channels there
    is no group vector for any of the channel. This implies that either there are
    no participating SUs or the participating SUs do not satisfy the network constraints
    for the auctioned channels. D. Illustrative Example Fig. 3 discusses the proposed
    double auction model using an example. In this figure, 7 SUs are acting as buyers
    and 2 POs are acting as sellers. All total there are 5 channels out of which 3
    channels are auctioned by PO 1 and remaining 2 channels by PO 2. Due to the network
    constraints, all channels may not be available to every SU. As for SU 1, only
    three channels (C1, C2 and C4) out of the 5 channels are available for which SU
    1 submits its bids. Similarly, the SOPs of all other SUs are shown along with
    each SU in the figure. Also, the figure shows the interfering SUs using the interference
    matrix. The shaded region in the first row second column of the matrix implies
    that SU 1 and SU 2 cannot be assigned a common channel simultaneously due to their
    interference. Ask values from the POs for their respective channels are given
    in Table 2. Table 3 shows the preference list of each SU and accordingly the bids
    from the SUs based on their preference list are given in Table 4. And, on collecting
    all the bids and asks, the auctioneer first of all obtains the channel-specific
    groups for each channel and their respective group bids. Then, the winning bidders
    and sellers and their respective payments are determined as shown in Table 5.
    Channel 1 gets assigned to SUs S1, S4 and S7 since they are non-interfering amongst
    them and their group bid computes to be the highest amongst other groups. Similarly,
    we get the winners for channels 3, 4 and 5. But channel 2 remains unassigned because
    the highest group bid value is less than the ask value of channel 2. Now, we start
    the 2nd round of auction as there are SUs participating for the unassigned channel
    2 and also for the channel 3 where the channel is auctioned for the remaining
    available time. For the channels 1, 4 and 5, even though their available time
    may not be fully utilized, but there are no SUs who look for these channels. So,
    Table 6 shows the ask values, Table 7 and Table 8 gives the preference list and
    bids of the SUs respectively for the two channels. For channel 3, the SUs who
    did not get this channel previously can only participate. And finally, groups,
    group bids, winners and payments for channel 2 and 3 are given in Table 9. Further,
    there are no more auction rounds since there are no SUs who bids for the channels.
    In a practical scenario, the base stations (BS) of a cellular network operate
    as sellers and the SUs in the ad hoc CRN will be the bidders. Then, the channels
    which are kept unused by the mobile stations (MS) are brought for lease by the
    respective BS which can earn a revenue to the BS and along with provide the SUs
    their requisite spectrum. TABLE 2 Seller Ask Values in 1st Round TABLE 3 Preference

    model. Show All E. Auction Properties In this section, we prove the economic properties
    for the proposed double auction. Definition 1:Individual rationality: A double
    auction is said to be individually rational if no winning bidder pays a price
    which is greater than its valuation and no winning seller earns a price which
    is less than its valuation. That is, ∀i∈N , p (b) ij ≤ v (b) ji when a ij =1 and
    ∀q∈M , p (s) qj ≥ v (s) qj when w qj ≠0 . Definition 2:Truthful: A double auction
    is said to be truthful if there is no bidder or seller in the game who can improve
    its utility by submitting an untruthful bid or ask value. Definition 3:Ex-post
    budget balance: A double auction is said to be ex-post budget balance if the auctioneer
    earns a non-negative revenue. Theorem 1:The proposed double auction is individually
    rational in the buyer side. Proof:For an auction to be individually rational in
    the buyer side, the utility obtained by every buyer should be non-negative. That
    is, for an SU i , u (b) i ≥0 . In the buyer side, every SU i , who is a member
    of a winning group g j z , pays a price which is equal to the minimum valuation
    offered by some SU h belonging to g j z . This implies that all members of g j
    z including SU h makes a payment which is less than or equal to their respective
    valuation for the channel j . That is, ∀i∈ g j z , v (b) ji ≥ v (b) jh where v
    (b) jh is the payment. Hence, we get a non-negative utility for the SUs, that
    is, u (b) i ≥0 . Theorem 2:The proposed double auction is individually rational
    in the seller side. Proof:For an auction to be individually rational in the seller
    side, the utility obtained by every seller should be non-negative. That is, for
    a PO q , u (s) q ≥0 . In the seller side, a PO q on selling its channel j ( 1≤j≤
    k q ) to the members of a group g j z earns a payment p (s) qj from the auctioneer
    where p (s) qj is equal to the valuation of PO q for the channel j . And since
    utility is the difference between the payment and the valuation, so utility obtained
    by PO q is u (s) q =0 . Hence, no matter what the ask value is for the channel,
    the utility remains to be zero. This results in a non-negative utility for the
    POs. Lemma 1:When an SU i wins a channel j by submitting a bid value b (b) ji
    , then SU i also wins the channel with a bid b ′(b) ji > b (b) ji . (provided
    that all other bids and asks and network conditions remain same) Proof:On auctioning
    a channel j from a PO q , if a group g j z wins the channel, then it depends on
    the lowest bid value submitted by some SU h of the group. As such, every other
    SU in g j z has a bid value greater than or equal to the bid of SU h . Now, for
    any SU i∈ g j z such that i≠h , if SU i submits a bid b ′(b) ji > b (b) ji , SU
    i still wins the channel j since the group bid remains unchanged. And also, if
    SU h submits a bid b ′(b) jh > b (b) jh , the group still wins the channel since
    the group bid increases or stays same, no matter whether SU h remains the lowest
    bidder in the group or not. Lemma 2:When a PO q sells a channel j(1≤j≤ k q ) by
    submitting an ask value b (s) qj , then PO q can also sell the channel with a
    value b ′(s) qj < b (s) qj . (provided that all other bids and asks and network
    conditions remain same) Proof:To sell a channel j from PO q to the members of
    a group g j z , the group bid μ j z has to be greater than the ask value b (s)
    qj . So, when g j z wins channel j , this implies that b (s) qj ≤ μ j z . As such,
    even with an ask value b ′(s) qj < b (s) qj , PO q can sell its channel to the
    group. Theorem 3:The proposed double auction is truthful in the buyer side. Proof:A
    double auction is truthful in the buyer side if on submitting an untruthful bid
    value b (b) ji ≠ v (b) ji by an SU i , its utility cannot be improved. That is,
    if u (b) i and u ′(b) i are the utilities for v (b) ji and b (b) ji respectively,
    then u (b) i ≥ u ′(b) i . Case I: b (b) ji > v (b) ji When SU i cannot win the
    auction by bidding either v (b) ji or b (b) ji , then u (b) i = u ′(b) i =0 .
    When SU i loses by bidding v (b) ji , but wins on bidding b (b) ji , then we get
    u (b) i =0 . If an SU initially loses but then wins the auction by increasing
    its own bid value, this implies that the SU is the one who initially gives the
    lowest bid v (b) ji in the group which determines the group bid. When SU i submits
    b (b) ji > v (b) ji and it wins the channel, then there can be two cases. In one
    case, SU i remains the lowest bid SU in the winning group g j z . And in the other
    case, there can be some SU k in g j z such that b (b) jk ≥ v (b) ji , but b (b)
    jk < b (b) ji . So, SU k becomes the lowest bidder in g j z when SU i bids b (b)
    ji . But, since SU i wins, it pays its own valuation in both cases because it
    is the bidder with lowest valuation v (b) ji in the group, i.e., p ′(b) ij = v
    (b) ji which results in u ′(b) i =0 . According to Lemma 1, it cannot be true
    that SU i wins by bidding v (b) ji and loses on bidding b (b) ji . When SU i wins
    by bidding both v (b) ji and b (b) ji , then let p (b) ij and p ′(b) ij be the
    payments respectively. With v (b) ji , if SU i is the lowest valuated bidder in
    the group g j z , then with b (b) ji > v (b) ji , SU i may or may not be the lowest
    bidder but it submits the lowest valuation. So in both conditions, SU i on winning
    channel j pays its own valuation as the payment, i.e., p (b) ij = p ′(b) ij .
    Otherwise, with v (b) ji , if SU i is not the lowest valuated bidder in g j z
    , then its payment is independent of its valuation and it depends on only the
    valuation of some SU k who has the lowest value in g j z . So, with b (b) ji >
    v (b) ji , we get p (b) ij = p ′(b) ij which gives u (b) i = u ′(b) i . Case II:
    b (b) ji < v (b) ji When SU i cannot win the auction by bidding either v (b) ji
    or b (b) ji , then u (b) i = u ′(b) i =0 . According to Lemma 1, it cannot be
    true that SU i wins by bidding b (b) ji and loses on bidding v (b) ji . When SU
    i loses by bidding b (b) ji , but wins on bidding v (b) ji , then we get u ′(b)
    i =0 . Now, according to Theorem 1, the utility obtained by a winning SU is non-negative.
    So, with bid v (b) ji , u (b) i ≥0 . When SU i wins by bidding both v (b) ji and
    b (b) ji , we get u (b) i = u ′(b) i due to similar reasons as explained in Case
    I. Theorem 4:The proposed double auction is truthful in the seller side. Proof:A
    double auction is truthful in the seller side if on submitting an untruthful ask
    value b (s) qj ≠ v (s) qj by a PO q for its channel j , the utility of PO q cannot
    be improved. That is, if u (s) q and u ′(s) q are the utilities for v (s) qj and
    b (s) qj respectively, then u (s) q ≥ u ′(s) q . Now, the payment of a winning
    PO is its valuation for the leased channel. And according to Theorem 2, if PO
    q wins the channel j with b (s) qj when b (s) qj < v (s) qj or with v (s) qj when
    b (s) qj > v (s) qj or with both b (s) qj and v (s) qj when either b (s) qj >
    v (s) qj or b (s) qj < v (s) qj , then we get u (s) q = u ′(s) q =0 . Also, according
    to Lemma 2, it cannot be true that PO q loses with an ask value of v (s) qj and
    wins on submitting the ask value b (s) qj when b (s) qj > v (s) qj or it loses
    with an ask value of b (s) qj and wins on submitting the ask value v (s) qj when
    b (s) qj < v (s) qj . Hence, the utility of the PO cannot be improved if the ask
    value differs from its valuation. Theorem 5:The proposed double auction is ex-post
    budget balance. Proof:A double auction is said to be ex-post budget balance if
    the difference between the payment collected from bidders and the payment paid
    to sellers is non-negative. That is, if auctioneer earns a non-negative revenue.
    According to the payment strategy, payment earned from a winning group is its
    group valuation and payment paid to a winning seller is its valuation for the
    sold channel. Since, the auction model restraints to a truthful bidding strategy
    and a channel can be assigned to a group of SUs only when the group bid is greater
    than or equal to the ask value of the channel, so this implies that the profit
    earned by auctioneer will be non-negative. SECTION IV. Performance Evaluation
    In this section, we study the MATLAB based simulation of the proposed auction
    model. In the simulation setup, we consider a network of size 800m ×800m where
    the SUs are randomly distributed. Interference amongst the SUs is modeled by applying
    the distance-based interference mechanism [12], [14], [23] for the given network
    size. We assume the distance between two SUs as less than or equal to 200m for
    them to interfere with each other. Auctioneer announces the maximum allowable
    transmission power of the channels which is in the range of [0.01,1] Watts. Bandwidth
    and noise variance are common for all SUs and is taken as 1 KHz and 10−5 respectively.
    The values for the path loss factor and interference from primary network ranges
    between [2], [4] dB and [0.001,0.0001] Watts respectively. For performance analysis,
    we first compare our model with an existing double-auction model called PreDA
    [22]. From Table 1, it can be noted that PreDA shows similarities with the proposed
    model in terms of the deployed network characteristics. PreDA designs the model
    in such a way that every idle channel may not be available to each user (dynamics
    in SOPs) and along with considers that the channels auctioned are heterogeneous
    in quality. But, PreDA excludes the channel availability time constraint in its
    model, which can thereby have an adverse effect on its network performance. We
    simulate PreDA by applying the network constraints taken up in our model, and
    this accordingly influences the bid collection in PreDA. A bid-independent group
    formation algorithm (as discussed in PreDA) is executed to get non-interfering
    groups on SUs. Preference list of each SU in PreDA is decided in the similar way
    as in the proposed method. And then, channels are leased by forming virtual groups
    for each channel. Further, PreDA designs the winner determination strategy in
    such a way that on computing the group bid for each buyer group, the SU with minimum
    bid is eliminated from the group. This decreases the SU count who can acquire
    the free channels in PreDA. For both the models, the number of channels that a
    PO can lease is set to be 2. We deploy two different network scenarios for performance
    evaluation, where in one scenario, the number of SUs are varied from 50 to 90
    keeping number of POs fixed at 10, and in the other scenario, number of POs are
    varied from 5 to 30 keeping number of SUs fixed at 80. Secondly, performance of
    the proposed model is analyzed using three different sets of SUs while varying
    the number of POs from 5 to 30. Here again, the number of channels from each PO
    is taken to be 2. Third, we evaluate the effect of varying number of auctioned
    channels from the sellers in our proposed model. Then, to show how the network
    constraints can influence the system performance, we compare our model with PreDA,
    where in PreDA, the constraint related to channel availability time in excluded
    as in its actual model. However, we proceed with dynamics in SOPs of SUs since
    this constraint is also incorporated in the actual model of PreDA. Lastly, the
    interference range is varied from 100m to 600m to observe its impact on spectrum
    utilization and spectrum reuse for a single auction round with varying number
    of SUs as well as channels. All the results are averaged over 500 rounds in every
    scenario. The performance metrics used to evaluate the results are given as follows.
    Total allocated bands ( T b ): This is the total number of free channels allocated
    amongst SUs during the auction process as given in Eq. 9. T b =Y− ∑ j=1 Y ∏ i=1
    N (1− a ij ) (9) View Source Allocated units per seller ( A s ): This is the ratio
    of number of allocated channels to the number of participating sellers (POs) as
    given in Eq. 10. A s = Y− ∑ j=1 Y ∏ i=1 N (1− a ij ) M (10) View Source Spectrum
    utilization ( S u ): This is the total of winning bid values from the SUs as expressed
    in Eq. 4 which includes the winning bids from all auction rounds. Seller’s Payment
    ( S p ˜ ): This is the total price values earned by the winning sellers for their
    assigned channels in all the auction rounds. Eq. 11 shows the payment earned by
    the winning sellers in one auction round ( S p ). S p = ∑ q=1 M ρ (s) q (11) View
    Source Revenue ( R ˜ ): This is the total revenue earned by the auctioneer in
    all auction rounds. Eq. 12 shows the revenue of the auctioneer in one auction
    round R . R= ∑ q=1 M ∑ j=1 k q r qj (12) View Source Channel allocation ratio
    ( C a ): This is the ratio of number of channels which got assigned during the
    auction process to the total number of free channels which are auctioned as given
    in Eq. 13. C a = Y− ∑ j=1 Y ∏ i=1 N (1− a ij ) Y (13) View Source Spectrum reuse
    ( S r ): This is the ratio of number of times the channels are reused amongst
    the SUs to the number of assigned channels as given in Eq. 14. S r is obtained
    for the initial auction round. S r = ∑ q=1 M ∑ j=1 k q w qj Y− ∑ j=1 Y ∏ i=1 N
    (1− a ij ) (14) View Source Successful user ratio ( U r ): Using this metric,
    we show how the channel availability time can adversely affect the network performance
    when it is discarded while designing the auction model. U r is defined as the
    ratio of number of winning SUs who abide by the availability time constraint and
    therefore can complete their transmission to the total number of winning SUs in
    the network as given in Eq. 15. Therefore, this metric is used while we compare
    our designed model (in presence of channel availability time constraint) with
    PreDA (in absence of channel availability time constraint). U r = ∑ i=1 N ∑ j=1
    Y T A(j) > T R(ij)) a ij ∑ j=1 Y ∑ i=1 N a ij (15) View Source In Fig. 4(a), the
    count for total allocated bands is obtained for the proposed model and PreDA.
    From the figure it can be observed that with increase in number of POs (sellers),
    total allocated bands increases because more number of free channels are available
    which can be acquired by the SUs. The proposed model makes a good use of the vacant
    radio spectrum as compared to PreDA. This is because, virtual group formation
    strategy applied in PreDA creates groups for a channel whose group bids may not
    be high enough to exceed the ask value of the channel. Also in PreDA, a buyer
    group having more than one member eliminates the minimum bid SU from the group.
    This decreases the group bid value as well as winning SU count who can be allocated
    the channels in PreDA. In our proposed model, channel-specific group formation
    is carried out for each channel. We assign a channel to every member of the winning
    group. The group bids calculated in the proposed model give a greater value as
    compared to the group bids in PreDA due to which there is a greater chance for
    a channel to get assigned in our model. When number of channels are less, marginally
    similar results are obtained for both the models since there are sufficient SUs
    who can get the channels. But when number of channels increases, the possibility
    of getting unassigned channels also increases. Fig. 4(b) shows the number of allocated
    channels (units) per seller where the proposed model performs better as compared
    to PreDA due to the group formation and allocation methods deployed in our model.
    Increase in number of sellers increases the competition amongst them to sell their
    free channels. This leaves behind some unassigned channels. So, on increasing
    the number of sellers the count of allocated channels per seller decreases. PreDA
    uses signal to interference and noise ratio (SINR) as a preference indicator of
    channels which is an important criteria for channel selection. Using SINR can
    provide a different perspective in the quality of available channels. We plan
    to use SINR in our designed model as a future initiative so that we can allow
    finer radio bands to be utilized in an efficient way. FIGURE 4. a, b shows total
    allocated units and allocated units per seller of proposed model and PreDA respectively
    with respect to number of POs. Show All Fig 5(a) shows the total allocated bands
    for both the models with increasing number of SUs (buyers). When number of SU
    increases for a fixed set of available channels, more SUs are willing to utilize
    the vacant spectrum. This also increases the SU count who can reuse a particular
    channel. From the figure we can observe that when SUs are more in number, almost
    all auctioned channels sell out in our proposed model. But the grouping strategy
    applied for channel allocation in PreDA reduces the number of allocated bands.
    In Fig 5(b), allocated channels per seller shows a growth with increasing number
    of SUs because number of allocated channel increases when more SUs are eager to
    get the channels. FIGURE 5. a, b shows total allocated units and allocated units
    per seller of proposed model and PreDA respectively with respect to number of
    SUs. Show All Fig 6(a) shows the number of satisfying SUs with respect to their
    channel preference when number of PO is 5 and number of SU is 50. In our proposed
    model, a new preference list is built up by an SU in each auction round. To obtain
    the satisfying buyers in Fig 6(a) we consider the initial auction round and the
    respective preference lists of the SUs in this round. In our model, an SU bids
    for all its available channels according to its preference list. Group formation
    and channel allocation algorithms do not include channel preference. So from Fig
    6(a) we can observe that the number of satisfying SUs varies for different channel
    preferences. Fig 6(b) shows the number of satisfying SUs with respect to their
    channel preference when number of PO is 5 and number of SU is 70. Here again,
    we take the initial auction round to compute the number of satisfying buyers.
    FIGURE 6. a, b shows number of satisfying SUs with respect to channel preference
    for 50 SUs 5 POs and 70 SUs 5 POs respectively for the proposed model. Show All
    In Fig. 7(a), spectrum utilization is obtained for the proposed model for three
    different sets of SUs on increasing the number of POs from 5 to 30. When number
    of channels are more, SUs have a greater chance to get access to the spectrum.
    This increases the spectrum utilization with increase in number of POs. The model
    also allows the leftover availability time of the assigned channels to be used
    in successive auction rounds which further boosts the overall spectrum utilization.
    In some cases spectrum utilization can get reduced even when channels are more
    in number because some channels may remain unassigned during the auction process
    or the leftover availability time of the assigned channels may not get used. Again,
    when number of SU increases for a fixed set of POs, we get an improved performance
    for spectrum utilization. However, due to interfering SUs and the network constraints
    taken up in this model, a group with more SU count may achieve a reduced utilization
    as compared to a group with less number of SUs. Fig. 7(b) shows the payment earned
    by the winning sellers. On increasing the number of channels, sellers are likely
    to earn a higher income since the number of auctioned items are more. In the proposed
    model, group bids computed are high and this enables our model to lease more number
    of channels which further increases the seller’s payment. When SUs are more in
    number, then depending on the groups formed for the channels, the payment marginally
    varies among the sets of SUs. Similarly from Fig. 7(c), we can observe that on
    increasing the number of channels the auctioneer gets to earn a higher revenue
    if all channels get assigned during the auction. Fig. 7(d) shows the channel allocation
    ratio. When number of channels are less all channels get assigned amongst the
    SUs. But on increasing the number of channels, it is more likely that some channels
    remain unassigned which thereby decreases the allocation ratio. Lastly Fig. 7(e)
    gives the spectrum reusability values where with increasing number of channels
    spectrum reuse improves subject to the number of assigned channels. But with different
    sets of SUs, interference amongst the SUs may somehow effect the spectrum reusability.
    FIGURE 7. a, b, c, d, e shows spectrum utilization, seller payment, revenue, channel
    allocation ratio and spectrum reuse respectively of proposed model for different
    sets of SUs on varying the number of POs. Show All In Fig. 8(b) and 8(c), we are
    varying the number of channels which a PO can auction. The number of channels
    that are available for auction from each PO is randomly chosen between 1 and 3.
    Fig 8(a) shows the total number of channels that are kept for lease by the POs
    when the number of POs are varying from 5 to 20. In Fig. 8(b) we can observe the
    variation in spectrum utilization in three different sets of SUs when the number
    of POs are increased. With more number of channels, it is expected that some of
    those channels will remain unassigned which reduces the utilization of the radio
    bands. Again in some cases, even with increasing the number of POs, spectrum utilization
    may get reduced because the number of channels available from the POs is less.
    This reduces the spectrum availability amongst the SUs. Therefore, when the number
    of channels from POs is different, then an increase in the number of POs cannot
    indicate an increase in the number of channels or an increase in spectrum utilization.
    On taking different sets of SUs, we can observe that spectrum utilization increases
    with increasing SU count because the number of non-interfering SUs who can be
    simultaneously assigned a channel increases. But, there can be a situation where
    some available channel remains unassigned because the group bids cannot satisfy
    the allocation condition and this consequently degrades the spectrum utilization
    obtained by the set comprising of more number of SUs as compared to the set having
    lesser number of SUs. In Fig. 8(c), channel allocation ratio has been displayed
    for different SU sets. For all the sets we get a good performance in channel allocation.
    This is because in our model, if a channel does not get assigned in an auction
    round, successive auction rounds can be carried out to lease such channel until
    a stopping criteria is met. This increases the chances of channel allocation.
    However, on increasing the number of POs (which can increase the number of channels),
    there may arise some unassigned channels which can reduce the channel allocation
    ratio. FIGURE 8. a, b, c shows total number of auctioned channels from POs and
    spectrum utilization and channel allocation ratio for three different sets of
    SUs when the number of channels at POs are varied. Show All Fig. 9(a) and 9(b)
    shows how the channel availability time constraint can have an impact on the use
    of radio spectrum. We evaluate the performance using two scenarios. In one scenario,
    number of POs is varied from 5 to 30 when number of SU is 80, and in other scenario
    number of SUs is varied from 50 to 90 when number of PO is 10. On simulating PreDA,
    we have considered that PreDA does not include the availability time constraint
    in its model as according to [22] and its allocation proceeds as per its designed
    algorithm. Now when winning SUs are obtained in PreDA, then there we may find
    one or more winning SUs who are unable to complete their transmission. This is
    because, such as SU gets a channel which has to be given way to the licensed user
    while the SU is carrying out its transmission. As such, the successful user ratio
    declines in PreDA and this results in a wastage of the radio spectrum. But in
    our proposed model, every wining SU can complete its transmission over the assigned
    channel due to the constraints imposed in the model. This overall provides a much
    better successful user ratio and improves the radio spectrum usage. FIGURE 9.
    a, b shows successful user ratio of proposed model and PreDA with respect to number
    of SUs and POs in consideration with availability time constraint. Show All In
    Fig. 10(a) and 10(b), spectrum utilization and spectrum reuse values are obtained
    when the interference range is varied as {100m, 200m, 300m, 400m, 500m, 600m}
    for three different sets of SUs, {20, 40, 60}, with the number of PO kept fixed
    at 6. From Fig 10(a), we can observe that on increasing the interference distance
    for each SU, the spectrum utilization gets reduced since the numbers of members
    in the groups will get reduced. When the interference distance considered is large
    enough, then even some channels may remain unassigned resulting in a shrink in
    spectrum utilization. Similarly, spectrum reuse degrades in its performance with
    increase in the interference distance as shown in Fig 10(b). Again, Fig. 10(c)
    and 10(d) shows the spectrum utilization and spectrum reuse values under the similar
    interference ranges, but in a different scenario where the number of POs are varied
    as {2, 4, 6} while keeping the number of SU fixed at 20. From both the figures,
    we can observe that there is a decrease in the values of the two parameters which
    occurs because the group sizes get smaller on increasing the interference distance
    for each SU. However, with increase in the number of channels, a growth in the
    performance of both spectrum utilization and spectrum reuse can be observed. FIGURE
    10. a, b, c, d shows spectrum utilization and spectrum reuse for varying interference
    ranges with respect to number of SUs and number of POs. Show All Hence, from the
    simulation results we can conclude that the proposed double auction mechanism
    deployed for spectrum allocation in CRN significantly helps in enhancing the spectrum
    utilization across the network. SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we proposed
    a double auction mechanism for multi-channel multi-winner allocation with heterogeneous
    channel condition. This urges the sellers and buyers to submit channel-specific
    asks and bids respectively to the auctioneer. Dynamics in spectrum opportunities
    and variation in availability time of channels are incorporated in the model which
    essentially improves the network performance. To allow spectrum reuse, groups
    are configured specifically for each channel and a group bid from each group decides
    the channel allocation pattern amongst the SUs. Along with achieving an improved
    spectrum utilization, we have also proved that the proposed auction is individually
    rational, truthful and budget balance. Simulations have been carried out to show
    that the proposed auction outshines in terms of spectrum utilization which significantly
    resolves the spectrum scarcity problem amongst the wireless devices. As a future
    initiative, we plan to improve the utility of the buyers and the sellers by considering
    the network conditions proposed in this model. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This article was

    Today, wireless communication systems are very important in human life. Wide range
    of applications and services of wireless communications are going to change the
    world more in future. The growth and usage of wireless communication systems increased
    rapidly across the world which led to the main problems of wireless communications,
    which are the scarcity of radio resources like power, frequency, and time. At
    present, the frequency spectrum’s less availability, the need of reuse of the
    frequency have also gained great importance. There is a necessity to design, improve,
    and upgrade the wireless communication systems if we need to attain the improvement
    of communications. In wireless communications, the resources must be utilized
    properly or else it may cause a issue scarcity of resources, which need to be
    solved. The spectrum is a major resource, and it should be allocated such that
    it is not going to be wasted. Static spectrum allocation and dynamic spectrum
    allocation can be said as the types of the allocation methods. The static spectrum
    allocation has given many successful applications the required spectrum they needed,
    but a situation was faced, where the spectrum [1] which was available has became
    insufficient for the emerging technologies, as the available applications left
    no space for them. We can also say that the spectrum is left unutilized. The main
    concept behind the working of a cognitive radio is the reuse or using this unutilized
    spectrum in an optimal way. We can solve these issues by using CRN’s. Cognitive
    radio’s have capability that to be aware of its environment. Mitola was the first
    person to introduce cognitive radio. The CR should need adaptability, sensing,
    flexibility, agility. Cognitive radio networks are formed by connecting all the
    cognitive radios. These cognitive radios try to sense the spectrum and try to
    figure out the white spaces in it. Cognition, awareness, adaptability are the
    basic features of CRN’s. The performance of a system can be made as optimal only
    by processing the information that we obtain from the environment, and this process
    is known as cognition. The process of finding whether a spectrum is available
    for communication or not that is sensing the environment which is known as awareness.
    A dynamic system which can reconfigure its parameters [2] is a cognitive radio
    system. The issues like utilization of unused spectrum and the less availability
    of the spectrum can be solved by using the dynamic accessing property of the spectrum
    of a cognitive radio [3]. As these networks are dynamic, open, flexible, there
    are chances that they can be exploited. These networks are vulnerable to attacks.
    Hence providing them with security is of a big and a complicated task. The cognitive
    cycle can be represented as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Cognitive cycle Full size
    image 1.1 AI for Cognitive Radio Networks Cognitive radio (CR) is the emerging
    technology for providing many applications [4] like self-organizing networks,
    spectrum markets, dynamic spectrum access, and so on. The cognitive radio designs
    can be implemented by using AI techniques [5] which help in improving the factors
    such as security, robustness, stability, responsiveness of a cognitive radio [6].
    The three main things that should be in cognitive radio are: observation, reconfiguration,
    and cognition. Observation: It is the process of collecting the characteristics
    of the radio and information about the environment. Reconfiguration: The process
    of changing a radio’s operating parameters. Cognition: The process of analyzing
    the radio characteristics and environment, making decisions of actions, noting
    the impact of these actions on radio is done here. These three can be combined
    to form an element called cognitive engine (CE). In a CR, the tasks of cognition
    are taken care by this engine [7]. The process starts by taking the input from
    environment; now, the analysis and classification of the situation are done by
    CE [8]. 2 Related Works The cognition in a radio can be viewed in application
    of artificial intelligence to the radio domain [8]. This paper presents a view
    on different types of techniques [9] used for implementing the design of a cognitive
    radio and providing security against attacks on cognitive radios like sensing
    data falsification attack, primary user emulation attack, etc. The table representing
    attacks and their existing solutions are given in Table 1. Table 1 Traditional
    attacks and their existing solutions Full size table 3 Attack Models 3.1 PHY Layer
    Attack Model The report false sensing attack (RFSD) that occurs in PHY layer mainly
    uses the collaborative spectrum sensing reports to mislead the resultant users.
    In collaborative spectrum sensing, the sensing reports from the several secondary
    users are considered to make a final decision of a primary user presence in the
    spectrum. Now, if “on” is the result of the fusion center that gives a clarity
    that attack is accomplished. The honest secondary users sensing reports characteristics
    can be seen now. In every stage of sensing, the sensing energy of a ith client
    can be denoted as Ei and it’s distribution is $$E_{i \\, \\sim } \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {\\chi_{2m,}^{2} H_{0} } \\\\ {\\chi_{2m}^{2} \\left( {2\\gamma_{i} } \\right),
    H_{1} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.$$ (1) where χ specifies chi-square allocation,
    m = time band width, \\(\\gamma\\)i = signal to noise ratio, H0 represents primary
    user is absent, and H1 represents main user which is available. Let \\(G_{0 }\\)
    represents sincere coverage, and \\(G_{1 }\\) represents untruthful coverage.
    An attacker reports correct Em value if it is above the threshold, i.e., Em ≥ ξ
    and dishonestly report if and if it is below threshold, i.e., Em < ξ he reports
    wrong value Em + Δ (because primary user is not present), where ξ = threshold
    and Δ = bias which attacker adds. 3.2 Defense Scheme There is a three step procedure.
    In this scheme, at primary step, the presence of primary user is find out by using
    the sensing reports given by each node by the fusion center. Which is done by
    using a hypothesis test 1 for each node? The Neyman Pearson lemma is of the form:
    $$\\mathop \\prod \\limits_{i = 1,i \\ne j}^{N} \\frac{{P\\left( {E_{i} = e_{i}
    |H_{1} } \\right)}}{{P\\left( {E_{i} = e_{i} |H_{0} } \\right)}}$$ (2) where η
    is the threshold value for examination 1. In second step, if the result of test
    1 is H0, then only we perform test 2 to find out if the node (j) is lying. $$\\frac{{P\\left(
    {E_{j} = e_{j} |G_{1} , H_{0} } \\right)}}{{P\\left( {E_{j} = e_{j} |G_{0} , H_{0}
    } \\right)}}$$ (3) 3.3 MAC Layer Attack Model In order to start the transmission
    of the data packets by a inferior user, it need to stay for some length of time
    known as distributed inter frame space (DIFS). DIFS means the length of the time
    upto which a channel must remain idle after that time completes a secondary user
    can use that channel to transmit the data. A interval [0, CW] is used to distribute
    uniformly this backoff time. Contention window is the representation of CW. If
    the transmission becomes successful, then the CW will be again set to minimum
    value. 3.4 Defense Scheme The cramer-von Mises (C-M) test is used as defense scheme.
    The difference between distributive functions is used here to find the malicious
    users, where a window size is observed, and it is examined whether it follows
    the distribution of the original window size or not. In the first step, for each
    and every node, the observed window size is calculated $$x_{i} = \\frac{{t_{i}
    - t_{i - 1} - T_{{{\\text{DIFS}}}} - T_{o} }}{\\delta }$$ (4) where \\(t_{i -
    1} =\\) last transmission end time, \\(T_{o}\\) = time taken between last transmission
    end time and current time of packet, and \\(t_{i} =\\) current time of packet.
    A cumulative distribution can be made, and it is denoted by F1. Now, the difference
    can be evaluated between cumulative functions is calculated as \\(\\theta\\).
    Let ×1,…, xK be the K observations, and y1, …, yL be the L sample data of real
    distribution. Then, the \\(\\theta\\) can be calculated as: $$\\begin{aligned}\\theta
    & = \\frac{{KL}}{{\\left( {K + L} \\right)^{2} }}\\left( \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{i
    = 1}}^{K} \\text{sgn} \\left( {F_{0} \\left( {x_{i} } \\right) - F_{1} \\left(
    {x_{i} } \\right)} \\right)\\left[ {F_{0} \\left( {x_{i} } \\right) - F_{1} \\left(
    {x_{i} } \\right)} \\right]^{2}\\right. \\\\ &\\quad + \\left.\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{j
    = 1}}^{L} \\text{sgn} \\left( {F_{0} \\left( {y_{j} } \\right) - F_{1} \\left(
    {y_{j} } \\right)} \\right)\\left[ {F_{0} \\left( {y_{j} } \\right)~\\left( 6
    \\right) - F_{1} \\left( {y_{j} } \\right)} \\right]^{2} \\right)\\end{aligned}$$
    (5) A value “D” defined as max {\\(\\theta\\), 0} is used to find the trust value.
    The trust value \\(\\pi_{2}\\) is calculated by $$\\pi_{2} = e^{{ - D^{2} }}$$
    (6) If the value of \\(\\theta\\) becomes negative, then we can say that original
    window size is less than the backoff window size. D takes the value of zero, and
    the trust value becomes 1. 3.5 Cross-Layer Attack The utilization of the channel
    can be reduced easily by using a cross layer attack. The attack which is considered
    here is: Firstly, the RFSD assault occurs in physical layer, and secondly, the
    small backoff window (SBW) assault occurs in medium access control layer [15].
    These both attacks take a relationship of “OR.” The attack probability \\(P_{1}\\)
    is used by attackers to perform RFSD attack and \\(P_{2}\\) to perform SBW attack
    on their corresponding layers. These attack probabilities are the values which
    are optimal and chosen by the attackers carefully. 3.6 Cross-Layer Defense The
    section shows a cross-layer defense framework, and it is represented as (Fig.
    2). Fig. 2 Cross-layer defense framework for CRN’s Full size image The parts of
    the above represented framework are: SLMTC: Single-layer monitoring and trust
    calculation: The part of the framework where the trust values of nodes in individual
    layers are calculated. Trust fusion: The trust values from individual layers are
    considered, and a final trust value T is calculated from all the available nodes
    in the network. Anomalous recognition: After calculating the final test value
    for a node, it is considered, and the node is classified whether it is malicious
    or not is done here. The CTM—cross-layer trust manager is obtained by combining
    trust fusion and abnormal detection parts of the defense framework. The goal of
    the trust fusion is to determine how much a node I can be trusted by the CTM.
    The final trust value can be calculated as: $$T = w_{1} \\pi_{1} + w_{2} \\pi_{2}$$
    (7) where w1 is the level with which the CTM trusts the PHY layer results, and
    w2 is the level with which the CTM trusts the MAC layer results. \\(\\pi_{1}\\)
    and \\(\\pi_{2}\\) are the individual layer trust values. The weights are derived
    by using variance values. The weights are calculated as: $$w_{1} = \\frac{{v_{2}
    }}{{v_{1} + v_{2} }},w_{2} = \\frac{{v_{1} }}{{v_{1} + v_{2} }}.$$ (8) A heuristic
    method is used here to find the values of variances. Let vj represents the variances
    with j = 1, 2, and \\(v_{j}^{i}\\) denotes the sequence of variances \\(\\left\\{
    {\\pi_{j}^{i} \\left( 1 \\right) \\ldots \\pi_{j}^{i} \\left( M \\right)} \\right\\}\\),
    where M is current detection round; I is node number; j is layer number. The variance
    is calculated as: $$v_{j} = \\frac{1}{{c_{j} }}\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{{i,1 \\le
    i \\le N \\& \\frac{{v_{j}^{i} }}{{v_{j}^{m} }} \\le \\rho }} v_{j}^{i}$$ (9)
    where cj is the count of nodes who satisfy the condition \\(\\frac{{v_{j}^{i}
    }}{{v_{j}^{m} }} \\le \\rho\\), and \\(\\rho\\) is the threshold value for finding
    which variances doesn’t satisfy normal nodes variances. After the calculation
    of the final trust value for a node if it is less than the threshold value λ3,
    it is considered as malicious. 4 Results 4.1 Simulation Setup For the simulation
    initially, we consider a wireless CRN with 10 nodes, Let N = 10 out of which two
    secondary users are not trusted, and they do not collude. The main important parameters
    we have considered are listed in Table 2. Table 2 Simulation parameters Full size
    table 4.2 Results Figure 3 illustrates the defense mechanism we are following
    in the physical layer, and the considered parameters are attack probability in
    X-axis and channel availability in Y-axis. When there is no attacker the performance
    in the physical layer is considerably good but when two attackers are there, then
    the performance automatically degrades. When the attackers are there and the defense
    mechanism defined in our work is used, then performance is automatically good.
    The above graph shows an evident result about the physical layer defense mechanism
    in our work is considerably very good. When assault chance is 0, and control accessibility
    will be 1. Fig. 3 Physical layer attack and defense scheme Full size image Figure
    4 illustrates the defense mechanism we are following in the MAC layer, and the
    considered parameters are attack probability in X-axis and transmission probability
    in Y-axis. When there is no attacker, then the performance in the MAC layer is
    excellent but when two attackers are there, then the performance automatically
    degrades, and it reaches to the attack probability of 1(all nodes are not useful
    and attacked). The above graph shows an evident result about the MAC layer defense
    mechanism in our work which is considerably very good. When assault chance is
    0 and control accessibility will be 1. Fig. 4 MAC layer attack and defense scheme
    Full size image From these two simulations, the following observations are noted
    in physical and MAC layers. When there is no security, the channel accessibility
    in attack probability increases and physical layer decreases significantly. Physical
    layer performance is good, and there is a more chance of attacks in this layer
    than in MAC layer. From the simulation, it is observed that the optimal assault
    chance is 0.5, and the utmost performance deprivation is 16.42%. In MAC layer,
    defense attack chance is 0.8, and the maximum performance decrease is 8.72%. 5
    Conclusion This work gives a significant solution to cross-layer attacks in cognitive
    radio networks. When secondary user attacks in one layer, his attack strength
    is very less compared to coordination in multiple layers. The layers we have considered
    are physical, MAC, and the attacks are RFSD (Physical) and SBW (MAC) layers. The
    Trust fusion mechanism demonstrated in this work works provides solution for abnormal
    users detection in physical and MAC layers and cross- layer trust management schemes.
    Finally, this concept of cross-layer trust management schemes can also be useful
    to remaining attacks in other layers of CRN’s. References Ganesh D, Pavan Kumar

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Changsha, China SECTION I. Introduction With
    the rapid expansion of wireless Internet services, the number of users in wireless
    communication systems has increased exponentially, which requires more spectrum
    and continuous bandwidth. Radio Frequency spectrum is a highway for wireless communication
    systems and information communication technology services. Current spectrum management
    lacks flexibility. In order to meet the growing demand for spectrum, new supervisory
    methods and technical means are needed for spectrum allocation, utilization and
    management to achieve more flexible spectrum sharing and dynamic spectrum access
    to meet the growing demand for spectrum crisis. Dynamic spectrum access is an
    effective method of spectrum sharing. It can regulate the use of spectrum and
    realize the effective use of spectrum resources. Dynamic spectrum sharing is to
    realize that third-party users can share spectrum authorized to existing users
    without interference to existing users. Cognitive radio technology can use spectrum
    dynamically and adaptively to realize dynamic spectrum sharing. The second users
    of unauthorized spectrum can share the spectrum of primary users without interference
    to authorized users. In cognitive radio technology, the primary user, that is,
    the authorized user, has priority in the use of the spectrum, and the secondary
    user, that is, the unauthorized user, uses the unused spectrum opportunely. These
    unused spectrum is called spectrum holes. Generally, spectrum holes can be divided
    into two categories: time spectrum holes and space spectrum holes [1]. The time
    spectrum hole is that one band of the primary user is not used for a period of
    time. The spatial spectrum hole is that there is a spatial spectrum hole in the
    geographical area far from the primary user. In cognitive radio networks, the
    goal of secondary users is to find and utilize spectrum holes in the most efficient
    way. Before accessing spectrum, secondary users detect spectrum holes by spectrum
    sensing [2], geographic location database, or feedback signal [3]–[4]. Once spectrum
    holes are detected, secondary users share spectrum band with primary users. Spectrum
    sharing is divided into three modes: interweave spectrum sharing, overlay spectrum
    sharing and Underlay spectrum sharing. In interleaved spectrum sharing, if the
    secondary user detects the absence of the primary user, the secondary user accesses
    the frequency band and uses the time spectrum holes to Implementing secondary
    and primary users to avoid simultaneous transmission. In Underlay spectrum sharing,
    secondary users use spatial spectrum holes to control transmission power to avoid
    interference to primary users and violate the allowable interference threshold
    of primary users, so as to achieve simultaneous transmission between secondary
    users and primary users. In overlay spectrum sharing, secondary users reduce the
    interference in concurrent transmission by assisting primary transmission. In
    return, secondary users gain additional transmission time or bandwidth for their
    own transmission. At present, cognitive radio technology mainly focuses on the
    ground network. For satellite communications, C and K-band frequencies are used
    for fixed satellite services, while for mobile satellite services, L and S bands
    are more suitable because they are less affected by atmospheric factors. Due to
    the demand for high broadband services, mobile satellite services allocate higher
    frequency bands, including Ku and Ka bands, in addition to L and s bands. The
    future satellite network is a heterogeneous wireless access network. Each network
    works in a different spectrum range. The spectrum range is wider and the spectrum
    management is more complex. In addition, cognitive radio technology also needs
    to solve the problem of spectrum sharing security. Spectrum security is also an
    important issue of dynamic spectrum management and dynamic spectrum access. The
    literature [5] proposes a blockchain verification protocol for secure spectrum
    sharing in mobile cognitive radio networks. This spectrum sharing mechanism is
    used for media access protocol to access wireless bandwidth. In this paper, This
    paper analyzes the several application scenarios of cognitive satellite network
    is analyzed, and we proposes a dynamic spectrum sharing method for LEO satellite
    network based on Blockchain. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
    2 is the overview of blockchain; section 3 describes the current scenario scheme
    of cognitive satellite network system; section 4 describes the architecture and
    principle of spectrum sharing system of cognitive satellite network based on blockchain;
    section 5 is the conclusion. SECTION II. Overview of Blockchain Blockchain is
    a distributed ledger that operate without any trusted central authorization. Blockchain
    data structure is an ordered block list. These blocks record digital actions,
    which are aggregated into blocks. These digital actions can be transactions, etc.
    These digital action blocks should be broadcast to all nodes in the network and
    verified by the network nodes. These digital action blocks should be confirmed
    by all nodes in the network. A. Blockchain Structure Figure 1 is Blockchain structure
    which has four block. A block of Blockchain generally consist of header fields
    and digital action lists. A digital action includes information about contributors,
    time, etc. Header field includes version, Hash value of the previous block, timestamp,
    nonce, Merkle root. The Header field was fixed length. A timestamp is the time
    at which blocks are generated. Nonce is a counter used to ensure that each digital
    action is processed only once. The hash value is calculated by passing the header
    of the previous block to a hash function. With the hash of the previous block
    stored in the current block, lockchain is thus growing with new blocks being created
    and linked to it. Fig. 1 Blockchain structure Show All Merkle root is the root
    of Merkle tree, which is a binary tree data structure. In the blockchain, Merkle
    tree calculates a hash value for all the digital actions in each block through
    the Hash function. by concatenating two hashes, which is called leaf node, a new
    string will form, and the hash value is calculated for the new string. A new hash
    value is obtained. the new hash value is called the parent node. A Merkle tree
    is constructed by recursively hashing paired leaf nodes until at last there is
    only one hash, Namely Merkle root. B. Consensus Algorithm Blockchain does not
    need to be verified by a trusted third party. Instead, a consensus is used and
    there are different consensus algorithms. Generally, there are proof of work (PoW),
    proof of Stake (PoS) and Practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT). In the case
    of no centre authority, the digital action block generated by one node is verified
    by all nodes. C. Digital Signature In asymmetric encryption algorithm, each node
    needs two keys, namely public key and private key, which can be encrypted and
    decrypted each other. The public key is public and does not need to be kept secret,
    while the private key is held by itself. When node A communicates with node B,
    two processes can be realized, one is encryption based on public key, the other
    is authentication based on public key, namely digital signature authentication.
    SECTION III. Scenario of Spectrum Sharing System In Cognitive Satellite Network
    Cognitive satellite network mainly includes two scenarios for spectrum sharing.
    One is cognitive hybrid satellite terrestrial network, which allows satellite
    network and terrestrial network to run in the same frequency band. The other is
    the cognitive multi beam broadband dual satellite shared spectrum system. A. Cognitive
    hybrid satellite terrestrial network Figure 1 shows the cognitive hybrid satellite
    terrestrial network model [6]. For cognitive hybrid satellite terrestrial network,
    it includes two communication links for sharing spectrum, the first is the communication
    link from satellite to satellite user terminal, the second is the communication
    link from ground base station (BS) to ground user terminal. the following table
    I is the possible spectrum band of hybrid cognitive hybrid satellite terrestrial
    network. Fig. 2 System model of cognitive satellite terrestrial network Show All
    TABLE I Possible Frequency Bands For Cognitive Satellite Terrestrial Network Networks
    B. Cognitive multi beam broadband dual satellite shared spectrum system Figure
    3 shows dual-satellite shared spectrum scheme for multi-beam broadband satellites
    [7], both of which cover the same area of multi-beam satellites and operate in
    normal forward mode. The two satellites are GEO and connected to different gateways.
    The principle of cognitive multi-beam satellite network system divides the system
    into primary satellite and slave satellite. The core technology of cognitive radio
    is beam sensing. The purpose of beam sensing is to find and use idle beam to transmit
    information without harmful interference to the primary satellite. In the procedure
    of communication, the slave satellite is to quickly sense the re-emergence of
    the primary satellite, and to release the occupied beam to the primary satellite.
    The working process of cognitive radio unit is as follows: in each specific time
    slot, the signal received by antenna is transmitted to the broadband RF front-end
    through the receiving unit, then energy detection is carried out and multiple
    candidate available channels are determined, then information is transmitted to
    the MAC layer, and then the detection module is used to identify the signal types
    received in the candidate channels, if in this channel. When the signal is present,
    the MAC layer will select another candidate channel, and then detect the channel
    until the unoccupied channel is found. Fig. 3 Dual-satellite sharing spectrum
    scheme for multi-beam satellites Show All SECTION IV. Spectrum Sharing System
    of Cognitive Satellite Network Based On Blockchain Spectrum sharing system of
    cognitive satellite network based on blockchain is for LEO satellite network system
    and is a self-organization spectrum management system. A. Arcitecture of Spectrum
    sharing system for cognitive satellite network based on blockchain Consider a
    LEO multi-beam satellite communication network system as shown in Figure 5. The
    spectrum license satellite and the non-licensed satellite are composed. The spectrum
    license satellite is called the primary satellite and the non-licensed satellite
    is called the second satellite. When the spectrum of the primary satellite is
    not used in a specific time and area, the second satellite can rent these spectrum
    to improve the spectral efficiency. And make the primary satellite generate additional
    revenue. We consider LEO satellite communication network system, which is composed
    of spectrum licensed satellite and non licensed satellite The spectrum licensed
    satellite is called the primary satellite, and the non licensed satellite is called
    the secondary satellite. When the spectrum of the primary satellite is not used
    in a specific time and area, the secondary satellite can rent the spectrum, which
    can improve the spectrum efficiency and generate additional income for the primary
    satellite. For the dynamic spectrum access system of LEO satellite based on blockchain,
    there are two modes to establish the blockchain network. The first mode is to
    directly deploy the blockchain network on the communication network composed of
    LEO satellites. The system architecture is shown in Figure 4. It includes LEO
    cognitive satellite network system, satellite ground network management center
    and control center system. In the first mdoe, the information about spectrum management
    recorded in the blockchain is directly generated by the satellite node. in the
    LEO satellite communication network. Satellite node has the functions of mining.
    In the first mode, all the functions of the blockchain are completed on the satellite
    node. It is necessary to configure a control channel on the satellite node by
    using the inter satellite link, which is used to transmit transactions and blocks.
    Fig. 4 LEO cognitive satellite network system based on blockchain and directly
    deploying on satellite node Show All Suppose there are N satellites, including
    P primary satellites U1, U2,…, Up, S second satellites, Up +1, Up +2,…,Up+s ,.
    These satellites have half-duplex transceivers, which can be sent or received
    at any time. The spectrum is divided into M orthogonal channels 1, 2,… M, these
    channels are symmetrical. Assuming that all satellites have a common control channel
    for exchanging control messages between the primary satellite and the second satellite,
    and that each satellite has another channel connected to the ground station, this
    control channel includes a variety of data frames, one of which is used for spectrum
    leasing, spectrum requests, and spectrum allocation for Satellites, defined as
    SLRA frame. The system clock can be realized by GPS receiver. Blockchain network
    is established in this control channel for spectrum access management. Blockchain
    network records satellite GPS information, spectrum usage information, spectrum
    leasing information, etc. The frame structure of SLRA frame is shown in Figure
    5, including synchronization code, SLRA Frame Fields, and data information. This
    mechanism eliminates the overhead of the traditional cognitive radio network,
    which is an additional sensing cycle. Fig. 5. SLRA Frame Structure Show All In
    the second mode, the blockchain network is not directly deployed on LEO satellite
    niode, but migrated to the ground network, as shown in Figure 6. LEO satellite
    can be connected to the ground network through GEO satellite, and can also be
    connected to the ground network in the coverage area. For LEO satellite, the on-board
    resources are limited, so the task of recording transaction and mining is to offload
    to the dedicated terrestrial blockchain network. In this mode, the blockchain
    functions as a separate database. Although this increases the cost of transferring
    transactions to the dedicated blockchain network, it is no longer necessary to
    use the inter satellite link between LEO satellites to establish a blockchain
    network. In this mode, the mining task is to offload to the ground cloud or edge
    computing service provider, and the transaction is recorded in the blockchain
    [8]. Fig. 6 LEO cognitive satellite network system based on blockchain and offload
    to ground network Show All B. Spectrum Leasing and Allocation Based on BlockChain
    When the primary satellite has idle spectrum, it advertise spectrum leasing information
    by SLRA frame, the second satellite receives spectrum leasing information sends
    spectrum request frame, and the primary satellite receives spectrum request frame
    from the second satellite, allocates available idle spectrum for the second satellite,
    and carries out leasing transactions. In order to rent and allocation spectrum
    based on Blockchain protocol, similar Bitcoin, the concept of specoins [8] is
    introduced. The primary satellite publishes idle spectrum, and there is rental
    cost based on specoins description in the SLRA frame. When the second satellite
    requests spectrum, there is rental cost in the SLRA frame. In addition, when the
    second satellite requests spectrum, the rental cost can be higher than the rental
    cost of the primary satellite. Within a certain time interval, if multiple secondary
    satellites request spectrum frames, the primary satellite will allocate spectrum
    to the secondary satellite with the highest rental cost, and the transaction is
    settled by specoins. Cognitive satellite network nodes are rewarded with specoins
    by updating blockchains. In addition, the secondary satellite can also get specoins
    directly in real currency exchange. Through the blockchain protocol, the secondary
    satellite can rent the available spectrum from the primary satellite. When the
    satellite does not have enough processing power to update the blockchain to obtain
    specoins, but needs a large amount of data transmission, it can exchange the real
    currency for specoins to obtain the available spectrum resources. Blockchain record
    all transactions, including available spectrum obtained by leasing, mining and
    updating Blockchain, real currency exchange, etc. The spectrum leasing and allocation
    based on Blockchain protocol is shown in Figure 7. Fig. 7. Spectrum Leasing and
    Allocation Based on Blockchain Show All SECTION V. Conclusion Dynamic spectrum
    access is an effective method to maximize the utilization of spectrum resources.
    For the dynamic spectrum management of satellite network, this paper analyzes
    the application scenarios of two kinds of cognitive satellite network at present,
    and puts forward dynamic spectrum access system for LEO cognitive satellite network
    based on blockchain, which can not only realize the maximum utilization of spectrum
    resources, but also solve the security problem of spectrum dynamic access. The
    process of spectrum leasing and allocation in LEO cognitive satellite network
    based on blockchain and the frame structure of spectrum lease, request and allocation
    are described in detail. Based on blockchain protocol, participants in spectrum
    usage can advertise, apply, record, confirm and use spectrum resources, which
    makes it easier to share spectrum resource between primary satellite and second
    satellite. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This Yaliny''s

    DOI: 10.1109/TII.2020.2971735 Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction
    The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next step in the evolution of the Internet,
    where physical objects augmented with computing, communication, and sensing capabilities
    will collect massive data, ranging from raw physical variables up to high-level
    information [1]. From the requirements of IoT, we can conclude the future devices
    should have cognitive capability and big data processing capability. So a simplified
    IoT can be seen as cognitive radio networks (CRNs). CRNs need to interact with
    the primary network to get spectrum resources. The interaction between cognitive
    radio and single primary network is divided into two stages, spectrum sensing
    and dynamic spectrum access. Since there is only one primary network, the access
    behavior is performed according to the spectrum sensing results. If the primary
    user (PU) arrives in the secondary user''s communication process, the communication
    process will be terminated and alienate the channel immediately, which is called
    dynamic spectrum access [2]. In the interaction between cognitive radio and multiple
    primary networks, the best dynamic spectrum access is needed according to the
    characteristics of different primary networks, to improve the performance of CRNs.
    This process is called network selection strategy [3]. As such, the network selection
    method is one of the dynamic spectrum access techniques in multiple primary networks
    scenarios. This interaction between CRNs and primary networks can bring more spectrum
    options to the CRN system through network diversity gains, and improve the quality
    of service of cognitive users. Therefore, more and more researchers began to invest
    in the network selection of CRNs with multiple primary networks [4]–[14]. Wei
    et al. [4] simulated the user''s behavior and evaluate the system performance
    under different strategies for dynamic spectrum access, and, then, formulated
    the best access strategy for different types of users. In [3], interference caused
    by cognitive users to PUs was analyzed, and a network selection scheme is proposed
    to minimize interference. In [5], a spectrum decision scheme is proposed for multichannel
    selection without considering the influence of sensing errors on spectrum decision-making.
    The final scheme reduces the average residence time of cognitive users. In [6],
    the influence of the number of users on the spectrum switching performance is
    analyzed, and two channel selection schemes are proposed with the objective function
    of maximizing the throughput of the system. However, in this article, the existence
    of perception errors is not considered, and perception is always considered accurate.
    In [7], the utility functions of throughput and network selection schemes were
    obtained based on continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) modeling under perfect spectrum
    sensing, and network selection schemes were proposed using gradient Markov performance
    potential theory. These studies are all under the assumption of perfect spectrum
    sensing. However, in the actual environment, two common spectrum sensing errors,
    namely false alarm and missed detection, are unavoidable. False alarm makes secondary
    user (SU) neglect the opportunity of spectrum access, resulting in the waste of
    spectrum resources, and missed detection leads to SU access to the channel transmitted
    by PU, resulting in SU dropout and interference with PU. Therefore, the network
    selection problem studied in this article is based on imperfect spectrum sensing.
    The problem of network selection under imperfect spectrum sensing also faces complexity
    challenges. Suppose there are M primary networks, and the number of channels shared
    by each primary is N m . There are three possible states for each spectrum unit,
    PU transmission, SU transmission, and idle state. The complexity of the system
    is O( 3 ∑ M m=1 N m ) . Besides, in the case of spectrum sensing errors, there
    are at most ∏ M m=1 ( N m +1) possible spectrum sensing results in each system
    state, at which time the complexity of the system research works O( 3 ∑ M m=1
    N m ) ∏ M m=1 ( N m +1) . Therefore, the network selection problem of multiple
    primary CRNs is a high-dimensional optimization problem with linear constraints.
    The prior knowledge of PUs is difficult to obtain in the complex network environment
    especially in multiple primary networks, and it is impossible to analyze the statistical
    characteristics of the system without the prior knowledge of PUs. Therefore, most
    of the studies are carried out on the assumption that prior knowledge of PUs is
    known. In [8], on the premise of knowing the prior knowledge of cognitive users
    and PUs, evolutionary game theory was used to model the whole process. Considering
    the users’ quality of service requirements comprehensively, and an evolutionary
    game scheme based on pricing and user needs is proposed to determine the best
    access scheme. In [9], the game model is used to study joint pricing and network
    selection in CRNs. In [10], the maximum achievable throughput of hybrid spectrum
    sharing method was calculated with given PU prior knowledge, and a new cooperative
    padded mode selection method in CRNs is proposed. In view of the fact that the
    prior knowledge of PUs is unknown, Wang et al. [11] extended the problem of [3]
    to the case of unknown PU''s channel state, and proposed a new solution under
    the condition of limited collision probability of PUs, including two improved
    schemes of greedy scheme and energy-efficient scheme, which have certain research
    significance for the future network selection problem. This article aims to address
    these problems in network selection. Considering the imperfect spectrum sensing
    results, highly complex system state, and the lack of prior knowledge of primary
    networks, we proposed a deep Q-learning based online network selection method,
    which can improve the intelligence of CRNs’ selection with multiple primary networks.
    The rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II introduces the system
    model of the CRNs with multiple primary networks. Section III analyzes the network
    selection problem with Markov decision process (MDP) and proposes a deep Q-learning
    based network selection method. Section IV shows simulation results and compares
    our proposed network selection method with an offline selection method. Finally,
    Section V concludes this article. SECTION II. System Model Cognitive radio technology
    is an effective way to solve the contradiction between the rapid development of
    wireless applications and inefficient spectrum allocation. However, the preemptive
    priority of PUs and the space-time variation characteristics of the idle channel
    lead to the extremely unstable performance of network (CRN). With the development
    of network convergence technology and the popularity of heterogeneous networks,
    the CRN with multiple primary networks (CRNMPNS) is becoming possible. CRNMPNS
    provides more spectrum resources and network selection options. Multiple primary
    CRNs consist of primary radio networks (PRNs) and CRNs. Its topological structure
    is shown in Fig. 1. Some PRNs are distributed in a certain geographical area,
    and CRNs are located in the area around them. CRN consists of SUs and fusion center
    (FC). SUs are divided into in-band SUs and out-of-band SUs. In-band SUs refers
    to US that have access to authorized channels, and those that have not access
    are called out-of-band SUs. For in-band SUs, it is not necessary to participate
    in spectrum sensing all the time. It is only necessary to periodically sense whether
    the currently occupied channel has a PU''s arrival while maintaining normal communication.
    If a PU arrives, it immediately exits the current channel and sends access request
    to FC again. For out-of-band SUs, FC allocates spectrum sensing. If there is an
    idle channel, FC allocates the right to access the authorized channel. Because
    FC has known the distribution of in-band SUs, the sensing channel only includes
    the channel occupied by PU and idle channel. Fig. 1. Topological structure of
    CRNMPNS. Show All The workflow diagram of multiple primary CRNs is shown in Fig.
    2. First, according to the current network state, FC adopts a certain cooperative
    sensing scheduling scheme. According to the sensing scheduling SUs sense, the
    corresponding PRNs. Then, SUs are sensed separately by single-point sensing, and
    the sensing results are fused by FC according to certain fusion criteria to determine
    the current final channel state of PRNs. When SU initiates an access request,
    FC chooses the best PRN for dynamic spectrum access according to the corresponding
    network selection scheme. Finally, the performance of the CRN network is evaluated,
    such as PU collision probability, CRN throughput, SU congestion rate, SU dropping
    rate, PU congestion rate, and other performance indicators. Network selection
    of multiple primary networks is a key technology in dynamic spectrum access. Fig.
    2. Work flow chart of CRNMPNS. Show All SECTION III. Reinforcement Learning Based
    Online Network Selection Method In the complex network environment, it is impossible
    to predict the situation of PRN''s prior knowledge, so it is impossible to solve
    this problem by using offline scheme. Therefore, it is necessary to study the
    network selection scheme in the case of PRN''s prior knowledge is unknown, that
    is, online network selection scheme. Therefore, in view of the necessity of this
    research, this article carries on the analysis and the scheme design of the online
    network selection. A. Network Selection According to the definition of CR, the
    premise is that PU does not cause harmful interference. In this article, the event
    of PU accessing SU channel is called PU collision event, and the probability of
    PU accessing SU channel is called PU collision probability. Therefore, if the
    collision probability of PU is not limited, spectrum switching will occur only
    when the collision probability of PRN m is high, which will lead to a higher collision
    probability of PRN m and have a greater impact on its PU service performance.
    Therefore, aiming at this problem, the network selection optimization of cognitive
    radio with multiple primary networks is studied with PU collision probability
    as constraint condition. 1) Performance Analysis From the concept of collision
    probability of PU, it can be concluded that the collision probability of PU is
    the ratio of the number of PUs occupying SU to the total number of PUs. Therefore,
    when the PU arrives and the PU interrupts SU transmission, the collision rate
    needs to be recorded and updated. Arrival of SU: When the event of SU’ arrival
    happens, the first thing is to make sure is there any idle channel from sensing
    result. If there is not any idle channel from sensing result, then this SU is
    blocked. Otherwise, SU is going to select one PRN to access. When this selected
    PRN has idle channel, then this SU is accessed. Otherwise, this SU is dropped.
    In the end, update the channel information. SU''s left: When SU completed its
    transmission, it will leave current channel. Arrival of PU: When PU arrives, if
    there is not any idle channel or SU''s channel, then this PU is blocked. Otherwise,
    this PU''s access is complete. If this PU accessed SU''s channel, then this SU
    is dropped and a new SU arrival process starts. If this PU did not access an SU’
    channel, then an idle channel is occupied. In the end, update the channel information.
    Because PU''s priority, there are following situations. PU arrives, and all channel
    are occupied by other PUs, then PU blocked. PU arrives, and randomly access idle
    channel, then update channel information and collision rate. PU arrives, and randomly
    access SU''s channel, then this SU execute a new SU arrival process called channel
    switching. At last, update the channel information and collision rate. PU''s left:
    When PU completed its transmission, it will leave current channel. By simulating
    the system in a period of time T , we can get the number of PU access in a period
    of time N m access,PU , the collision number N m collision , the number of dropped
    SU N drop,su , the number of accessed SU N access,su , and the number of blocked
    SU N block,su . Based on these data, we can get the performance index of communication
    system.  Block rate of SU: Let P block,su denote the block rate of SU. Then, the
    block rate can be represented as the ratio of the total number of SUs denied to
    the total number of SUs in PRN P block,su (s)= ∑ m=1 M N block,su (s) N access,su
    (s) ∀s∈Ω. (1) View Source Drop rate of SU: Let P drop,su denote the drop rate
    of SU. Then, the drop rate can be represented as the ratio of the total number
    of SUs interrupted to the total number of SUs in PRN: P drop,su (s)= ∑ m=1 M N
    drop,su (s) N access,su (s)− N block,su (s) ∀s∈Ω. (2) View Source Collision rate
    of PU: Let P m collision denote the collision rate of PU. Then, the collision
    rate can be represented as the ratio of the total number of collision between
    PU and SU to the total number of PUs in PRN P m collision (s)= N m collision (s)
    N m access,pu (s) ∀s∈Ω. (3) View Source Throughput of CRN: Let C denote the throughput
    of CRN. Then, the throughput can be represented as the ratio of the total number
    of SUs that complete the transmission task to the total length of time in a certain
    period of time C= ∑ m∈M,s∈Ω N m access,su (s)− N m block,su (s)− N m drop,su (s)
    T . (4) View Source Based on that, the online network selection problem can defined
    as: Without knowing the prior knowledge of PRNs, the system makes decision that
    SU access or not according the collision rate constraint of PU. This definition
    can use follow equation to describe: C1: C2: C3: θ(s,m)=arg max θ∈θs,m C θ θ s,m
    ∈[0,1] ∀m∈M∀s∈Ω ∑ m=1 M θ s,m =1∀s∈Ω P t collision,m <PCM,m,m∈M,t∈T (5) View Source
    where θ denote the accessibility of SU, P CM,m denotes the upper limit of collision
    probability. 2) Online Network Selection Scheme The online network selection scheme
    mainly calculates the priority of PRNs according to the updated collision probability
    of PU, and let P IM,m denote this probability. As the number of idle channels
    increase, PRN with lower collision probability should have higher priority, so
    priority can be set as a function of collision probability and number of idle
    channels. Thus, the P IM,m can be represented as follows: P IM,m = N IDLE,m N
    m × P CM,m − P c,m P CM,m (6) View Source where N IDLE,m denotes the number of
    idle channel in PRN m , N m denotes the number of channels, and P c,m denotes
    the latest collision rate of PU in PRN m . Therefore, if there is no idle channel,
    or if the collision probability of PU exceeds the upper limit, the priority is
    0, i.e., SU blocking. If it meets the requirements, the largest PRN m N in P IM,m
    is selected for access. Its pseudo-code is shown in Algorithm 1. Because the probability
    of PU collision in online network selection is obtained by recording the behavior
    of PU arrival, it can only represent the network state at that time. When SU arrives,
    the network state cannot be determined only by the collision probability of PU.
    Using online network selection scheme, when the collision probability of PU reaches
    a given upper limit, the current state is determined to be inaccessible, which
    will result in the waste of current band resources. Algorithm 1: Pseudo-code of
    ONUP. Input: N IDLE,m , P c,m , P CM,m Output: SU access/block for m∈S do do    if
    P c,m ≥ P CM,m then       P IM =−∞    else       if N IDLE,m ==0 then          P
    IM =−∞       end if    end if end for S ′ =m|m∈S, P IM ≠−∞ if S ′ ≠ϕ then    Action=‘SU
    block’ else [ k=ar g m∈ S ′ max( P IM ) ]    Acton=‘SU access in PR N k ’ end
    if Algorithm 2: Pseudo-code of ONUP-Greedy. % Here is the differences between
    ONUP and ONUP-Greedy if P c,m ≥ P CM,m then    σ= P c,m − P CM,m    [P,Q]=max(
    N IDLE,m (k,:))    if P≥2&&σ<h× P IM,m then       P IM,Q =1    else       P IM,Q
    =−∞    end if end if Therefore, a greedy online scheme based on the number of
    idle channels is proposed, that is, on the basis of the online scheme, when the
    collision probability is greater than the upper limit, judgment is added to find
    out the largest number of idle channels in the current state within a certain
    range of guaranteeing the maximum collision probability. If it is greater than
    2, the priority is 1 in the current state. If it is not satisfied, the priority
    is infinitesimal. When the number of idle channels is more than 2, it is guaranteed
    that the transmission will not be interrupted because of the random arrival of
    PU when the idle channel is accessed, and a reserved channel is given. Its pseudo-code
    is shown in Algorithm 2. The idea of online scheme based on minimum collision
    probability is similar to that of greedy online scheme. Only when the collision
    probability is exceeded, the access with the lowest collision probability of PU
    is selected under the same condition of greedy online scheme. Its pseudo-code
    is shown in Algorithm 3. Algorithm 3: Pseudo-code of ONUP-Min. % Here is the differences
    between ONUP and ONUP-Min if P c,m ≥ P CM,m then    σ= P c,m − P CM,m    [P,Q]=min(
    P c,m )    if P≥2&&σ<h× P IM,m then       P IM,Q =1    else       P IM,Q =−∞    end
    if end if B. Problem Formulation With MDP From the system model, we can see network
    selection is a kind of decision-making scheme. MDP can introduce a mechanism for
    reasoning about planning and acting when it faces uncertainty. This uncertainty
    can denote as a tuple (S,A,P r sa (⋅),R) . S is the set for possible states, A
    is the set of available actions, P r sa (⋅) denotes the transition probability
    to each state if action a is taken in state s , and R represents the reward function.
    A normal MDP process is shown as follows. s 0 is the initial state, in s 0 the
    agent takes an action a 0 . Then, system state transit from s 0 to s 1 according
    to the probabilities P r s 0 a 0 (⋅) , and based on action a 0 agent gets a reward
    R 0 . And this process continues to generate a state sequence s 0 , s 1 , s 2
    , s 3 ,… The aim of any agent in MDP is to maximize a discounted accumulative
    reward when starting in any state s , which is called state-value function and
    defined as follows: V π (s)=E[ ∑ t=0 ∞ γ t R t | s 0 =s,π] (7) View Source where
    R t is the reward received according action step t , γ is discount factor adjusting
    the effect of future rewards to current action selection, and π denotes the policy,
    which maps from state s to a probability distribution over actions that the agent
    can take in state s . The optimal state-value function [15] is given by V ∗ (s)=
    max π V π (s). (8) View Source Then, if this optimal state-value V ∗ (s) exists,
    the optimal policy π ∗ is determined as π ∗ ( s t )=arg max a∈A R ¯ a s t + ∑
    s t +1 P r s t a ( s t+1 V ∗ ( s t+1 )) (9) View Source where R ¯ a s t is the
    expected reward by taking action a at state s t . To calculate V ∗ (s) , the value-iteration
    algorithm can be adopted. However, since the transition probabilities P r sa (⋅)
    are not easy to acquire in many practical problems, reinforcement learning algorithm,
    especially Q-learning, are widely adopted to handle MDP problems, for which the
    state space, explicit transition probabilities, and the reward function are not
    essential [12]. In Q-learning, the Q function[15] is defined as Q π (s,a)=E[ ∑
    t=0 ∞ γ t R t | s 0 =s, a 0 =a,π] (10) View Source which is the expected accumulative
    reward when starting from state s with action a and, then, following policy π
    . Similarly, we can define the optimal Q function as Q ∗ (s,a)= max π Q π (s,a).
    (11) View Source Q-learning is ensured to reach the optimal Q values under conditions
    [12], which is executed according to following equation: Q t+1 (s,a)=(1−α) Q t
    (s,a)+α[ R t ]+γ max a ′ Q t ( s t+1 , a ′ ) (12) View Source where α is the learning
    rate. Once Q ∗ (s,a) for each state action pair is achieved, the optimal policy
    can be determined as π ∗ (s)=arg max a∈A Q ∗ (s,a). (13) View Source C. Deep Reinforcement
    Learning With the application of machine learning in everyday life, various machine
    learning methods are merging and upgrading. In this article, deep reinforcement
    learning method we selected, deep Q learning network (DQN), combines the advantages
    of Q learning with neural networks. If we use tabular Q learning, for each state,
    action needs to be stored in a table of Q table. In real life, we may have tens
    of millions of states. The values of DQN are all placed in tables, which is limited
    by our computer hardware, so it is inefficient to get data from tables and update
    data. This is why DQN comes into being. We can use neural networks to estimate
    the value of this state, so we do not need a table. We can take the state and
    action as the input of the neural network and, then, get the Q value of the action
    through the analysis of the neural network, so we do not need to record the Q
    value in the table, but directly use the neural network to generate Q value. In
    another form, we can input only the state values, output all the action values,
    and, then, according to the principle of Q learning, directly select the action
    with the largest value as the next action to be done. We can imagine that the
    neural network receives external information, which is equivalent to collecting
    information from the eyes, nose and ears, then outputs the value of each action
    through brain processing, and, finally, chooses the action through reinforcement
    learning. Neural network is trained to predict the exact value. How is the neural
    network trained in reinforcement learning? First of all, we need the correct Q
    value of actions, which is replaced by the Q reality in Q learning. Similarly,
    we need a Q evaluation to update the neural network. Thus, the parameters of the
    neural network are the old parameters plus learning rate alpha multiplied by the
    difference between Q reality and Q evaluation. In summary, we predict the values
    through NN, which is the Q evaluation. Then, we choose the action with the maximum
    value in Q evaluation to get reward in the environment. Q reality also contains
    two Q evaluations from the neural network analysis, but this Q evaluation is for
    the next steps. The pseudo-code of deep Q-learning with experience replay is shown
    as Algorithm IV. Algorithm 4: Deep Q-Learning With Experience Replay. Initialize
    replay memory D to capacity N Initialize action-value function Q with random weights
    θ Initialize target action-value function Q ^ with weight θ − =θ for episode=[1,M]
    do    Initialize sequence s 1 = x 1 and pre-processed sequence ϕ 1 =ϕ( s 1 )    for
    t=[1,T] do       With probability ϵ select a random action a t ;       Otherwise
    select a t =arg max a Q(ϕ( s t ),a;θ) ;       Execute action a t in emulator and
    observe reward r t and image x(t+1) ;       Set s(t+1)= s t , a t , r t and preprocessed
    ϕ(t+1)=9ptϕ(s(t+1)) ;       Store transition ϕ t , a t , r t ,ϕ(t+1) in D ;       Sample
    random mini-batch of transitions ( ϕ j , a j , r j ,ϕ(j+1)) from D ;       y j
    ={ r j , r j +γ max a ′ Q ^ ( ϕ j+1 , a ′ ; θ − ), if terminates at step j+1 otherwise
    ;       Every C steps reset Q ^ =Q ;    end for end for In order to use Pytorch
    to realize DQN, the recommended way is to build two neural networks. We built
    two neural networks, which are shown in Fig. 3. Target_net is used to predict
    the q_target value. It will not update the parameters in time. Eval_net is used
    to predict q_eval. This neural network has the latest parameters of the neural
    network. Two neural networks are designed to fix the parameters of a neural network
    (target_net). Target_net is a historical version of eval_net. It has a set of
    parameters long before eval_net. These parameters are fixed for a period of time
    and, then, replaced by new parameters of eval_net. Eval_net is constantly being
    upgraded, so it is a trainable network. And target_net''s trainable = False. Fig.
    3. Structure of NN in deep Q-learning. Show All SECTION IV. Simulation Results
    In this section, we compared three online network selection methods ONUP, ONUP-Greedy,
    ONUP-Min, and ONUP-RL with weighted network selection method, which is an offline
    network selection method. In this section, blue line represents ONUP, red line
    represents ONUP-Greedy, black line represents ONUP-Min, green line represents
    ONUP-Weight, and pink line represents ONUP-RL. All of them are network selection
    methods, ONUP is an online updating method, which is updated by the collision
    rate of PU; ONUP-Greedy is an online updating method, which is updated by the
    number of idle channels in each PRNs; ONUP-Min is an online updating method, which
    is updated by min collision rate of PU in all PRNS; ONUP-RL is an updating method,
    which is updated by the reinforcement learning method; and ONUP-Weight is an offline
    updating method, which selects network by the PRN''s weight. The simulation parameters
    in this section are shown in Table I and we only consider small-scale fading in
    this article. TABLE I Simulation Parameters Fig. 4 to 6 show that the collision
    probability of PU in each PRN is controlled within a given collision upper limit.
    From these three figures, we can see the ONUP-Greedy, ONUP-Min, and ONUP-RL methods
    float within a certain upper limit. The weighted scheme ONUP-weighted limits the
    collision probability of PU, so the collision probability of PU increases with
    the increase of SU''s arrival rate. Because of this difference between ONUP-weighted
    and other three methods, in these three PRNs, all the collision rate of PU are
    around 0.1, which are calculated by the other three methods, but the result from
    ONUP-Weighted method can break the limitation with the increasement of SU''s arrival
    rate. Fig. 4. Collision rate of PU in PRN1. Show All Fig. 5. Collision rate of
    PU in PRN2. Show All Fig. 6. Collision rate of PU in PRN3. Show All Fig. 7 shows
    the block rate of SU. When the arrival rate of SU is low, there are many idle
    channels at first, so the blocking rate is also low as shown in Fig. 7. With the
    increase of SU''s arrival rate, the block rate of SU in CRN increases. In Fig.
    7, we can also see that the ONUP method has the highest block rate of SU, ONUP-Min
    and ONUP-Greedy are in the middle, and ONUP-Weighted and ONUP-RL have the lowest
    block rate of SU. That is because ONUP-Weighted method weighted PRNs by the number
    of channels and ONUP-RL can learn the number of channels by reinforcement learning,
    so these two methods can minimize the block rate of SU when SU access PRNs. When
    the collision probability of PU researches the upper limit, the access behavior
    of SU is controlled, thus the blocking rate increases sharply. Because the online
    scheme ONUP does not consider the situation above the upper limit, the blocking
    rate is the highest and the probability of SU handover failure is also high, so
    the drop rate is the highest shown as Fig. 8. In Fig. 8, we can see ONUP-RL method
    has the lowest drop rate of SU, because ONUP-RL is based on deep reinforcement
    learning, which can be learned from the past. The greedy online scheme ONUP-Greedy
    has the highest access probability because it chooses the largest number of idle
    channels to access when it is above the upper limit. When the PU interrupts SU
    transmission, the probability of handover success is high, so the drop-call rate
    is low. However, the minimum collision probability online scheme, ONUP-Min, has
    a slightly higher blocking rate because it chooses the PRN access with the minimum
    collision probability when it is higher than the upper limit, and the PRN does
    not necessarily have idle channels at this time. Fig. 7. Block rate of SU. Show
    All Fig. 8. Drop rate of SU. Show All Fig. 9 shows the throughput of CRN. With
    the increase of SU''s arrival rate, the throughput has been increased, but when
    the upper limit of PU collision rate is reached, the online scheme ONUP researches
    a certain degree and tends to be saturated, and the other methods have higher
    throughput than the online scheme because they consider the situation above the
    upper limit. Since there is no collision restriction, the throughput of the weighted
    scheme increases continuously with the increase of SU rate. The throughput of
    ONUP-RL method are almost the same as the offline method ONUP-Weight. Fig. 10
    shows the learning curve of deep Q-learning in solving network selection problem.
    It can be seen that the curve does not decline smoothly, because the input data
    in DQN changes step by step. Different data will be obtained according to the
    learning situation. Therefore, unlike the general supervised learning, the cost
    curve of DQN is different. Fig. 9. Throughput of CRN. Show All Fig. 10. Learning
    rate of network selection method. Show All SECTION V. Conclusion In this article,
    the problem of online network selection with multiple primary networks was analyzed.
    The performance indicators such as PU collision probability, SU blocking rate,
    SU dropout rate, and CRN throughput were calculated. Based on the search and learning
    ability of DQN, a reinforcement learning based online network selection method
    of cognitive radio with multiple primary networks was proposed. Besides only considering
    the collision probability of PU, the greedy online network selection scheme and
    the online network selection scheme based on the minimum collision probability
    were also compared. The simulation results showed that the CRN throughput of deep
    Q-learning based method was higher than the other methods, and this proposed deep
    reinforcement learning based online network selection method also had a better
    block rate and drop rate of SU, but the collision rate of PU was slight higher.
    About future work, first we will put network switch into consideration. In this
    article, dropped secondary user cannot switch to another subcarrier to keep transmitting.
    Second, we will used this kind of deep Q-learning based algorithm to deal with
    more complex communication situation, which is much similar to the future form
    of IoT. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This A

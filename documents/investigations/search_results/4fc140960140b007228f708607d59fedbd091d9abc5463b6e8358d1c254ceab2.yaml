    Due to scarcity of natural resources and degradation in land quality, it has become
    necessary for every country to take maximum advantage of available natural resources
    to enhance agricultural activities. Use of machine learning technology with available
    data, information and knowledge can help us to achieve these goals. Machine learning
    has emerged with big data to perform large computation. Application of machine
    learning in agriculture to predict crop yield, recommendation of fertilizers and
    pesticides can help to improve the quality and quantity of crop production which
    enhances country’s economic condition. This research discuss the importance of
    machine learning in agriculture with comparative analysis of popular supervised
    machine learning algorithms like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random
    Forest and Artificial Neural Network; that predicts suitable crop for a given
    land based on seasons and soil parameters which can help farmers to make the right
    decisions about crop selection. We have analyzed & evaluated impact of these algorithms
    on crop prediction using standard deviation and absolute error method in order
    to conclude that K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm out performs other approaches. Published

    \ \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \nAgriculture has been considered as the primary means\
    \ of reducing poverty and improving food \nsecurity of the world’s 80% of impoverished\
    \ people who live in rural areas as per the World Bank reports. \nMoreover, agriculture\
    \ contributes to around 25% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in some developing\
    \ \ncountries [1]. Globally, the agricultural industry has been adversely affected\
    \ by increased droughts, floods, \nerratic precipitation patterns, and heat waves\
    \ brought on by climate change. Additionally, the high population \ngrowth rate\
    \ and the existing climate-related impacts on agricultural lands, agricultural\
    \ areas are under more \npressure to provide enough food [2]. To satisfy the increasing\
    \ food demand, available agriculture land must be \nutilized effectively such\
    \ that sustainable and healthy crops are produced. However, traditional intensive\
    \ \nagricultural practices are causing land degradation and lead to relatively\
    \ lower yield [3]. Furthermore, the \nfarmers are unaware about climate changes\
    \ and market fluctuations in real-time ending up with inappropriate \nsupply of\
    \ required crops. Cost of per yield production is increasing due to inefficient\
    \ utilization of resources \n[4]. For example, the fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ are used extensively without the precise requirement.  \n        \n \n    \
    \   ISSN: 2502-4752 \nIndonesian J Elec Eng & Comp Sci, Vol. 29, No. 3, March\
    \ 2023: 1597-1605 \n1598 \nThe shortcomings are addressed by the application of\
    \ information and communication technologies \n(ICT) to agriculture, widely known\
    \ as smart agriculture [5]. Smart agriculture comprises extensive ICT \ninfrastructure\
    \ that generates enormous amounts of data that can be utilized to improve the\
    \ traditional agriculture \npractices [6]. Smart agriculture employing big data,\
    \ ICT and internet of things (IoT) has transformed the \ntraditional experience-based\
    \ agriculture and has gained much attention from researchers. Numerous studies\
    \ are \npresented in the literature that provide specific application of smart\
    \ agriculture including crop forecasting [7], \n[8], pest identification [9],\
    \ [10], precision farming [11], [12], irrigation monitoring [13], [14], smart\
    \ \ngreenhouses [15], [16], and supply-chain [17], [18]. But relatively few studies\
    \ cover all stakeholders of \nagriculture.  \nThis research is an attempt to present\
    \ an effective, complete and scalable framework for smart \nagriculture; Agri-PAD.\
    \ The layered framework focuses on three major components of big data agriculture\
    \ \napplications. The first layer is responsible for sensing real-time data from\
    \ sensors and is called the perception \nlayer. The second layer, called the data\
    \ procession layer, stores and processes the data. The third, and the final \n\
    layer comprises various applications which are available to all stakeholders to\
    \ maximize the agri-productivity. \nThe major contributions of this reseach are\
    \ summarized below: \n− We propose a comprehensive big data analytics framework;\
    \ Agri-PAD that facilitates agriculture activities \nby offering three broad categories\
    \ of applications that is precision, recommendation and enterprise. \n− We demonstrate\
    \ the implementation of Agri-PAD framework for crop prediction and crop \nrecommendation.\
    \ \n− We discuss major challenges that hinder adoption of smart agriculture widely.\
    \ \nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 discusses big data\
    \ role in agriculture,  \nsection 3 describes the related work, section 4 explains\
    \ the Agri-PAD framework, section 5 presents potential \nuse cases of Agri-PAD\
    \ framework. Section 6 discusses open challenges in the adoption of big data in\
    \ \nagriculture while section 7 concludes the paper. \n \n \n2. \nBIG DATA IN\
    \ AGRICULTURE \nBig data is termed as a technological paradigm for data. It refers\
    \ to massive, heterogeneous, structured, \nsemi-structured and unstructured datasets\
    \ that includes text, images, videos, and audios [19]. Big data is \nconsidered\
    \ as the data generated at high velocity, high volume, and with high variety that\
    \ require advanced \ntechnologies and algorithms for processing [20]. Big data\
    \ definitions have evolved rapidly; the following five \ndimensions have emerged\
    \ as common criteria to illustrate big data: \n− Volume: the enormous amounts\
    \ of digital data generated and collected every second from a billion of \ndevices\
    \ and applications.  \n− Velocity: the speed of data creation and generation.\
    \  \n− Variety: the diversity of the data types, sources and their format (e.g.,\
    \ videos, documents, comments, and \nlogs). \n− Veracity: The truthfulness, reliability\
    \ and accuracy of the data and their sources.  \n− Value: the usefulness of the\
    \ collected data i.e., the insights that can be extracted from the big data. \n\
    Big data is more inclined towards the capability to search, aggregate, visualize\
    \ and cross-reference \nlarge datasets in reasonable time to extract information\
    \ and insights which was previously not feasible, both \neconomically and technically\
    \ [21]. Big data applications are utilized in almost every field; engineering,\
    \ \nmathematics, computer science, business, management and accounting, biochemistry,\
    \ genetics, physics and \nastronomy to name a few [19].  \nBig data in agriculture\
    \ has immensely evolved the traditional agricultural practices [5]. Major sources\
    \ \nof big data in agriculture include: \n− On-field sensors which provides real\
    \ time insights about farm (biosensors and weather stations).  \n− Airborne sensors,\
    \ data captured from drones and satellites. \n− Data collected by governmental\
    \ agencies and third-party organizations such as yearly statistical reports, \n\
    rules and regulations. \n− Data from web available via online repositories, web\
    \ services, and social media feeds. \nIt is evident that the data produced by\
    \ above-mentioned sources are heterogeneous in nature with \nvaried level of volume,\
    \ velocity and variety. However, efficient storage, processing and analysis of\
    \ such diverse \ndata for extracting valuable information such as precision farming\
    \ is guaranteed by the big data proponents \n[22]. Big data technologies that\
    \ can be used for such applications include Hadoop distributed file system \n\
    (HDFS), HBase, Cassandra, Spark, Hive, tensorflow and many others [23]. \n \n\

    Climate change and growing population are turned out as serious threats to food\
    \ security and major \nchallenges for agriculture [24]. The total agricultural\
    \ land utilized for food production has experienced a decline \nand with time\
    \ the gap between demand and supply has become more significant [25]. To meet\
    \ this rising \ndemand, farmers need to produce approximately 70% more food by\
    \ 2050, according to the UN food and \nagriculture organization (FAO) [26]. Consequently,\
    \ the agriculture industry adopted technological trends and \ntransformed into\
    \ smart agriculture. Smart agriculture comprises of IoT, cloud computing, big\
    \ data, and artificial \nintelligence improves crop yield, reduces waste, and\
    \ optimizes supply chains [27].  \nVarious studies have been conducted for improving\
    \ productivity in agriculture using smart agriculture \nsolutions. Sarker et al.\
    \ [5] proposed a conceptual framework incorporating big data technologies to facilitate\
    \ \nfarmers at field level. Their proposed solution is a seven-stage model that\
    \ encompasses extracting data from \nthe sensors and explains how that big data\
    \ might assist in accomplishing sustainable agriculture. Liu et al. [28] \nproposed\
    \ an experimental framework to monitor different agricultural aspects such as\
    \ water, fertilization, \ntemperature using IoT and cloud computing. Their framework\
    \ is capable of acquiring, persisting and \nprocessing sensor data which would\
    \ help in satisfying farm needs as and when required. A smart agriculture \nmonitoring\
    \ system for the detection of soil temperature and moisture was presented in Mekala\
    \ and Viswanathan \n[29]. Analyzing the data with a stated accuracy of 94%, the\
    \ proposed cloud-based solution may enable efficient \nmonitoring of specific\
    \ crop comfort levels and might be an accurate and useful decision tool for farmers.\
    \ \nCicioğlu and Çalhan [30] introduced an IoT enabled corn production monitoring\
    \ system. The proposed solution \nmonitored the cornfield for soil and air attributes\
    \ via different sensors and provides crucial information through \ngraphical interfaces\
    \ about growth of corn, requirement of water and the actions to be taken for disease\
    \ risks. \nVincent et al. [31] targets the land suitability assessment and proposed\
    \ a recommendation model that classifies \nthe land suitability by employing machine\
    \ learning models on the big data produced by sensors. The system \nassists farmers\
    \ in classifying the land for cultivation in more suitable, suitable, moderately\
    \ suitable, and \nunsuitable classes. To increase crop production and to control\
    \ the agricultural cost, Rajeswari et al. [32] \npresented a smart agricultural\
    \ model that predicts the crop yield and choose the best crop sequence based on\
    \ \nprevious crop sequences on the same farmland and soil nutrient data. \nApart\
    \ from crop monitoring, researchers have employed advanced technologies to especially\
    \ improve \nthe irrigation processes. Tseng et al. [33] proposed a big data analysis\
    \ technique to assist farmers in crop \nselection. They used a three-dimensional\
    \ correlation analysis to analyze the irrigation cycle and determine the \nfarmer's\
    \ irrigation techniques. The soil moisture content was then computed to identify\
    \ irrigation and determine \nwhether the farmer had used pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ Nawandar and Satpute [34] proposed an intelligent system \nfor smart irrigation\
    \ intending to preserve water resources. Bu and Wang [35] presented a deep reinforcement\
    \ \nlearning based smart agriculture system which aims to reduce extraneous water\
    \ consumption. Further, \nKamienski et al. [36] proposed smart water management\
    \ architecture for an efficient water irrigation system. \nThese irrigation systems\
    \ track the water requirements of crops based on collected data and actuate water\
    \ flow \nin line with expected demands without any human involvement.  \nThe application\
    \ of smart agriculture is not limited to automating the traditional practices\
    \ and reducing \nhuman involvement, but also includes fully automated farms that\
    \ can be operated without any human \nintervention [37], [38]. These systems exploit\
    \ agriculture big data in a robust and effective way. However, \nadoption of these\
    \ unmanned farms is still in its infancy and a number of issues such as governmental\
    \ and data \nsecurity legislations are yet to be addressed.  \nDespite the challenges,\
    \ big data remains the driving force behind smart agriculture. The data collected\
    \ \nvia sensors and other IoT devices provides detailed insights to the farmer\
    \ leading to better decision making and \neffective utilization of resources.\
    \ The aforementioned solutions prove that big data technologies have the \npotential\
    \ to revolutionize the agriculture industry. However, each of these solutions\
    \ has limited scope and is \nfocused on a single aspect of agricultural activity.\
    \ To fully utilize the potential of smart agriculture, there is a \nneed for a\
    \ platform that integrates all agricultural activities and provides a holistic\
    \ view to all stakeholders. \nKeeping in view the limitations of existing solutions\
    \ we propose a framework-Agri-PAD that includes the \ncomplete lifecycle of agriculture\
    \ activities and enables all stakeholders in making informed decisions. The \n\
    following sections describe the details of Agri-PAD framework. \n \n \n4. \nAgri-PAD\
    \ THE PROPOSED FRAMEWORK \nThis section presents Agri-PAD, a smart agriculture\
    \ framework that encompasses major agriculture \nactivities. The integration of\
    \ various services in a single framework ensures that all stakeholders are facilitated\
    \ \nand that a broad view of the system is presented, which eventually helps in\
    \ better decision making. The Agri-\nPAD framework offers a systematic classification\
    \ of services and applications leveraging big data analytics. \nThe Agri-PAD framework\
    \ consists of three layers i) perception layer, ii) data processing layer and\
    \  \niii) application layer as depicted in Figure 1. The Agri-PAD framework is\

    \ \nreal-time data streams. It incorporates a wide variety of techniques and technologies\
    \ to aggregate, manipulate, \nanalyze, and visualize big data. The details about\
    \ each layer are described in the successive subsections.  \n \n \n \n \nFigure\

    \ layer \nThe perception layer is the first layer of Agri-PAD framework. This\
    \ layer is horizontally scalable and \nincludes all data sources as mentioned\
    \ in section 2. Big data sources in agriculture can be broadly categorized \n\
    into IoT devices (ground sensors, weather stations, and airborne sensors), social\
    \ media posts, and web-based \ndata i.e., the data stored in databases. The data\
    \ will be acquired from each source and make available to the \nnext layer for\
    \ further processing. \n \n4.2.  Data processing layer  \nThe data processing\
    \ layer is the fundamental layer that acts as a data processing engine. It handles\
    \ \neverything from data storage to knowledge extraction. It first transforms\
    \ the data into an analysis-ready format. \nThen, apply big data tools and technologies\
    \ to extract relevant insights. Data will be processed in  \nApache Hadoop [19],\
    \ [39] ecosystem as it offers scalable platform for storing, managing and processing\
    \ big \ndata. Table 1 summarizes the applications provided by Hadoop. Moreover,\
    \ it incorporates any programming \nlanguage that offers processing of artificial\
    \ intelligence algorithms. \n \n4.3.  Application layer \nApplication layer is\
    \ the topmost layer of Agri-PAD framework. This layer is the key layer that \n\
    interacts with the users and provides services to the farmers and other stakeholders.\

    \ monitoring their farms remotely. Soil, weather, and crop conditions can \nbe\
    \ observed without being present on the farm. The requirement of pesticides and\

    \ by using such applications. Understanding how management choices affect \nsustainability\
    \ and operational efficiency, improving smallholder farmers' productivity and\
    \ income, providing \nfair and attractive insurance and finance for farmers, facilitating\
    \ farmers' financing and easier payments, and \nconnecting smallholders directly\

    \ and marketing) Lahore, Punjab. We have \nused 7 major crops data which includes\
    \ wheat, cotton, rice, sugarcane, maize, ground nut and barley. The \ndataset\
    \ includes the production of the crops and area available for crop cultivation\
    \ in the respective province.  \nThe selected dataset was divided in training\
    \ and testing sets with 80:20 ratio. The training set was \nused to establish\
    \ model to predict production of crops while the test set was used to test the\
    \ quality of the \nmodel. Random forest algorithm was applied having 1097.2 RMSE.\
    \ Figure 3 illustrates the accuracy of the \nmodel which clearly indicates that\
    \ the model outperformed with nearly equal actual and predicted values for \n\
    each crop. Crop production forecasting is essential for policy makers to make\
    \ timely decisions and Agri-PAD \nframework has the tendency to incorporate historical\
    \ data from different resources and generate effective crop \nproduction estimates\
    \ that can be used as agricultural production warnings in food-insecure regions.\
    \ Thus, \nempowering decision makers to plan expeditiously. \n \n \n \n \nFigure\

    \ \nCrop harvesting recommendation prior to its cultivation is an effective tool\
    \ for farmers to increase \nproductivity with no capital loss. This is a type\
    \ of recommendation application in Agri-PAD framework. This \napplication will\
    \ help the farmers to make an informed decision by recommending the best suitable\
    \ crop \naccording to the climate condition before cultivation. To prove its applicability,\
    \ we have used crop \nrecommendation dataset available at Kaggle. The dataset\
    \ comprised of 7 independent and 1 dependent features \nwith no missing values.\
    \ The dataset was balanced for 22 crops with features including temperature, humidity,\
    \ \npH value, rainfall, nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium. \nNaïve Bayes algorithm\
    \ was used for training the model which attained the accuracy of 99%. The \nmodel\
    \ was able to recommend the crop against the climatic parameters. This model is\
    \ part of the data \nprocessing layer of Agri-PAD framework that process real-time\
    \ data via its perception layer, thus enabling \nfarmers to make appropriate decision\

    6. \nOPEN CHALLENGES IN ADOPTION OF BIG DATA TECHNOLOGIES IN AGRICULTURE \nBig\
    \ data analytics undoubtedly provides tremendous insights for making better decisions\
    \ in the \nagricultural domain but has not undergone its wide adoption in production\
    \ agriculture [40]. The open \nchallenges hindering its way can be broadly categorized\
    \ into technical and operational challenges. Technical \nchallenges deal with\
    \ the installation of technical devices, their management, and the technical expertise\
    \ \nrequired in disseminating the smooth transfer of data between participating\
    \ entities. Researchers [41], [42] \nasserted that the availability of limited\
    \ infrastructure and lack of technical human resources to collect, process \n\
    and analyze the huge amount of diverse data is the potential barrier in smart\
    \ agriculture adoption. The collected \ndata must be consistent, clean, complete\
    \ and in compliance with the protocols that allow to be pooled into a \ncentralized\
    \ server for processing. Hence, the consistency, accuracy, and veracity of big\
    \ data and its analytics \nare critical challenges [43]. Nonetheless, security\
    \ and privacy remain an inherent concern for all stakeholders \n[44]. Another\
    \ barrier that inhibits smart agriculture from wide adoption is the insufficient\
    \ internet connectivity. \nTransferring data from IoT devices to server needs\
    \ high speed internet connectivity, but the availability of \ninternet is still\
    \ critical in rural areas of most developing countries [45]. \nOperational challenges\
    \ involve the investment and management of the field and post-agricultural \n\
    activities. Transforming the traditional agriculture system into smart agriculture\
    \ requires huge amount of \ninvestment both in terms of financial cost and time.\
    \ Further, smart agriculture demands proper maintenance of \nthe infrastructure\
    \ and includes certainly high costs for the smooth running of its operations and\
    \ up-gradation. \nAdditionally, proper training of farmers is also required to\
    \ get the maximum benefit. Proper governance and \nstructure of agricultural big\
    \ data are still missing and require policy frameworks.  \nApart from technical\
    \ and operational challenges, acceptance of smart agriculture is also hindered\
    \ by \nthe lack of trust among its stakeholders. The primary stakeholder, farmer,\
    \ mostly belongs to the older age group \nare less likely to utilize smart agriculture\
    \ infrastructure as they are more habitual of traditional agriculture \nactivities.\
    \ Furthermore, the direct link of farmer to the consumer will end the middleman\
    \ inclusion and \ndominance which would create chaos between them that may result\
    \ in strong opposition in the adoption of \nsmart agriculture.  \n \n \n7. \n\
    CONCLUSION \nAgriculture and climate change are inextricably linked. The rapid\
    \ pace of climate change will have \nfar-reaching consequences on the agricultural\
    \ ecosystem. Therefore, to ensure food security, smart agriculture \nis the prospective\
    \ solution. Smart agriculture utilizes big data analytical techniques which have\
    \ been proved to \nbe outstandingly beneficial in providing valuable insights\
    \ leading to better decision-making. In this research, \nwe discussed the applications\
    \ of big data analytics in agriculture industry and proposed a framework; Agri-\n\
    PAD. The framework consists of three layers i.e., perception layer, data processing\
    \ layer, and application layer. \nAgri-PAD incorporates big data analytics by\
    \ providing three distinguished categories of applications namely \nprecision,\
    \ recommendation, and enterprise applications. Real-time data analytics applications\
    \ that facilitate \nfarmers in managing their farms and crops remotely fall under\
    \ the precision category. Recommendation \napplications, based on historical data\
    \ collected from various sources, provide insights that lead to informed \ndecision-making.\
    \ While enterprise applications assist farmers in reaching the market directly,\
    \ eliminating the \nmiddleman dependence and improving the efficiency of the agriculture\
    \ supply chain. Further, we present two \nuse cases of smart agriculture employing\
    \ machine learning. We also highlight the open challenges that are \nserving as\
    \ barriers to the adoption of smart agriculture widely. Realizing the importance\
    \ of security and privacy, \nwe intend to enhance this framework by including\
    \ a layer to handle data security in the future. In addition, the \nwork on an\
    \ integrated testbed to further validate the effectiveness of the Agri-PAD framework\
    \ can be \nundertaken. \n \n \nREFERENCES \n[1] \n“Agriculture overview.” https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/agriculture/overview#1\

    \ countries with water scarcity.\nThis also aﬀects\nagriculture, as a large amount\
    \ of water is dedicated to that use. The possible consequences of global\nwarming\
    \ lead to the consideration of creating water adaptation measures to ensure the\
    \ availability\nof water for food production and consumption. Thus, studies aimed\
    \ at saving water usage in the\nirrigation process have increased over the years.\
    \ Typical commercial sensors for agriculture irrigation\nsystems are very expensive,\
    \ making it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of\nsystem.\
    \ However, manufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can be connected\
    \ to\nnodes to implement aﬀordable systems for irrigation management and agriculture\
    \ monitoring. Due to\nthe recent advances in IoT and WSN technologies that can\
    \ be applied in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at\
    \ summarizing the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems.\
    \ We determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation systems regarding\n\
    water quantity and quality, soil characteristics and weather conditions. We provide\
    \ an overview of\nthe most utilized nodes and wireless technologies. Lastly, we\
    \ will discuss the challenges and the best\npractices for the implementation of\
    \ sensor-based irrigation systems.\nKeywords: irrigation; IoT; precision agriculture;\
    \ sensors\n1. Introduction\nThe lack of fresh water is a rising concern, particularly\
    \ in the Mediterranean countries or southern\nAsian countries such as India. Among\
    \ the countries in Europe, the Mediterranean countries are the\nmost vulnerable\
    \ to drought [1]. A connection has been established between climate policies and\
    \ water\nmanagement. Water management can be aﬀected by diﬀerent variables such\
    \ as the water demand\nfrom the diﬀerent sectors or the consequences of some degrees\
    \ of warming on hydrological resources.\nClimate change and its eﬀects are a recurrent\
    \ topic in research papers regarding water resources and\nagriculture. The possible\
    \ consequences of global warming have led to the consideration of creating\nwater\
    \ adaptation measures to ensure the availability of water for food production\
    \ and people and\nto maintain ecosystems [2]. Furthermore, the safety of the water\
    \ to be consumed by humans and\nto be returned to the environment must be ensured.\
    \ The possible risks of climate change are an\nincrease in water shortage, the\
    \ reduction of water quality, the increase in water and soil salinity,\nthe biodiversity\
    \ loss, the increase in irrigation requirements or the possible cost of emergency\
    \ and\nremediation actions. These reasons have led to an increase in the number\
    \ of studies focused on\nreducing water usage in irrigation processes. Some of\
    \ these studies suggest the implementation of\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042; doi:10.3390/s20041042\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n2 of 48\nsocial, economic\
    \ and climate change policies, as well as the implementation of technological\
    \ innovations\nto improve water management.\nThe agricultural sector is one of\
    \ the most important economic resources in these countries\nadding to the importance\
    \ of managing well the available water resources to ensure the continuing\nof\
    \ this economical sector. In India, 10% of the area of the country is covered\
    \ by rice plantations [3].\nFurthermore, 20% of the Indian population is below\
    \ poverty levels and 15% is food insecure. Therefore,\nlow food production aﬀects\
    \ both the population and the economy. In 2002, the monsoon season\nproduced the\
    \ least amount of precipitation in the last 130 years. That resulted in a loss\
    \ of rice production\ndue to the lack of fresh water. To determine the drought\
    \ caused by anomalies in surface water, the\nStandardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration\
    \ Index (SPEI) was utilized. These indexes and the\ninformation gathered from\
    \ sensors that monitor the environment, the soil and the water can be utilized\n\
    to determine the current state of the water and the possibility of covering all\
    \ the freshwater needs.\nCountries with higher funds are already implementing\
    \ systems for water management and water\nreuse aiming to optimize water usage\
    \ and reduce the environmental impact caused by utilizing great\namounts of water.\
    \ However, some countries may ﬁnd these solutions to be costly.\nCommercial sensors\
    \ for systems aimed for agriculture and its irrigation are very expensive,\nmaking\
    \ it impossible for smaller farmers to implement this type of system on their\
    \ farms. However,\nmanufacturers are currently oﬀering low-cost sensors that can\
    \ be connected to nodes to implement\nlow-cost systems for irrigation management\
    \ and agriculture monitoring. Furthermore, due to the\ninterest in low-cost sensors\
    \ for monitoring agriculture and water, new low-cost sensors are being\nproposed\
    \ in researches such as a leaf water stress monitoring sensor [4], a multi-level\
    \ soil moisture\nsensor comprised of copper rings placed along a PVC pipe [5],\
    \ a water salinity monitoring sensor\nmade with copper coils [6] or a water turbidity\
    \ sensor made with colored and infrared led emitters\nand receptors [7].\nDue\
    \ to the recent advances in sensors for the implementation of irrigation systems\
    \ for agriculture\nand the evolution of WSN and IoT technologies that can be applied\
    \ in the development of these\nsystems, we present a survey aimed at summarizing\
    \ the current state of the art regarding smart\nirrigation systems. In this survey,\
    \ we are going to provide an overview of the state of the research\nregarding\
    \ irrigation systems. We will determine the parameters that are monitored in irrigation\n\
    systems regarding water quantity and quality, soil characteristics, weather conditions,\
    \ and fertilizer\nusage. We will provide an overview of the most utilized nodes\
    \ and wireless technologies employed to\nimplement WSN and IoT based smart irrigation\
    \ systems. Lastly, we will discuss the challenges and the\nbest practices for\
    \ the implementation of sensor-based irrigation systems.\nOther authors have performed\
    \ studies with a focus on irrigation systems, water management\nor precision agriculture\
    \ systems. However, the other available surveys on smart irrigation systems\n\
    analyzed quite a few papers [8–12] and therefore do not provide an in-depth analysis\
    \ of the state\nof the art regarding irrigation systems. Others are focused on\
    \ speciﬁc aspects regarding irrigation\nsuch as software for irrigation systems\
    \ [13], pivot-center speciﬁc irrigation systems [14] or irrigation\nsystems for\
    \ greenhouses [15]. Lastly, there are surveys that focus on precision agriculture\
    \ [16–21], crop\nmonitoring [22] and the agro-industrial and environmental ﬁelds\
    \ of agriculture [23] that comment on\nirrigation agriculture. In this survey,\
    \ we provide an overview of the current advances in irrigation\nsystems and the\
    \ utilized sensors and actuators. Furthermore, we provide discuss the most utilized\n\
    nodes and the wireless technologies employed for the communication and transmission\
    \ of the data\ngathered by the sensors. This way, with this work we address the\
    \ current gap in literature with a\nsurvey that provides an overview of IoT-based\
    \ smart irrigation systems.\nThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section\
    \ 2 presents the methodology employed to\nperform the survey. Section 3 presents\
    \ the water management techniques utilized in current studies, the\nparameters\
    \ that are utilized to determine the irrigation schedule and the related actuators.\
    \ The sensors\nand parameters considered for the soil monitoring aspects of the\
    \ evaluated smart irrigation systems\nare depicted in Section 4. The most monitored\
    \ weather parameters and the sensors that monitor\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n3 of\
    \ 48\nthem are presented in Section 5. Section 6 comments on the most utilized\
    \ nodes for IoT and WSN\nirrigation systems and the most popular wireless communication\
    \ technologies and cloud platforms.\nThe discussion of the current trends regarding\
    \ IoT crop irrigation systems is presented in Section 7.\nLastly, the conclusion\
    \ and future work are presented in Section 8.\n2. Materials and Methods\nIn this\
    \ section, the process followed to elaborate this paper is presented. To perform\
    \ this study,\nthe following research questions were considered: What are the\
    \ current IoT solutions for smart\nirrigation for agriculture? What sensors, actuators,\
    \ nodes, and wireless technologies are being utilized\nto develop IoT irrigation\
    \ systems? Search engines and digital libraries were utilized by the authors to\n\
    search manually for papers suitable for this survey. A total of 283 papers were\
    \ obtained from Google\nScholar [24], IEEE explore [25], Scopus [26] and the digital\
    \ library of Sensors [27]. The keywords\nemployed to obtain the total number of\
    \ papers to be analyzed were IoT irrigation, IoT irrigation system,\nand smart\
    \ irrigation. Furthermore, all papers were checked to ensure they included the\
    \ keywords\nirrigation or water and IoT or smart in their content.\nIn order to\
    \ discern which papers to use, only papers written in English were considered.\n\
    Furthermore, to observe the recent evolution in this ﬁeld, the selected papers\
    \ were published from\nthe years 2014 to 2019 (both years inclusive). Finally,\
    \ a total of 178 papers were utilized to compile\nthis review.\nAfter the selection\
    \ process, all papers were classiﬁed manually into IoT irrigation systems and\n\
    architecture, protocol and sensor proposals that were not used to create the ﬁgures\
    \ in this paper but\ndiscussed relevant information. The papers from the ﬁrst\
    \ group (160) were then analyzed to determine\nthe sensors and actuators that\
    \ were employed to develop the IoT irrigation system, the parameters\nthat were\
    \ monitored, the type of irrigation and agriculture, the type of node, the type\
    \ of wireless\ntechnology and data visualization technique that was utilized to\
    \ access the data and to manually\nchoose the actions of the irrigation system.\
    \ All the collected data has been then classiﬁed into diﬀerent\nsections and converted\
    \ into graphs and tables to provide a complete overview of the actual state of\
    \ the\nart regarding IoT irrigation systems.\nThe distribution of the papers regarding\
    \ the country of the ﬁrst author is presented in Figure 1.\nAs it can be seen,\
    \ the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries where\
    \ agriculture\nis a major economic source. India is the country with the highest\
    \ number of papers with a total of\n92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China and Spain\
    \ are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, Ecuador,\nIndonesia Thailand, and\
    \ the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the countries that\n\
    have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\nIt is remarkable\
    \ that only one out of the ﬁve countries with the highest agricultural land area\n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top ﬁve countries\
    \ of our survey\nin terms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers\nthat presents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area.\nWith regard to the top\
    \ six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three of\n\
    them (India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water scarcity\
    \ problems. Again,\nthere are some countries with regions aﬀected by water scarcity\
    \ that use irrigation systems in their\nagriculture and have published fewer papers\
    \ on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does\nnot mean that in these\
    \ countries no eﬀorts are done in order to reduce water use in agriculture. It\
    \ is\npossible that in these countries the major eﬀorts are done by enterprises\
    \ and their ﬁndings are directly\npatented and distributed in the marked. Most\
    \ of the papers are published by authors who come from\ndeveloping countries.\n\
    As per the number of papers per year of publication, see Figure 2, the interest\
    \ in this topic has\nbeen increasing over the years. The lower amount of papers\
    \ for 2019 is due to the year not being\nﬁnished when the selection process of\
    \ the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers performed\nin 2019 had been\
    \ published.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n4 of 48\n \nThe distribution of the papers\
    \ regarding the country of the first author is presented in Figure 1. \nAs it\
    \ can be seen, the countries that investigate IoT systems for irrigation are countries\
    \ where \nagriculture is a major economic source. India is the country with the\
    \ highest number of papers with \na total of 92 papers, 57.5% of the total. China\
    \ and Spain are tied with seven papers each. Costa Rica, \nEcuador, Indonesia\
    \ Thailand, and the USA have between three and six papers. The rest of the \n\
    countries that have investigated IoT systems for irrigation have one or two papers.\
    \  \n \nFigure 1. Number of published papers presenting IoT systems for irrigation\
    \ per country. \nFigure 1. Number of published papers presenting IoT systems for\
    \ irrigation per country.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n4 of 48 \nIt is remarkable that\
    \ only one out of the five countries with the highest agricultural land area \n\
    (China, USA, Australia, Brazil, and Kazakhstan) is included in the top five countries\
    \ of our survey in \nterms of water management. India, which is the country with\
    \ the highest production of papers that \npresents IoT systems for water management\
    \ is the 7th country in terms of agricultural land area. With \nregard to the\
    \ top six countries, in terms of published papers with irrigation systems, three\
    \ of them \n(India, China, and Spain) have regions with high and moderate water\
    \ scarcity problems. Again, there \nare some countries with regions affected by\
    \ water scarcity that use irrigation systems in their \nagriculture and have published\
    \ fewer papers on irrigation systems like the USA. Nonetheless, it does \nnot\
    \ mean that in these countries no efforts are done in order to reduce water use\
    \ in agriculture. It is \npossible that in these countries the major efforts are\
    \ done by enterprises and their findings are directly \npatented and distributed\
    \ in the marked. Most of the papers are published by authors who come from \n\
    developing countries.  \nAs per the number of papers per year of publication,\
    \ see Figure 2, the interest in this topic has \nbeen increasing over the years.\
    \ The lower amount of papers for 2019 is due to the year not being \nfinished\
    \ when the selection process of the papers was completed. Thus, not all the papers\
    \ performed \nin 2019 had been published. \n \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year. \n3. Water Management \nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present different\
    \ \ntechniques for water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers \nthat include any sort of water pumping actuator as\
    \ an irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated \npapers, 107 of them present\
    \ an actuator for irrigation. After analyzing the 107 papers we discard the \n\
    ones that just offer partial information, a total of 89 papers are included in\
    \ this section.  \nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known\
    \ as irrigated agriculture, there are \ndifferent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The different options present different efficiency and, in \nsome cases, a specific\
    \ manner should be used for a specific crop. The specific manners to irrigate\
    \ have \na great variety but we can divide them into the following categories:\
    \ Attending to the way of water \nis distributed we can consider: (i) flood irrigation,\
    \ (ii) spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation, and (iv) \nnebulizer irrigation.\
    \ Regarding the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation without\
    \ \nany consideration, when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated,\
    \ (ii) scheduled irrigation, \nwhen the water is supplied according to the estimated\
    \ needs in a period of year, (iii) Ad hoc irrigation, \nwhen the amount of water\
    \ is calculated based on the sensors measurements. The vast majority of the \n\
    papers included in this section propose to use pumps and valves to distribute\
    \ the water in \nconjunction with sensors to measure environmental parameters\
    \ in order to calculate the water needs. \nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this\
    \ section, 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation \nsystem, the\
    \ other six only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure\
    \ 3. Those 83 \ninclude different levels of detail, there are 49 papers that only\
    \ indicate that there are motor/pumps in \nFigure 2. Number of published papers\
    \ presenting IoT systems for irrigation per year.\n3. Water Management\nIn this\
    \ section, we present the information and analysis of papers that present diﬀerent\
    \ techniques\nfor water management in the irrigation process. For this analysis,\
    \ we consider the papers that include\nany sort of water pumping actuator as an\
    \ irrigation system. From a total of 178 evaluated papers,\n107 of them present\

    \ section.\nIn the agriculture activities that use water inputs, also known as\
    \ irrigated agriculture, there\nare diﬀerent manners to distribute the water.\
    \ The diﬀerent options present diﬀerent eﬃciency and,\nin some cases, a speciﬁc\
    \ manner should be used for a speciﬁc crop. The speciﬁc manners to irrigate\n\
    have a great variety but we can divide them into the following categories: Attending\
    \ to the way\nof water is distributed we can consider: (i) ﬂood irrigation, (ii)\
    \ spray irrigation, (iii) drip irrigation,\nand (iv) nebulizer irrigation. Regarding\
    \ the existence of sensing systems we can have: (i) irrigation\nwithout any consideration,\
    \ when the amount of water is not calculated or estimated, (ii) scheduled\nirrigation,\
    \ when the water is supplied according to the estimated needs in a period of year,\
    \ (iii) Ad\nhoc irrigation, when the amount of water is calculated based on the\
    \ sensors measurements. The vast\nmajority of the papers included in this section\
    \ propose to use pumps and valves to distribute the water\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\

    \ to calculate the water needs.\nFrom the 89 evaluated papers in this section,\
    \ 83 include clear information of the proposed irrigation\nsystem, the other six\
    \ only mention that they include actuators for irrigation, see Figure 3. Those\

    \ that there are motor/pumps in\ntheir system (40 paper) or valves (nine papers)\
    \ without more detail. From those papers which oﬀer more\ndetails, 19 of them\
    \ include sprinklers (the most used system) [28–46], eight use drip irrigation\
    \ [4,47–54],\ntwo propose the utilization of sprayers [4,55], and the rest use\
    \ a very speciﬁc irrigation systems\n(robots [56], pivot [14], rain gun [57] or\
    \ it can be applied to multiple systems [58]). In conjunction with\nthe principal\
    \ irrigation system, three papers propose the use of a fogging system [41,43,51]\
    \ and two\npapers propose the use of fertigation in their systems [42,52].\nSensors\

    \ environments (air, water, soil or plant) have been\nmonitored in most papers.\
    \ This information is presented in Figure 5. A paper that monitored the soil\n\
    can measure one or more parameters, but this information is not included in Figure\

    \ (see Figure 6).\nFrom the 89 included papers, more than half of the proposals\
    \ measure between three and four\nparameters. Measuring fewer parameters (one\

    \ On the other hand, there are ﬁve\npapers (6% of cases) that do not measure any\
    \ parameter [33,41,77–79].\nNext, the details about the measured parameters are\
    \ shown. Regarding the sensors of soil, plants,\nand water (see Figure 7), the\
    \ most used sensor in the systems is the soil moisture sensor, it is used in 76\n\
    papers (more details in Section 4). First, we will analyze the data from soil\
    \ and plant sensors. The soil\ntemperature is much less considered in these systems,\
    \ it is only measured in seven proposals. Attending\nto the soil characteristics,\
    \ in one proposal the authors use a sensor that monitored the nutrients of the\n\
    soil [80]. There are 14 proposals of IoT for irrigation management that include\
    \ a pH sensor. However,\nnot all of them specify if the pH sensors are for the\
    \ soil or for the water [31,42,49,54,68,70,74,75,81,82],\nonly four of them indicate\
    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one for water [69]). Only four papers\n\
    consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter is the plant height\
    \ [64,83], using an\nultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf wetness\
    \ was considered in their system [46,84,85].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n7 of 48\n\
    Diﬀerent sensors are used, [84] used a sensor based on optical signals while [46]\

    \ this (three for soil [66,67,72] and one \nfor water [69]). Only four papers\
    \ consider plant monitoring, in two papers the measured parameter \nis the plant\
    \ height [64,83], using an ultrasound sensor. In the other two cases, the leaf\
    \ wetness was \nconsidered in their system [46,84,85]. Different sensors are used,\
    \ [84] used a sensor based on optical \nsignals while [46] utilized a commercial\
    \ FC-37 sensor (Lydia Vogler, Peißenberg, Germany).  \nNow, the data from the\
    \ water sensor are presented. In this case, we will consider for the \ncommentaries\
    \ not only the data of the graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also\
    \ the \ninformation of the paper which measures the water quality, having or not\
    \ the actuators for the \nirrigation system. The water level in the tanks is measured\
    \ in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92] out \nof 88 papers that have a pumping\
    \ system. There are different methods to monitor the water level in \nthe tanks\
    \ and the most used is the one based on ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology\
    \ is \nused in one case [36], the rest of cases do not offer information of how\
    \ the data is measured. In the \ncase of sensors based on ultrasound methods,\
    \ the most utilized sensor is the HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi \nguoyun dianzishangwu\
    \ youxiangongsi , Shenzhen, China, used in [69]). In addition, there are six \n\
    papers that do not include an actuator for the irrigation system even when they\
    \ have water level \nsensors [60,93–97]. There are nine papers where sensors for\
    \ monitoring water flow are utilized \n[14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82]. The sensors\
    \ used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems \nFT110 G3/8 sensor\
    \ (Gems Sensors and Controls, Mumbai, India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 \n\
    (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi jishu youxian gongsi , Wuhan, China) in the proposal\
    \ presented in \n[76]. Both sensors are based on a Hall effect turbine. They have\
    \ different prices and similar \noperational ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8 can measure\
    \ flows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other \nsensor, the YF-S402, is capable of\
    \ measuring flows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover, water flow \nsensors are used\
    \ in three other proposals that do not include actuators for irrigation systems\
    \ [5,98,99]. \nRegarding water quality, the water conductivity is monitored in\
    \ four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in \none case [75], the authors indicate\
    \ the used sensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH \nand conductivity\
    \ from B&C Electronics (Carnate , Italy). \n  \nFigure 7. Monitored parameters\

    \ \nAdditionally, there are two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems\
    \ that include in \ntheir proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless,\

    \ In this case, we will consider for the\ncommentaries not only the data of the\
    \ graphic (proposals with irrigation system) but also the\ninformation of the\
    \ paper which measures the water quality, having or not the actuators for the\
    \ irrigation\nsystem. The water level in the tanks is measured in 17 [32,36,51,57,58,61,62,64,69,85–92]\
    \ out of 88 papers\nthat have a pumping system. There are diﬀerent methods to\
    \ monitor the water level in the tanks\nand the most used is the one based on\
    \ ultrasound [32,69,89], the resistive methodology is used in\none case [36],\
    \ the rest of cases do not oﬀer information of how the data is measured. In the\
    \ case of\nsensors based on ultrasound methods, the most utilized sensor is the\
    \ HC-SR04 (Shenzhenshi guoyun\ndianzishangwu youxiangongsi, Shenzhen, China, used\
    \ in [69]). In addition, there are six papers that\ndo not include an actuator\
    \ for the irrigation system even when they have water level sensors [60,93–97].\n\
    There are nine papers where sensors for monitoring water ﬂow are utilized [14,31,42,45,50,64,75,76,82].\n\
    The sensors used are only described in two cases, the commercial Gems FT110 G3/8\
    \ sensor (Gems\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n8 of 48\nSensors and Controls, Mumbai,\
    \ India) is used in [75] and the YF-S402 (Wuhan yingying yingying xinxi\njishu\
    \ youxian gongsi, Wuhan, China) in the proposal presented in [76]. Both sensors\
    \ are based on a\nHall eﬀect turbine. They have diﬀerent prices and similar operational\
    \ ranges. The Gems FT110 G3/8\ncan measure ﬂows between 0.5 to 5 L/min. The other\
    \ sensor, the YF-S402, is capable of measuring\nﬂows between 0.3 to 6 L/min. Moreover,\
    \ water ﬂow sensors are used in three other proposals that do\nnot include actuators\
    \ for irrigation systems [5,98,99]. Regarding water quality, the water conductivity\n\
    is monitored in four proposals [51,68,69,75]. Only in one case [75], the authors\
    \ indicate the used\nsensor. They use commercial sensors for monitoring pH and\
    \ conductivity from B&C Electronics\n(Carnate, Italy).\nAdditionally, there are\
    \ two papers without an actuator for irrigation systems that include in their\n\
    proposals a sensor for conductivity [98,100]. Nevertheless, no data regarding\
    \ the equipment used are\ngiven. Regarding the pH of water, it is monitored in\
    \ another three papers (apart from [69]) [99,101,102].\nIn one case [99], the\
    \ authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron, Taipei, Taiwan).\n\
    The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals [51,69]. Only in one\
    \ case [69] did the\nauthors specify that the used sensor is the DS18B20 (Adafruit\
    \ Industries, New York, NY, USA). No other\nproposals evaluated in this survey\
    \ (having or not irrigation system) presented the use of temperature\nsensors\
    \ for the water.\nOn the other hand, with regard to the proposals that monitored\
    \ the atmospheric parameter,\nthe data is presented in Figure 8. Next, we are\
    \ presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\nsystems. No details\
    \ of which sensors are used in which papers are given in this section. This information\n\
    will be further discussed in Section 5. The air temperature is the most measured\
    \ parameter, it is\nmonitored in 58 papers. A total of 51 proposals include a\
    \ humidity sensor. Other parameters are less\nmeasured such as the rain, which\
    \ is measured in eight out of 89 papers that proposed an irrigation\nsystem, or\
    \ the wind, measured in only one paper. Meanwhile, there are 15 proposals that\
    \ consider the\nweather forecast. From those 15 proposals, 10 of them use the\
    \ data from the forecast in conjunction\nwith the data gathered by sensors and\
    \ ﬁve proposals use the weather forecast as the sole information\nfor weather\
    \ data/atmospheric parameters.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n8 of 48 \n[99,101,102].\
    \ In one case [99], the authors specify the used sensor, the Lutron Pe-03 (Lutron,\
    \ Taipei, \nTaiwan). The temperature of the water is measured in two proposals\
    \ [51,69]. Only in one case [69] \ndid the authors specify that the used sensor\
    \ is the DS18B20 (Adafruit Industries, New York, New \nYork, USA). No other proposals\
    \ evaluated in this survey (having or not irrigation system) presented \nthe use\
    \ of temperature sensors for the water.  \nOn the other hand, with regard to the\
    \ proposals that monitored the atmospheric parameter, the \ndata is presented\
    \ in Figure 8. Next, we are presenting the importance of these sensors for irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. No details of which sensors are used in which papers are given in\

    \ Since we are considering only\nthe papers that include an irrigation system,\
    \ the most used actuator in the diﬀerent irrigation systems.\nTherefore, we do\

    \ actuator is\nthe sound emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103].\
    \ It is generally used as an alarm for the\nfarmers or as a dissuasive measure\
    \ to prevent the entry of animals into the farming lands. In second\nposition,\
    \ we found the use of artiﬁcial light systems. They are used in six cases [36,38,50,71,72,75].\n\
    The use of artiﬁcial light is mainly related to the generation of artiﬁcial photo-\

    \ the atmospheric conditions (temperature, humidity or even the\nbalance between\
    \ CO2/O2). The proposals that include the use of fans are [39,65,68,72,75]. The\

    \ A total of 71 proposals (81% of cases) use only the irrigation system as an\
    \ actuator. \nThere are seven papers (8% of cases) that propose the use of two\

    \ and in one case the use of \nfive actuators is presented [67].  \nNext, we present\
    \ in Figure 10 the description of the selected actuators. Since we are considering\
    \ \nonly the papers that include an irrigation system, the most used actuator\
    \ in the different irrigation \nsystems. Therefore, we do not include the use\
    \ of irrigation actuators in Figure 10. The most utilized \nactuator is the sound\
    \ emitter, used in seven cases [32,49,58,59,61,66,103]. It is generally used as\

    Most of those proposals use similar sensors based on the conductivity between\
    \ two electrodes.\nDiﬀerent models of the aforementioned sensor have been used\
    \ in the proposals (see Figure 13). The most\nused sensor, based on conductivity,\
    \ is the YL69 (SparkFun Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA). It has been\nused in nine\
    \ proposals [44,56,71,87,95,115–118]. This sensor is characterized by a low price\
    \ and it is\ncreated speciﬁcally to operate with Arduino (and similar nodes).\
    \ The output voltage goes from 3.3\nto 5 V and the output values are related to\
    \ soil moisture (0 to 300 for dry soil, 300 to 700 humid soil).\nNevertheless,\
    \ it is not possible to have a measure that indicates exactly the value of moisture\
    \ without\nperforming new tests and calibration of the sensor. The same range\
    \ of measure is found in the other\nused sensor based on the same principle, the\
    \ FC-28 (Uruktech, Baghdad, Iraq, used in [34,72,76]) and\nthe SEN0114 (DFRobot,\
    \ Shanghai, China, used in [46]). The S-XNQ-04 sensor (XNQ Electric Company\n\
    Store, Beijing, China), used in [55] has a similar operation principle. However,\
    \ it is composed of three\nelectrodes. In this case, the sensor output voltage\
    \ goes from 0 to 2 V and the sensor is capable of\nmeasuring the soil moisture\
    \ giving as a response the relative saturation moisture content expressed\nin\
    \ percentage (%). This sensor has an accuracy of 3% and it can measure from 0\
    \ to 100% of relative\nsaturation. It can operate from −40 to 85 ◦C.\nSensors\
    \ 2020, 20, x \n12 of 48 \nsensors goes from −40 °C to 85 °C and its accuracy\
    \ is ±0.5 °C. The operation principle of this sensor is \nnot specified in the\
    \ datasheet.  \n \nFigure 13. Number of papers that used different models of soil\
    \ moisture sensors. \nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three papers include\
    \ in their proposals sensors for \nmonitoring this variable [5,80,102]; nonetheless,\
    \ not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only \npaper that clearly indicates\

    \ time, the VH400 (Vegetronix,\nInc., Riverton, UT, USA), is utilized in [37,40,89,96,119,120].\
    \ These sensors can be used from 40 ◦C to\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n12 of 48\n\
    85 ◦C, but the accuracy and operational range of the sensor probe are not indicated\
    \ in its datasheet.\nThe operational principle of this sensor is based on the\
    \ measurement of the dielectric constant of the\nsoil using transmission line\
    \ techniques to measure the moisture in any type of soil notwithstanding\nsoil\
    \ salinity. The output voltage of this sensor goes from 0 to 3 V. This output\
    \ voltage is related to\nthe volumetric water content in the soil. The sensor\
    \ does not oﬀer a linear relationship between the\noutput voltage and the volumetric\
    \ water content, but the sensor can measure from 0 to up to 60% of\nvolumetric\
    \ water content in the soil. This sensor has a relatively low price and can be\
    \ implemented in\nArduino systems (and similar).\nA sensor with completely different\
    \ operational principles, the 200SS (HYPERION TECHNOLOGIES\nB.V., Delft, The Netherlands),\
    \ is used in two proposals [14,121].\nIt is a solid-state electrical\nresistance\
    \ sensing device that is used to measure soil water tension.\nThe 200SS has a\
    \ pair of\nhighly corrosion-resistant electrodes, as a resistive device, the resistance\
    \ of the sensor changes with the\nsoil moisture. The electrodes are embedded within\
    \ a granular matrix. The output values of the sensor\ngo from 0 to 199 centibars.\
    \ The higher the value of centibars the lower the water availability for the\n\
    plants. The system presented in [54] uses an SM300 sensor. This device is able\
    \ to measure two soil\nparameters (moisture and temperature). The SM300 measures\
    \ the soil moisture and temperature based\non the generation and propagation of\
    \ the electromagnetic ﬁeld into the soil. The sensors measure\nthe soil moisture\
    \ as the volumetric water content, the operating range goes from 0 to 100% and\
    \ the\naccuracy is ±2.5%. This sensor is manufactured by Delta-T Devices Ltd.\
    \ (Cambridge, UK). This sensor\nis not speciﬁcally created to be integrated in\
    \ an Arduino measuring system, even though it can be\nadapted since the output\
    \ voltage goes from 0 to 1 V.\nFinally, the system detailed in [122] used the\
    \ HA2002 sensor, but no information is available\non the internet about this sensor\
    \ in terms of operational principle nor range of measuring. The sole\ninformation\
    \ that was found was that the sensor is an HA2001 sensor manufactured by Handan\
    \ Dingrui\nElectronics Co., Ltd. (Handan, China).\nRegarding the sensors used\
    \ for monitoring the soil temperature, which are mentioned in [37,40,\n45,54,63,67,94,122,123],\
    \ the diﬀerent sensors are detailed in this paragraph. There are ﬁve papers that\n\
    do not specify the sensors used [45,63,67,94,123]. The other four proposals indicate\
    \ in the paper the\nsensors selected. Although in one paper no information could\
    \ be found about the sensor utilized [122],\nthe authors indicate that their system\
    \ includes the HA2001 sensor.\nIn other cases, the information of the selected\
    \ sensors is detailed. The proposal presented in [54]\nused an LM35 sensor. This\
    \ device is able to measure temperature. The operating range is −40 to\n+125 ◦C\
    \ and the accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The sensors oﬀer an analogic signal and it is manufactured\
    \ by\nTexas Instruments (Dallas, TX, USA). The proposals presented in [37,40]\
    \ selected the THERM200\n(Vegetronix, Inc., Riverton, UT, USA) to measure the\
    \ temperature. The operational range of these\nsensors goes from −40 ◦C to 85\
    \ ◦C and its accuracy is ±0.5 ◦C. The operation principle of this sensor is\n\
    not speciﬁed in the datasheet.\nIn terms of sensors for soil nutrients, three\
    \ papers include in their proposals sensors for monitoring\nthis variable [5,80,102];\
    \ nonetheless, not all of them indicate the used sensor. The only paper that\n\
    clearly indicates the utilized sensor is the proposal presented in [80] includes\
    \ an 1185 SunRom\ncolor sensor (Sunrom Electronics, Ahmedabad, India). This sensor\
    \ is based on RGB color detection,\nin [80] authors relate the color of the soil\
    \ with the nutrients. The pH of the soil is measured in four\nproposals [66,67,72,110].\
    \ However, none of these proposals indicates the selected device or equipment\n\
    in the paper.\n5. Weather Monitoring\nAn overview of the weather parameters monitored\
    \ in IoT irrigation monitoring systems and the\nmost utilized sensors to monitor\
    \ these parameters is provided in this section. The weather conditions\nare a\
    \ key factor both in irrigation needs and in the performance of crops. Figure\
    \ 14 shows the most\nmonitored weather parameters in the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation proposals. Temperature\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n13 of 48\nand humidity\
    \ aﬀect the evapotranspiration of the water in the soil. Air temperature is deﬁned\
    \ as the\nthermic level of the atmosphere and is usually measured in Celsius,\
    \ Fahrenheit or Kelvin degrees.\nIt is the most monitored weather parameter with\
    \ one hundred papers monitoring it. Humidity is the\npresence of water vapor in\
    \ the air. The amount of water vapor in the air is expressed in percentage (%).\n\
    It is the second most monitored weather parameter with 86 papers. Furthermore,\
    \ luminosity is paired\nwith temperature as direct radiation from the Sun raises\
    \ the temperature and leads to more water loss in\nthe soil. It is deﬁned as the\
    \ intensity or brightness of the light. It is measured in Lux. It is the third\
    \ most\nmonitored parameter with 28 papers. The amount of precipitation determines\
    \ whether the irrigation\nis needed or not and the amount of water to be employed\
    \ in the case of irrigation being necessary.\nIt considers any form of hydrometeor\
    \ that falls from the atmosphere and reaches the earth’s surface.\nFurthermore,\
    \ it includes rain and snow. A total of 14 papers considered precipitation monitoring.\n\
    Although temperature, relative humidity, luminosity, and precipitations are the\
    \ most important factors\nregarding IoT irrigation systems for agriculture, many\
    \ systems propose the monitoring of other\nenvironmental parameters. Table 1 details\

    \ \nAs it can be seen, the four previously mentioned weather parameters are the\
    \ most recurrent \nenvironmental factors in the literature. However, there are\
    \ other weather factors concerning the air \nand climate that are monitored in\
    \ some IoT smart irrigation systems. Ultraviolet radiation is \nelectromagnetic\
    \ radiation with wavelengths ranging from 10 nm to 400 nm and is monitored by\
    \ seven \npapers [14,66,68,75,120,138,145]. Measuring wind speed [14,45,46,67,72],\
    \ wind direction [45,46,67] \nand atmospheric pressure [158] is also considered\
    \ by some papers. Air pollutants are considered in \nsome IoT irrigation systems\
    \ as well. CO2 [45,63,66,67,75,138,145], ozone [102], gas [95,143] and smoke \n\
    [124] are the types of air pollutant considered by the currently available smart\
    \ irrigation systems. \nLastly, other parameters that are monitored concerning\

    \ and it incorporates a pluviometer [46]. The PRD180 is comprised of a rain detecting\
    \ board\nwith two separate PCB tracks and a control module that provides a digital\
    \ and an analog output [48].\nThe operating voltage is from 3.3 V to 5 V. It is\
    \ manufactured by Elecmake (India). Like the PRD180, the\nYL83 (Vaisala, Vantaa,\
    \ Finland) is comprised of a series of conductive strands printed onto a Bakelite\n\
    plaque [76]. The water creates a short-circuit oﬀering a low resistance between\
    \ the lines connected to\nthe ground and the lines connected to the positive polarity.\n\
    The type of agriculture most concerned with air and wind as a parameter concerning\
    \ weather\nis greenhouse agriculture. For example, one of the aims of [68] is\
    \ the sanitation of the air of the\ngreenhouse from pathogens and chemical contaminants.\
    \ This is then closely related to the activation\nof the actuators necessary to\
    \ the regulation of the quality of the air. The contaminants that can aﬀect\n\
    the quality of the air are CO, CO2, O3, NOx, PM2.5, and PM10, among others [64].\
    \ In the context\nof agriculture, air contaminants are monitored with the use\
    \ of sensors that can be low-cost sensors\nsuch as the MQ135 (SHENZHEN INVENTOR\
    \ ELECTRONIC TECHNOLOGYCO., LTD., Shenzhen,\nChina), MQ131, MQ2 or MQ9 sensors\
    \ or commercial sensors that can be found in professional weather\nstations. The\
    \ MQ135 [64,143], used for benzene, alcohol, smoke, NH3, NOx and CO2 monitoring,\
    \ and\nthe MQ2 [64,95], used for gas monitoring (propane, hydrogen, and LPG),\
    \ are the most utilized low-cost\nsensors for air quality monitoring. The MQ131\
    \ is utilized for ozone, Cl2, NO2 monitoring [64] and\nthe MQ9 is utilized for\
    \ CO/combustible gas, methane, carbon monoxide and LPG monitoring [64].\nAnother\
    \ sensor that can be used to monitor CO2 is the CDM4161A (Toshniwal Sensing Device\
    \ Private\nLimited, Ajmer, India) [145].\nWind speed and direction may be of interest\
    \ to IoT irrigation systems such as for the proposal\nin [46], that utilized the\
    \ SEN-08942 sensor manufactured by Sparkfun. Barometric pressure can be of\ninterest\
    \ as well and can be measured by the BME280 sensor manufactured by Bosch [157].\n\
    Movement detection is often related to security measures or to the aim of scaring\
    \ animals to\navoid crop damage. The most utilized sensor for movement detection\
    \ is a passive infrared (PIR)\nsensor [42,95]. This sensor measures the infrared\
    \ light that radiates around the objects placed at the\nfront of the sensor. The\
    \ change in infrared radiation is converted into changes in voltage that trigger\n\
    the detection. It is often utilized for intrusion and pest detection. Ultrasonic\
    \ sensors are often utilized\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n18 of 48\nto detect movement,\
    \ such as the robot proposed in [65] that is able to perform some actions to scare\
    \ the\nanimals that may enter the ﬁelds. These sensors are comprised of a transmitter\
    \ and a receiver that\noperate at the 40 kHz frequency. Its range is from 10 cm\
    \ to 30 cm. Ultrasound at lower frequencies was\nutilized in [60] to repel the\
    \ animals. Insects may cause great damage to the crops, for that reason some\n\
    systems such as [45] include a pest warning functionality. The system in [133]\
    \ is able to even detect the\ntype of insect pests that are damaging the crops.\
    \ These features are often accompanied by a buzzer to\ngenerate an alarm when\
    \ intruders or animals are detected [61].\nDepending on the type of agriculture,\
    \ the values from the measures for each environmental\nparameter can be utilized\
    \ to determine the actions of diﬀerent types of actuators. It can be part of a\n\
    model like the one proposed in [72] where the on-agriculture stage gathers the\
    \ data on temperature,\nhumidity, light, moisture and wind speed in order to activate\
    \ or deactivate fans, artiﬁcial light, a cooler\nand water pumps. Many IoT irrigation\
    \ systems have both a manual and an automatic mode to control\nirrigation. In\
    \ [64], the amount of water released by the water pumps or the duration of the\
    \ irrigation\ncan be selected in the manual mode. For the automatic mode, a preset\
    \ value is utilized at the beginning.\nThen, the data is analyzed to determine\
    \ the personalized settings. The most utilized actuators to\nmodify the conditions\
    \ of the climate that aﬀects the crops or to protect the crops from animals and\n\
    intruders are presented in Figure 20.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n18 of 48 \n \nFigure\

    \ utilized to scare animals and to alert the user of anomalies in the system \n\
    or the intrusion of animals or people [32,49,58,59,61,66,91,95,103]. Fans [39,65,68,72,75,152,166]\
    \ and \nartificial lighting [39,51,71,72,75,82,154] are tied in first place with\
    \ seven papers each. The fans can be \nutilized to cool the temperatures and to\
    \ create a breeze or light wind to aid in the pollination process. \nArtificial\
    \ light is utilized to aid plants in performing photosynthesis. Different colors\
    \ may be good \nfor different aspects of the plant growth such as blue for the\
    \ leaves and a mix of red and blue for the \nflowers. Coolers are the third most\
    \ employed actuator for weather conditions controlling, utilized for \ncooling\
    \ the temperature and for aiding in the control of the relative humidity, with\
    \ four papers \n[28,39,68,72]. The least utilized actuators in IoT irrigation\

    \ two types depending on the purpose of\nthe IoT devices. On the one hand, we\
    \ can distinguish the devices that function as nodes that transmit\nsmall amounts\
    \ of data at short distances and have low energy consumption. On the other hand,\n\
    there are devices that can transmit large amounts of data over long distances\
    \ that have high energy\nconsumption. Therefore, range, data rate, and energy\
    \ consumption are some of the most important\naspects to consider when deciding\
    \ which technology to use.\nIf the utilized standard is considered, there are\
    \ a large number of wireless standards that are used\nin the communications of\
    \ IoT devices. A general classiﬁcation can be established between devices\nthat\
    \ communicate at short or long distances. Short distance communication standards\
    \ usually reach\ndistances of up to 100 m. Long-distance communication standards\
    \ reach distances of kilometers.\nAlso, another type of classiﬁcation can be established\
    \ based on the employed communication\ntechnology. In this way, three categories\
    \ can be established. The ﬁrst category is formed by those that\nconnect utilizing\
    \ Ethernet or cable and WAN technology. The second category is comprised of those\n\
    that connect via WiFi and WAN technology. Finally, the third category is formed\
    \ by those that connect\nusing both low power WiFi and WAN technology.\nIf the\
    \ spectrum band used is considered, we can classify them into technologies that\
    \ use the\nunlicensed spectrum or the licensed spectrum. Unlicensed spectrum bands\
    \ are known as Industrial,\nScientiﬁc, and Medical (ISM radio band bands, and\
    \ are deﬁned by article 1.15 of the International\nTelecommunication Union’s (ITU)\
    \ ITU Radio Regulations (RR) [184]. The ISM bands can vary according\nto the region\
    \ and its permits. Its main advantage is its ease of installation and the main\
    \ drawbacks are\nrelated to safety deﬁciencies and possible interferences. The\
    \ licensed spectrum bands are assigned\naccording to the diﬀerent proprietary\
    \ technologies. They oﬀer greater security, greater coverage, and\nfewer interferences.\
    \ However, the cost of using a licensed band is higher.\nThe most utilized communication\
    \ technologies among the reviewed papers are presented in\nTable 6. In many of\
    \ the proposals that we have studied, the authors combine several communication\n\
    technologies instead of using one single protocol. As an example, it is very common\
    \ for authors to\nstart using either a wired or a wireless technology to connect\
    \ the sensors with the nodes, and then, use\na wireless technology to send data\
    \ from nodes to remote or cloud storage centers.\nTable 6. Most utilized communication\

    \ 2020, 20, 1042\n30 of 48\n7. Discussion\nIn this section, current trends regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture are going to\nbe presented.\n7.1. Big\
    \ Data Management and Analytics for Irrigation Optimization\nIoT systems, in general,\
    \ generate a great amount of data due to monitoring diﬀerent parameters\nin real-time,\
    \ and IoT irrigation systems generate big data as well. Therefore, it is necessary\
    \ to provide\nmechanisms to manage and analyze big data. Ahad et al. [202] comment\
    \ on the need for sustainable\nmanagement of big data to avoid overusing natural\
    \ resources. Using blockchain, powering IoT devices\nwith solar energy, selecting\
    \ useful data and discarding unnecessary and redundant data, employing\nclustering\
    \ techniques to reduce the volume of the information, implementing time-eﬃcient\
    \ algorithms\nand the utilization of sustainable resources as alternatives to\
    \ the components that are employed\nnowadays are some of the suggestions they\
    \ provide.\nAlthough the data gathered from the sensors is already a big source\
    \ of information, the analysis\nof this data is paramount to optimize the IoT\
    \ irrigation system according to the crop and the weather\nconditions. For this\
    \ purpose, Tseng et al. [203] presented a big data analysis algorithm to aid farmers\n\
    in the crop selection process. Their proposal satisﬁed the ﬁve Vs (volume, velocity,\
    \ variety, veracity,\nand value) of big data. They performed a 3D correlation\
    \ analysis that evaluated the irrigation cycle to\nidentify the irrigation practices\
    \ performed by the farmer. Then, they calculated the soil moisture content\nto\
    \ detect irrigation and to evaluate if the farmer applied pesticides or fertilizers.\
    \ This information was\ncoupled with data on the weather conditions and other\
    \ aspects of the soil to provide the farmer with\nthe cultivation risks of each\
    \ type of crop. Nonetheless, there are other technologies that are currently\n\
    being utilized to analyze the big data produced by IoT irrigation systems for\
    \ agriculture.\nArtiﬁcial intelligence (AI) is currently the type of technology\
    \ most companies are interested in for\nvarious purposes. In the case of irrigation,\
    \ the use of AI is tied to the optimization of the available\nresources such as\
    \ water, fertilizers or energy or to obtain information from the crops such as\
    \ the\npresence of diseases or the correct growth of the plants, vegetables, and\
    \ fruits. One of the techniques\nemployed to analyze the data gathered from the\
    \ sensors so as to perform decisions on the irrigation\nsystems is fuzzy logic.\
    \ Fuzzy logic has been employed to improve irrigation scheduling in greenhouses\n\
    and control the drainage implementing it on the controller of the system [100].\
    \ The fuzzy rules were\nprovided according to the water availability utilizing\
    \ the QtFuzzyLite software ((FuzzyLite Limited,\nWellington, New Zealand). Another\
    \ fuzzy logic controller is employed to determine the coverage\nerror for the\
    \ resources so as to determine if the eﬀective watering of the plants can be guaranteed\
    \ [96].\nThe system presented in [136] utilized fuzzy logic to determine the duration\
    \ of the irrigation process\nonce the soil moisture values go below the 20% threshold.\
    \ Light and temperature lead to the least\naccuracy in irrigation (40%) whereas\
    \ any combination with the soil moisture values reached an accuracy\nfrom 62 to\
    \ 81%. The authors conclude that the subsoil moisture sensor is the most important\
    \ sensor to\ndetermine irrigation. The irrigation time was predicted in [162]\
    \ as well, using the adaptive neuro fuzzy\ninterference system (ANFIS) to predict\
    \ the irrigation time. This fuzzy logic technique was implemented\nemploying the\
    \ MATLAB software. However, outdoor temperature and light are important to avoid\
    \ the\nevaporation of the water. Another irrigation system utilizes iterative\
    \ learning control (ILC) arithmetic\nto make decisions regarding the opening of\
    \ the water valves [67].\nMachine learning is another technique that is utilized\
    \ in irrigation systems to perform predictions.\nThe prediction algorithm in [120]\
    \ for soil moisture prediction obtained an accuracy of 96%. Prediction\ntechniques\
    \ can also be utilized to estimate the amount of available water for irrigation\
    \ such as the case\nof [119], where the authors employ Fisher’s LDA method for\
    \ that purpose. Water usage is predicted as\nwell in [50] employing regression\
    \ algorithms. The regression algorithms consider the temperature of\nthe environment\
    \ and the water ﬂow to produce a water consumption forecast that is then visualized\n\
    by the user through a mobile app.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n31 of 48\nFeedforward\
    \ neural networks and the structural similarity index were employed in [204] to\n\
    develop an optimized smart irrigation system. The authors compared gradient descent\
    \ and variable\nlearning rate gradient descent optimization techniques to predict\
    \ soil moisture and they determined\nthat the latter was the best one. Furthermore,\
    \ a study on machine learning applied to agriculture so as\nto perform predictions\
    \ on irrigation was performed in [205]. Diﬀerent machine learning techniques\n\
    were applied to the data on the soil and the environment collected from jojoba\
    \ plantations. The authors\nconclude that the boosted tree classiﬁer was the best\
    \ classiﬁcation model was and the gradient boosted\nregression trees was the best\
    \ regression model. They had a 95% and 93% accuracy respectively.\nThe authors\
    \ suggest as well that diﬀerent feature-sets would be better for diﬀerent plots\
    \ as some\nconﬁgurations achieved better results for diﬀerent types of plots such\
    \ as organic ones. Furthermore, the\nmodels considerably reduced their accuracy\
    \ when deliberated soil drying was performed. Moreover,\nthe authors state that\
    \ the data on the weather and the saturation could be not considered without it\n\
    substantially aﬀecting the accuracy of the models.\n7.2. Low-Cost Autonomous Sensors\n\
    As we have seen in Section 2, the majority of the countries that dedicate more\
    \ eﬀort to researching\nIoT irrigation systems are countries where the farmers\
    \ cannot aﬀord commercial solutions. Therefore,\nmost of the solutions for irrigation\
    \ management are comprised of low-cost sensors and controllers so\nas to increase\
    \ the scope of the beneﬁts of utilizing smart irrigation systems. Apart from individual\n\
    sensors, some shields integrate several sensors and connectors for irrigation\
    \ and agriculture speciﬁc\nIoT systems such as the OpenGarden shield ((Libelium\
    \ Comunicaciones Distribuidas S.L., Zaragoza,\nSpain) [136]. It can be connected\
    \ to an Arduino UNO and it is comprised of an LDR, a DHT22 connector\n(SparkFun\
    \ Electronics, Niwot, CO, USA), a soil moisture connector, a hydroponics connector,\
    \ digital\nand analog pins, a DS18B20 connector (Adafruit Industries, New York,\
    \ NY, USA) and an antenna\nconnector. This type of solution allows the easy implementation\
    \ of low-cost smart irrigation systems.\n7.3. Sustainable Irrigation Systems\n\
    Most irrigation systems do not have access to the power grid, therefore there\
    \ is a need for\nalternative means of powering up the devices that conform the\
    \ system. Even irrigation systems with\naccess to the power grid may only receive\
    \ power during a constrained time period. In India, for\nexample, the system presented\
    \ in [29] determines when access to electricity is available to turn on\nthe irrigation\
    \ motors. This system was designed to help farmers when access to electricity\
    \ happens\nat irregular hours or even at night, when farmers may not be present\
    \ in the ﬁeld. To address the\nneed for alternative ways of powering the irrigation\
    \ systems in agricultural ﬁelds that are too far to\naccess the power grid, many\
    \ systems incorporate a solar energy functionality, making the system\nmore sustainable\
    \ [41]. Furthermore, the use of solar energy reduces the energetic costs which\
    \ is\nan advantage for irrigation systems intended for developing areas.\nConsidering\
    \ those reasons,\na total of 22 of the surveyed papers chose to utilize solar\
    \ energy to power their proposed irrigation\nsystem [4,38,41,46,50,56,63,66,69,88,90–92,96,99,101,140,145,171,178,181].\n\
    7.4. Frequency of the Data Acquisition\nThe frequency at which the parameters\
    \ are monitored may be diﬀerent for each proposal. Real-time\nmonitoring [31,71]\
    \ has been surging as the cost of the devices, whether they are processors, devices\n\
    for data storage or sensors, has experienced a considerable reduction. Some proposals\
    \ decide not to\nmonitor the parameters in real-time so as to reduce energy consumption.\
    \ Some authors have decided\nto take a measure every 10 s [58].\n7.5. New Forms\
    \ of Data Acquisition\nThe advances in technology as lead to new ways of obtaining\
    \ the data from the sensors deployed\nin the ﬁelds. One of the new ways of gathering\
    \ data from the sensor nodes is by utilizing drones [31].\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n\
    32 of 48\nDrones also allow obtaining new data that could not be obtained in other\
    \ ways such as aerial images\nof the ﬁelds.\nAnother new form of data acquisition\
    \ is the use of robots that can incorporate both sensors and\nactuators to perform\
    \ activities such as soil moisture sensing, weeding, spraying water or scaring\
    \ the\nanimals [65]. Robots can be utilized for the irrigation of precise areas\
    \ due to their ability to travel to\nthe desired location [38]. This robot is\
    \ able to measure soil moisture and include proximity sensors\nto avoid collisions.\
    \ The robot has a sprinkler system to irrigate the desired area. Furthermore,\
    \ the\nwireless robot in [66] is comprised of both environmental and soil monitoring\
    \ sensors and performs\ntasks such as water spraying, scaring animals and moving\
    \ through the ﬁeld. In order to improve the\nnavigation of the robots for irrigation,\
    \ the authors in [55] provided the robot with a coverage path\nplanning (CPP)\
    \ algorithm that has a map of the static elements and environmental data. The\
    \ robot\noperating system (ROS) was utilized to develop the control system of\
    \ the robot which is divided into\nthree layers. The ﬁrst layer reads the data\
    \ from the sensors and controls the actuators, the second\nlayer performs the\
    \ communication among the elements of the system and the third layer performs\
    \ the\ndecision making and the path planning. This robot performs irrigation as\
    \ a linear shower. Furthermore,\nthese robots can be powered by solar panels [38,66]\
    \ to provide them with more autonomy.\n7.6. Security in IoT Systems for Irrigation\n\
    Depending on the characteristics of the environment where the implementation of\
    \ the IoT system\nis carried out, securing the system may become a challenging\
    \ task as diﬀerent types of threats must be\nconsidered. On the one hand, all\
    \ the security issues of any IoT system can be applied to an IoT irrigation\n\
    system for agriculture. Therefore, current works with their focus on securing\
    \ IoT describes the security\nchallenges that IoT irrigation systems may face.\
    \ For example, organizations such as the Internet\nEngineering Task Force (IETF)\
    \ study the diﬀerent problems that aﬀect this. Furthermore, authors\nsuch as Garcia-Morchon\
    \ et al. [206] present in their work the following list of security threats and\n\
    managing risks: vulnerable software/code, privacy threats, cloning of things,\
    \ malicious substitution\nof things, eavesdropping attacks, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack, ﬁrmware attacks, extraction of private\ninformation, routing attack,\
    \ elevation of privilege, denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. Regarding DoS\nattacks,\
    \ Kamienski et al. [50] highly stressed the importance of protecting the irrigation\
    \ system from\nDoS attacks or avoiding attackers from accessing the collected\
    \ data or the system with the intention of\ndamaging the crops.\nIn order to face\
    \ the above threats, it is necessary to apply the appropriate security measures,\
    \ but\nas new threats and attacks appear daily, [206] propose using methodologies\
    \ such as analyzing the\nbusiness impact of the attack, assessing the threats\
    \ considering their impact and probability, its impact\non the privacy of the\
    \ collected information and the process of reporting and mitigating incidents.\n\
    However, on the other hand, when considering just the currently available studies\
    \ on securing\nIoT irrigation systems speciﬁcally, it is possible to discern which\
    \ aspects of IoT security are prioritized\nfor this type of system.\nJimenez et\
    \ al. [207] identiﬁed the security threats speciﬁc to an intelligent wastewater\
    \ puriﬁcation\nsystem for irrigation. Apart from the previously mentioned security\
    \ threats [206], the authors of [207]\ncontemplate physical attacks that the IoT\
    \ deployment may face. The IoT devices must be protected\nfrom the weather and\
    \ possible animals that access the ﬁelds. However, strong weather conditions\n\
    such as ﬂoods or animals such as wilds boars may result in the IoT device being\
    \ damaged or lost.\nFurthermore, the IoT devices may also be damaged by the operators\
    \ when they are performing their\nactivities or be the aim of a person with malicious\
    \ intentions. Another threat to the devices deployed\non the ﬁeld is the possibility\
    \ of them being replaced to malicious nodes, providing the attacker with\naccess\
    \ to the network [29]. The deployed devices may also be susceptible to malicious\
    \ code and false\ndata injection, leading to wrong results and the malfunction\
    \ of the system. Sleep deprivation attacks\nare aimed at depleting the battery\
    \ of the devices. The deployed nodes are susceptible to booting attacks\nas well.\
    \ Furthermore, attackers may also perform eavesdropping and interfere with the\
    \ deployed\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n33 of 48\ndevices. The concern of securing\
    \ the physical devices deployed on the ﬁelds has led to many systems\nincorporating\
    \ PIR sensors, scarecrows, and buzzers to detect intruders, either humans or animals,\
    \ and\nto alert of their presence [59,208].\nPrivacy is another aspect to consider.\
    \ The data managed by IoT irrigation systems may not need as\nmuch privacy as\
    \ the data managed by other IoT applications such as those for health. In fact,\
    \ Jimenez\net al. [207] remark that it may not be necessary for the gathered data\
    \ of some irrigation IoT systems to\nremain private, but the correct performance\
    \ of the system must be ensured, which is avoiding DoS\nattacks. However, the\
    \ owners of the ﬁelds may be implementing new techniques they would prefer to\n\
    remain private or the water quality management system could be regarded as a critical\
    \ infrastructure\nas the produce that results from the ﬁelds irrigated with that\
    \ water would be consumed by people.\nTherefore, considering this aspect, Ahad\
    \ et al. [202] and Barreto et al. [209] remark the need for user\nprivacy, as\
    \ the obtention of this information may lead to attacks to the owner or the personnel\
    \ of the\nfarm. Ahad et al. [202] consider data and device privacy as well, because\
    \ of the need for guaranteeing\nthe ownership of the data to avoid repudiation\
    \ and ensuring data availability. Barreto et al. [209]\nremark on the burden that\
    \ could be originated from the exposure of the GPS locational data captured\n\
    by IoT devices as attackers may gain information on the location of the farm to\
    \ perform physical attacks.\nLastly, Ahad et al. [202] also comment on the need\
    \ for a secure storage system for the information,\nwith particular emphasis on\
    \ distributed data storage systems. Attacks such as SQL injections can lead\n\
    to the obtention of private information from storage systems [210].\nAs cloud\
    \ computing often goes hand in hand with IoT systems, threats to cloud services\
    \ may\ncompromise the IoT irrigation system as well. Flooding attacks and cloud\
    \ malware injection are some\nof the attacks that can be intentionally executed\
    \ to compromise the data and the performance of the\ncloud [210].\nRansomware\
    \ is another security threat that could aﬀect irrigation systems for agriculture\
    \ [209].\nAll the data regarding pesticides and the fertigation system could be\
    \ encrypted until a ransom is paid.\nFor this reason, having a back-up in a remote\
    \ location is greatly advised.\nBarreto et al. [209] also remark some security\
    \ threats that are not usually commented on when\ndiscussing the security of IoT\
    \ systems for agriculture. One of these threats is the damage that can be\ncaused\
    \ by social engineering as the users of the IoT irrigation system could provide\
    \ login information\nto people posing as technicians or click on malicious links\
    \ on their e-mails. The other threats are\nagroterrorism, cyber-espionage, mostly\
    \ related to accessing intellectual property or conﬁdential\ninformation regarding\
    \ aspects such as genetically modiﬁed crops.\nBlockchain is a new technique that\
    \ is being applied to secure IoT systems [210], which allows\nsecure data storage\
    \ and communication. In agriculture, it is mostly utilized to secure the supply\n\
    chain [211], although there are other proposals that use it to secure a greenhouse\
    \ [212] or to secure\nthe overall smart agriculture framework [213]. Regarding\
    \ IoT irrigation systems for agriculture,\nblockchain has been applied in [214]\
    \ to track and trace the information exchange of their proposed\nsmart watering\
    \ system.\n7.7. Common Architecture Designs for IoT Irrigation Systems for Agriculture\n\
    In this subsection, an overview of the most frequent architectures for these systems\
    \ is going to\nbe discussed.\nMulti-agent architectures are popular in IoT solutions\
    \ for irrigation management [175,180].\nThese types of architectures make a distinction\
    \ among the diﬀerent elements they are comprised of.\nTypically, the distinction\
    \ is made according to the layer of the architecture the elements are encompassed\n\
    in. For example, nodes positioned higher in the hierarchy may act as a broker\
    \ for those lower in the\nhierarchy [175].\nMost architectures are divided into\
    \ layers or functional blocks that represent the main actions to\nbe carried out\
    \ [215]. These blocks or layers can be considered as generic and are utilized\
    \ in most of the\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n34 of 48\navailable architecture designs\
    \ for IoT systems intended for irrigation management. The main elements\nof these\
    \ architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ and security.\nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain environment\
    \ to perform multiple\nactivities such as detection, monitoring, control, and\
    \ action. The devices must have interfaces that allow\ntheir connection with other\
    \ devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained through\ndiﬀerent\
    \ sensors will generally be treated and their results will be applied to diﬀerent\
    \ actuators. Then, it\nis necessary to transmit the monitored data and response\
    \ actions between the devices. Communication\nprotocols are used for this task.\
    \ In most cases, diﬀerent communication protocols are used working\ntogether on\
    \ the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such as device discovery,\
    \ device control\nor the analysis of the collected data, the use of services may\
    \ be necessary as well. The applications allow\nthe interaction of the user with\
    \ the system. From the applications, the user will be able to visualize\nthe information,\
    \ both obtained by monitoring and that extracted from the data once they have\
    \ been\nprocessed. On many occasions, the user can execute the actions that he\
    \ considers appropriate to the\nsituation presented by the data, the actions can\
    \ also be carried out automatically. Lastly, providing\nsecurity to the system\
    \ may also be considered.\nTraditionally, the IoT architecture has been considered\
    \ to be divided into three layers, which are\nthe perception, network, and application\
    \ layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between the\nnetwork and application\
    \ layers has been introduced in multiple studies. This layer, called service layer,\n\
    is employed to store and process data using cloud and fog computing. For the last\
    \ few years, authors\nsuch as Ferrández-Pastor [216] presented a new architecture\
    \ proposal, based on four layers: things,\nedge, communication, and cloud. In\
    \ these latest architectural proposals, the authors use the edge layer\nto locate\
    \ critical applications and perform basic control processes. Also, as indicated\
    \ by [216], cloud\n(internet/intranet) can provide Web services, data storage,\
    \ HMI interfaces or analytic applications.\nFigure 29 shows an image where one\
    \ can see the architecture models.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n34 of 48 \n \nelements\
    \ of these architectures are devices, communications, services, management, applications,\
    \ \nand security.  \nIoT systems are comprised of devices located in a certain\
    \ environment to perform multiple \nactivities such as detection, monitoring,\
    \ control, and action. The devices must have interfaces that \nallow their connection\
    \ with other devices to transmit the necessary information. The data obtained\
    \ \nthrough different sensors will generally be treated and their results will\
    \ be applied to different \nactuators. Then, it is necessary to transmit the monitored\
    \ data and response actions between the \ndevices. Communication protocols are\
    \ used for this task. In most cases, different communication \nprotocols are used\
    \ working together on the same IoT system. In order to perform activities such\
    \ as \ndevice discovery, device control or the analysis of the collected data,\
    \ the use of services may be \nnecessary as well. The applications allow the interaction\
    \ of the user with the system. From the \napplications, the user will be able\
    \ to visualize the information, both obtained by monitoring and that \nextracted\
    \ from the data once they have been processed. On many occasions, the user can\
    \ execute the \nactions that he considers appropriate to the situation presented\
    \ by the data, the actions can also be \ncarried out automatically. Lastly, providing\
    \ security to the system may also be considered.  \nTraditionally, the IoT architecture\
    \ has been considered to be divided into three layers, which are \nthe perception,\
    \ network, and application layer. Later on, an intermediate layer placed between\
    \ the \nnetwork and application layers has been introduced in multiple studies.\
    \ This layer, called service \nlayer, is employed to store and process data using\
    \ cloud and fog computing. For the last few years, \nauthors such as Ferrández-Pastor\
    \ [216] presented a new architecture proposal, based on four layers: \nthings,\
    \ edge, communication, and cloud. In these latest architectural proposals, the\
    \ authors use the \nedge layer to locate critical applications and perform basic\
    \ control processes. Also, as indicated by \n[216], cloud (internet/intranet)\
    \ can provide Web services, data storage, HMI interfaces or analytic \napplications.\
    \ Figure 29 shows an image where one can see the architecture models. \n \nFigure\
    \ 29. Evolution of the layered model in IoT architecture. \nIn the case of the\
    \ reviewed IoT systems for irrigation, both 3-layered [46,83,118,217,218] and\
    \ 5-\nlayered architectures [180] are available. Commonly, the lower layer is\
    \ comprised of the sensor nodes \nand the actuators. The middle layer is comprised\
    \ of a gateway and contemplates data transmission. \nLastly, the third layer is\
    \ usually tasked with performing data storage and analysis. Typical third \nlayers\
    \ are conformed of cloud services, databases or applications. \nA novel take on\
    \ IoT deployments for precision agriculture is being considered on the Internet\
    \ of \nUnderground Things [219]. The authors define the functionalities as in-situ\
    \ sensing, wireless \ncommunication in underground environments and the connection\
    \ between the elements of the \narchitecture such as sensors, machinery or the\
    \ cloud. For the case of IoUT, the sensors are deployed \nunderground. The authors\
    \ performed a study on wireless communication among above ground and \nunderground\
    \ devices. The path loss link between above ground and underground devices reached\
    \ -\n80 dBm for 50 m. The distance between underground devices reached approximately\
    \ 10 m for -80 \ndBm. The authors also comment on the effects of soil moisture\

    \ subsection, we present an architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system\
    \ for irrigation.\nIn order to ensure the correct performance of the IoT irrigation\
    \ system for precision agriculture, the\narchitecture should provide interoperability,\
    \ scalability, security, availability, and resiliency.\nAfter having carried out\
    \ an exhaustive study of works presented by other researchers, our\narchitecture\
    \ proposal is divided into four layers that we deﬁne as devices, communication,\
    \ services,\nand application, as shown in Figure 30. Furthermore, the aspects\
    \ related to management and security\nshould be treated jointly between the communication\
    \ and services layers.\nSensors 2020, 20, x \n36 of 48 \n \nFigure 30. Architecture\
    \ proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture. \n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems \nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221]. It consists of \ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves \nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground \ncommunication. It\
    \ is especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture\
    \ IoT \nsystems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and\
    \ farmers and it would reduce \nthe amount of physical damage the nodes deployed\
    \ on the fields may receive. Although WiFi \nsurprisingly allows underground-above\
    \ ground communication in short distances and depths above \n30 cm [222], it would\
    \ be necessary to study the performance of other existing protocols or even the\
    \ \ncreation of a new protocol that employs lower frequency bands to transmit\
    \ the information through \nthe soil medium.  \nThe use of LoRa is increasing\
    \ for irrigation and precision agriculture applications due to its long-\nrange,\
    \ which allows wireless communication to remote fields. However, the advances\
    \ in 5G may lead \nto a decrease in the interest in LoRa technology. On the one\
    \ hand, if the designed irrigation system \nproduces lower amounts of data, as\
    \ these types of systems present low variability in the data, LoRa \npresents\
    \ itself as a very good solution. However, on the other hand, for IoT systems\
    \ that require the \ntransmission of large amounts of data, 5G would solve the\
    \ problem of the limited amount of data \nthat LoRa can transmit. Considering\
    \ these aspects, a possible future is the use of LoRa and 5G hybrid \nwireless\
    \ networks to attempt in satisfying those needs [223]. \nThere are diverse opinions\
    \ on the existence and effects of climate change on earth. However, \nthere is\
    \ no doubt that many governments, companies and the citizens themselves are increasing\
    \ their \nawareness regarding sustainable consumption. This not only affects their\
    \ view on the energy \nconsumption of IoT systems for irrigation but also, the\
    \ origin of the components of the devices and \nthe impact of IoT devices on the\
    \ environment and the fauna of the area where they are deployed. \nTherefore,\
    \ the reduction in energy consumption and the use of alternative powering methods\
    \ will \ncontinue to be a research trend. Furthermore, it may be a challenge to\
    \ find new materials that are \nweather-resistant and do not increase severely\
    \ the cost of the devices, but the use of recyclable \nmaterials in some of the\
    \ elements of the IoT devices is to be expected [203]. \nAs it has further been\
    \ commented on Subsection 7 1 blockchain and AI will be incorporated into\nFigure\
    \ 30. Architecture proposal for an IoT irrigation system for agriculture.\nThe\
    \ ﬁrst layer is the Device layer, where all the devices that will perform the\
    \ functions of detection,\nmonitoring, control, and action are located. We would\
    \ have four types of nodes. The water monitoring\nnode would monitor water quality\
    \ to determine if the water is apt for the irrigation of the crops.\nThe soil\
    \ monitoring node would monitor soil moisture, soil temperature and other parameters\
    \ that\naid in the irrigation schedule decision process. The weather monitoring\
    \ node would measure air\ntemperature and humidity, precipitation, luminosity,\
    \ radiation, and wind parameters so as to aid in\nthe decision making process.\
    \ Lastly, the actuator nodes would perform the actions resulting from the\ndecision-making\
    \ process.\nThe second layer is the communication layer, comprised of three blocks.\
    \ The Hop-to-Hop\ncommunication block allows deﬁning data link layer technologies\
    \ and to transmit the frames that\ncontain the data of the device layer. From\
    \ this block the frames will be sent to the network communication\nblock, to reach\
    \ the remote locations. The routing function can be assumed in this block in mesh\n\
    networks, such as 802.15.4 networks. The end-to-end communication block is responsible\
    \ for delivering\nthe capabilities of the transport and application layers of\
    \ the TCP/IP model when communication\ncrosses diﬀerent network environments.\
    \ Finally, the network communication block is responsible for\nthe communication\
    \ (routing) between the networks, of the hop-to-hop at end-to-end blocks, using\n\
    the address, for example, IPv4 and IPv6, and the ID resolution. In addition, it\
    \ will be responsible for\nmanaging the QoS.\nThe next layer is the services layer,\
    \ which is comprised of three blocks. The services block includes\nthe IoT services\
    \ and operability for their discovery and search. The organization block performs\
    \ the\nassignment of the services according to the needs of the users or the available\
    \ resources. At last,\nin business environments that relate to IoT, the modeling\
    \ and execution of service block will be invoked\nfrom the execution of the applications.\n\
    Sensors 2020, 20, 1042\n36 of 48\nThere are two blocks, management and security,\
    \ that act on both the previously described\ncommunication and services layers.\
    \ The management block is based on the fault, conﬁguration,\naccounting, performance,\
    \ security (FCAPS) model and framework.\nThis is a model of the ISO\nTelecommunications\
    \ Management Network [220].\nThe security block guarantees both the security and\
    \ privacy of the systems and is comprised\nof four blocks. The authentication\
    \ block is responsible for the authentication of users and services.\nThe authorization\
    \ block manages access control policies. Furthermore, access control decisions\
    \ will\nbe made based on access control policies. The key exchange & management\
    \ block is used to achieve\nsecure communications between peers. Finally, the\
    \ trust & reputation block is responsible for scoring\nthe user and calculating\
    \ the level of trust of the service.\nThe last layer is the application layer.\
    \ It allows users to interact with the IoT system. From this\nlayer, users can\
    \ receive alarms, visualize the gathered data in real-time or activate the actuators\
    \ or\nactions that have not been programmed automatically.\n7.9. Future Challenges\
    \ of IoT Irrigation Systems\nThe Internet of Underground Things (IoUT) is a new\
    \ view of the IoT [221].\nIt consists of\ndeploying both underground and above\
    \ ground IoT devices that communicate among themselves\nwith underground-underground,\
    \ underground-above ground, and above ground-above ground\ncommunication. It is\
    \ especially useful and applicable to irrigation and precision agriculture IoT\n\
    systems as the devices would not be impeding the work of machines and farmers\
    \ and it would\nreduce the amount of physical damage the nodes deployed on the\

    As it has further been commented on Section 7.1, blockchain and AI will be incorporated\
    \ into most\nIoT services [210], including those aimed at irrigation and precision\
    \ agriculture. These technologies\nprovide not only increased security but also\
    \ optimization to the management of the IoT systems.\nThis will lead to an increased\
    \ understanding of the crops and a faster way to characterize genetically\nmodiﬁed\
    \ crops and the eﬀects of new fertilizers and pesticides. Furthermore, it will\
    \ aid in optimizing\nand reducing water consumption and improving the new mechanisms\
    \ that are being proposed to\ndetermine if treated wastewater can be used for\
    \ irrigation and which crops can be irrigated with\nwastewater depending on its\
    \ composition.\nSensors 2020, 20, 1042\n37 of 48\nLastly, farmers usually have\
    \ a very small proﬁt and thus, these IoT systems may not be aﬀordable\nto them.\
    \ Therefore, the cost of IoT devices and the overall system implementation should\
    \ have a\ndecreasing tendency for these types of systems to have a commercial\
    \ future.\n8. Conclusions and Future Work\nWater management is paramount in countries\
    \ with water scarcity. This also aﬀects agriculture, as\na large amount of water\
    \ is dedicated to this use. The rising concerns about global warming have led\n\
    to the consideration of creating water management measures to ensure the availability\
    \ of water for\nfood production and consumption. Thus, the researches on water\
    \ usage reduction for irrigation have\nincreased over the years. In this paper,\
    \ we have provided an overview of the actual state of the art\nregarding IoT irrigation\
    \ systems for agriculture. We have identiﬁed the most monitored parameters to\n\
    characterize water quality for irrigation, soil and weather conditions. We have\
    \ also identiﬁed the most\nutilized nodes to implement IoT and WSN systems for\
    \ the irrigation of crops and the most popular\nwireless technologies. Furthermore,\
    \ the current trends in the implementation of IoT systems for crop\nmanagement\
    \ and irrigation have been discussed as well. We have provided a 4-layer architecture\n\
    proposal as well for the management of crop irrigation.\nAs future work, we are\
    \ developing a smart irrigation system that evaluates water quality prior to\n\
    irrigation based on the proposed architecture.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology,\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    Keywords: crop management; sustainable agriculture; smart farming; internet-of-things
    (IoT); advanced

    agriculture practices; issues and problems

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.

    \ predicted by merely analyzing individual disease\ncauses. Only through construction\
    \ of a comprehensive analysis system can users be provided\nwith predictions of\
    \ highly probable diseases. In this study, cloud-based technology capable of\n\
    handling the collection, analysis, and prediction of agricultural environment\
    \ information in one\ncommon platform was developed. The proposed Farm as a Service\
    \ (FaaS) integrated system supports\nhigh-level application services by operating\
    \ and monitoring farms as well as managing associated\ndevices, data, and models.\
    \ This system registers, connects, and manages Internet of Things (IoT)\ndevices\
    \ and analyzes environmental and growth information. In addition, the IoT-Hub\
    \ network\nmodel was constructed in this study. This model supports efﬁcient data\
    \ transfer for each IoT device as\nwell as communication for non-standard products,\
    \ and exhibits high communication reliability even\nin poor communication environments.\
    \ Thus, IoT-Hub ensures the stability of technology specialized\nfor agricultural\
    \ environments. The integrated agriculture-specialized FaaS system implements\n\
    speciﬁc systems at different levels. The proposed system was veriﬁed through design\
    \ and analysis of\na strawberry infection prediction system, which was compared\
    \ with other infection models.\nKeywords: smart farming; prediction; infection\
    \ forecast model; IoT; oneM2M; LoRa\n1. Introduction\nSmart farms are farms that\
    \ can remotely and automatically control the growth environments\nof crops and\
    \ livestock, by combining information and communications technology (ICT) with\n\
    greenhouses, livestock barns, and orchards [1,2]. Such farms measure and analyze\
    \ the temperature,\nhumidity, and sunshine levels of farm facilities using technology\
    \ such as the Internet of Things (IoT)\nand implement remote control through mobile\
    \ devices [3–5]. To date, cutting-edge information\ntechnology (IT) applications\
    \ such as Big Data, cloud computing, and robotics have been utilized for\nagriculture,\
    \ and ICT integration, research, and development have been performed [6–11].\n\
    Smart farms are attracting global attention as a solution to the increasing demand\
    \ for food due to\npopulation growth; labor force shortage owing to fewer and\
    \ aging farmers; and ongoing problems in\nagriculture, such as limited distribution\
    \ and expansion of cutting-edge agricultural technology [12–14].\nDuring the last\
    \ century, increases in temperature and rainfall due to sudden climate change\
    \ posed\nsigniﬁcant problems for agriculture [15]. In particular, decreasing production\
    \ owing to disease requires\nattention because this problem directly affects the\
    \ income of farm households [16].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051; doi:10.3390/s18114051\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n2 of 17\nMany efforts toward\
    \ disease prevention have recently been made [17,18]. Notably, the physiologies\
    \ of\nthe major pathogens affecting different crops have been determined, and\
    \ the temperature dependence\nof disease occurrence has been identiﬁed using advanced\
    \ technology and data analysis [19,20].\nIn addition, modeling capable of predicting\
    \ disease occurrence has been performed through real-time\ncollection of weather\
    \ data using unmanned observation planes, as well as analysis of long-term\nrecorded\
    \ data [21,22].\nIn this study, the cloud-based Farm as a Service (FaaS) system\
    \ is proposed, which is capable\nof handling the collection, analysis, and prediction\
    \ of agricultural environment information on one\ncommon platform. The proposed\
    \ FaaS is a common platform based on the oneM2M standards\nand supports openAPI\
    \ (where API stands for “application programming interface”). Thus, various\n\
    application services can be developed and collection, control, operation, and\
    \ management of\nagricultural data are facilitated [23–25]. FaaS virtualizes the\
    \ resource information of smart farms\nin various forms based on the Platform\
    \ as a Service (PaaS) approach and provides environments\nfor service operation\
    \ and development [26,27]. The smart farm service established by FaaS utilizes\n\
    cloud-based technology that shares IT infrastructure resources, such as servers,\
    \ storage, middleware,\nand networks, through a network. FaaS also virtualizes\
    \ smart farm devices, such as IoT devices and\nactuators, for operation. Existing\
    \ heterogeneous smart farm systems installed and operated by farm\nhouseholds,\
    \ as well as legacy systems installed and operated individually or separately\
    \ by different\nsuppliers, can be integrated in FaaS through cloud-based technology,\
    \ and the farm management\nfunction can be used in the form of a cloud service.\
    \ The proposed smart farm service can provide crop\ngrowth information monitoring\
    \ services according to the requirements of farm households, as well\nas disease\
    \ prediction services, through application of cloud computing, IoT, Big Data,\
    \ and mobile\ntechnology to greenhouses, orchards, and livestock barns [28,29].\n\
    As a case study, Seolhyang, a South Korean strawberry variety, was cultivated.\
    \ A model predicting\nthe infection risk of Botrytis cinerea, a major disease,\
    \ was then developed to evaluate the performance of\nthe proposed system [30,31].\
    \ Botrytis cinerea generally causes damage to the fruit, calyxes, fruit stalks,\n\
    leaves, and petioles of strawberries. In particular, it causes considerable damage\
    \ to the fruit by invading\nyoung fruit and causing light or dark browning. In\
    \ addition, this disease causes decomposition and\ngray pathogens under humid\
    \ conditions.\nThe remainder of this study is organized as follows. In Section\
    \ 2, the IoT-Hub design is presented.\nThe FaaS system is classified into three\
    \ layers: the network layer, FaaS layer, and application layer;\nthe IoT-Hub network\
    \ model supports the oneM2M platform, which is the low-level layer. The Long\n\
    Range (LoRa) communication system is also discussed. In Section 3, the FaaS conﬁguration\
    \ and\nfunctions are described. FaaS is the middle-level layer. In Section 4,\
    \ the overall system implementation\nand performance evaluation are discussed,\
    \ and an infection prediction model specialized for\nstrawberry diseases is developed.\
    \ Thus, a technological application that utilizes the disease prediction\nsystem\
    \ is presented. Finally, analysis and utilization of the developed system are\
    \ discussed in the\nconclusion section.\n2. IoT-Hub for FaaS\nThe FaaS device\
    \ management service aims to provide interoperability among numerous IoT\ndevices,\
    \ even those based on platforms developed according to different standards or\
    \ technology.\nIn other words, it provides a common platform structure that is\
    \ application-independent and that can\nsupport all services in the corresponding\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld.\n2.1. IoT-Hub Network Model\nIn this study, the IoT-Hub network\
    \ model was designed to support smart farm devices.\nThe IoT-Hub network supports\
    \ the oneM2M common platform and constitutes the low-level layer of\nthe three-layer\
    \ FaaS system. The IoT-Hub network was designed under the condition that sufﬁcient\n\
    power, such as that required by the LoRa Class C platform, is provided [32]. IoT-Hub\
    \ targets a network\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n3 of 17\nin which the device positions\
    \ are ﬁxed and can be applied to all short-, medium-, and long-distance\nwireless\
    \ networks. A user can directly transmit control messages, such as actuator control\
    \ and data\ncollection commands, to a certain terminal through the server. In\
    \ addition, the sleep-mode time is\nsynchronized between a given terminal and\
    \ gateway. Thus, the terminal can receive data from the gateway\nat a predetermined\
    \ time without transmission and reception of additional control messages. As a\
    \ result,\nthe energy efficiency is enhanced. Figure 1 shows a network model to\
    \ which IoT-Hub can be applied.\nSensors 2018, 18, x FOR PEER REVIEW  \n3 of 18\
    \ \n \nand data collection commands, to a certain terminal through the server.\
    \ In addition, the sleep-mode \ntime is synchronized between a given terminal\
    \ and gateway. Thus, the terminal can receive data from \nthe gateway at a predetermined\
    \ time without transmission and reception of additional control \nmessages. As\
    \ a result, the energy efficiency is enhanced. Figure 1 shows a network model\
    \ to which \nIoT-Hub can be applied. \n \nFigure 1. Network model using Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT)-Hub. FaaS: Farm as a Service; api: application \nprogramming\
    \ interface; LoRa: Long Range. \nIoT devices can either access IoT-Hub through\
    \ the interface or communicate with the FaaS layer \ndirectly. IoT-Hub delivers\
    \ messages between IoT devices and FaaS, or between IoT devices, based on \nthe\
    \ transmission control protocol/Internet protocol (TCP/IP). FaaS stores the data\
    \ collected from IoT-\nHub in a database and provides the required functions for\
    \ the user to implement machine learning \nalgorithms in the application layer.\
    \ It can also transmit commands to IoT devices through IoT-Hub \ndepending on\
    \ user requests. Users can monitor the data stored in FaaS via user devices such\
    \ as \ncomputers and smartphones and can transmit messages to IoT devices through\
    \ FaaS and IoT-Hub. \n2.2. IoT-Hub Registration Procedure for FaaS \nAs is apparent\
    \ in Figure 2 and Table 1, for IoT-Hub to be linked with FaaS, a registration\
    \ process \nthat implements the server authentication process using the IoT-Hub\
    \ object identifier (OID) is \nrequired. When the OID authentication step is complete,\
    \ IoT-Hub requests lookup of a given IoT-\nHub resource in FaaS using the OID.\
    \ If the resource does not exist, the resource is created in FaaS \nbased on the\
    \ OID. When the IoT-Hub resource creation step is finished, IoT-Hub requests a\
    \ list of IoT \ndevices connected to FaaS via IoT-Hub (the OID and extended unique\
    \ identifier (EUI) pair). If IoT-\nHub receives the list of IoT devices in a normal\
    \ manner, the registration process is complete. The \nregistration process is\
    \ executed whenever power is applied to IoT-Hub, and the resource creation \n\
    process is omitted if the target IoT-Hub resource already exists in FaaS. \nThis\
    \ FaaS, IoT device, and IoT-Hub network process includes processes between each\
    \ \ncommunication entity, such as device registration/deletion, sensing information\
    \ requests/searches, \ncontrol information transfer/status checks, and a request\
    \ for a list of registered equipment, and \nfollows the specifications of the\
    \ oneM2M platform [33]. \nFigure 1. Network model using Internet of Things (IoT)-Hub.\
    \ FaaS: Farm as a Service; api: application\nprogramming interface; LoRa: Long\
    \ Range.\nIoT devices can either access IoT-Hub through the interface or communicate\
    \ with the FaaS layer\ndirectly. IoT-Hub delivers messages between IoT devices\
    \ and FaaS, or between IoT devices, based on\nthe transmission control protocol/Internet\
    \ protocol (TCP/IP). FaaS stores the data collected from\nIoT-Hub in a database\
    \ and provides the required functions for the user to implement machine learning\n\
    algorithms in the application layer. It can also transmit commands to IoT devices\
    \ through IoT-Hub\ndepending on user requests. Users can monitor the data stored\
    \ in FaaS via user devices such as\ncomputers and smartphones and can transmit\
    \ messages to IoT devices through FaaS and IoT-Hub.\n2.2. IoT-Hub Registration\
    \ Procedure for FaaS\nAs is apparent in Figure 2 and Table 1, for IoT-Hub to be\
    \ linked with FaaS, a registration process\nthat implements the server authentication\
    \ process using the IoT-Hub object identiﬁer (OID) is required.\nWhen the OID\
    \ authentication step is complete, IoT-Hub requests lookup of a given IoT-Hub\
    \ resource\nin FaaS using the OID. If the resource does not exist, the resource\
    \ is created in FaaS based on the OID.\nWhen the IoT-Hub resource creation step\
    \ is ﬁnished, IoT-Hub requests a list of IoT devices connected\nto FaaS via IoT-Hub\
    \ (the OID and extended unique identiﬁer (EUI) pair). If IoT-Hub receives the\
    \ list\nof IoT devices in a normal manner, the registration process is complete.\
    \ The registration process is\nexecuted whenever power is applied to IoT-Hub,\
    \ and the resource creation process is omitted if the\ntarget IoT-Hub resource\
    \ already exists in FaaS.\nThis FaaS, IoT device, and IoT-Hub network process\
    \ includes processes between each\ncommunication entity, such as device registration/deletion,\
    \ sensing information requests/searches,\ncontrol information transfer/status\
    \ checks, and a request for a list of registered equipment, and follows\nthe speciﬁcations\
    \ of the oneM2M platform [33].\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n4 of 17\nSensors 2018,\

    4. Implementation of Prediction System\nThe FaaS disease and pest prediction service\
    \ can conﬁrm the presence of diseases and pests\nusing disease and pest images\
    \ captured by capable service terminals. For example, disease and\npest management\
    \ applications and image-capturing devices can be used. This service also provides\n\
    predictive information on the likelihood of disease and pests, based on operation\
    \ information obtained\nfrom sensors and controllers installed inside and outside\
    \ the facility buildings. In this study, host plants,\npathogens, and environmental\
    \ factors were analyzed and simulated by implementing data collection,\nprocessing,\
    \ and analysis technologies through FaaS. Hence, it was possible to systematically\
    \ analyze\nthe complex interrelationships among the components of plant disease\
    \ occurrence.\nPlant diseases cause morphological changes or degrade growth/reproduction\
    \ functions by\nchanging the metabolic processes and physiological forms of plants.\
    \ The causes of the various\nplant diseases include bacteria, fungi, and viruses.\
    \ Plant diseases occur when certain components are\ncomprehensively quantiﬁed;\
    \ these components can be classiﬁed as pathogens, environment-based\nfactors,\
    \ and host plants. Here, pathogens are modeled by considering the sum of their\
    \ virulence\nand density. Similarly, the environment-based factors are quantiﬁed\
    \ as the sum of the conditions\n(e.g., temperature and humidity) that promote\
    \ disease occurrence. Finally, the host plants are quantiﬁed\nas the sum of the\
    \ conditions that foster plant susceptibility.\nA disease may occur when the disease\
    \ onset conditions of each element are established. In contrast,\nthe disease\
    \ may not occur or the disease onset will be weak if any of the elements are absent.\
    \ Pathogen\nvirulence and density play an important role in plant disease onset.\
    \ As for the host plants themselves,\nthe sum of the elements that foster plant\
    \ susceptibility, which corresponds to the disease onset\nconditions, is important.\
    \ In other words, contact between plants and pathogens is required for\ninteraction,\
    \ and the disease onset conditions must be met after such a contact. If such conditions\
    \ are\nchanged by an increase or decrease in one of the elements, the disease\
    \ occurrence degree is dramatically\nchanged [36].\n4.1. Strawberry Cultivation\
    \ Test Bed\nIn this study, to construct a disease and pest prediction system for\
    \ Seolhyang, a South Korean\nstrawberry variety, two linked smart greenhouses\
    \ were constructed, as shown in Figure 4. Inside the\ngreenhouses, 16 chambers\
    \ with constant temperature and constant humidity functions were designed,\nand\
    \ the Seolhyang infection model was established through tests and analysis.\n\
    In addition, to verify the usefulness of the proposed FaaS system, the FaaS low-level\
    \ layer\nequipment was designed by installing oneM2M-based IoT devices as shown\
    \ in Figure 5. These devices\nmeasured the temperature, humidity, CO2 concentration,\
    \ and illumination intensity inside and outside\nthe smart greenhouses. IoT-Hub\
    \ supporting the LoRa network was also established.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n\

    \ Disease Prediction Service\nThe purpose of the FaaS system is to improve crop\
    \ productivity and provide convenient\nconvergence technology applications for\
    \ farm households that operate smart farms. In this study,\na strawberry disease\
    \ infection prediction model was developed by implementing the IoT-Hub network\n\
    layer for wireless communication as well as the FaaS middle layer for data collection,\
    \ processing,\nand analysis.\nMany models have been developed to predict the infection\
    \ probabilities of speciﬁc strawberry\ndiseases. Among them, the General Infection\
    \ Model was constructed based on the temperature and\nwet spell. This model can\
    \ be used when new and minimally researched pathogens are found [41].\nThe General\
    \ Infection Model was developed to explain any disease system when appropriate\n\
    coefﬁcients are provided. In this model, the critical disease onset limit is deﬁned\
    \ as 20% disease\nincidence or a 5% infected leaf area, under the assumption that\
    \ the number of pathogens is unlimited.\nThe model estimates the wetting duration\
    \ required to reach the critical disease onset limit at\na speciﬁc temperature.\n\
    As the General Infection Model predicts infection risks according to the weather\
    \ conditions\nassuming that there are always sufﬁcient pathogens to cause infection,\
    \ this model can be applied in\nvarious ways to create a disease infection prediction\
    \ model for strawberries.\nIn this study, the Botrytis cinerea strain was applied\
    \ to Seolhyang, which is a strawberry variety\ngrown in the largest area of South\
    \ Korea. The disease occurrence trend according to the temperature\nand leaf surface\
    \ wetting duration was then monitored through FaaS [42]. Based on the test results,\n\
    Sensors 2018, 18, 4051\n13 of 17\na model for predicting the Botrytis cinerea\
    \ infection risk of Seolhyang using the General Infection Model\nwas developed.\n\
    First, a syringe needle was used to cut the leaves of Seolhyang plants that had\
    \ been planted in the\ntest bed greenhouse two months earlier. Then, the leaves\
    \ were sprayed with Botrytis cinerea bacterial\nculture ﬂuid diluted to a concentration\
    \ of 100 cells/mL. After constant temperature and constant\nhumidity functions\
    \ were set for the greenhouse chambers, the disease symptoms were examined for\n\
    three months. Table 7 lists the environmental conditions of each chamber.\nTable\

    \ model is expressed as follows:\nW(T) =\n(\nWmin\nf (T) , Wmin\nf (T) ≤ Wmax\n\

    0, T< Tmin or T >Tmax\n(2)\nHere, W(T) is the wetting duration required to reach\
    \ the critical disease onset limit at temperature\nT (required wetness duration,\
    \ time); Wmin and Wmax are the minimum and maximum required\nwetting durations\
    \ (time), respectively; f (T) is the infection probability at temperature T (0–1);\n\
    Tmin, Topt, and Tmax are the minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures for infection\
    \ (◦C),\nrespectively; and T is the average temperature at a given time (◦C).\n\
    The equation for infection probability f (T) at T (Equation (2)) was originally\
    \ introduced to explain\nthe effect of T on the crop development rate [43]. This\
    \ model is based on the beta function, which is\ncommonly used as a probability\
    \ function in statistics to explain a biased distribution. The value of\nthe beta\
    \ function lies between 0 and 1 because it indicates probability. Therefore, f\
    \ (T) = 0 holds for\nT = Tmin and T = Tmax, and f (T) = 1 holds for T = Topt.\
    \ Figure 6 shows the infection probability\nand required wetness duration according\
    \ to the environmental conditions. The infection model for\nSeolhyang was completed\
    \ by maintaining the four conditions given in Table 7 within the test bed for\n\
    three months and analyzing data from the experimental and control groups.\nBotrytis\
    \ cinerea of Seolhyang can survive when attached to the surface of plants and\
    \ when a high\nconcentration of infectious agents, such as bacterial resins that\
    \ appear on branches in the early stages of\ngrowth, exists. Except for hot summers,\
    \ infection can be easily transferred within or between orchards\nat any time.\
    \ Based on the analysis presented in Figure 8a, if the probability of occurrence\
    \ of greenhouse\ndiseases is determined to be 80%, maintenance of optimal temperatures\
    \ and wetting durations can be\ndetermined using (b). Accordingly, we propose\
    \ the following regarding disease control:\n•\nForecast less than 0.8: For agronomic\
    \ control, (A) adequately manage ventilation; (B) pay attention\nto watering and\
    \ avoid excessive humidity; and (C) immediately remove dead, aged, and infected\n\
    leaves and infected fruit. Note that Seolhyang breeds are more susceptible to\
    \ gray mold when\nsubject to cold-weather damage compared to other breeds. Extramembranous\
    \ supplementary\nheat should be provided.\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n14 of 17\n\

    \ treatment before the disease has\noccurred. Connect to the pesticide information\
    \ system to distribute the correct types and amounts\nof pesticides and conduct\
    \ disease control [44,45].\nIn addition, similar curves were obtained for the\
    \ Botrytis cinerea infection model applied to other\ncrops, and it was found that,\
    \ in comparison with other strawberry varieties, Seolhyang is resilient at\nlow\
    \ temperatures [46,47].\n \ncontrol: \n• \nForecast less than 0.8: For agronomic\

    \ 8. Comparison of general infection models for Botrytis cinerea: (a) Infection\
    \ probability \naccording to temperature, and (b) required wetness duration according\
    \ to temperature. \nIn the case of the Botrytis cinerea disease in Seolhyang,\
    \ the critical disease onset limit was defined \nas 20% disease incidence, assuming\
    \ that an unlimited number of pathogens existed. As for ܹ݉݅݊ \nand ܹ݉ܽݔ for infection\
    \ at ܶ݋݌ݐ, the wetting duration that corresponded to 20% disease incidence \n\
    was calculated after obtaining the relationship between the wetting duration and\
    \ disease incidence \nfrom a regression analysis based on the FaaS MMS data. In\
    \ addition, ܶ݉݅݊ and ܶ݉ܽݔ were \ndetermined considering the disease incidence\
    \ of Seolhyang Botrytis cinerea obtained using the test \nbed, as well as the\
    \ results of a density change test. \nThe reciprocal of ܹ(ܶ), which is the result\
    \ of the General Infection Model, can be considered as \nthe magnitude of the\
    \ infection risk increasing at that time, and the accumulated value of the reciprocal\
    \ \nof ܹ(ܶ) can be regarded as the magnitude of the possibility that infection\
    \ succeeds at that time. \nTherefore, a model that calculates infection risk using\
    \ the accumulated value of the reciprocal of \nܹ(ܶ) was developed. If the leaves\
    \ are dried continuously, the bacterial activity decreases; thus, the \ninfection\
    \ possibility disappears. Therefore, the conditions for initializing the infection\
    \ risk were \ndetermined considering changes in the density of the Botrytis cinerea\
    \ on the leaves.  \nAnalysis of various models through comparison with the control\
    \ group using the test bed \nrevealed that the models of the crops infected with\
    \ Botrytis cinerea were similar. The disease onset \nܶ݋݌ݐ of Seolhyang was approximately\
    \ 20 °C. The disease incidence decreased very sharply in the \ntemperature range\
    \ of 15–20 °C and exhibited a relatively slow increase in the temperature range\
    \ of \n20–30 °C. In addition, the disease occurred easily when the conditions\
    \ within the facility were humid \nFigure 8. Comparison of general infection models\

    \ existed. As for Wmin\nand Wmax for infection at Topt, the wetting duration that\
    \ corresponded to 20% disease incidence was\ncalculated after obtaining the relationship\
    \ between the wetting duration and disease incidence from\na regression analysis\
    \ based on the FaaS MMS data. In addition, Tmin and Tmax were determined\nconsidering\
    \ the disease incidence of Seolhyang Botrytis cinerea obtained using the test\
    \ bed, as well as\nthe results of a density change test.\nThe reciprocal of W(T),\
    \ which is the result of the General Infection Model, can be considered as\nthe\
    \ magnitude of the infection risk increasing at that time, and the accumulated\
    \ value of the reciprocal\nof W(T) can be regarded as the magnitude of the possibility\
    \ that infection succeeds at that time.\nTherefore, a model that calculates infection\
    \ risk using the accumulated value of the reciprocal of W(T)\nwas developed. If\
    \ the leaves are dried continuously, the bacterial activity decreases; thus, the\
    \ infection\npossibility disappears. Therefore, the conditions for initializing\
    \ the infection risk were determined\nconsidering changes in the density of the\
    \ Botrytis cinerea on the leaves.\nAnalysis of various models through comparison\
    \ with the control group using the test bed revealed\nthat the models of the crops\
    \ infected with Botrytis cinerea were similar. The disease onset Topt of\nSeolhyang\
    \ was approximately 20 ◦C. The disease incidence decreased very sharply in the\
    \ temperature\nrange of 15–20 ◦C and exhibited a relatively slow increase in the\
    \ temperature range of 20–30 ◦C.\nIn addition, the disease occurred easily when\
    \ the conditions within the facility were humid and\noccurred widely when a sudden\
    \ drop in nighttime temperature caused cold damage. These results can\nguide consultations\
    \ for farm households and technical personnel involved with Seolhyang cultivation\n\
    using the FaaS disease prediction system, for example, in terms of environmental\
    \ control parameters\nfor the facility.\n5. Discussion\nIoT is generally perceived\
    \ as a system in which sensors and data are used to implement advanced\nprocesses\
    \ or activities in industrial or commercial environments. Interestingly, agriculture\
    \ is a ﬁeld that\nSensors 2018, 18, 4051\n15 of 17\ncan signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from\
    \ ICT. This study proposed an FaaS system for a greenhouse, constructed\nusing\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, big data, and mobile technology. The performance of each\
    \ layer was\nevaluated by implementing a disease prediction application. The IoT-Hub\
    \ system was developed,\nwhich supports oneM2M and LoRa, and is optimized for\
    \ the agricultural environment. This system\nwas improved to reduce unnecessary\
    \ control messages, namely, to provide communication with\nminimal messages. In\
    \ addition, through each function in the FaaS middle layer, a general infection\n\
    model for Seolhyang, a South Korean strawberry variety, was developed. This example\
    \ demonstrated\nthat various services, such as device malfunction diagnosis and\
    \ disease and pest image recognition,\ncan be provided by FaaS, and disease and\
    \ pest infection models for various crops can be developed.\nAdvanced ICT convergence\
    \ technology has made it possible to construct and utilize a system\nfor predicting\
    \ the occurrence frequency and incidence of pathogens that infect crops. However,\n\
    to construct prediction systems using vast amounts of climate information and\
    \ real-time monitoring of\nrapidly changing climates, it is necessary to develop\
    \ more advanced prediction models with closer\ncooperation between communication,\
    \ network, and software technologies. It is difﬁcult, however,\nto perfectly understand\
    \ and predict environmental, host plant, and pathogen patterns, which vary\nconstantly.\
    \ However, if integrated systems such as FaaS are developed, and various input\
    \ datasets\nrequired for service conﬁguration and interrelationship analyses are\
    \ collected, more accurate plant\ndisease prediction systems may be constructed\
    \ using advanced systems.\n6. Conclusions\nFaaS-based smart farms can substantially\
    \ lower initial facility installation costs and are expected\nto become a major\
    \ source of smart farm expansion as they are relatively easy to install through\n\
    mobile-based services. In the future, smart farm technology development will center\
    \ around knowledge\nservices that optimize the agricultural industry value chain\
    \ as well as environmental information\ncollection and facility control. Weather\
    \ information, distribution information, pricing information,\nand the like will\
    \ be collected and analyzed through Big Data and cloud-based systems and provided\n\
    to agricultural decision makers. Agricultural managers can use this variety of\
    \ collected and analyzed\ninformation to maximize the efﬁciency of decision making\
    \ in agricultural production and distribution\nprocesses related to crop selection,\
    \ production volume, disease control and prevention, shipping,\nand distribution\
    \ channels. In the future, the developed system will be linked to the National\
    \ Crop\nPest Management System to provide information on infection risk such as\
    \ risk based on crop, mycelial\ngrowth rate, disease development speed, germination\
    \ rate, and disease outbreak quantity. Further\nresearch and development will\
    \ be conducted for various agricultural technologies, such as technology\nthat\
    \ can use Big Data pertaining to agricultural environments to predict possible\
    \ disease outbreak\nbefore diseases and pests spread, as well as technology that\
    \ can use rapid information sharing to\ndistribute pesticides even after an outbreak.\n\

    Get rights and content Abstract Agriculture plays a crucial role in India’s economy
    and around 70% of people earn their income through it and also provides large
    employment opportunities. The technological advancement has led to remarkable
    achievements in developing Agricultural based software applications to get faster
    information. But, many farmers are still applying the traditional methods of farming
    and hence the result of productivity becomes very low. Agriculture prediction
    process for organic and inorganic farms is an open issue and it depends upon weather,
    soil fertility, water, seasons and commodity prices, etc. Soil fertility factor
    is paramount important to maintain the crop growth and increase the production.
    The soil fertility levels help the farmers to identify the deficiencies in the
    soil, namely nutrient content, soil type, pH value, EC (Electrical Conductivity)
    value and soil texture and to choose the right crops to increase the production.
    In this work, as a novelty, the soil fertility level is predicted by analyzing
    the Virudhunagar District Soil information and recommendations are offered for
    crop selection and sowing by using C5.0: Advanced Decision Tree (ADT) classifier
    algorithm. Using this technique, an Android-based mobile phone applications named
    as Design of Smart Information System (DSIS) application has been developed. The
    proposed application activates the Global Positioning System (GPS) to identify
    the user location. The performance of proposed model is analysed and it is compared
    with the existing classification model for agricultural data. Previous article

    fertility 1. Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of India’s economy. It also
    provides large employment opportunities to the people. Nowadays, the crop cultivation
    becomes very low since many farmers are still following the traditional farming
    methods. So the farmers, governments, agricultural scientists and the researchers
    are exploring new methods to get high yield from the farmland. Government of India
    is concentrating on the agriculture industry by handling several activities to
    increase the crop productivity (Vincya and Valarmathi, 2016). Based on the Green,
    White, Yellow, and Blue revolutions, new ideas can be introduced on the particular
    crop. It depends on the natural factors like water, soil, climate changes, etc.
    Crop production mainly depends on the soil fertility. So, it is mandatory to identify
    the low nutrients content and to maximize the same to get high quality crops (Soil
    test, 2016). In India, the primary nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium)
    are very deficient in the agricultural soil. So, it is mandatory to take necessary
    action for overcoming the deficiency by applying the correct requirement of fertilizers
    for the crop. Soil health is the combination of physical, chemical and biological
    activities of soil. The essential goal of any technology with respect to agriculture
    is to make the better crop production with many immediate and sustainable benefits
    (Athmaja and Hanumanthappa, 2016). Farmers are not only harvesting the crops and
    vegetables, but they also harvest the massive amount of data. Therefore, there
    is a need of big data analytics to analyze the same. It works with large datasets
    and problematical processing is done by database management applications or traditional
    data processing tools. MapReduce is used to access the big data sets with a parallel
    distributed algorithm and it is implemented with a programming model. It performs
    two operations: one is Map () and another is Reduce (). Map () takes care about
    filtering and sorting the data and Reduce () concentrates on summarizing the data
    (Bhargavi and Jyothi, 2011). Data mining discovers the unknown information from
    the dataset. The soil nutrient information, soil composition and soil characteristics
    are required for determining the soil fertility level. Also, the measure of soil
    fertility indicates the deficiencies that need to take treatment are based on
    the soil test. In agricultural production, soil fertility is the important factor
    for crop growth and productivity. Most of the farmers are unaware of soil testing
    and also not having pertinent knowledge about their land soil (Chandrakar et al.,
    2011). The soil test reports enable the farmers to choose the type of fertilizer
    and to know about the use of fertilizer based on the soil requirement. The excessive
    distribution of fertilizers is one of the major problems in agricultural domain.
    It should be rectified by analyzing the soil fertility level (Han and Kamber,
    2012). In addition, it''s important to define the time of distribution, type and
    quantity of fertilizers for healthy crop growing. Therefore, this work covers
    the building steps for producing an efficient and perfect predictive model for
    soil fertility with the help of our proposed C5.0: ADT Classifier algorithm. The
    motivation of this work is to assist Virudhunagar District farmers via mobile
    app to make the smart decision to optimize the crop yield based on soil nutrient
    availability and fertilization. The rest of the paper is organized as follows:
    Section 2 elucidates about the different decisions tree algorithms using agricultural
    data; Section 3 demonstrates the proposed method work flow; Section 4 proves the
    proposed method experimental outcomes; and finally Section 5 provides the overall
    conclusion of the paper. 2. Related work The simulation models play a very significant
    role in the development of the agro-ecological and socio-economic conditions.
    Several applications are in use, based on data mining algorithms in the agriculture
    field. Decision Support Systems (DSS) are used to generate data for agriculture
    management systems viz., the pest management, farm management and crop management
    system. The performance of these systems is low. Hence, the utilization of IoT
    based advanced techniques could improve the process of farmer decisions about
    crop fertilization. Many authors have done their research using data mining techniques
    with small instances. The decision support system model, related to soil water
    balance, consider several factors as soil type, weather, canal network, and crop
    type (Oad et al., 2009). Gholap et al. (2012) used Decision Tree algorithm for
    predicting soil fertility. Author collected the dataset from the private soil
    testing laboratory, Pune and used selection and boosting techniques to tune the
    performance of the J48 algorithm. Adaboost is one of the boosting techniques used
    in this research. They predicted the soil fertility level and classified as very
    low, very high, low, high, moderate, and moderately high. Further, they improved
    the accuracy level as 96.73% after applying selection and boosting algorithm.
    Preethai et al. proposed new approach for soil classification and predicted various
    factors with the help of decision support system. The author monitored the agricultural
    activities with the help of this new decision support system. Their study is involved
    with the Coimbatore District dataset and by using enhanced C4.5 algorithm, fast
    decision support process is achieved. Further it took less time for analysing
    small dataset (Preethai and Murugesakumar, 2016). In Suman and Naib (2013), author
    focused on classification and clustering of soil using various data mining techniques.
    In this work, soil dataset is collected from the soil testing laboratory, Bahadurgarh,
    Jhajjar. It contains 49 total soil sample instances with 10 attributes. Soil classifications
    deal with the categorization of soil into different soil classes as very low,
    low, high, medium and very high on the basis of nutrient percentage found in the
    soil and on the basis of these classes, fertilizer is suggested. Ganesan et al
    reported that the Indian farmers were adapted to apply mobile based agricultural
    advisory systems without consideration of their social and economical factors
    based on correlation analysis. In addition, they have conveniently learned important
    information on pest and disease control through mobile phone. For rural formers,
    mobile multimedia agricultural advisory system based call centre provides the
    required information (Ganesan et al., 2013). Shivnath Ghosh et al. projected a
    novel approach based on Supervised Learning and Back Propagation Neural Network
    to analyze the soil properties. The major motivation of this work is to examine
    how the crop growth gets affected by soil properties viz., organic matter, essential
    plant nutrients and micronutrient and to figure out the appropriate percentage
    of relationship among these using the above approach. The direct measurement of
    these parameters is expensive. The result shows that the proposed approach predicts
    the soil properties with better accuracy (Ghosh and Koley, 2014). Hemageetha et
    al. analyzed the soil resources and various soil types by using data mining classification
    and clustering techniques for Salem District. It helps the farmers to choose the
    suitable crops for their soil. Salem District contains red and black soil. The
    suitable crop was chosen based on the soil type and fertility level by using the
    classification algorithm (Hemageetha and Nasira, 2016). In Rajeswari and Arunesh
    (2016), authors have projected a method to predict soil type with classification
    algorithms. They applied JRip, J48 and Naïve Bayes algorithm used to discover
    the hidden information from soil data. They collected 110 soil test report data
    from agricultural soil testing lab, sattur block, Virudhunagar District. They
    compared the results with kappa statistics to find out the suitable algorithm.
    JRip model gives more accurate results for the soil test report data. Many authors
    didn’t use the huge amount of data. Data mining techniques are insufficient to
    analyze the large volume of data. Therefore, the big data analytics concept is
    used to handle the same. Our work aims to help the Virudhunagar District farmers
    to improve their crop yield based on predictions and soil analysis using the smart
    information systems. 3. System node and architecture In this work, a new well-designed
    model is used to predict the soil fertility level. In general, the soil test report
    contains the information about Macronutrient and Micronutrient contents of the
    given soil. From the soil test reports, it is observed that Virudhunagar District
    soil contains maximum amount of Macronutrient content viz., Nitrogen, Phosphorus
    and Potassium and the required amount of fertilizer for crop growing is calculated
    accordingly. The proposed method workflow is shown in Fig. 1. The farmer obtains
    the effective and smart solution to cultivate the crop yield ensuring a good soil
    fertility level and minimizing the fertilizer consumption. It has the data pre-processing
    steps to remove the noisy values in the dataset and then predicts the soil fertility
    level by using C5.0: ADT Classifier algorithm. Download : Download high-res image

    Firstly, the user gets connected with server by sending a service request using
    DSIS application. The location of farmer is identified by enabling GPS (Global
    Positioning System) on the mobile. The current GPS location details are extracted
    and processed by the service server using mobile communication network. Then,
    the service servers process the location information and get the relevant data
    from the cloud. Finally, the process response is sent back to the user’s mobile
    device through mobile communication network. Further, the proposed DSIS app allows
    the users to select the location information manually and get the useful recommendations
    from the same. Download : Download high-res image (262KB) Download : Download

    Virudhunagar District. Dataset has 15 attributes and a total of 25,000 instances
    of the soil sample test report. Table 1 describes the soil data set attributes.

    in this District (http://kvkapk.org/District%20Profile.pdf). The District headquarter

    full-size image Fig. 3. Location of study area. 3.2. Data pre-processing The raw
    information contains the missing information, corrupted information, inappropriate
    information and unknown data. So, the data pre-processing is the essential step
    for cleaning the data. During this, raw data is transformed into the reasonable
    format. Nowadays, data causes many errors at the time of analysis, because it
    contains inconsistent, incomplete and noisy values (Malley et al., 2016). Using
    the pre-processing technique, this problem is solved and the pre-processed data
    is taken into account for further processing. 3.3. Feature selection method It
    is also named as attribute and variable selection. This process is used to choose
    the relevant attributes from the database. The selection of feature enables us
    to have higher classification accuracy (Peng and Liu, 2018). It is used to select
    the relevant attributes and discard the irrelevant attributes, applied on the
    preprocessed dataset. 3.3.1. Chi-square MapReduce feature selection The renowned
    feature selection method is named as chi-square ( ). It is used to test whether
    the class label or the target is independent of a particular feature or not. This
    is used to select the predictor variable (Rajeswari et al., 2018). Chi-square
    value for a feature with ''r'' different values and ''c'' number of classes is
    defined as (3.3.1) where Oij is the number of instances with value ''i'' which
    are in class ''j''. Eij is the expected number of instances with value ''i'' and
    class ''j''. It was calculated with the help of MapReduce techniques. Pseudo code
    for Chi-Square MapReduce feature selection Input: Pre-processed Data Output: Relevant
    Attributes Map Phase: Step 1: Choose the node attributes in the data set Step
    2: Compute expected frequency for each attributes Step 3: For each attribute in
    sequence, calculate the observed frequency Reduce Phase: Step 1: Sum the observed
    and expected square values and divided by expected frequency Step 2: Select attribute
    with the highest weight to be the next node Step 3: Remove the node attribute
    Combine Phase: Repeat Map and Reduce phase steps until all attributes have been
    used. Further, it can be discovered from the attribute weights. The highest weight
    attributes are taken as the relevant attributes. Each attributes weight calculation
    is done by using (3.3.1) (Rajeswari and Suthendran, 2018). 3.4. Proposed classifier
    algorithm The recursive top-down approach of decision tree structure is used by
    the greedy algorithm which becomes popular data mining method. ID3 and its successor,
    C4.5 Decision tree algorithms are well known for rules construction and commonly
    applied in machine learning process. In that, J. Ross Quinlan’s algorithms are
    the most popular decision tree algorithms in the machine learning community (Quinlan,
    2014). The advantages and disadvantages of ID3, and C4.5 decision tree algorithms
    are as follows: Advantages: • Generate the small decision tree rules quickly •
    Entire dataset be tested to create the decision tree • C4.5 easily indicates the
    important attributes for classification • C4.5 uses leaf nodes to replace the
    unwanted branches. • C4.5 accepts both continuous domain and discrete domain values.
    Disadvantages: • It requires huge amount of memory space • Data over-fitting or
    over-classification problem occurs when small sample is tested. • It takes a decision
    based on single attribute testing. • It fails to process numeric attributes and
    missing values • C4.5 constructs empty branches with zero values The experimental
    results are compared with the existing decision tree algorithm. However, data
    mining algorithm does not handle a large amount of data set (ex. Data size – 2.00 MB,
    20,000 data instances). So, the MapReduce concept is used to process the huge
    amount of data. After feature selection, the relevant attribute can be taken for
    prediction process. C5.0: ADT classifier is used for pruning techniques to build
    the tree. This technique is used to overcome the disadvantages of C4.5 and ID3
    algorithms and reduces the decision tree size by removing sections of the tree
    it provides tiny rules to classify the instances. Pre-pruning method used in the
    proposed method prevents the earlier tree growth and it classifies the training
    set correctly (Rajeswari et al., 2017). The dual objective of pruning step is
    used to reduce the complexity of the final classifier as well as improved predictive
    accuracy by the reduction of removal of noisy data and over fitting. Pseudo code
    for C5.0: ADT Classifier Algorithm: Input: Selected features from soil dataset
    Output: Predict the soil fertility level and crop selection Map Phase Step 1:
    Read the attributes in soil dataset Step 2: Let C be a categorization of a set
    S of objects into categories C1, C2, … , Cr. Let Pi be the probability that an
    object in S is in categories Ci. The entropy of S is defined as Step 3: For any
    given attribute A, consider the set V (A) of possible values of A. For any v ∈ V
    (A), let Sv be the set of all elements of S having value v for the attribute A.
    The information gain of A with respect to S is given by Step 4: Compute the Gain
    Ratio using Entropy and Information gain Reduce Phase Step 1: The attribute with
    maximum information gain ratio is fixed as the parent node and the values of the
    attribute are its children nodes. Step 2: Using the remaining attributes, the
    highest information gain ratio attribute is considered as a child node and the
    process are repeated. If S (Vi) = ∅, the tree constructed is added as a new branch
    at vi. Step 3: Each leaf node of the final decision tree gives a rule for predicting
    the class label. The above pseudo code explains the methodology of proposed C5.0
    ADT classifier to generate prediction rules for soil fertility and crop selection.
    The proposed method is implemented on the MapReduce Hadoop framework based on
    distributed programming model. The disadvantage of existing approaches is generation
    of large number of branch nodes which results in increasing the tree size and
    thus leads to huge memory space usage. In this work, to overcome this issue, the
    Pruning concept is utilized between Map and Reduce phase as a novelty. Pruning
    technique downsizes the decision tree and thus instance classification becomes
    easier (Chandrakar et al., 2011). The generated prediction rules for Soil Fertility
    level and crop selection is shown in Figs. 4a;4b respectively. Download : Download

    full-size image Fig. 4b. Crop Selection prediction rules. The main objective is
    to predict the soil fertility level based on the soil nutrient content and select
    the suitable crop based on the soil fertility level to produce more yield with
    accurate results and less process time. In this proposed algorithm, the biggest
    gain ratio value is used as the splitting criteria for generating the classifier
    rules. The advantages of proposed method are as follows: • It provides accurate
    result • It requires less memory space • It takes less time to build a model •
    It can handle categorical values, continuous values and missing values from the
    dataset 4. Performance evaluation 4.1. Implementation R language is an open source
    statistical software and it is mostly used to process the statistical data. It
    does not handle the large amount of data. So, RHadoop, RmR, Rhdfs packages are
    used to integrate the R and Hadoop environment. It works with the terra bytes
    of data and easily handles the data. The proposed method code was written with
    the help of the RHadoop and RmR packages. The flow of proposed system is shown
    in Fig. 2. 4.1.1. Experimental environment In this work, a Hadoop 2.7.1 is installed
    on windows 7–64 bit operating system and a single-node Hadoop cluster with the
    MapReduce computing paradigm environment is created. MapReduce is a highly fault-tolerant
    distributed file system and it is generally designed to be deployed on low-cost
    hardware. It provides high throughput access application for large data sets.
    Hadoop platform be composed of single node cluster with Intel Core i5 (4590 s)
    @ 3.00 GHz Gen Processor, 8.00 GB RAM, 1 TB Hard disk and CPU clock speed 3.00 GHz.
    All Hadoop and MapReduce experiments are performed with the help of R 3.4.3, Rstudio
    1.1.423, and Java development kit (JDK) 1.8.0 131. Then, the mobile application
    development is using Android Studio 3.0.1, Android SDK – 7.0 (Nougat), and emulator:
    Intel® processor with support for Intel® VT-x (10.1″ WXGA (Tablet)). The performance
    analysis of proposed method is calculated in terms of time (in sec) and speedup.
    Moreover, the real-time data set collected from the Virudhunagar District is shown
    in Section 3.1. Data set was stored in the CSV (Comma Separated Values) file format.
    It was collected over the blocks of Virudhunagar District. Soil data set contains
    15 attributes and the sample soil data is shown in Table 2. In that, Class is
    the dependent variable and all other variables are the predictor variables which
    are used to predict the soil fertility level. Table 2. Sample soil data set. S.no

    Results and discussion The main aim of proposed model is used to predict the suitable
    crop based on the available soil information viz., soil type and soil fertility
    level with high accuracy and less time. 25% of data have been taken for training
    set to training the proposed model and remaining data is treated as the testing
    set. This work is compared with the other existing algorithms and also measured
    the accuracy by, (4.1) where TP (True Positive) represents the number of correctly
    classified instances that instance is positive, TN (True Negative) represents
    a number of correctly classified instances that instance is negative, FP (False
    Positive) represents the number of incorrectly classified instances that instance
    is positive, and FN (False Negative) represents the number of incorrectly classified
    instances that instance is negative. The performance of the model can be evaluated
    by using the above formula (4.1). The proposed method has the ability to provide
    correct prediction. Fig. 5 shows the preprocessing step result of soil data set.
    During the preprocessing, the missing values in the soil data set are identified,
    and then some data are replaced with the smoothing and binning method and removed
    some data. Before removing missing values, the raw data contains 25,000 records.
    In that, inconsistent data, error data, and missing values were replaced and removed.
    After pre-processing the soil test report, dataset has 15 attributes and a total
    of 24,980 instances of Virudhunagar District. The existing method takes a huge
    amount of time to find the fertility level. So, there is a need for new automated
    reliable method to find the better result with less time. Preprocessed soil data
    set was taken up for further classification process. Download : Download high-res

    Speedup Performance Analysis Results. 5. Conclusion The proposed model helps the
    farmers to analyze their farmland soil nutrient information. This is one of the
    essential requirements towards the agriculture sector to increase the crop production
    with a less utilization of fertilizer requirements and sustain the soil nutrient
    with good health. Through soil test, the farmers know the present requirements
    of fertilizer for the particular crop. These proposed models also facilitate the
    estimation of fertility level and suggests the suitable crop for sowing in the
    farmland for 11 blocks at Virudhunagar District. Experimental results show that,
    C5.0: ADT Classifier algorithm gives the best accuracy rate and less execution
    time for prediction analysis is compared with other existing classification algorithms.
    Further, the proposed model outperforms the existing models by 5% increase in
    accuracy and 46% less in prediction time than the existing data mining algorithms.
    The accuracy improvement is achieved by using the smoothing and binning method
    which handles the missing value, feature selection techniques for selecting the
    relevant data and pruning technique is used to find the highest attribute easily.
    Further, the proposed model takes less processing time and high speedup to complete
    the task on Hadoop framework structure. The DSIS app was developed to assist the
    farmers to choose the best crop for sowing based on soil nutrient level. We are
    aiming to upgrade our proposed system in future to offer recommendations that
    assist in choosing the suitable fertilizers to produce the maximum crop yield
    with less investment. Conflict of interest The authors have no conflict of interest

    Te food processing and handling industry is the most signiﬁcant business among
    the various manufacturing industries in the

    entire world that subsidize the highest employability. Te human workforce plays
    an essential role in the smooth execution of the

    production and packaging of food products. Due to the involvement of humans, the
    food industries are failing to maintain the

    demand-supply chain and also lacking in food safety. To overcome these issues
    of food industries, industrial automation is the best

    possible solution. Automation is completely based on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)
    or machine learning (ML) or deep learning (DL)

    algorithms. By using the AI-based system, food production and delivery processes
    can be eﬃciently handled and also enhance the

    operational competence. Tis article is going to explain the AI applications in
    the food industry which recommends a huge

    amount of capital saving with maximizing resource utilization by reducing human
    error. Artiﬁcial intelligence with data science

    can improve the quality of restaurants, cafes, online delivery food chains, hotels,
    and food outlets by increasing production

    utilizing diﬀerent ﬁtting algorithms for sales prediction. AI could signiﬁcantly
    improve packaging, increasing shelf life, a

    combination of the menu by using AI algorithms, and food safety by making a more
    transparent supply chain management

    system. With the help of AI and ML, the future of food industries is completely
    based on smart farming, robotic farming,

    and drones.

    1. Introduction

    It is well known that food or ration is a necessary for human

    beings and can be described as the best outcome of farming,

    fashioned after handing out the various foodstuﬀs shaped by

    farmers. For any country’s development, the food industry’s

    products play a crucial role [1]. It also has a signiﬁcant role in

    the development of the country’s economy as well as the

    world economy. Terefore, the quality of food industry

    products and their safety with proper distributions are much

    needed. In the last few decades, newly developed technology

    such as artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) achieved good results to

    attain the desired objectives [2]. Terefore, it is essential to

    investigate the AI-based smart agriculture and advanced

    food industry aspects. Such techniques fulﬁll social re-

    quirements and deliver quality products on time. By using

    these modern technologies, the food industry can produce a

    large number of food products in less time that will increase

    the economy of the company in exponential manner [2].

    AI-based systems or autonomous systems are extensively

    applied in approximately every portion of the technology. It

    enables the world to eﬃciently optimize the problems,

    computerize the food industry, and transﬁgure food in-

    dustries products [3]. By using a computerized system, the

    industry can examine and make sure the most favourable

    circumstances such as seed selection, crop monitoring,

    watering, and temperature monitoring can be improved,

    which will provide excellence of the food industry products

    [4, 5]. Te use of AI is not limited to these things only. It can

    also be helpful in food processing, storage, and delivery of

    food items. Intelligent gadgets such as robotics and intel-

    ligent drones can also play a very crucial and signiﬁcant role

    in minimizing the packaging cost. It will also help in de-

    livering the food products, completing the task in perilous

    surroundings, and also providing very-good-quality prod-

    ucts [6–8]. Te important roles of AI in food industries can

    be broadly classiﬁed into two classes: one is food security

    management, and another one is food quality management.

    Te area under each class is given in Figure 1. By keeping

    every aspect of AI in the food industry, this study provides a

    literature study of machine learning and AI in the food

    industry.

    Te rest of the manuscript is organized as smart farming

    followed by AI in the food processing industry. After this,

    the role of data analysis in the food industry is discussed;

    then, ML in the restaurant business is discussed. As per the

    food safety concern, AI is also important; therefore, the next

    section will describe the AI in food safety. At last, but not the

    least, the future scope of AI and ML in the food industry is

    covered. Finally, the conclusion of the manuscript is in-

    cluded in the last section.

    2. Smart Farming

    In the food industry, AI also has some important applica-

    tions such as soil monitoring, robocroping, and predictive

    analysis [9–11]. Figure 2 shows the trendy applications of AI

    in the food industry. Te description of each application is

    given in the forthcoming section.

    2.1. Soil Monitoring. In the current scenario, food industries

    are considering the beneﬁts of AI-based systems. Under the

    AI-based system, computer vision and deep-learning algo-

    rithm is very important and used to investigate the sequence

    of information or data received by the AI-based agents to

    trace the progress of crop and soil health [10, 12–22]. Te

    computerized systems are used to make available clients with

    a sagacity of their soil’s strengths and weaknesses. Te prime

    objective behind the building of the developed system is to

    identify defective crops and identify the probable approach

    for healthy crop development.

    In the recent scenario for Soil Monitoring (SM), once a

    farmer submits a sample of their farm soil to the monitoring

    body, afterwards, the customer will get a detailed summary

    of their ﬁeld soil contents. After the drawn results, an ad-

    equate decision has been taken for bacteria, fungi, and wide-

    ranging microbial progression.

    Te ﬁrst AI-based drone was used in Japan in the year

    1980 for crop dusting. Today, most companies are taking

    advantage of agriculture AI and aerial technology to keep

    an eye on crop health [15]. Te company’s primary en-

    deavour is to decrease the costs and improve crop growth.

    Users preprogram the drone’s route and then will inte-

    grate with the device. After that, the computer vision will

    record some pictures that will be used for examination

    purposes.

    Now, further technology moved to the new era of ad-

    vancement is called the Internet of Tings (IoT). Te IoT

    plays an important role in decision on crop and soil

    monitoring [16]. SM with IoT is the application of AI that

    supports farmers and food industries to capitalize on their

    economy, diminish the chances of ailment, and optimize

    uses of available assets. In these, sensors are deployed to

    sense the temperature of the soil, amount of nitrogen,

    phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) in soil, moisture level,

    the content of water, potential in soil, amount of photo-

    synthetic radiation, and oxygen level in soil [17]. Te col-

    lected data from the various sensors are again forwarded to

    the data centre point or the cloud for a proper decision so

    that adequate action can be taken timely. Te outcome of the

    analysis, visualization of received data, is helpful in resource

    utilization. Te identiﬁcation of the behaviour of the system

    requires identifying the trends of soil and making the del-

    icate decision to circumstances to get maximum crop yield

    and excellent products [16, 17]. Te agriculture-based IoT is

    called smart agriculture. Te IoT-based food industry is

    called the smart food industry.

    IoT-based agriculture is completely based on soil

    monitoring, weather forecasting, and crop monitoring. As it

    is known, weather and irrigation play a very crucial role in

    IoT-based agriculture. Te smart agriculture elucidations are

    also attached with an elegant atmosphere such as good air

    quality and a well-groomed watering system. Te commonly

    applicable sensors and types of measures considered by the

    respective sensors are given in Table 1.

    In the literature, so many studies [13–20] were found on

    smart farming and noticed that by using these modern tools,

    resources can be utilized in an optimized manner and the

    income can be maximized. Also, there are some speciﬁc

    Role of AI in food industry

    recognition technologies.

    By using AI in fertilizer management

    areas such as cannabis and hemp, soybeans, potato, al-

    monds, cherries, apples, and grapes yielding promising

    production by using smart farming.

    2.2.Robocrop. With the advancement in technology, the food

    industry is also using modern-technology-based tools so that

    production can be increased. One of the tools developed by

    the various research groups is called robocrop [18]. It is an AI-

    based robotic system that advances the yielding process by

    maximizing usefulness and uniformity. It conducts line up

    crop tools accurately and at a high rate. Te food industry

    product shrubbery forward of the system is monitored by a

    high-resolution and precise system. Te captured image is

    processed by a high-performing workstation to attend the

    maximum attentiveness of green band pixels relating to the

    crop line. Due to the outsized region captured by the input

    devices and the numerous processing line, an outstanding

    typical crop centre-line tracking is accomplished [19]. It

    evaluates the resultant image to a ground truth gridiron

    pattern with the crop line area. Te obtained information is

    then employed to align the instruments in the row via a

    hydraulic-based shift. Te pattern-based attribute builds the

    system very healthy besides backdrop pick over infestations. It

    improves the performance and production rate just because of

    multicameras and multiple sensors.

    In robocroping or agricultural automation, outstanding

    work has been carried out by various authors in the ﬁeld of

    harvesting robots [23–25] that has increased productivity

    considerably in recent decades. Tese systems became

    popular due to advancement and additional beneﬁts which

    are improved productivity and reduced labor force. Te

    previously published article [23] described the dual-arm

    harvesting robot which consists of dual arms arranged in an

    optimized manner. Tis dual-arm robot is suitable for fruit

    harvesting and based on SVM. In agricultural automation,

    robotic weeding facilitates weed control near or within crop

    rows automatically and eﬀectively. An image-processing-

    based system [24] was designed for identifying crop plants at

    various growth levels for robotic weeding control. In the list

    of existing systems, a speciﬁc system was developed for

    strawberry ﬂowers known as Adaptive Robotic Chassis

    (ARC) [25]. In that system, strawberry ﬂowers are captured

    by the installed camera and then processed. Finally, the

    desired coordinate has been obtained and the signiﬁcant

    actions are taken by the robot.

    Te performance of the robocrop completely depends on

    input image features. If the input image contains more

    dominant features, then it shows outstanding results. In

    every sample of an input image, the crop must present more

    shrubbery than the wildﬂower and the crop shrubbery

    should be near to the mean of the RGB colour band. A

    typical robocrop system consists of a robocrop console part,

    a hydraulic-based shaft, a three-point linkage frame, a high-

    deﬁnition camera, various types of speed sensors, an ADC

    adapter, and so on. Figure 3 shows one sample of robocrop

    picking fruits [19].

    2.3. Predictive Analytics. Learning models are developed to

    trail and forecast various environmental eﬀects on crop yield

    such as weather changes. For this, ML algorithms account

    for a very signiﬁcant role. ML algorithms in association with

    the satellites investigate crop sustainability, predict the

    weather, and assess farms to know about the existence of

    pests and diseases. Te model is very good at delivering high-

    standard data or information that is perpetually updated at a

    quick rate. Also, the organization is very much conﬁdent

    about the data it provides for its customers with admittance

    to more than one billion stacks of agronomic data regularly.

    Te data sources such as precipitation, wind speed, solar

    radiation, and temperature along with historical values are

    important for predictive analysis. Te obtained analysis

    accounts an important role for adequate scheduling and

    crop selection for particular agricultural land [20].

    FarmShots is a Raleigh, North Carolina-based AI start-

    up that focuses on analysing agricultural information de-

    rived from the pictures taken by drones and satellites. Te

    primary focus of the company is to detect pests, diseases, and

    reduced plant nutrition on farms [21]. In April 2017, the ﬁrm

    limited the free access of its products for John Deere’s

    customers via June 2017. With this collaboration, it is very

    much clear that John Deere is showing more interest in

    entering into agricultural tech freedom.

    3. Artificial Intelligence in Food

    Processing Industry

    In this section, authors are going to discuss the importance

    and application of diﬀerent areas of artiﬁcial intelligence

    such as pattern recognition, data science, deep learning,

    machine learning, and robotics in the food processing in-

    dustry. Along with food processing, the food handling

    industry is also important where AI plays a key role in

    handling the entire processing unit task. Tere are some

    important applications taken from the food processing and

    handling industry, as shown in Figure 4.

    3.1. Product Sorting and Packaging. In the food processing

    industry, the proper ordering and packaging of food

    products is one of the tedious tasks and time-taking pro-

    cesses for manufacturing units. Terefore, such a tedious

    task can be handled by AI-based systems so that the chance

    of error is minimized, and the production rate of the in-

    dustry is rapidly increased. Te development of AI-based

    systems is a challenging task due to the irregularities in

    shapes, colour, and sizes of vegetables and fruits. For de-

    veloping an AI-based sorting and packaging system, a large

    amount of data is needed so that the system is properly

    trained and performs the task in an eﬃcient manner [26, 27].

    Various research groups designed diﬀerent systems for the

    same task. One of them is TOMRA, which performs the

    sorting task in a very eﬃcient manner. It improved the

    production rapidly with the accuracy of 90%. In current

    situations, most of the product sorting and packaging tasks

    are performed by the automated system. By using such types

    of systems, industries gained some advantages such as faster

    production rate, high-quality yielding, and labor cost cut-

    ting. Figure 4 shows important applications taken from the

    food processing and handling industry.

    Te AI-based intelligent decision-making systems con-

    sist of various tools and methodologies, i.e., high-resolution

    cameras, laser-technology-based systems, X-ray-based sys-

    tems, and IR spectroscopy. Tese tools and technologies are

    used to analyze each and every aspect of the food products

    such as fruits and vegetables at the input channel. Con-

    ventional systems are only able to characterize good and bad

    products according to their appearance. By using TOMRA,

    it has been observed that the detaching and ordering

    problem can be improved by 5–10% in the case of potatoes

    only [28, 29]. Te same type of problem was also handled by

    a Japanese company that uses a TensorFlow ML-based

    system and also achieved a remarkable outcome and gained

    signiﬁcant beneﬁt in their assembling unit. Tis system

    achieved remarkable results for other food processing in-

    dustries also. In addition, each organization found that the

    AI-based system works more precisely. Te performance

    achieved for potatoes encourages the expansion of AI-based

    systems for others also. It can be further expanded for

    diﬀerent sections or departments of the food processing

    industry.

    3.2. Personal Health Sanitation. In the literature, it has been

    also found that diﬀerent countries across the globe such as

    the USA launched the food processing unit sanitation

    guideline. Such guidelines have also been taken care of by the

    AI-based systems. Initially, the KanKan and Shanghai

    municipal health agency worked together to develop an AI-

    based system. Te ﬁrst AI-based system is designed to grant

    object and facial recognition for an anonymous quantity.

    Te system is used to monitor individuals who are not

    following the guidelines [30]. If anything matches, then it

    can be resolved in real time without any delay. Te designed

    system shows very good results; therefore, it has been

    planned to expand the system for more and more

    organizations.

    3.3. Decision-Making System for Customers. In diﬀerent

    organizations, it is found that AI is not only helping food

    processing

    industries

    in

    developing

    various

    ﬂavor

    amalgamation but also assisting the customers in picking

    innovative essences [31]. In 2018, Kellog launched Bear-

    Naked-Custom that is most favorable for the customers

    to make their adapted granola from more than 50 con-

    stituents. With taking care of every individual, it records

    their ﬂavors, customer taste selection, and much more

    information. Such type of information is playing an

    important role for launching a new product into the

    market [31, 32]. Terefore, AI again played a good role in

    developing decision-making systems for customers.

    3.4. Equipment Cleaning and Maintenance. In food pro-

    cessing industries, proper cleaning and maintenance of

    processing tools are very much essential. Such a task can be

    easily handled by AI-based systems [33]. For implementing

    this, various sensors and cameras are deployed to perform

    the task. One product of Whitwell and Martec muscularly

    suﬀers that it can decrease to only 50%, which permits large

    eﬃciency and a lesser amount of time. Presently, Martec is

    trying to justify its AI-based cleaning place model. For this

    approach, Martec employs ultrasonic sensing imaging

    methods and optical ﬂuorescence methods to cultivate the

    obtained information to the AI system development [34]. It

    measures the remaining amount of food and microbial

    debris inside the machine. After releasing the entire report of

    the testing phase, the system will take stand.

    3.5. Launching New Products. Te launching of new prod-

    ucts for any production unit is a tedious task. Especially, in

    the case of food industries, it totally depends on the con-

    sumer’s interests. Terefore, the information collected by the

    various decision-making systems for customers is helpful for

    the launching of new products. Te collected information is

    processed by the ML-based module and then takes the

    proper decision for the product [2, 35]. By using an ML-

    based approach, questions such as “what customers are

    exactly looking out for” has been answered. Presently, nearly

    all the food processing industries and food product pack-

    aging industries are utilizing the power of artiﬁcial intelli-

    gence to expand and launch new products into the market.

    Previously, this work has been carried out through a case

    study or survey. Terefore, the success rate for the system is

    very low. Now, the entire scenario is changed, and AI and

    ML are prominently used for such types of tasks.

    In the entire region of the USA, a self-service soft drink

    corner has been installed by Coca-Cola. By using this,

    customers have the option to make thousands of drinks by

    adding minor variations in ﬂavors. Such type of activity has

    been recorded by the machine, and the rest of the analysis is

    performed by the ML and deep learning algorithms. By

    using these data, new products can be launched. Cherry

    sprite is the real time example of a product. It has been also

    suggested that, in the next coming decades, most of the food

    industries will take advantage of the recommendation sys-

    tem for developing new products.

    3.6. Demand-Supply Chain Management. As long as food

    industries are more worried about food safety policies, they

    are required to materialize more translucently regarding the

    pathway of food products in the supply chain system. To

    monitor every stage of the process AI is deployed [1]. It

    manages everything such as price control to inventory

    management. It also takes care of forecasting and moni-

    toring the pathway of possessions from where they are

    grown to the location where customers collect it. AI-based

    Symphony Retail provides the facility to book trans-

    portation, billing, and inventory management [36]. It also

    maintains the discipline and avoids getting plenty of

    commodities that end up in exhausted material.

    4. Data Analysis at Food Industry

    Te food-based industry is stuﬀed with a large number of

    well-established brands as well as food outlets. Due to the

    growing competition, this industry is losing its attraction for

    establishing a new business [37]. In the food industry, using

    technology, especially data science, is the only way which can

    make anyone stay upfront in the competition. Figure 5 gives

    the information regarding data analysis in the food industry.

    4.1. Customer Satisfaction. Ooshma Garg, the founding fa-

    ther of Gobble, shared a thought that a food industry can be

    phrased as a tech company. It was a disputable assertion for

    the rest of the world, but there’s some truth behind this

    [37, 38]. Data science has become a prerequisite in current

    technology-driven industries for elevating and maneuvering

    their diverse business practices. Gobble is a great example

    industry which completely relies on data science for predicting

    the supplies as well as the demand of its customers. It oﬀers its

    customers with ten-minute dinner kits and has more than

    thousands of regular customers with diﬀerent menu choices. It

    collects the data such as buying history, customer behavior,

    and feedback and food preference of diﬀerent time frames to

    ensure the readiness to meet the demands [39]. Gobble is a

    demand-driven example of a company that utilizes the arti-

    ﬁcial intelligence within the food industry and can surely serve

    as a blueprint for other businesses in their domain.

    4.2. Introducing New Recipes. A single recipe can be cooked

    in numerous ways by combining the ingredients. In addi-

    tion, the fact is that those ingredients can be cooked in some

    other ways which creates an area of endless possibilities to

    make cooking dishes. On the web, multiple recipes are

    available online and contain a huge dataset that allows the

    exploration of components in several cuisines from common

    man to professionals. Te researchers can determine the

    diﬀerences as well as the similarities between the diﬀerent

    cuisines [40]. For example, North American and Western

    European cuisines are totally based on the ingredients which

    contain the same ﬂavor of compounds that East-Asian and

    Southern-European cuisines avoid.

    In conclusion, the technologists can appraise which food

    components have a decent savor and mark a cuisine that is

    trendy in a few provinces. Tis basic understanding also

    permits artiﬁcial-intelligence-based algorithms to recom-

    mend the chefs with diﬀerent types of ingredient combi-

    nations that will surely result in broadening the menu as well

    as the proﬁts of a food industry.

    4.3. Reinventing Food Delivery. Online food outlets such as

    for Swiggy, Zomato, and Uber-eat have a large amount of

    data based on ordering patterns of their customers and dish

    preferences. Data science and AI can be utilized by the food-

    based professional for creating simpler, cost-eﬀective, and

    time-eﬃcient methods for delivering the product [41]. AI is

    beneﬁciating some existing industries with some valid

    chances for market domination. But still, it is nascent in the

    Journal of Food Quality

    5

    food industry and, therefore, needs more proﬁcient opti-

    mization by food companies as well so people can get their

    food with better services.

    5. Application of ML in the Restaurant Business

    Te application of ML and AI techniques is not limited to

    only making the automated system, robocrops, soil moni-

    toring, and new product launching. It can be also useful in

    the restaurant business for many numbers of services

    [42, 43]. Te list of applications of ML in restaurant business

    is given in Figure 6.

    5.1. AI-Based Customer Feedback System. Nowadays, there

    are many kinds of applications within the domain of food

    services which help in predicting the number and type of

    food being ordered as well as the relevant inventories. Tis

    information can be utilized for statistical analysis of visitor

    traﬃc and food items that would be needed during a period

    of time [43]. Such information is collected by combining the

    data of previous engagements with the customers, their food

    preferences, habits, and complaints, as well as supply of the

    required items during that period. Te result of collecting

    and analysing the information helps the food-service-based

    applications to secure more food orders from old as well as

    new customers, thus securing the consumer loyalty. More-

    over, it also helps in removing the loopholes and complaints

    that make these applications more fail-safe and reliable [44].

    Tere are some other applications which assist with the

    functionalities of the food-service-based applications such as

    the restaurant management framework, payment gateway

    applications, cloud-based big-data applications, and even the

    restaurant table booking platforms.

    5.2. Food-Vending Terminals and Applications. It has be-

    come the need of a food-selling ﬁrm to build a reliable

    system for providing its services online to the people after it

    decides its menu and marketing strategy. Tis system can be

    an online site that can provide the beneﬁt of fast ordering

    and recommendations or a mobile application that comes

    with added advantages such as incorporating an artiﬁcial-

    intelligence- (AI-) based system. Due to the emerging food-

    based e-commerce applications, it is a wise decision to enlist

    one’s food-selling ﬁrm to their repository [44]. It allows the

    ﬁrm to have best functionalities of these e-commerce

    applications without spending more money in developing

    the same for itself, although the amount of commission

    charged by the e-commerce can still lead the ﬁrm to develop

    it. AI can help in developing an automated customer-service

    segment that enables the ﬁrm to eﬃciently perform ad-

    ministrative tasks such as consumer grievance redressal,

    dispatching crews, and creating reports.

    5.3.AI-BasedOnlineRestaurantSearchEngine. It is observed

    that consumers often prefer a cafe, bar, or restaurant by

    comparing its ratings with competitors. Tus, it becomes

    important for an organization dealing in the food and

    beverage industry to know about the experience, either good

    or bad, from its customers to attract new customers or to

    avoid losing the old ones. Tese days, a large majority of

    customers are introduced to a food place via Google searches

    or another online medium. Tis fact is being utilized while

    recommending a customer with a preferred restaurant or

    cafe based on their locations and ratings with the help of AI

    [45]. Tese AI agents also help in notifying the customers

    about the oﬀers, events, or sales in their favorite food places.

    5.4. Voice Assistants. It is estimated that about 27% people

    preferred voice searching over conventional searching by

    typing. Due to this fact, the option of voice-based searching is

    being introduced into every food or other e-commerce in-

    dustry, while an entirely new area of voice commerce such as

    Alexa by Amazon has been developed. Tis feature can now be

    utilized by the restaurants to enable these voice commerce

    applications to make quick orders from them even without

    looking into details, and this is helpful for new restaurants [46].

    5.5. Self-Ordering Kiosk System. Te point-of-sale systems

    (or self-service systems) are popular among the customers,

    especially in well-established restaurants. Tese systems

    assist the customers with the ordering process by giving

    them detailed information about the ﬂavors or spices used,

    their preferences, and even the newly added items. Tese

    systems are now being adopted by every restaurant which

    incorporates automated systems. Tis technology has helped

    the restaurants in dealing with problems such as manpower

    shortages, customer engagements, and inaccurate orders.

    5.6. Robotics for the Food Industry. With the advancements

    of AI, it has become possible to utilize the eﬃciency of

    robotics in the food-based industries, although it has not

    been adopted on a large scale yet. Tere are a wide range of

    robotics that are being used in various areas of the food

    industry such as drones in food delivery and robotic arm on

    processing the food [18, 19]. However, as the cost of in-

    troducing these technologies in the food-based industry is

    higher than employing the manpower, these technologies

    are not being adopted. Some recent innovations in robotics

    are delivery drones and bots being used by “7-Eleven”

    convenience stores, “Flippy”: a two-arm robot for frying and

    packing the burger patties.

    5.7. Revenue Prediction Using ML. For a running business

    such as a restaurant and food outlet, the quality of food and

    services given by the owners is very important. Apart from

    the service and food, the prediction of sales output of the

    restaurant is also an essential part of the business. Te owner

    of the food chains or restaurants needs to compile a strong

    business plan for their future operations for better business

    growth and more proﬁt. In artiﬁcial intelligence, multiple

    ﬁtting algorithms can be used to create a sales forecast [47].

    In the food industry, ﬁnding a suitable ﬁtting algorithm for

    the sales prediction, i.e., for ﬁve months’ sales prediction or

    14 months’ sale prediction, requires a huge time and

    seamless eﬀorts. In this era of data science, it is possible to get

    sales predictions on ﬁngertips. Data science allows ﬁnding

    the best suitable algorithm for a particular business and easy

    deployment of the algorithm in the same business with a

    perfect AI development team.

    5.8. ML in Food Delivery. Machine Learning (ML) can help

    in eﬃciently solving the problems such as deciding the

    delivery routes, supply of raw materials, predicting the

    demands of certain food items, and planning the logistics

    [48]. Te delivery route problems can be solved with ML by

    optimizing the location of the delivery agent with current or

    upcoming traﬃc situations and then notifying them about

    the best route in a synchronous manner. By ensuring the

    eﬃcient and timely delivery, it becomes easier to provide

    constant orders and to even deal with problems such as

    running out of delivery agents or late deliveries. Moreover,

    by incorporating the ML, the scale of collected data increases

    with time which can later be analyzed using other artiﬁcial-

    intelligence-based algorithms for developing a more intel-

    ligent system. Such analysis could be performed using more

    advanced AI-based techniques such as deep learning (DL)

    that provide an added advantage over the competitors.

    6. Artificial Intelligence in Food Safety

    Due to the sterile nature of robots, it is widely acceptable in

    food processing industries. Tis feature is a huge factor in

    decreasing the number of foodstuﬀ-related diseases. Te

    Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) has drafted stricter

    hygienic necessities, which is applicable for complete supply

    chain systems. Te cause behind it is cereals, spices, and

    other food products that do not need refrigerators and they

    are in the most prone area of contamination. Formerly, such

    food products were free from contamination, but now, the

    scenario is entirely changed. For these types of problems, AI-

    based systems can surely help to resolve the problem. Tey

    are free from transferring illnesses as a human can do.

    However, the maintenance of an AI-based system is simple

    and easy [2, 49]. According to the report published by

    Technavio, the implementation of robots in food processing

    industries will lift up by 30% and also fulﬁll the government’s

    demands. Tere are also some new revolutionary inventions

    by using artiﬁcial intelligence in food safety approaches that

    are anticipated to become well-known soon. Tey have the

    major objective to plummeting the frequency of food-borne

    diseases. Figure 7 shows artiﬁcial intelligence in food safety.

    6.1. Next-Generation Sequencing and Electric Noses. Te two

    most promising inventions in the food industry are next-

    generation sequencing (NGS) and electric noses (ENs). NGS

    replaces the DNA approach in the food security region very

    quickly. Te introduction of AI-based automated systems

    and workﬂows helped formulate data acquisition and lab-

    oratory trials much quicker and more accurately than ever.

    Te NGS can ﬁnd hazardous inclination very quickly and

    eﬃciently. It can also prevent the infection epidemics before

    the impairment of an ample amount of people. ENs are

    mainly the surrogate for a person muzzle in fabrication

    surroundings. Some sensors are placed that can precisely

    identify a diversity of smells. Tese sensors just sense the

    smell around the surroundings, and sensed data are

    transferred to a data center where ML algorithms access

    these data [49, 50]. According to the decision made by the

    ML-based system, an alarm signal is transferred to the

    manufacturing units. Terefore, EN can be the upcoming

    future of food products safety.

    6.2. Food Waste Management. Te report published by the

    Department of Agriculture, USA, declares that, “In the

    United States, food waste is estimated at between 30 and 40%

    of the food supply. Tis estimate, based on estimates from

    the USDA’s Economic Research Service of 31 percent food

    loss at the retail and consumer levels, corresponded to

    approximately 133 billion pounds and $161 billion worth of

    food in 2010. Tis amount of waste has far-reaching impacts

    on the society.”

    According to McKinsey, AI can resolve such type of

    issues and disengage huge amount of opening by dipping

    food waste by the 2030. Such surprising statistics can be

    accomplished by launching supplementary regenerative

    leisure farming practices [51]. It shows that humans are not

    utilizing the available resources eﬃciently. Te traditional

    methods of farming can be replaced by the smarter farming

    methods. In this, various sensors are deployed and collect

    the information. Te collected information is processed with

    ML algorithms, and then appropriate decisions are taken. By

    using these, farmers can make decisions the fastest and

    accurate. Here are some suggested ways to reduce the food

    waste with AI:

    Journal of Food Quality

    7

    (i) While several elucidations examine the maturity of

    the fruits, others stature out what microorganisms

    can boost fruits and vegetables development not

    including the participation of artiﬁcial fertilizers.

    (ii) Manufacturers can acquire purge of ground ex-

    amination, gaining from compensation of the ar-

    tiﬁcial intelligence that will keep a considerable

    amount of capital.

    (iii) Te farm-based food supply chain management

    uses computer vision technology to manage and

    examine each process; then, the food waste will be

    decreased rapidly.

    (iv) Artiﬁcial-intelligence-based food tracking systems

    will enable us to sell food ahead of it turning into

    waste. By using this, more farmers and people can

    connect for buying the food products.

    Te major challenges to execute such types of ideas in

    reality cannot be conveyed by one organization and one

    body of the system. Te entire food industry needs to be

    altered. A complete association of associates is required to

    work together to make an eﬃcient system which signiﬁ-

    cantly blows on the entire globe.

    7. TheRemunerationofArtificialIntelligencein

    the Food Industry

    Tere are a few advantages of artiﬁcial intelligence in food

    industries listed as follows:

    (i) In recent times, almost all food processing indus-

    tries are unquestioning AI to advance the demand-

    supply chain management, meticulous logistics, and

    predictive analysis, as well as to add precision in the

    system.

    (ii) Digitization of the demand-supply chain manage-

    ment systems eventually compels returns and oﬀers

    a superior appreciation of the circumstances. Ar-

    tiﬁcial intelligence can examine massive amounts of

    data that are far from human potential.

    (iii) AI helps industry to diminish the time to market-

    place and improve agreement with suspicions.

    (iv) Automated ordering will positively decrease labor

    expenses, enlarge the pace of the manufacturing,

    and advance the excellence of products.

    8. TheFutureApplicationofAIinFoodIndustry

    After the investigation of the literature in the food industry,

    it can be observed that there is a need for a signiﬁcant

    amount

    of

    investment

    in

    the

    food

    processing

    and

    manufacturing industry. By applying AI, systems can easily

    identify various issues in food production than man-based

    systems. It has also been noticed that researchers are

    prominently working on this sector. Gayama, an agrotech

    ﬁrm based in Switzerland, is an excellent example of one

    such ﬁrm that has raised a sum of $3.2 million for an ar-

    tiﬁcial-intelligence-driven project. Te project is based on

    hyperspectral cameras that are able to distinguish a minor

    ﬂuctuation in water intensities, nourishment, vermin, and

    crop yields. Ten, the artiﬁcial intelligence process ﬁnds

    possible intimidation and generates alert signals to farmers

    so that they can plan accordingly. Te artiﬁcial intelligence

    process will also recommend convincing measures that

    farmers must get to preeminent use of available resources.

    By using ML and deep learning methods [52, 53], Earth’s

    surface can be also analyzed by satellite data. Te main

    intention is to discover spaces that would use some facility

    from the government or its shareholders for improving the

    crop that can improve the outcome.

    It has also been observed that the farming is immobile

    and old fashioned in many sections of the entire globe. It

    could be replaced with smart farming in the near future. AI

    has a possibility to implement smart farming and solve the

    existing crisis somehow in the coming future. Successful

    implementation of smart farming could enhance the yields

    by at least 60%. ML and AI are promising techniques, but

    there will be prosperity of solutions to eradicate waste in

    food production industries.

    For example, 77 Lab has previously launched elegant

    bots that can select food stuﬀ directly from the plant,

    eradicating the uselessness of manual labor. Tere were so

    many self-assisted pickers in history, but these elegant bots

    are using machine learning or deep learning and can decide

    the height of maturity of any fruit, recognize fruits from

    diﬀerent plants in a healthier manner, and handle fruits

    more precisely. So, these are the future of upcoming farming

    or food processing industries.

    9. Conclusions

    Tis study presented the various facts to indicate the ad-

    vantages and implementation of AI for the food businesses

    in a precise manner. In the current scenario, the food in-

    dustry is utilizing the basic level of artiﬁcial intelligence.

    Every day the role of AI is becoming vital due to its capability

    to escalate hygiene, food protection, and waste management

    system. In the future, AI is going to transform the food

    processing industry because it has so much potential to

    generate reasonable and healthier productivity for clients

    and employees. Te employment of AI and ML in food

    production and eatery businesses is already taking the

    \ products is anticipated to \nincrease rapidly in the next few decades, fuelled\
    \ by a growing \nworld population and greater per capita income1–3. However, \n\
    biotic and abiotic environmental stresses, such as plant pathogens, \nsudden fluctuations\
    \ in temperature, drought, soil salinity and toxic \nmetal pollution, impair crop\
    \ productivity and lead to significant \nlosses in agricultural yield worldwide4,5.\
    \ Crop pathogens and insect \npests alone cause an estimated global yield loss\
    \ of 11–30% for five \nmajor crops of global importance—wheat, rice, maize, potato\
    \ and \nsoybean—with the highest crop losses observed in regions already \nsuffering\
    \ from food insecurity6,7. The effects of climate change, \nwhich increase the\
    \ frequency of extreme weather and plant disease \noutbreaks, impose additional\
    \ pressure on agricultural innovation to \nmeet the growing demand8–11. Against\
    \ this backdrop, there has been \nan increasing demand for sustainable agricultural\
    \ practices to pro-\nduce crops with higher yield and quality12–14. Farming in\
    \ controlled \nenvironments, such as urban containers or rooftop farms, has dem-\n\
    onstrated that the throughput of plant biomass can be significantly \nincreased\
    \ via the control of microclimates15,16. It has been noted that \nthe outbreak\
    \ of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 serves as a humble \nreminder of the pivotal\
    \ role that urban farms can play in mitigating \nfood supply disruptions within\
    \ a city17. The growing importance of \nagriculture to meet the global food demand\
    \ requires a concomitant \nincrease in our understanding of how plants grow and\
    \ adapt outside \nof the laboratory for these farming practices to be effective.\n\
    During the past few decades, significant progress has been \nmade in understanding\
    \ plant growth, signalling pathways and their \nadaptive responses to environmental\
    \ stresses in the model plant \nArabidopsis thaliana18–20. Detailed genomic data\
    \ and quantitative \ntrait loci (QTL) can be found in global repositories such\
    \ as The \nArabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR)21, providing a wealth of \n\
    resources that enable versatile manipulation of A. thaliana genes to \nstudy plant\
    \ development and physiology22,23. Transgenic plants with \ngenetically encoded\
    \ biosensors allow for in vivo study of the dynam-\nics of plant signalling molecules,\
    \ which can be monitored with \nimaging platforms in a laboratory setting24. While\
    \ these advances \nhave been instrumental in advancing our understanding of plant\
    \ \nscience, our knowledge of plant behaviour in the field remains \nmore limited.\
    \ This is primarily due to the difficulty in extending \ngenetic engineering approaches\
    \ to study agriculturally important \nplants, and the dearth of alternative tools\
    \ to probe the internal plant \nstate25,26. Current genomic data in A. thaliana\
    \ or unicellular green \nalgae such as Chlamydomonas often cannot be used to predict\
    \ or \nrepresent the complexities in agriculturally relevant crops27. There \n\
    are genomic resources available for model crops such as rice (Oryza \nsativa),\
    \ maize (Zea mays) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum)28–30, \nbut these denote\
    \ only a handful of families and do not sufficiently \nrepresent the biodiversity\
    \ of crops31. In addition, studying the sig-\nnalling pathways and physiology\
    \ of these crops under variable field \nconditions remains a longstanding challenge32.\
    \ Measuring the level \nand temporal dynamics of metabolites in these crops typically\
    \ relies \non mass spectrometry-based techniques33–35. These methods are \ndestructive\
    \ and require laborious processing of multiple samples \nof plants per data point.\
    \ Transcriptomic data of crops under field \nconditions remain scarce due to the\
    \ complexity of such studies36. \nThese challenges create a gap between our detailed\
    \ understand-\ning of model plants and important agricultural targets for humans,\
    \ \ncontributing to our fragmentary knowledge of the underpinning \nSpecies-independent\

    \ approaches are urgently required to alleviate the growing pressure on agriculture\

    \ crops cultivated in fields or production facilities. This \nPerspective highlights\
    \ the recent development of new analytical tools that are rapid and non-destructive\
    \ and provide tissue-, \ncell- or organelle-specific information on living plants\
    \ in real time, with the potential to extend across multiple species in field\
    \ \napplications. We evaluate the utility of engineered plant nanosensors and\
    \ portable Raman spectroscopy to detect biotic and \nabiotic stresses, monitor\
    \ plant hormonal signalling as well as characterize the soil, phytobiome and crop\
    \ health in a non- or \nminimally invasive manner. We propose leveraging these\
    \ tools to bridge the aforementioned fundamental gap with new synthe-\nsis and\
    \ integration of expertise from plant biology, engineering and data science. Lastly,\

    \ adapt and grow in agri-\ncultural conditions.\nIn recent years, there has been\
    \ significant progress towards \nnew innovative tools which can be applied to\
    \ probe the spatiotem-\nporal profile of plant chemical signals in model and non-model\
    \ \nplants alike, providing a potential mechanistic bridge between \nthe two.\
    \ Such species-independent platforms can also be applied \nnon-destructively and\
    \ thus enable real-time investigation of plant \nphysiology and signalling. This\
    \ Perspective reviews the underly-\ning elements of such next-generation tools\
    \ and discusses how they \ncan bridge the gap between model plants in the laboratory\
    \ and field \napplication for agriculturally relevant plants. We also provide\
    \ a \nfuture outlook for the integration of these tools with existing tech-\n\
    nologies to transform crop improvement and highlight what needs \nto be done to\
    \ increase the utility and accessibility of these tools to \nthe end-users.\n\
    Limitations in current plant phenotyping tools\nRecent advances in imaging systems\
    \ have led to the development \nof field-based phenotyping platforms to collect\
    \ high-throughput \ntrait measurements over a large field of view37–39. With these\
    \ sys-\ntems, plants’ physical and physiological features can be interrogated\
    \ \nnon-destructively40. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) now allow \nplant phenotyping\
    \ and disease monitoring at the spatial resolution \nof an individual plant41,42.\
    \ They can be paired with portable ana-\nlytical devices and smartphone-based\
    \ platforms to provide remote \nsensing data43,44. These technologies are currently\
    \ being used to \nextract information about crop health and environmental stresses\
    \ \nbased on plant trait measurement in terms of chlorophyll con-\ncentration,\
    \ water potential, leaf area and temperature45–48. While \nfield-based phenotyping\
    \ platforms convey useful information about \ncrop health status and can be applied\
    \ over a large area, their effective \nimplementation often requires clear phenotypic\
    \ manifestation that \nhas already altered the plants’ spectral profile. The time\
    \ lag between \nstress perception and phenotypic changes required for detection\
    \ \nmay render timely intervention difficult and reduce the effective-\nness of\
    \ management decisions for certain or specific types of stress \nconditions. For\
    \ instance, the measurement of hyperspectral images \nusing drones may only show\
    \ a warning when plants are already \ndehydrated or infected49. Yang et al. evaluated\
    \ several examples of \nhigh-throughput phenotypic screening applied in A. thaliana\
    \ or \ncrops50. These methods include ground-based phenotyping in the \nfield\
    \ (for example, crop phenology recording system (CPRS)51 and \nfield scanalyzer52),\
    \ remote sensing via drones, post-harvest pheno-\ntyping (for example, seed-evaluation\
    \ accelerator (SEA)53 and phe-\nnoSeeder54) and pocket phenotyping. Most of these\
    \ methods were \ndetermined to be too costly at present, of low measuring speed\
    \ in \ntheir current form or of limited resolution. In addition, they still \n\
    rely on phenotypic changes such as a decrease in chlorophyll con-\ncentration\
    \ and plant water potential, both of which can be caused \nby manifold stress\
    \ types55. This type of detection method therefore \nlacks specificity, and early\
    \ intervention to remediate the specific \nstresses remains challenging.\nAnother\
    \ potential issue with the deployment of remote sensor \ntechnologies in a field\
    \ setting is the question of how many sensor \ndata points is enough to obtain\
    \ a statistically representative view of \nthe field. Varella et al. described\
    \ the use of data acquisition within \nthe precision farming context in a regular\
    \ grid as well as directed \ngrid format, depending on the end goal and applications56.\
    \ Images \ncollected by remote sensors make it possible to obtain a great deal\
    \ of \ninformation about specific ‘targets’ on the surface, including quali-\n\
    tative and quantitative aspects, such as shape, geographical context, \ntemporal\
    \ behaviour, size, physical properties, intrinsic aspects and/\nor state-specific\
    \ factors. However, data management is still chal-\nlenging, and calibration is\
    \ almost always required to adjust for \nchanges in canopy structure, camera geometries,\
    \ incident sunlight \nangle and other uncontrollable environmental factors43.\
    \ The large \nimage data also necessitates complex data interpretation, limiting\
    \ \nthe automation of image processing57. Most commercial image anal-\nysis software\
    \ and its built-in algorithms are not open source and \ncannot be modified easily\
    \ across different platforms50. As such, they \nare often not accessible in their\
    \ current form to smaller farms58, and \nthe underlying concern of whether these\
    \ techniques are capable of \nearly diagnosis of stresses or nutrient deficiency\
    \ persists.\nSpecies-independent tools for early detection of plant \nstresses\n\
    Plants transmit various biotic and abiotic stress signals to reprogram \nthe cellular\
    \ transcriptional machinery and metabolic responses to \nenhance their fitness\
    \ under stress59. Here, we briefly review two \ndifferent technologies for monitoring\
    \ these stress signals: nano-\nsensors for measurements within the plant organs\
    \ and electrical \nsensors for measuring surface biopotentials. Both of these\
    \ sensors \nmonitor stress signals at short time-scales—from seconds to min-\n\
    utes. At intermediate time-scales, the stress response manifests as \nchanges\
    \ in metabolites. Here, we consider spectroscopic monitoring \nof metabolites\
    \ within the plant and volatile organics that the plants \nproduce within hours\
    \ as part of their stress response. While some \nbiotic stresses such as vector-borne\
    \ viruses and vascular pathogens \nrequire only a short window for infection with\
    \ very limited man-\nagement options60,61, the information obtained from nanoscale\
    \ and \nspectroscopic measurements may be used to aid remediation strate-\ngies\
    \ to mitigate certain stresses such as water and nutrient availabil-\nity, as\
    \ well as moderate changes in the abiotic environment.\nPerception of stress stimuli\
    \ involves the propagation of \nshort-lived signalling molecules, such as reactive\
    \ oxygen species \n(ROS) and intracellular calcium (Ca2+), and phytohormones,\
    \ such \nas jasmonates, salicylates, auxins, gibberellins and abscisic acid62–64.\
    \ \nSignal transduction triggers a cascade of transcriptional repro-\ngramming\
    \ that changes cellular development, plant growth and \nbehaviour65,66. Key signalling\
    \ molecules and phytohormones are \nconserved across species, albeit with potentially\
    \ different spatio-\ntemporal dynamics67–70. Monitoring the evolution of plant\
    \ signal-\nling molecules as they are generated upon stress perception has the\
    \ \npotential to enable early diagnostics of environmental or biological \nstressors.\
    \ If these indicators can be intercepted before the manifes-\ntation of stress-induced\
    \ phenotypic changes, there is potential for \nintervention to prevent the yield\
    \ loss and reduction in crop quality. \nThis will necessarily depend on the type\
    \ and magnitude of stress as \nwell as the availability of management options.\
    \ While detecting a \nstatic concentration of a signalling molecule may give an\
    \ indication \nof plant health, such information is not as useful as the concentra-\n\
    tion profile of the signalling molecule in space and time. Hence, \nto develop\
    \ an effective tool capable of studying plant physiology \nand reporting stress\
    \ events, both the sensitivity and the temporal \nresolution of the platform have\
    \ to be considered. In addition, these \ntools have to be stable in terms of their\

    \ not amenable to genetic modification75. We recently \ndemonstrated the application\
    \ of SWNT to study stress-induced \nhydrogen peroxide (H2O2) signalling waves\
    \ in seven different plant \nspecies76. Nanosensors were embedded into leaf mesophyll\
    \ cells via \nneedleless syringe infiltration. Upon contact with H2O2, the nano-\n\

    \ The wave characteristics of the H2O2 signalling  \npathway probed by the nanosensors\
    \ were found to be different \nacross species and specific for the stresses that\

    \ been shown to detect \nexogenously introduced glucose in A. thaliana and algae\
    \ C. zeylan-\nica79. The information obtained by SWNT- and quantum dot-based \n\
    nanosensors can further be conveyed using a portable Raspberry \nPi-based camera\
    \ and platform at remote distances. Fluorescent car-\nbon dots have emerged as\
    \ a promising substitute to conventional \nquantum dots due to their excellent\
    \ biocompatibility80. Carbon dots \nhave been used to detect heavy metal pollution\
    \ in the cell walls of \nonion81. While these studies were conducted in laboratory\
    \ settings, \nthey highlight proven possibilities for next-generation technologies\
    \ \nto empower future agricultural practices.\nAn emerging class of sensor technologies\
    \ that can be conve-\nniently applied to monitor plant growth and dynamics is\
    \ wear-\nable sensors. The measurement of bioelectric potential changes in \n\
    plants can be used to detect changes in environmental factors such \nas atmospheric\
    \ pressure, temperature, humidity and light inten-\nsity82. Ochiai et al. compared\
    \ commercially available boron-doped \ndiamond (BDD), silver and platinum plate\
    \ electrodes for measur-\ning electrochemical signals in potted Opuntia hybrid\
    \ plants and \nalso in three different ground-planted trees83. The BDD electrodes\
    \ \nwere found to be 4–7 times more sensitive to bioelectric potential \nchanges\
    \ in potted Opuntia hybrid plants compared to platinum or \nsilver electrodes.\
    \ Similarly, for ground-planted trees, where bioelec-\ntric potential change was\
    \ induced by changing temperature and \nhumidity for months without replacing,\
    \ removing or changing elec-\ntrodes, BDD electrodes were 5–10 times more sensitive\
    \ than plati-\nnum electrodes. Thus, the BDD electrode-based monitoring system\
    \ \nhas the potential to measure live plant growth and may represent \na promising\
    \ warning system for suddenly changing environmental \nconditions.\nThe stress\
    \ signals that have been discussed previously in this \nsection trigger metabolic\
    \ responses in the plant. Metabolomics \nis becoming increasingly common in plant\
    \ physiology and bio-\nchemistry, and to date has been applied to studies dealing\
    \ with \nplant stresses including water, temperature, light, nutrient, oxida-\n\
    tive and biotic stresses84–87. To identify, quantify and character-\nize metabolites\
    \ requires high-throughput analytical technologies. \nSeveral techniques including\
    \ gas chromatography–mass spectrom-\netry (GC–MS), liquid chromatography (LC)–MS,\
    \ capillary electro-\nphoresis (CE)–MS and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy\
    \ \n(NMR) are commonly used in plant metabolomics research88–91. \nUnfortunately,\
    \ these widely used techniques require sample prepa-\nration and are not suitable\
    \ for in vivo monitoring of metabolites. If \nour goal is to monitor plant stress\
    \ to optimize crop yield, techniques \nthat require destruction of the plant and\
    \ lengthy sample preparation \nfail to realize the potential of metabolomics to\
    \ provide real-time \nphenotypic signatures.\nRaman spectroscopy enables non-destructive\
    \ biochemical detec-\ntion capable of interrogating multiple molecular species\
    \ simultane-\nously. As an optical tool, Raman spectroscopy can be considered\
    \ \nas an extension of the imaging techniques that are already widely \ndeployed\
    \ in field-based phenotyping. However, Raman spectros-\ncopy allows for significantly\
    \ greater chemical specificity. To date, \nseveral groups have applied Raman spectroscopy\
    \ for monitoring \nbiotic and abiotic stresses. Early reports utilize Raman spectroscopy\
    \ \nfor measurements of metabolites such as carotenoids and antho-\ncyanins as\
    \ markers for abiotic stress in plants—including drought, \nsaline, light and\
    \ heat stress92. Similarly, the carotenoid peaks were \nobserved as early stress\
    \ markers for viral infections93. While these \nstudies were performed on a few\
    \ specimens of an ornamental \nplant (coleus lime or Abutilon hybridum), we can\
    \ imagine that a \nhigh-throughput tool for monitoring plant stress in real time\
    \ could \nbenefit both plant biologists and farmers. Indeed, we have recently\
    \ \nobserved the nitrate peak in vegetable crops using NIR Raman \nspectroscopy94.\
    \ Early diagnosis and specific diagnosis of nitrogen \ndeficiency was observed\
    \ in A. thaliana as well pak choi (Brassica \nrapa chinensis) and choy sum (Brassica\
    \ rapa var. parachinensis). \nIn all cases, the nitrate Raman line was observed\
    \ to decrease well \nbefore any changes in leaf reflectance or chlorophyll concentration\
    \  \n(Fig. 1d–f). These changes were observed early enough for nitrogen \naddition\
    \ to recover the full yield of the leafy vegetables. Similarly, \nearly detection\
    \ of infection in important crop species by Raman \nspectroscopy has progressed\
    \ rapidly in the last few years95. Since \nRaman is probing the optical properties\
    \ of the plant leaf, it will \nlikely be feasible to perform these measurements\
    \ remotely from dis-\ntances as great as 100 m (refs. 96,97). As the cost of Raman\
    \ hardware \ndeclines, metabolite measurements could become an everyday part \n\
    of agriculture and the food supply—from farm to market to table.\nPlants also\
    \ emit characteristic volatile organic compounds \n(VOCs), which play a pivotal\
    \ role in plant growth, communication \nand defence98,99. VOC profiling can give\
    \ an indication of the health \nstatus of high-value commodity crops and provide\
    \ new insights into \ninterplant and plant-to-insect communication100. Polymeric\
    \ sor-\nbent traps are usually employed to concentrate VOCs before they \nare\
    \ sent to the laboratory for thermal desorption and analysis with \nMS-based systems101.\
    \ A trace amount of VOCs can be detected with \nthis platform, but it requires\
    \ bulky and expensive instrumentation \nfor direct in-field analysis100. Zheng\
    \ et al. recently introduced the \nintegration of plasmonic nanoparticles in a\
    \ smartphone-based VOC \nfingerprinting platform for the detection of Phytophthora\
    \ infestans \nin tomato plants102. The sensor array is composed of gold nanoparti-\n\
    cles with different aspect ratios which aggregate upon VOC contact, \ntriggering\
    \ a change in their colorimetric profile. When tested in a \ngreenhouse setting,\
    \ the smartphone-based sensor array was able to \ncapture the pathogen-induced\
    \ VOC changes in tomato leaves as \nearly as two days post-infection before visible\
    \ symptoms appeared. \nIn another demonstration, Fong et al. reported a SWNT-based\
    \ \nchemiresistive sensor capable of detecting 15 ppb concentration of \nethylene\
    \ within seconds of exposure103. Ethylene is an important \nVOC that is central\
    \ to the regulation of plant development, ranging \nfrom seed germination to fruit\
    \ ripening and senescence. The sensor \nwas able to monitor dynamic changes in\
    \ trace amounts of ethylene \nduring the senescence of carnation and lisianthus\
    \ flowers. Artificial \nelectronic nose (E-nose) platforms are also being developed\
    \ for \nrapid, non-invasive monitoring of plant VOCs104. They comprise of \na\
    \ sensor array, signal conditioning circuit and pattern recognition \nalgorithms.\
    \ However, issues related to selectivity and the effect of \nenvironmental conditions\
    \ necessitates further improvement to such \nsensor systems for optimal detection.\
    \ VOC sensors do not need to \nbe implanted within the plant tissues, but they\
    \ have to show high \nsensitivity to capture trace amounts of VOCs commonly emitted\
    \ by \nplants. In addition, their long-term stability, reproducibility, struc-\n\
    tural integrity and robustness will have to be considered for in-field \nanalysis.\n\
    New opportunities afforded by species-independent tools\nWe propose that the newly\
    \ developed tools introduced above can \nfacilitate a new understanding of crop\
    \ behaviour and dynamics \nin agricultural settings. The adoption of the aforementioned\
    \ tech-\nnologies in the study of model plants and their genetic variants \ncan\
    \ help validate the utility of these tools. In addition, they can \nalso complement\
    \ research in plant biology, especially in instances \nwhere genetically encoded\
    \ biosensors are limited in utility; for \nexample, in multiplexing and imaging\
    \ of various molecules simul-\ntaneously. CRISPR–Cas9 systems, especially those\
    \ that can pro-\nduce transgene-free genome-edited crops and thus circumvent \n\
    regulatory concerns in many countries105,106, could also be used in \nconcert\
    \ with advanced analytical technologies to aid trait identifica-\ntion and alteration\
    \ for improved crop performance. Enhancing our \nbasic understanding of plant\
    \ science can bridge the gap between \nmodel and non-model plants, and ultimately\
    \ help to extend the \napplicability of these tools for plants outside of laboratory\

    \ \ntools, can potentially allow the extension of findings across spe-\ncies (Fig.\
    \ 2a). This can yield new insights previously inaccessible \nthrough traditional\
    \ plant biology approaches. For example, the \nspeed and characteristics of a\
    \ wound-induced H2O2 wave probed \nby nanosensors appeared to be controlled by\
    \ the antioxidant capac-\nity of different plant species76. Machine-learning algorithms\
    \ can be \nsimilarly applied to the readings obtained by nanosensors or spec-\n\
    troscopy tools to predict plant behaviour across species107.\nAnother potential\
    \ opportunity of these newly developed tools \nis afforded by their ability to\
    \ probe systemic signalling within the \nplants, often in real time. As these\
    \ technologies are non-destructive \nand can be used to extract information from\
    \ the plants at a \nwhole-plant resolution, we can study how local stimuli induce\
    \ \nthe propagation of signals from one organ or organelle to another \nwithin\

    conventional methods, such as analysis by high-performance liq-\nuid chromatography/gas\
    \ chromatography and serological assays, \ndifficult100. By contrast, field-deployable\
    \ miniaturized sensors could \nbe cost-effective diagnostic tools to monitor plant\
    \ health and devel-\nopment. The use of engineered nanoparticles, located within\
    \ the \nplant tissues and subcellular compartments, may enable biochemi-\ncal\
    \ pathways to be studied selectively with a greater precision and \nat a shorter\
    \ timescale than existing approaches71,110. Decoding plant \nsignalling pathways\
    \ non-destructively for agriculturally important \nplants as well as model systems\
    \ ubiquitously explored in plant biol-\nogy will lead to radically new agricultural\
    \ technologies: from rapid \nplant phenotyping to early diagnostics of plant health\
    \ status.\nIn addition, the physical and chemical properties of nanopar-\nticles\
    \ can also be engineered to tune their localization within plant \ncells. Nanoparticles\
    \ with dimensions below the size exclusion limit \nof the cell wall (~20–50 nm)\
    \ have the ability to access the plant \ncell interior111. It has been shown that\
    \ the zeta potential and size \nof nanoparticles govern their subcellular localization\
    \ within plant \ncells, enabling the specific targeting of various compartments\
    \ such \nas the chloroplasts and the cytosol75,112,113. Furthermore, targeting\
    \ \nmoieties can be grafted onto the surface of nanostructures to direct \ntheir\
    \ localization to the nucleus, mitochondria or other organelles \nwithin a plant\
    \ cell114,115. While these strategies can be rationally \nemployed to control\
    \ nanoparticle transport into specific organelles, \nbiomolecules present in the\
    \ plant biological environment can rap-\nidly adsorb onto nanoparticle surfaces\
    \ in an energetically favour-\nable process and alter the nanoparticle surface\
    \ characteristics116,117. \nThe new corona formation due to adsorbed proteins\
    \ can unpredict-\nably change nanoparticle identity and localization118,119. The\
    \ inter-\naction between proteins and other biomolecules on nanoparticle \ncorona\
    \ formation in the plant biological environment needs to be \nfurther investigated.\
    \ The targeted delivery of nanosensors to differ-\nent plant organelles will help\
    \ elucidate the subcellular dynamics of \nsignalling molecules within model plants\
    \ as well as agriculturally \nrelevant crops. The ability to precisely deliver\
    \ nanosensors to spe-\ncific plant compartments can also enable multiplexing of\
    \ different \nmolecules to help untangle the complex interplay of plant signalling\
    \ \npathways.\nIn addition to monitoring the phytohormones and/or other \ngrowth-promoting\
    \ metabolites, we also propose a holistic approach \nto apply multi-dimensional\
    \ spectral analyses to the phytobiome and \nthe soil or rhizospheric microbiome,\
    \ both of which are important \ncontributors to plant phenotypes and crop yields.\
    \ The crop yield is \na complex phenotype, and such tripartite interactions that\
    \ consider \nplant metabolism, soil and microbiota not only influence proper \n\
    growth and development in plants, but also the overall health and \nmetabolic\
    \ resilience. Microbiota associated with the rhizosphere \nand phyllosphere contribute\
    \ significantly to plant growth and to tol-\nerance or resistance to biotic and\
    \ abiotic stresses120–122. Probing the \nplant-associated microbiome community\
    \ can provide a wealth of \ninformation about the crop development and health123–125.\
    \ The fluo-\nrescent nanosensors described in the previous section can be easily\
    \ \ninterfaced within a fibre optic platform, creating an electrode-like \nor\
    \ optode probe for the detection of local nutrients, pollutants and \nspecific\
    \ microorganisms in the soil. In this configuration, nanosen-\nsors are mounted\
    \ at the tip of an optical fibre which performs both \nthe excitation and signal\
    \ collection for fluorescence monitoring, as \nwe and others have shown recently126,127.\
    \ The nanosensor–optode \nform factor has a high mechanical flexibility and can\
    \ be compactly \nintegrated into a portable detection platform that can utilize\
    \ the \nsame hardware as Raman spectroscopy. This presents a promising \napproach\
    \ for multi-dimensional spectral monitoring of soil in the \nfield. We anticipate\
    \ that Raman microspectroscopy and imaging \nwill prove to be useful tools to\
    \ identify chemical signatures and soil \nconstituents128 associated with the\
    \ beneficial phytobiome systems \nthat promote plant growth. In addition, a portable\
    \ fluorescence \nimaging system has been developed for automated phenotyping \n\
    of root architecture in the field129. The analytical technology plat-\nforms highlighted\
    \ here could be leveraged to probe ongoing soil \nhealth, phenotype root architecture\
    \ directly and elucidate beneficial \nmicrobial traits. Non-invasive soil phenotyping\
    \ allows plant and \nmicrobial traits to be measured on the same population over\
    \ time, \nand offers opportunities for simultaneous monitoring of shoot and \n\
    root growth130. Such an approach may help identify and utilize the \ncritical\
    \ growth-promoting metabolites as well as the crucial meta-\nbolic hubs towards\
    \ improved crop yield and resilience131. Likewise, \nsurface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy\
    \ could be applied in con-\njunction with detailed metabolomics to identify the\
    \ molecular and \nchemical basis of plant–soil–microbiome interactions132,133,\
    \ thus \nenabling the development of knowledge-based intelligent solutions \n\
    for precision agriculture.\nAn effective implementation of nanosensors and spectroscopy\
    \ \nplatforms in the field will require a concomitant development in \nlow-cost\
    \ and high-throughput image analysis tools for plant phe-\nnotyping. Such tools\
    \ can be used to interpret the sensor readings \nwith high quantitative and temporal\
    \ resolution. For example, the \nrecently introduced PlantCV, an open-source image\
    \ analysis soft-\nware for plant phenotyping, can correlate plant phenotypes with\
    \ \nstress treatments using low-cost electronics in an automated fash-\nion134.\
    \ By coupling advances in image analysis algorithms with new \nsensor technologies,\
    \ we can extract information about not just the \nvisible plant phenotype but\
    \ also the internal metabolite dynamics \nfor early diagnosis. Recent demonstrations\
    \ that optical signals from \nnanosensors can be read out with a Raspberry Pi\
    \ platform high-\nlight the potential ability of these promising technologies\
    \ to inte-\ngrate with existing portable platforms76,77. Indeed, coupling remote\
    \ \nsensing technologies with micro or nanosensors which are easy \nto use and\
    \ able to provide the required precision would be key to \nmaking remote sensor\
    \ platforms useful. Developing an integrated \nplatform that combines species-agnostic\
    \ tools with advanced imag-\ning platforms and data analysis packages will enable\
    \ a large-scale \nfield data collection at high spatial and temporal resolutions\
    \ for \nnon-destructive plant phenotyping and early diagnostics. While \nsome\
    \ progress has been made in demonstrating the development \nand utility of these\
    \ tools, successfully integrating all the different \ncomponents into an integrated\
    \ platform that is reliable, affordable \nand accessible for end-users remains\
    \ a fundamental challenge.\nNew analytics to advance urban farming\nAs a product\
    \ of agriculture, the plant is itself a highly complex \nmachine within a dynamic\
    \ ecosystem. The fundamental study of \nits internal workings, hydraulics, chemical\
    \ signalling and genetic \npathways remains an important and emerging scientific\
    \ enterprise. \nMoreover, there are diverse microbial communities in the soil\
    \ and \nplant tissues which promote plant development through improved \nnutrient\
    \ acquisition, accelerated growth and increased host resis-\ntance against stresses135,136.\
    \ Handheld Raman spectrometers that \nallow a form of laser-induced, biochemical\
    \ fingerprinting of living \nplants yield access to the internal workings of plants\
    \ with unprec-\nedented precision. Similarly, nanotechnology-enabled molecular\
    \ \nrecognition allows measurement of plant signalling hormones and \nstress responses\
    \ in a way that can ‘decode’ the inner communication \nwithin the plant itself.\
    \ They can also be employed to characterize \nrhizospheric and phyllospheric microbiota.\
    \ Such modern tools and \nrelated technologies may open possibilities for long\
    \ sought-after \nfeedback control schemes to accelerate and improve plant growth,\
    \ \nyield, nutrition and culinary properties in urban farm settings  \n(Fig. 2b).\
    \ Water, light and fertilizer are all example inputs whose \namounts and applied\
    \ durations can be digitally controlled subject to \ninternal responses within\

    Advanced analytical tools, such as Raman spectroscopy and nano-\nsensor technology,\
    \ could augment or replace conventional assess-\nments of SAS, which are mostly\
    \ restricted to the genetic level and \nthe gene expression of shade-induced genes\
    \ (AtHB2, AtHB4, PIL1 \nand so on)140–142.\nTechnological status and economic\
    \ potential of advanced \nanalytical tools\nBiotic and abiotic stresses cause\
    \ substantial losses in crop yield  \nand the economic value of agricultural products.\
    \ Plant diseases  \nand pests cause an estimated average yield loss of 30.0% in\
    \ rice, \n22.6% in maize, 21.5% in wheat, 21.4% in soybean and 17.2% \nin potato\
    \ worldwide6. Global wheat production is predicted to \ndecrease by 6% for each\
    \ degree Celsius rise in temperature143. \nDrought alone is responsible for more\
    \ substantial crop losses annu-\nally than all pathogens combined, with approximately\
    \ $30 billion \nworth of global losses in crop production over the past decade5.\
    \ \nThe severity and frequency of these stresses on crop production are \nfurther\
    \ exacerbated by climate change144–146. Advanced analytical \ntools highlighted\
    \ here can help offset the economic losses caused \nby these factors through early\
    \ stress detection in crops. However, \nto facilitate widespread adoption of these\
    \ technologies in agricul-\nture, their economic potential and reliability need\
    \ to be validated \nto ensure that they remain affordable and more effective than\
    \ the \nexisting approaches.\nThe economics of deploying species-independent platforms\
    \ \nin agriculture depends on a number of factors such as the type of \nagriculture\
    \ (for example, open-field agriculture or urban farms), \ncrop selection (high-value\
    \ produce or more commodity staples) as \nwell as the nature of the analytical\
    \ tools employed. Here, we illus-\ntrate some cases whereby the use of sensors\
    \ may be economically \nadvantageous. The profitability of portable Raman spectroscopy\
    \ \nfor precision agriculture applications can be modelled on previ-\nous work\
    \ studying the economic benefits of portable reflectance \nanalysers for inferring\
    \ crop yield and nitrogen demand. Portable \nreflectance sensors (for example,\
    \ Greenseeker) have been used to \nguide the variable rate application (VRA) of\
    \ nitrogen fertilizer. \nPrevious studies have demonstrated a value for precision\
    \ delivery \nof nitrogen fertilizers to be $16–29 ha–1 for a commodity crop such\
    \ \nas wheat147. In practice, reflectance analysis is an imperfect assay for \n\
    plant nitrogen, as the reflectance also changes with temperature, \nwater availability\
    \ and time within the growing season. By contrast, \nRaman spectroscopy can be\
    \ employed to specifically measure nitro-\ngen status in plants94. Today, a portable\
    \ Raman analyser may cost \napproximately $12,000. If a consulting engineering\
    \ firm were to \nprovide services at the cost of their technical labour ($16 h–1)\
    \ and \ncapital depreciation (4-yr depreciation, 300 h annually for measure-\n\
    ments with 20% residual value), Raman analysis would cost $8 ha–1, \nassuming\
    \ 15 min of operation per hectare (10 min of walking and \n5 min of Raman acquisition).\
    \ The economic benefit ($16–29 ha–1) \nrelative to the cost ($12 ha–1) is significant,\
    \ even for a commodity \nsuch as wheat and assuming a utilization of only 300\
    \ h annually.  \nIn practice, higher value crops such as vegetables and more \n\
    demanding schedules (900 h annually) might be more reflective \nof the margins\
    \ for a mature business employing Raman spectros-\ncopy for precision agriculture.\
    \ Within the urban farming context, \nthe use of non-destructive sensors has allowed\
    \ companies such as \nAeroFarms to apply fertilizers frequently and in small doses,\
    \ adjust-\ning along the way to optimize plant growth. Such adjustments may \n\
    be made as frequently as 15-min intervals, coupled with sensors \nwhich tightly\
    \ control humidity and water consumption, driving cost \nefficiencies in water\
    \ and fertilizer use. The fluorescence of optical \nnanosensors can also be monitored\
    \ with a Raman spectrometer148. \nAs such, the same portable instrument can be\
    \ used to obtain both \nthe Raman spectra and the nanosensor information at no\
    \ extra cost. \nFurthermore, advanced analytical tools not only drive efficiencies\
    \ \nfrom the cost perspective, such as reduced fertilizer application, but \n\
    they can also benefit the revenue side from increased product qual-\nity. For\
    \ instance, sensors that can detect optimal harvesting condi-\ntions to tune the\
    \ flavour profiles of crops149–151 may translate into \nproducts that consumers\
    \ are willing to pay a price premium for, \nfurther enhancing the value proposition\
    \ for targeted sensor deploy-\nment within different agricultural settings.\n\
    In addition to profitability, the technological robustness and sen-\nsitivity\
    \ of these potentially disruptive technologies need to be fur-\nther evaluated\
    \ for field applications. While some of the described \ntools have been shown\
    \ to work in laboratory or greenhouse con-\nditions76,77,94,102, the complex and\
    \ constantly changing environment \nin the field poses a different set of challenges\
    \ and opportunities to \nvalidate the performance of these technologies. For example,\
    \ the \nstability, sensitivity and selectivity of nanosensors may be affected\
    \ \nby weather, plant developmental stage and soil types. Plant scientists \n\
    and researchers have an important role to validate the performance \nof these\
    \ tools under variable conditions in the laboratory in parallel \nto their application\
    \ in the field. The variability in adaptive responses \nbetween plant species\
    \ and subspecies to stresses, the incidence of \nmultiple stresses as well as\
    \ the biodiversity of pathogens, insects \nand microbes further add to complexity\
    \ of agricultural systems \nin which the reliability of species-independent tools\
    \ needs to be \nassessed152,153. Multiplexing different sensors and analytical\
    \ tools can \nhelp increase the precision of crop diagnostics, but this will increase\
    \ \nthe operational cost for growers, and the optimal combinations may \nvary\
    \ from one field to another. Systems-level evaluations can be use-\nful to identify\
    \ the optimal design space in which the accuracy and \neconomic impact of the\
    \ deployable platforms can be maximized154. \nThe impact of different soil characteristics\
    \ and climate conditions \non the linearity and robustness of the proposed tools\
    \ can be assessed \nthrough large-scale field data collection at geographically\
    \ diverse \nsites. Data from such studies can also inform further redesign and\
    \ \nrefinement of these technologies to ensure their effective deploy-\nment in\
    \ agriculture155.\nWith these new tools, questions arise as to how many sensors\
    \ \nmust be deployed to monitor multiple hectares of plants and at what \nfrequency.\
    \ In the absence of any additional information, except that \nsuch plants follow\
    \ a distribution in desired traits or status, the prob-\nlem is one for basic\
    \ statistics. However, this neglects the prior infor-\nmation that researchers\
    \ will collect though the steady deployment \nand data collection using these\
    \ tools. Mathematical models and \nmachine learning that leverage data analytics\
    \ form an essential part \nof the sensors themselves. When combined, new opportunities\
    \ will \nlikely emerge. The monitoring of a much smaller cohort of plants \ncould\
    \ inform the field. The concept of strategically placed ‘sentinel \nplants’ can\
    \ dramatically reduce the necessary deployment scale156,157. \nSuch an approach\
    \ can be complimented by the use of drone technol-\nogy to check and update such\
    \ models without the burden of scan-\nning the entire plantation158,159. In contrast,\
    \ the urban farm does not \nhave the same challenges with geographical scale,\
    \ but will benefit \nfrom the same overall approach.\nNaTuRe PLaNTS | VOL 6 |\

    NATuRe PLANTs\nConclusion and outlook\nThis Perspective highlights that we now\
    \ have first-generation exam-\nples and promising concepts of how a new generation\
    \ of tools can \nrevolutionize plant science and agriculture. The development\
    \ of \nsensors and non-invasive technology to study plant signalling and \nphysiology\
    \ in situ would now allow us to extend investigations nor-\nmally conducted under\
    \ laboratory conditions to field-grown crops, \nmaking use of the knowledge base\
    \ accumulated using model plants \nsuch as Arabidopsis, rice and tomato. With\
    \ the advent of advanced \nanalytical tools, the challenge becomes the translation\
    \ of the raw \ndata collected into meaningful information for the farmers to make\
    \ \nprofitable decisions. The addition of Internet of Things (IoT) to sen-\nsors,\
    \ big data analysis and incorporation of artificial intelligence \ntechniques\
    \ will promote data-driven agriculture to enable sustain-\nable farming160. Furthermore,\
    \ for these species-independent plat-\nforms to be accessible and affordable to\
    \ agricultural end-users, there \nmust be an increased collaboration among engineers,\
    \ data scien-\ntists and plant biologists. There has to be a change in paradigm\
    \ and \nmind-set that these fields are separate to encourage more collabora-\n\
    tion between these different groups. Sustained engagement with the \npublic, farmers\
    \ and plant breeding programmes can help accelerate \nthe acceptance and integration\
    \ of these tools in everyday farming \npractices. It is paramount that more testing\
    \ of species-independent \ntools is conducted under field conditions, with critical\
    \ evaluations of \ntheir technical robustness and economic potential to ensure\
    \ sustain-\nable implementation of these technologies in tomorrow’s agriculture.\n\

    \ of work opportunities for inhabitants. Many farmers prefer traditional farming\
    \ ap-\nproaches, which result in low yields. Agriculture and related industries\
    \ are vital to the economy’s long-term growth and de-\nvelopment. Te primary issues\
    \ in agricultural production include decision-making, crop selection, and supporting\
    \ systems for\ncrop yield enhancement. Agriculture forecasting is inﬂuenced by\
    \ natural variables such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume,\nwater\
    \ quality, season, and crop prices. Growing advancements in agricultural automation\
    \ have resulted in a ﬂood of tools and apps\nfor rapid knowledge acquisition.\
    \ Mobile devices are rapidly being used by everyone, including farmers. Tis paper\

    \ amount of agricultural waste possible.\n1. Introduction\nAgriculture is essential\
    \ to the nation’s economy because it\nfeeds the whole population. It links and\
    \ interacts with all of\nthe country’s relevant enterprises in this regard. A\
    \ country is\nconsidered socially and economically prosperous if it has a\nrelatively\
    \ large agricultural base. In most countries, agri-\nculture is the primary source\
    \ of employment. Wide farms\nusually require the hiring of additional laborers\
    \ to assist with\nplanting and the treatment of farm animals. Most of these\n\
    major farms have nearby processing plants where their\nagricultural products are\
    \ ﬁnalized and developed [1]. During\nhumanity’s civilization, signiﬁcant innovations\
    \ have been\nmade to boost agricultural productivity with fewer resources\nand\
    \ human eﬀort.\nSmart farming is a term that refers to the well-known\nand better\
    \ approach to farm management that has become\npopular in modern agriculture.\
    \ Crop health and production\nare monitored via the use of agricultural and information\n\
    technologies, which include monitoring ﬁeld crop condition\nand associated indicators.\
    \ Ultimately, the objective of smart\nfarming is to reduce the cost of agricultural\
    \ inputs while still\nmaintaining the quality of the end product. Fertilizers\
    \ and\ninsecticides have typically been applied in bulk and at a ﬁxed\npace, with\
    \ the whole ﬁeld being treated as a single unit of\ntreatment.\nDespite this,\
    \ the high population rate has never enabled\ndemand and supply to meet during\
    \ these periods. According\nto estimates, the global population will reach 9.8\
    \ billion in\n2050, up around 25% of the current total [1].\nHindawi\nJournal\
    \ of Food Quality\nVolume 2022, Article ID 7692922, 7 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2022/7692922\n\
    Developing countries are expected to account for nearly\nall of the population\
    \ growth stated [2]. On the other hand,\nurbanization is expected to intensify,\
    \ with 70 percent of the\nworld’s population expected to be urban by 2050 (up\
    \ from 49\npercent today) [3]. Furthermore, income levels will be many\ntimes\
    \ higher than they are now, driving up food demand,\nparticularly in developing\
    \ countries.\nAs a result, these countries will be more conscious of\ntheir diet\
    \ and food quality. As a result, consumer preferences\nmay shift away from wheat\
    \ and cereals and toward legumes\nand, eventually, meat.\nFood production should\
    \ quadruple by 2050 to feed this\nlarger, more urban, and wealthier population\
    \ [4, 5]. In\nparticular, the current annual wheat production of 2.1 billion\n\
    tones should increase to almost 3 billion tones, and yearly\nmeat production should\
    \ increase by more than 200 million\ntones to meet the demand of 470 million tones\
    \ [6, 7].\nCurrently, crop planting is low, so many farmers prefer\nto employ\
    \ conventional methods. Consequently, producers,\ngovernments, agricultural scientists,\
    \ and academia are ex-\nploring innovative ways to increase agricultural land\
    \ pro-\nduction. Environmental causes such as water, plants, and\nclimate change\
    \ impact them. Te production of crops is\nmostly based on soil fertility. As a\
    \ result, classifying and\nincreasing the availability of low-nutrient crops for\
    \ quality\ncrops is critical [2].\nIt is tough to produce quality crops since\
    \ soil fertility\ndetermines most of the crop productivity. In addition, the\n\
    detection and optimization of inadequate nutrition content\nare required to achieve\
    \ the aim.\nDisease detection in crop leaves is diﬃcult. If it is di-\nagnosed\
    \ at the right time, associated pesticides may be used\nto suppress the disease.\
    \ Crops are often harmed by a\nshortage of primary nutrients. As a result, it\
    \ is essential to\nuse fertilizers of the proper nature. Farmers have a rough\n\
    time gathering soil nutrient statistics, water nutrient in-\nformation, groundwater\
    \ level, environmental conditions,\nand seasonal crop data concerning their farmland.\
    \ Fur-\nthermore, they are having diﬃculty making better decisions\nbased on the\
    \ facts available to them.\nMany modern farms and farming-related industries\n\
    make good use of modern machinery as well as scientiﬁc and\ntechnological principles.\
    \ Many farmers are unaware that soil\nresearch has little useful information about\
    \ their soil. Soil\ntest reports allow farmers to choose the appropriate fertility\n\
    and learn how to apply fertilizer based on soil requirements.\nExcessive fertilizer\
    \ application is occasionally one of the\nmost serious issues in the agricultural\
    \ domain [3].\nTis necessitates correction by soil fertility analysis.\nFurthermore,\
    \ for safe crop development, it is critical to\nidentify the time of delivery,\
    \ form, and quantity of fer-\ntilizers. Farmers also should not understand environ-\n\
    mental conditions when selecting crops. It is also diﬃcult\nto diagnose diseases\
    \ in leaves. Tis results in a bad yield.\nWhat\nare\nthe\ncurrent\nconcerns\n\
    of\nfarmers\nand\nagriculturists?\nTe use of technology in agriculture can overcome\
    \ most\nof the problems related to modern agriculture. In particular,\nthe use\
    \ of the Internet of Tings concept, machine learning,\nand cloud storage results\
    \ in providing solutions to most of\nthe problems.\n2. Literature Survey\n2.1.DecisionSupportSystemsinAgriculture.\
    \ Data generation\nmethods for farm management systems, such as pesticide\ncontrol,\
    \ ﬁeld management, and crop management, are\nemployed by decision support systems\
    \ (DSS) [4]. Te ef-\nfectiveness of these devices is weak. Tis might improve\n\
    farmers’ decision-making processes on crop fertilization by\nusing modern IoT-based\
    \ solutions. Many researchers have\nanalyzed data mining approaches with restricted\
    \ cases. Te\nSoil Water Balance decision system model takes into con-\nsideration\
    \ several aspects, including the soil condition,\ntemperature, channel network,\
    \ and cultivation quality.\nSynthesis of Crop Environment (CERES) Wheat, which\n\
    forms part of DSSAT, was deployed eﬀectively in the\nsemiarid and subtropical\
    \ areas of Punjab for ﬁve crop\nseasons from 2000-2001 to 2003–2005 in order to\
    \ cater for\nwheat crop development and advancement under nitrogen,\nvarying climatic\
    \ conditions, and water.\nIn Indian agriculture, the success of the DSS consultative\n\
    is highly crucial. e-Sagu is a DSS service given under Media\nLabor, Asia, by\
    \ IIIT, Hyderabad. It promotes improvement\nin farmhouse\nproductivity by disseminating\
    \ ﬁrst-rate\nfarmhouse informative agroexpert decisions in a sensible\nbehavior\
    \ of all farmhouse operations at the farmers’ door-\nsteps. Tis advice was given\
    \ during all stages of seed cul-\ntivation, starting with the crop sowing stage\
    \ and ending with\nthe harvesting stage, and it reduced crop growing costs while\n\
    increasing farmhouse yield with the excellence of agricul-\ntural products [6].\n\
    2.2. Big Data Analytics in Agriculture. Big data analysis is the\nprocess of processing\
    \ massive volumes of data in order to\nuncover hidden patterns, unpredictable\
    \ correlations, in-\ndustry dynamics, customer preferences, and other types of\n\
    useful business intelligence. Teoretical ﬁndings may lead to\nsuccessful promotion,\
    \ new income opportunities, better\nfarming preparation, improved grower eﬃciency,\
    \ compet-\nitive advantages over competitors, and other economic\nbeneﬁts. Troughout\
    \ this generation, the agricultural sector\nmust develop decision-making processes\
    \ that can take ad-\nvantage of large increases in data and knowledge from a\n\
    variety of diﬀerent sources, including soil, crops, weather,\nand farm management\
    \ systems [7].\nTombare et al. [8] sought to gain insight into crop yield\nforecasting\
    \ through big data research while also recognizing\nthe socioeconomic problems\
    \ involved. Te analysis of this\nmassive amount of data is focused on K-means\
    \ clustering\nmethods to determine which farming methods are better for\n2\nJournal\
    \ of Food Quality\nthe particular area and estimate yield using Apriori algo-\n\
    rithms. Tis useful knowledge was once again given to\nfarmers in order to improve\
    \ crop yields and promote organic\nfarming.\nIn huge data sets with a Hadoop-based\
    \ neural network,\nVictoria et al. [9] oﬀered a comparable and decentralized\n\
    computing paradigm for function discovery. Tey used an\nartiﬁcial neural network\
    \ frame in Hadoop YARN for the\nimplementation of ﬁve selection algorithms for\
    \ attributes.\nTe Hadoop binary relational memory network is combined\nwith stability\
    \ and versatility to identify the optimum attri-\nbute selector for quick identiﬁcation\
    \ of appropriate qualities\nfrom diﬀerent and high-dimensional dimension data\
    \ sets.\nLin [10] implemented the MapReduce representation in\nHadoop, thus using\
    \ the Apriori data mining algorithm. In\ngeneral, Association Rules algorithms\
    \ compute rule scarcity\nwhen working with a large number of attributes. Tis\n\
    problem is solved by the proposed MR-Apriori algorithm.\nA good crop recommendation\
    \ system has been devel-\noped by Priya et al. [11]. A Naive Bayes MapReduce classiﬁer\n\
    was used to oﬀer recommendations to farmers for the crop,\nespecially for agriculture\
    \ in the Telangana area. Te\nequipment is adaptable so that diﬀerent crops may\
    \ be\nevaluated. Using a yield chart may establish the ideal period\nfor planting,\
    \ plant growth, and harvesting. Farmers are given\nan accurate agricultural model\
    \ to inform them of which crop\nthey can grow on the ground.\nSuryanarayana et\
    \ al. [12] created a framework that uses\nhistorical weather data from an area\
    \ and analyzes it using the\nMapReduce and Hadoop methods. Many important sectors\n\
    that are inﬂuenced by the climate, such as agriculture, air\ntravel, water supply,\
    \ and tourism, will beneﬁt from weather\nforecasting. Weather forecasting is a\
    \ branch of meteorology\nthat involves gathering data from diﬀerent sources about\
    \ the\ncurrent state of the weather, such as rainfall, temperature,\nwind, and\
    \ fog.\nIn the Internet of Tings age, the meteorological de-\npartment uses various\
    \ types of sensors to determine hu-\nmidity and temperature, among other things.\
    \ MapReduce\ntechnology is used to eﬃciently analyze weather data using\ndistributed\
    \ algorithms. Te advantage of using Map Reduce\nwith Hadoop is that it can speed\
    \ up data collection in an\nenvironment where the amount of data is growing by\
    \ the\nday.\nTe only way to determine the important features in a\ndata set is\
    \ by feature selection. It has a high accuracy rating\nand takes less time to\
    \ complete. Several scholars have de-\nveloped feature selection algorithms. Recent\
    \ research studies\nhave established numerous data mining methods that have\n\
    been used for the study of agricultural and biological\ndatasets, resulting in\
    \ valuable classiﬁcation patterns [13].\nChouhan et al. [14] proposed a new way\
    \ for the ex-\ntraction of features from a dataset utilizing the PSO-SVM\nmethodology\
    \ and the fuzzy categorization of decisions trees.\nTis proposed strategy was\
    \ used for the datasets of Mush-\nroom and Soja. Te experimental results show\
    \ that the\nmethodology provided exceeds existing accurate techniques.\nTe key\
    \ characteristics contribute to wheat grain pro-\nduction as determined by the\
    \ controlled feature selection\nalgorithm [15]. 472 Iranian ﬁelds with a unique\
    \ set of 21\nfeatures have been selected for the feature selection phase. As\n\
    a result of the vast variety of characteristics chosen, the\nresults demonstrated\
    \ that the systems had greater stability.\nVillacampa [16] compared feature selection\
    \ approaches\nsuch as knowledge gain, correlation-based feature collection,\n\
    relief-F, wrapping, and hybrid methods for reducing the\nnumber of features in\
    \ data sets. Tree general classiﬁcation\nalgorithms (Decision Trees, K-Nearest\
    \ Neighbor, and\nSupport Vector Machines) were used as classiﬁers to eval-\nuate\
    \ the eﬃciency of the aforementioned methods. Te\nrelief-F system outperformed\
    \ all other methods of choosing\nfunctions, according to the data.\nRu and Kruse\
    \ [17] suggested a novel application of a\nfeature collection approach based on\
    \ agricultural data. Te\napproach included a comprehensive set of features as\
    \ well as\na complete selection technique. To associate the outcomes of\nthe various\
    \ data sets with the yield projection, two regression\nmodels (SVR and RegTree)\
    \ were used. Both the regression\nmodels, SVR and RegTree, generated experiments\
    \ that were\nsigniﬁcantly diﬀerent but also comparable. Nonetheless, on\nthe one\
    \ hand, both models returned understandable and\nexplainable function scores while,\
    \ on the other hand, of-\nfering a new understanding of the data sets and their\n\
    functions.\n2.3. Soil Classiﬁcation in Agriculture. Gholap et al. [18]\npredicted\
    \ soil fertility using a decision tree algorithm. Tey\nused attribute collection\
    \ and boosting techniques to improve\nthe eﬃciency of the J48 decision tree algorithm\
    \ after col-\nlecting a dataset from a private soil testing laboratory in\nPune.\
    \ J48 is a Java version of the C4.5 algorithm that is open\nsource. It is a mathematical\
    \ classiﬁer built on the Id3 al-\ngorithm, which is commonly used in machine learning.\
    \ It is\nbased on the idea of information entropy.\nC4.5 produces a decision tree\
    \ in which each node divides\nthe groups according to the knowledge gained. As\
    \ the\nseparating criterion, the attribute with the highest nor-\nmalized knowledge\
    \ gain is used. Tey forecasted soil fertility\nand graded it as extremely poor,\
    \ very high, low, high,\nmoderate, or relatively high. Tey also increased the\
    \ accu-\nracy ratio to 96.73 percent by using a selection and boosting\nalgorithm.\n\
    Ghosh and Koley [19] proposed a new approach to soil\nproperty analysis that is\
    \ centered on neural networks for\nsupervised learning and backpropagation. Tis\
    \ research was\nmainly due to the eﬀects of soil qualities such as organic\nmatter,\
    \ key plant nutrients, and micronutrients on crop\ndevelopment and to the determination\
    \ of their percentage\nusing the method above. Tese parameters are extremely\n\
    expensive to calculate directly. Te ﬁndings showed that the\nproposed\napproach\n\
    successfully\nforecasted\nthe\nsoil\nparameters.\nTe links between large-scale\
    \ meteorological conditions\nand agricultural yield were examined by Dahikar and\
    \ Rode\n[20]. Te main simulation and prediction approaches for\nimproving their\
    \ accuracy have been created for artiﬁcial\nneural networks. Te crop forecasting\
    \ methodology employs\nJournal of Food Quality\n3\nthe artiﬁcial neural network\
    \ to predict the correct harvested\nprocess by detecting soil and environmental\
    \ characteristics\nsuch as soil shapes, PHs, phosphates, phosphates, potassium,\n\
    organic coal, calcium, magnesium, sulphur, manganese,\ncopper, iron, depth, temperature,\
    \ precipitation, and hu-\nmidity (ANN).\nKaur et al. [21] addressed agricultural\
    \ data mining\ntechnology and practices. Data mining techniques such as\nK-means,\
    \ K-Nearest Neighbor, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks,\nand Support Vector Machines\
    \ are used in recent data mining\napproaches. Tey investigate the crop price forecasting\n\
    problem. Tis has been a major agricultural concern in\nrecent years, and it can\
    \ only be resolved with the knowledge\nthat\nis\ncurrently\navailable.\nTey\n\
    discovered\nsuitable\nknowledge models that aided in achieving high precision\n\
    and generality in price prediction.\nA robot might be used to keep food and warehouses\n\
    secure, which could be beneﬁcial. Managing a huge ware-\nhouse may be exhausting,\
    \ and food is often left unattended,\nwhich can result in contamination of the\
    \ product. Robots may\nalso be employed to guard warehouses against intruders,\
    \ even\nin the most diﬃcult of circumstances, according to the\nmanufacturer.\
    \ Utilizing this kind of robot would not only save\nmoney but also help to maintain\
    \ the integrity and quality of a\nmeal, which would help to assure food safety\
    \ [22].\nWith computer vision, it is possible to accomplish food\nsafety and security\
    \ that is automated, nondestructive, and\ncost-eﬀective. Extensive research has\
    \ been done to deter-\nmine how eﬀective it is in the assessment and classiﬁcation\
    \ of\nfruits and vegetables. An overview of the most current in-\nnovations in\
    \ the food business is provided as well as in-\nformation on the critical components\
    \ of image processing\ntechnology. In this paper, the various components of a\n\
    computer vision system are discussed in further depth. In\norder to prevent food-borne\
    \ disease and ensure food se-\ncurity, rapid and precise detection of hazardous\
    \ bacteria is\nessential for public safety biomonitoring. Various ways of\ndetecting\
    \ microorganisms have been developed throughout\ntime [23].\n3. Methodology\n\
    A framework for smart crop tracking and monitoring is\npresented in this section.\
    \ Sensors, IoT devices, cameras,\nmobile apps, machine learning, and big data\
    \ analytics are\nmajor parts of this framework. Hardware includes Arduino\nUno,\
    \ multiple sensors, and Wi-Fi devices.\nFrameworks in Figure 1 consist of the\
    \ following\ncomponents:\nArduino Uno: this board [24] features Wi-Fi, Ethernet,\n\
    a USB port, micro-SD card space, and three reset\ncatches in addition to an MCU\
    \ ATMega 32u4 with\nArduino compatibility. Te board may also connect to\nan Atheros\
    \ AR9331 to run Linux.\nDHT11/DHT22 humidity sensor: this is a humidity and\n\
    moisture sensor. It is used to continuously assess the\nhumidity and moisture\
    \ levels on land. Tis sensed data\nis stored in the cloud via Arduino Uno [25].\n\
    YL-69 soil moisture sensor: this sensor is used to de-\ntermine the water content\
    \ of the soil. It is widely used in\nfarming, water systems, greenhouses, and\
    \ other re-\nsearch center applications that demand precise esti-\nmates of water\
    \ levels in the soil. It is divided into two\nsections: an electrical board that\
    \ holds the hardware\nand a test that measures dirt mugginess. Te sensor\noperates\
    \ by establishing a potential distinction that\ncorresponds directly to the dielectric\
    \ permittivity of\nwater. Voltage variations can be translated as changes\nin\
    \ dielectric permittivity and hence as changes in water\nlevels [26].\nCamera:\
    \ it is used to capture cropped images and store\nthose images into cloud storage\
    \ via an IoT Arduino\nUno board.\nCloud storage: all crop-related images are stored\
    \ in the\ncloud for further analysis using an SVM classiﬁer. Soil-\nrelated details\
    \ are also stored in the cloud for further\nanalysis using a K-means classiﬁer.\n\
    For disease detection in crops, the SVM classiﬁcation\nalgorithm is used. Images\
    \ related to crops are collected\ninto the cloud using cameras and Arduino Uno.\
    \ Ten\nimage preprocessing and feature extraction are exe-\ncuted. Ten these images\
    \ are classiﬁed using the SVM\nalgorithm. Ten the disease is predicted on the\
    \ basis of\na previously available training data set as soil details of a\nparticular\
    \ form are also available in the system. Ten,\non the basis of detected and soil\
    \ quality, the system\nsuggests the type and quantity of pesticides that can be\n\
    used to avoid damage to crops.\nMobile application: results are made available\
    \ to\nfarmers using a mobile application. Farmers will reg-\nister on a mobile\
    \ application, and they can see all the\ndetails related to their land and crops.\n\
    4. Machine Learning Algorithm\n4.1. Support Vector Machine Approach. A support\
    \ vector\nmachine (SVM) is a comprehensive supervised learning\napproach, which\
    \ is generally deployed for mostly solving\ntwo-class categorization problems.\
    \ Besides, the SVM can\nalso be utilized for analyzing the data for classiﬁcation\
    \ and\nregression scenarios. Further, SVM employs the kernel\nTemperature \nHumidity\

    the\ndata,\nand\nthen,\ndepending upon these transformations, it determines an\n\
    optimal borderline among the likely outcomes. Moreover,\nthe decision boundary\
    \ between the two classes on a graph\nneeds to be widespread. SVM builds an optimal\
    \ borderline\nthat splits the new data point and assigns it to the correct\ncategory.\
    \ Terefore, this optimal borderline is also known as\nthe hyperplane [26].\nTe\
    \ complexity of logistic SVM is as follows: n \x88 number\nof training examples,\
    \ K \x88 number of support vectors, and\nd \x88 dimensionality of the data.\n\
    Training time complexity \x88 O n2\n\U0010FF10\n\U0010FF11,\nRun − time complexity\
    \ \x88 O(k ∗ d).\n(1)\n4.2. Logistic Regression. Te method used to relate a de-\n\
    pendent variable to one or more independent variable is\nlogistic regression.\
    \ Te dependent variable is sometimes\ncalled predictors, and predictors are called\
    \ the independent\nvariable. Plant type prediction (c) is variable based on\n\
    temperature and humidity disparity. Tus, soil moisture and\npH rate are variable\
    \ independent. Te formula that has been\nestablished is\nY \x88 B0 + B1X1 + B2X2\
    \ + B3X3.\n(2)\nTe complexity of logistic regression is as follows:\ntrain time\
    \ complexity \x88 O(nd),\nspace complexity \x88 O(d),\n(3)\nwhere n is the number\
    \ of training examples and d is the\ndimensionality of the data.\n4.3. Random\
    \ Forest. Random forests are a collection of tree\npredictors in which each tree\
    \ is based on the values of a self-\nsampled random variable with the same distribution\
    \ across\nall forest trees. Te generalization error in the forest con-\nverges\
    \ as the number of trees in the woods is at an all-time\nhigh [27].\nA tree classiﬁer\
    \ forest’s generalization error depends on\nthe strength of the speciﬁc forest\
    \ trees and their comparison.\nUsing a random selection of features to separate\
    \ each node\nproduces error rates that are more stable in terms of noise.\nInternal\
    \ measurements calculate variance, frequency, and\nconsistency, and these are\
    \ used to show the response to in-\ncrease the number of characteristics used\
    \ in the splitting.\nExternal measurements are also used for parameter impor-\n\
    tance estimation. Speciﬁc ideas apply to regression as well [28].\nTe complexity\
    \ of random forest is as follows:\ntraining time complexity \x88 O(n ∗ log(n)\
    \ ∗ d ∗ k),\n(4)\nwhere k is the number of decision trees, n is the number of\n\
    training examples, and d is the dimensionality of the data.\nSpace complexity\
    \ \x88 O(depth of tree ∗ k).\n(5)\n5. Result Analysis\nA data set of 500 images\
    \ was created for the experimental\nstudy. Tis data set contains images related\
    \ to mango leaf.\n135 images had disease, and 365 images were normal images.\n\
    In experimental analysis, three classiﬁcation algorithms,\nnamely, SVM-Support\
    \ Vector Machine, logistic regression,\nand random forest classiﬁers, are used.\
    \ To calculate accuracy,\nthe following formula was used:\naccuracy \x88\n(TP\
    \ + TN)\n(TP + TN + FP + FN),\n(6)\nwhere TP denotes True Positive, TN denotes\
    \ True\nNegative, FP denotes False Positive, and FN denotes\nFalse Negative.\n\
    Te results proved that the accuracy of the SVM classiﬁer\nis better than the random\
    \ forest and logic regression al-\ngorithm. Te accuracy values for these classiﬁers\
    \ are shown\nin Table 1 and are represented through graphs in Figure 2.\nTe graphical\
    \ representation of the accuracy is shown in\nFigure 3. Also, other eﬃciency parameters\

    \ accuracy are less than 75%.\n6. Conclusion\nTe main challenges for agriculture\
    \ production are decision-\nmaking, crop selection, and supporting systems to\
    \ increase\ncrop yield. Agriculture forecasting is dependent on natural\nfactors\
    \ such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume,\nwater quality, seasons,\
    \ and crop prices. Growing develop-\nments in agricultural automation have resulted\
    \ in the\nmassive production of tools and applications for obtaining\nfast knowledge.\
    \ Everyone, including growers, is increasingly\nusing mobile devices. A framework\
    \ for smart crop tracking\nand monitoring is presented in this paper. Sensors,\
    \ IoT\ncameras, mobile apps, and big data analytics are all included.\nA framework\
    \ for disease detection in crops is proposed. Tis\nis based on SVM classiﬁcation.\
    \ It detects disease in crops and\nsuggests suitable pesticides on the basis of\
    \ previously\navailable soil data of a particular land.\n6.1. Future of Work.\
    \ Tis product is meant to tell farmers to\ntake action right away. However, there\
    \ is still a lot of work\nthat needs to be done in the near future. Te ESP32’s\
    \ node\nMCU has both wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities\nbuilt in. We could\
    \ not make more prototypes because we did\nnot have enough money. In big farmlands\
    \ with a lot of\ndiﬀerent crops, farmers can install many prototypes like this\n\
    that will be on a local network, connected by Bluetooth, and\nhave a single main\
    \ node that will gather data and send it to\nthe cloud. Drone technology is also\
    \ being looked into. By\nattaching this system to drones, it will be possible\
    \ to map\nfarmland in 3D, as well as keep an eye on crop production\nand life\
    \ conditions. With the help of the GSM module and\nIoT SIM card on our laptops,\
    \ we can connect this whole\nsystem to the Soracom Lagoon dashboard for even more\
    \ in-\ndepth analysis. As a result, smart farming has a bright future\nahead of\
    \ it. Tis industry has the power to change the world\nwith the help of the right\
    \ technology and government\nincentives.\nData Availability\nTe data shall be\

    deals with digital technologies, both hardware and software, and how they can
    help increase agricultural production and food security in a sustainable fashion.
    Africa is going digital, enabling millions of Africans to connect for the first
    time. The effect is to revolutionize the lives of African farmers—by overcoming
    isolation, by speeding up change, and by taking success to scale. Digital connectivity
    has enormous implications for agriculture and nutrition. It is already being used
    to disseminate information on nutrition and health, providing timely information
    on everything from weather predictions, crop selection, and pest control to management
    and finance. Technologies include the analysis of big data, using machine learning
    and blockchain technology applications that help to produce and analyze digital
    soil maps, to provide sophisticated insurance and faster breeding cycles for traditional
    African crops. Keywords: digital technologies, digital connectivity, digital farmers,

    \ that allows responding to the challenges of the\nnew data era. In conjunction\
    \ with machine learning, farmers can use data to address problems such\nas farmers’\
    \ decision making, water management, soil management, crop management, and livestock\n\
    management. Crop management includes yield prediction, disease detection, weed\
    \ detection, crop\nquality, and species recognition. On the other hand, livestock\
    \ management considers animal welfare\nand livestock production. The purpose of\
    \ this paper is to synthesize the evidence regarding the\nchallenges involved\
    \ in implementing machine learning in agricultural Big Data. We conducted a\n\
    systematic literature review applying the PRISMA protocol. This review includes\
    \ 30 papers published\nfrom 2015 to 2020. We develop a framework that summarizes\
    \ the main challenges encountered,\nmachine learning techniques, and the leading\
    \ technologies used. A signiﬁcant challenge is the design\nof agricultural Big\
    \ Data architectures due to the need to modify the set of technologies adapting\
    \ the\nmachine learning techniques as the volume of data increases.\nKeywords:\
    \ Big Data; machine learning; agriculture; challenges; systematic literature review\n\
    1. Introduction\nIn order to meet the global food demand by 2050, increased food\
    \ production from\n25% to 70% is required [1]. Considering this increase, food\
    \ production per hectare needs\nto double when the world population stabilizes\
    \ around 2100 (United Nations 2019). Food\nsecurity is a fundamental global need,\
    \ which is threatened by several factors such as\npopulation growth, shrinking\
    \ arable land, climate change, food waste, and consumer\npreference for animal\
    \ protein [2]. Increasing agriculture or food production rapidly to meet\nthe\
    \ growing demand for food supply is not an easy task. Several factors contribute\
    \ to\nthis problem, such as current agricultural practices, poor storage, markets,\
    \ and changing\nscenarios [3].\nFor offering sustainable agricultural production,\
    \ it is necessary to use cutting-edge tech-\nnologies such as blockchain, IoT,\
    \ Big Data, and machine learning (ML), among others [3,4].\nData-driven agriculture\
    \ among these technologies is the most promising approach to solve\ncurrent and\
    \ future issues. If it were possible to generate a large amount of data from\n\
    farms and use it to drive some agricultural decisions, most global food problems\
    \ could be\nsolved [3]. For example, if farmers could build data sets or maps\
    \ for diverse environmental\nfactors around the farm, they could implement techniques\
    \ such as smart farming, precision\nfarming, vertical farming, and others. It\
    \ has been proven that data-driven agriculture\nimproves crop yields, reduces\
    \ costs, and guarantees sustainability [5].\nLi et al. explained that agricultural\
    \ Big Data is a part of cutting-edge technology. It\ncomprises concepts, technology,\
    \ speciﬁc measures, and an entire gamut of agricultural\nactivities such as farming\
    \ and planting. The same authors stated that by incorporating\nAgronomy 2022,\
    \ 12, 748. https://doi.org/10.3390/agronomy12030748\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/agronomy\n\
    Agronomy 2022, 12, 748\n2 of 34\ninformatization, intelligence, and precision,\
    \ the problems of traditional agriculture could\nbe solved. However, the research\
    \ on agricultural Big Data is in its initial stage, therefore,\nmore studies need\
    \ to be conducted [6].\nThe implementation of agricultural Big Data involves a\
    \ set of challenges to consider.\nFrom the technical point of view, White et al.\
    \ mentioned challenges such as inaccessibility,\nunusability, incompatibility,\
    \ inconvenience, lack of data interoperability, lack of rural\nbandwidth, lack\
    \ of data calibration, and lack of representation of crop growth models and\n\
    weather forecasts [2]. Moreover, Lassoued et al. analyzed the potential and impact\
    \ of Big\nData in agriculture. The authors identiﬁed several challenges such as\
    \ data sources, lack of\nstandard, security, cybercrime, and intellectual property\
    \ protection [7]. Similarly, Bhat and\nHuang et al. pointed out challenges in\
    \ information quality, safety, and security [3].\nFrom a societal perspective,\
    \ Lassoued et al. determined that the lack of trained staff\nto manage large volumes\
    \ of data was another Big Data challenge [7]. Moreover, Li et al.\nidentiﬁed other\
    \ problems considering the relatively backward rural areas’ viewpoint. For\ninstance,\
    \ there is little understanding from the farmers due to their low education levels;\n\
    there is a decline in online sales, lack of talent for Big Data in these areas,\
    \ limited Internet\nand data processing, and inadequate facilities for Big Data\
    \ development. People must\nstart relying on agricultural Big Data, so it becomes\
    \ a key technology for agricultural\ndevelopment, which can signiﬁcantly improve\
    \ agricultural efﬁciency, reduce production\ncosts, and increase sales [6].\n\
    According to Gopal et al., many other challenges arise because of the multimodal\n\
    nature of data. For example, there is room to improve data collection methods\
    \ and statis-\ntical and data analysis techniques to understand agricultural activities\
    \ better. The mech-\nanism used in smart farming to improve these aspects is ML,\
    \ the scientiﬁc ﬁeld that\nallows a machine to learn without much programming.\
    \ With Big Data technologies and\nhigh-performance computing, ML creates new opportunities\
    \ to facilitate, quantify, and\nunderstand the intensive data processes in agricultural\
    \ operating environments [4].\nAdvancements indicate that agriculture can beneﬁt\
    \ from ML at every management\nlevel, including species, ﬁeld, crop, and livestock\
    \ management [4]. ML is implemented in\nvarious agricultural applications such\
    \ as yield prediction algorithms, image recognition\nalgorithms, and robotics\
    \ to harvest different types of specialty crops [8].\nAgricultural Big Data is\
    \ playing an essential role in the integration of ML. Farmers\nuse the data to\
    \ calculate crop yields, fertilizer demand, cost savings, and even identify\n\
    optimization strategies for future crops [4]. ML is being employed for crops to\
    \ predict\nyields, spot diseases, detect weed, ensure crop quality, and recognize\
    \ species. For livestock,\nML is being used for animal welfare and livestock production\
    \ [9].\nThere are many challenges when implementing agricultural Big Data on farms\
    \ due\nto agricultural data sets’ volume, variety, and complexity [10]. The main\
    \ opportunities\nand challenges lie in establishing a reference point in the agricultural\
    \ sector because the\nfactors that affect agriculture will vary with climate,\
    \ geographic zone, soil type, crop, and\ntraditions [11].\nThis research aims\
    \ to discuss the different challenges of implementing ML in agricul-\ntural Big\
    \ Data. We want to highlight the technologies and ML techniques used, the kinds\n\
    of problems that need to be solved, and the challenges imposed by the volume,\
    \ variety,\nvelocity, veracity, and analysis itself. We provide a framework that\
    \ summarizes the data\nto allow researchers to decide which ML paradigm or solution\
    \ to use depending on the\nspeciﬁc agricultural Big Data scenario. Additionally,\
    \ this paper allows the identiﬁcation of\nresearch gaps and opportunities in this\
    \ area. Consequently, it serves as a comprehensive\nfoundation and facilitator\
    \ for future research. To this end, we conducted a systematic\nliterature review\
    \ (SLR), applying the PRISMA protocol [12]. We selected a set of 30 articles\n\
    that explain the use of Big Data and ML in agriculture.\nThis paper is structured\
    \ as follows. Section 1 is the introduction. Section 2 contains\nthe theoretical\
    \ background on Big Data, agricultural Big Data, ML, and the main challenges\n\
    reported in the literature. Section 3 describes the methodology used to collect\
    \ the relevant\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n3 of 34\npapers for the study. Section\
    \ 4 contains the results derived from the analysis of the selected\npapers. Section\
    \ 5 discusses the main challenges of applying ML in agricultural Big Data.\nFinally,\
    \ Section 6 presents the conclusions.\nBecause of the large number of abbreviations\
    \ used in the relative scientiﬁc works,\nTables 1 and 2 list the abbreviations\

    \ and Big Data. On the one hand,\nwe explain the use of ML in agriculture, and\
    \ on the other hand, the use of Big Data and its\ndevelopment in agriculture.\
    \ Finally, we mention the main challenges in agricultural Big\nData, described\
    \ in the literature.\n2.1. Machine Learning\nML is a research ﬁeld that formally\
    \ focuses on learning systems and algorithm theory,\nperformance, and properties.\
    \ It is a highly interdisciplinary ﬁeld based on different areas\nsuch as artiﬁcial\
    \ intelligence, optimization theory, information theory, statistics, cognitive\n\
    science, optimum control, and many other scientiﬁc, engineering, and mathematical\
    \ dis-\nciplines [13]. Because of its many applications, ML has covered almost\
    \ every scientiﬁc\ndomain, making it signiﬁcantly impact science and society [14].\
    \ It is applied to recommen-\ndation drivers, recognition systems, informatics\
    \ and data mining, and autonomous control\nsystems [15].\nDepending on the nature\
    \ of the feedback available for a learning system, ML can be\nclassiﬁed into three\
    \ main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforced\nlearning.\
    \ Table 3 compares ML techniques from different perspectives in data processing.\n\
    The row “Data processing tasks” indicates the problems that need to be solved,\
    \ and the\nrow labeled “Learning algorithms” describes the methods that can be\
    \ used to solve these\nproblems. A processing effort is required to convert raw\
    \ data into valuable data. This effort\nusually includes: (a) data cleaning to\
    \ remove inconsistent or missing elements and noise,\n(b) data integration to\
    \ put together data from many sources, and (c) data transformation to\nnormalize\
    \ and discretize data [16].\nTable 3. Main ML techniques.\nClassiﬁcation Type\n\

    \ problems.\nIn general, the goal of ML algorithms is to optimize the performance\
    \ of a task by\nexploiting examples or past experiences. By exploiting examples\
    \ or past experiences, ML\ncan generate efﬁcient relationships for data inputs\
    \ and reconstruct a knowledge schema to\nanalyze large data volumes [16].\nAgronomy\

    \ of this is that many producers say that weeds are the most severe threat to\n\
    crop production. Accurate weed detection is essential for sustainable agriculture\
    \ because\nweeds are difﬁcult to detect and distinguish from crops. ML algorithms,\
    \ along with sensors,\nnow allow accurate detection and identiﬁcation of weeds\
    \ without causing environmental\nproblems or secondary effects. ML for weed detection\
    \ has led to developing tools and\nrobots to destroy weeds, minimizing the need\
    \ for herbicides [9]. Therefore, accurate\ndetection and classiﬁcation of the\
    \ characteristics of crop quality have increased product\nvalues and reduced waste.\n\
    Figure 3 presents a graph showing the different ML techniques used to improve\n\
    agriculture. Liakos et al. explained that eight ML models had been implemented;\
    \ ﬁve\nof these models were implemented for crop management, and the most popular\
    \ models\nwere artiﬁcial neural networks (ANN). Four ML models were implemented\
    \ for livestock\nmanagement, with the most popular models being support vector\
    \ machines (SVM). For\nwater management, particularly evapotranspiration estimation,\
    \ two ML models were\nimplemented, and the most frequently implemented were ANN.\

    \ is a consequence of various\nfactors, following the considerable advancements\
    \ of ICT systems in agriculture [16].\nThe increased interest in ML research in\
    \ agriculture is a consequence of several factors:\nthe considerable advances\
    \ in ICT systems in agriculture; the vital need to increase the\nefﬁciency of\
    \ agricultural practices while reducing the environmental burden; and the need\n\
    for reliable measurements with the handling of large volumes of data [16,17].\n\
    2.2. Big Data\nBig Data is deﬁned in four dimensions (four Vs) [18]. First, it\
    \ refers to the enormous\nvolume of generated, stored, and processed data. Second,\
    \ it also refers to the high velocity\nof data transmission in interactions, and\
    \ the rates at which data are generated, collected,\nand exchanged. Thirdly, it\
    \ refers to the variety of data formats and structures (structured,\nsemi-structured,\
    \ and unstructured) resulting from the heterogeneity of data sources [19].\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 748\n8 of 34\nThe fourth dimension is veracity, which refers to the\
    \ ability to validate the quality of the\ndata used in the analyses.\nApart from\
    \ the “4 Vs”, another dimension of Big Data must also be considered: its\nvalue.\
    \ The value is obtained by analyzing data to extract hidden patterns, trends,\
    \ and\nknowledge models through algorithms and smart data analysis techniques.\
    \ Data science\nmethods increase the value of data by better understanding their\
    \ phenomena and be-\nhaviors, optimizing processes, and improving the discoveries\
    \ of machines, businesses,\nand scientists [20]. Therefore, we cannot consider\
    \ the science of Big Data without includ-\ning data analysis and ML as critical\
    \ steps for numbering value among Big Data science\nstrategies [21].\nIn practice,\
    \ Big Data analysis tools enable data scientists to discover correlations and\n\
    patterns by analyzing massive quantities of data from different sources. In recent\
    \ years,\nthe science of Big Data has become an essential modern discipline for\
    \ data analysis [21].\nIt is considered an amalgam of classic disciplines such\
    \ as statistics, artiﬁcial intelligence,\nmathematics, and informatics with its\
    \ sub-disciplines, including database systems, ML,\nand distributed systems [22].\n\
    The Big Data ecosystem handles the evolution of data, models, and support infras-\n\
    tructure throughout its life cycle; it is a whole set of components, or architecture,\
    \ storing,\nprocessing, and visualizing data and delivering results to guide applications\
    \ [23,24]. The\nframework architecture of Big Data in Figure 5 includes data storage,\
    \ information manage-\nment, data processing, data analysis, and interface and\
    \ visualization components.\nAs shown in Figure 5, the Big Data process starts\
    \ with the identiﬁcation of the sources\nfrom which useful data are extracted\
    \ [18]. Next, the data are stored in one of the designed\ndata models depending\
    \ on whether the data are structured or not. In the following step,\nthe data\
    \ are classiﬁed and ﬁltered according to the type of analysis required. Then,\
    \ it is\ndeﬁned whether the processing will be by batch, stream, or memory storage\
    \ [25]. The\nclassiﬁed data are analyzed using appropriate tools such as DL [26],\
    \ ad hoc analysis [25],\nand data science in general [27]. The data obtained must\
    \ be presented through some kind\nof visualization tool. Finally, the data are\
    \ analyzed by the decision makers [24].\nAgronomy 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\

    \ Big Data and ML\nSeveral authors have explained a number challenges when using\
    \ Big Data or ML in\ndata analysis for agricultural development.\nWhite et al.\
    \ conducted a survey with researchers participating in a conference on pre-\n\
    cision farming to identify different scenarios and challenges where agricultural\
    \ Big Data is\nused: (1) mid-season yield prediction for real-time decision making,\
    \ (2) sow lameness, (3) ir-\nrigation in cotton management, (4) in-season decision\
    \ making, (5) policymaker perspective,\n(6) cropping selection system, (7) business\
    \ analytics for agriculture, (8) grower perspective,\n(9) consumer perspective,\
    \ and (10) benchmarking scenario—comparing individual grower\nyields with modeled\
    \ outputs based on other people’s data [2]. The challenges indicated\nfor these\
    \ scenarios using the data are errors, inaccessibility, unusability, incompatibility,\n\
    and inconvenience. An example of this is the lack of data interoperability that\
    \ prevents\nintegration and uniﬁed analysis of data collected by multiple sensors\
    \ and platforms. The\nlack of rural bandwidth often makes data transmission, particularly\
    \ of large data sets that\ninclude images, impossible. In addition, sensor data\
    \ require calibration. Finally, the authors\nindicated that better representations\
    \ of crop growth models are required and more speciﬁc\nweather forecasts for individual\
    \ farms and ﬁelds [2].\nLassoued et al. analyzed the impact and potential of Big\
    \ Data in agriculture. They\nidentiﬁed several challenges related to data sources\
    \ because not all the segments in the\nvalue chain capture data the same way.\
    \ They pointed out that there is no standard by which\nthe data are captured,\
    \ making it difﬁcult to harmonize and compile the data from various\nsources [7].\
    \ Additionally, by doing a survey, they learned that the implementation of Big\n\
    Data in an organization depends on a clear strategy and a need for trained personnel\
    \ to\nadminister large volumes of data. Training and talent, more than capital,\
    \ are fundamental\nfor optimal production in the future [7]. Another major obstacle\
    \ identiﬁed is data gov-\nernance. Although most of the experts surveyed were\
    \ willing to share their data under\ncertain conditions, many expressed concerns\
    \ about data privacy, security, cybercrime, and\nintellectual property protection.\n\
    Bhat and Huang conducted a study on the application of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ and Big\nData in agriculture. They indicated several challenges when applying\
    \ Big Data in real life.\nOne of these challenges is the compilation and analysis\
    \ of large volumes of data produced\nthrough IoT and wireless sensor networks.\
    \ These two include digital images and data\nfrom UAV, satellites, and data integration\
    \ and pose difﬁculties for the effective execution\nof smart farming. The authors\
    \ explained that most Big Data systems are adequate for\nlarge industrial farms\
    \ because they have the infrastructure to access data, resources, and,\nmost importantly,\
    \ funding. However, they found only a few examples of small farming\noperations\
    \ in the developing world. Big Data has the potential to support non-industrial\n\
    farms; however, the moral and ethical questions concerning availability, cost,\
    \ and ﬁnancing\nmust be addressed to achieve these advantages [3].\nOn the other\
    \ hand, Bhat and Huang examined data collection and analysis challenges.\nThe\
    \ combination of data from various sources causes concern about the quality of\
    \ the\ninformation and its merging. Moreover, the volume of information compiled\
    \ causes\nconcern about security and protection. The compiled data sets are enormous\
    \ and complex,\nmaking it challenging to manage the standard procedures of smart\
    \ analysis. These methods\ndo not usually work well when applied to agricultural\
    \ data. The authors expect scalable\nand versatile methods to adapt to large amounts\
    \ of information [3].\nSince the agricultural data set contains various information\
    \ about soil, climate, seeds,\ncultivation practices, irrigation facilities, fertilizers,\
    \ pesticides, weeds, harvesting, post-\nharvest techniques, and others, challenges\
    \ arise at different stages of agricultural Big Data\nsuch as at data collection,\
    \ storage, and analysis [4]. Moreover, the data are generated and\nmaintained\
    \ by governments, universities, research organizations, farming companies, and\n\
    agricultural input companies for agricultural production, insurance, marketing,\
    \ supply\nchain, packaging, distribution, etc. [4]. Due to this multimodal nature\
    \ of the data, there\nare several challenges, such as the need to improve data\
    \ collection methods, statistical\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n11 of 34\ntechniques,\
    \ and more effective and efﬁcient data analytics to understand and support the\n\
    functions of several agricultural verticals. On the other hand, Weersink et al.\
    \ explained\nthat the data must be collected consistently and fulﬁll the protocols\
    \ that can group them\ninto centralized servers. These servers must be protected\
    \ from cyberattacks while masking\nthe identity of the operation managers [31].\n\
    Coble et al. analyze the challenges and opportunities of Big Data in agriculture\n\
    and conclude that these technologies will lead to relevant analytics at every\
    \ stage of\nthe agricultural value chain. The authors believe that there are relevant\
    \ policy, farm\nmanagement, supply chain, consumer demand, and sustainability\
    \ issues. A signiﬁcant\nchallenge mentioned by the authors is the management of\
    \ data repositories due to the\nvolume and variety [32]. According to Coble et\
    \ al., data service providers struggle to\nattract a critical mass of farmers\
    \ to submit farm data to repositories. This concern is partly\nbecause the value\
    \ of an agricultural data community ultimately depends on the number\nof farms\
    \ and acres in the system, i.e., the size of the network. Concerning data variability,\n\
    different levels of data quality are available, e.g., some farmers are known for\
    \ not correctly\nlabeling on-farm production data or for not considering all sowing\
    \ data. These aspects are\nof utmost importance for the system to deliver a proper\
    \ analysis and the farmer to make a\ncorrect decision. The authors point out that\
    \ progress must be made in creating public data\nrepositories, engaging both large\
    \ and small farmers in real collaboration.\nOn the other hand, Misra et al. present\
    \ an overview of Big Data, AI, and IoT and their\ndisruptive role in shaping the\
    \ future of agri-food systems [33]. The authors discuss these\ntechnologies in\
    \ greenhouse monitoring, smart farm machines, drone-based crop imaging,\nsupply\

    \ fusion), and\nfood safety. They indicate an economic impact from the point of\
    \ view of productivity, lower\ncost of production, and improved quality. Therefore,\
    \ adopting technological innovations\nand taking advantage of them is essential\
    \ for modern agriculture and the food industry.\nOur paper analyzes the main challenges\
    \ in agricultural Big Data when incorporating\nML for data analysis. The challenges\
    \ are classiﬁed based on the intrinsic characteristics\nof Big Data, the four\
    \ Vs, and the ML data analysis itself. From the data found, we pro-\npose a framework\
    \ that summarizes the challenges, the ML techniques, and the leading\ntechnologies\
    \ used to provide information for future research.\n3. Methodology\nThe research\
    \ method used for this paper was SLR. For the selection of articles, the\nPRISMA\
    \ (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis) method\n\
    was applied, which contains four stages: identiﬁcation, screening, eligibility,\
    \ and inclu-\nsion [12]. To deﬁne the objectives and research questions (RQ),\
    \ we used the methodology\nproposed by Kitchenham and Charters [34]. The analysis\
    \ stems from a series of RQ such as\n(1) what kind of problems are solved using\
    \ agricultural Big Data and ML, (2) what is the\nagricultural line of business\
    \ in which the problems are attempted to be solved, (3) what\nare the main ML\
    \ techniques used to analyze the data, (4) what technological tools are used\n\
    to implement agricultural Big Data, and (5) what are the challenges to implement\
    \ ML in\nagricultural Big Data.\nThe search string was constructed as follows:\
    \ (a) from the RQs we obtained keywords;\n(b) we applied the population–intervention–comparison–results–context\
    \ criterion to frame\nthe RQs (PICOC [35]) criterion. According to Kitchenham\
    \ and Charters [34], the population\ncorresponds to an application area, namely,\
    \ agricultural Big Data. On the other hand, the\nintervention deals with the challenges\
    \ in applying ML. In our case, it is not appropriate to\napply the comparison.\
    \ The results obtained are the identiﬁed problems, the corresponding\nsolutions,\
    \ and challenges when applying various ML techniques.\nMoreover, we accessed Scopus,\
    \ Springer, ACM, IEEE, MDPI, and Web of Science. The\nsearch strings used in all\
    \ data sources were “Big Data”, “machine learning” and “agriculture\nor farm”.\
    \ We looked for these strings in the articles’ titles, keywords, and abstracts.\
    \ In\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n12 of 34\naddition, we considered only scientiﬁc\
    \ articles and conferences in English published from\n2015 to 2020.\nIn descending\
    \ order, we identiﬁed 580 potential articles in the Scopus database, 567 in\n\
    the Web of Science database, 486 in Springer, 356 in IEEE, 309 in ACM, and 270\
    \ in MDPI.\nWe excluded books, book chapters, working papers, and press articles.\
    \ This ﬁnal selection\nresulted in 30 relevant articles.\nIn the identiﬁcation\
    \ phase, 2568 articles were examined. This examination was fol-\nlowed by a screening\
    \ where the duplication criterion was applied. This screening resulted\nin 1489\
    \ identiﬁed articles. The abstracts of these articles were then reviewed, and\
    \ we\nchecked whether or not they contained the nexus between agriculture, Big\
    \ Data, and ML.\nAfter eliminating the non-relevant articles, 54 articles remained\
    \ for detailed analysis. This\nanalysis consisted in reviewing the entire article\
    \ to ensure that it included a description\nof the Big Data process and the ML\
    \ techniques. Most of the excluded articles had purely\ntheoretical, technological,\
    \ or experimental issues. Some excluded articles poorly discussed\nthe nexus between\

    4.1.1. Farmers’ Decision Making\nIn the case of farmers’ decision making, three\
    \ problems have been noted and solved by\napplying ML in Big Data systems. The\
    \ ﬁrst one involves taking actions to lower production\ncosts. Dutta et al. managed\
    \ to capture data from domain knowledge on farming processes,\nAgronomy 2022,\
    \ 12, 748\n14 of 34\nunderstanding of the soil, harvest optimization based on\
    \ climate conditions, and data\nfrom the farmers’ undocumented experiences. They\
    \ analyzed the data to develop low-cost\nplanting [36]. They used a Big Data architecture\
    \ to process the available metadata separately\nfrom the data analysis. The processing\
    \ was performed using data mining and text mining\ntechniques, and ML techniques\
    \ applied to sensor data. The uniqueness of the architecture\nin this context\
    \ lay in the selection of the ML technique based on the real-time application\n\
    and the farmers’ expert domain knowledge. In this way, it was possible to target\
    \ the ML\nprocesses to extract the desired feature space, increasing the efﬁciency\
    \ and accuracy of\nthe system.\nDoshi et al. developed a Big Data system they\
    \ call AgroConsultant, which is designed\nto help Indian farmers make an informed\
    \ decision about which crop to grow considering\nthe planting season, the geographic\
    \ location of their operation, the characteristics of the soil,\nand environmental\
    \ factors such as temperature and precipitation [37]. For this purpose, the\n\
    authors use a Big Data architecture with two subsystems. The ﬁrst one predicts\
    \ crop suit-\nability through recommendations. They use a training dataset to\
    \ ensure the ML techniques’\ncorrect analysis. This dataset includes historical\
    \ records of soil and weather parameters\nfor 20 crop types accumulated over thirty\
    \ years. The second subsystem is concerned with\nprocessing the heterogeneous\
    \ data and class labels for subsequent ML analysis.\nThe second problem has to\
    \ do with climate prediction. Rehman et al. used real-\ntime applications on sensors\
    \ to capture climate changes in the soil and the atmosphere to\nestablish planting\
    \ dates [38]. They used a Big Data architecture with IoT to collect data in\n\
    a real time and seamless way. The system makes recommendations by analyzing a\
    \ set of\nagricultural and climate change rules.\nFinally, the third problem refers\
    \ to increasing production. For this, Tarik and Mo-\nhammed use methodological\
    \ data to predict the cereal production rate in an area character-\nized by an\
    \ unstable climate [39]. They use a system that captures water data from a weather\n\
    station. The information is processed to obtain temperature, dew point, humidity,\
    \ pressure,\nvisibility, wind direction, wind speed, gust speed, events, rainfall,\
    \ weather conditions, etc.\nThe system pre-processed the data because it is often\
    \ incomplete and inconsistent. The data\nfrom 60 years of industry history data\
    \ were processed to carry out the comparative study.\nThe authors were able to\
    \ analyze the data to improve the understanding of the agricultural\necosystem\
    \ through a scorecard.\n4.1.2. Crops\nIn the case of crops, the most signiﬁcant\
    \ concern is to increase production after re-\nducing production costs, increasing\
    \ quality, and ﬁnally managing diseases. Balducci et al.\nanalyze environmental\
    \ data such as climate, humidity, and wind along with production\nand structural\
    \ data such as soil type and land extension and, from these, propose easy-to-\n\
    develop tasks based on the use of ML techniques [40]. In the same concern, Kedarmal\
    \ et al.\nuse an ontology of smart farming that contains agriculture-related concepts\
    \ and properties\nto link the stored data with a knowledge graph. This graph allows\
    \ farmers to take timely\naction to improve production and predict crop yields\
    \ [41]. Ramaraj et al. address the issue\nof crop yield prediction by analyzing\
    \ the most commonly used rice cultivation methods,\nyield parameters, and morphological\
    \ characteristics of the crop, thus improving the process\nof predicting yield\
    \ expectations [42]. Priya et al. present a precision farming model to\nsuggest\
    \ what crops must be planted in terms of ﬁeld conditions. This suggestion allows\n\
    farmers to maximize the production and quality of their crops [43,44]. Yoki et\
    \ al. imple-\nment the BMS system (Big Data Application Machine Learning-based\
    \ Smart Farm System),\nemphasizing crop productivity and the importance of increasing\
    \ the farmers’ income. The\nauthor concludes that the information and the processable\
    \ knowledge must be improved\nat the farm level to increase production and improve\
    \ the quality of the harvest by getting a\nreasonable price [45]. For crop identiﬁcation\
    \ and classiﬁcation, Shelestov et al. present a\nworkﬂow that uses satellite imagery\
    \ and produces a crop classiﬁcation map of the analyzed\narea [46]. Yahata et\
    \ al. address the same issue, using image detection methods on images\nAgronomy\
    \ 2022, 12, 748\n15 of 34\nobtained from a cyber–physical system to collect data\
    \ on the stage of crop growth and\nenvironmental information [47]. They developed\
    \ valuable rules for a good crop, adapted\nthrough detecting ﬂowers and seedpods.\
    \ Crop disease detection is addressed by Fenu\nand Malloci, who conclude that\
    \ the ML models tested are able to predict a risk index for\nlate blight in potatoes\
    \ using weather data from meteorological stations in the region [48].\nTombe presents\
    \ a development that integrates computer vision for smart agriculture. The\nproposed\
    \ technique analyzes crop image features and can determine the health status of\n\
    the crop, identifying diseases or weeds [49].\n4.1.3. Animal Research\nIn animal\
    \ research, we found only three papers that explain the use of Big Data and\n\
    ML. Nobrega et al. used an animal behavior monitoring platform based on IoT and\
    \ cloud\ncomputing technologies to monitor sheep in vineyards. The system allows\
    \ knowing what\neach sheep consumes to ensure that the vineyards are not damaged\
    \ and improve quality.\nOn the other hand, the system allows keeping track of\
    \ sheep diseases [50]. Abbona et al.\ndeveloped a genetic programming approach\
    \ that includes white-box techniques that are\nsuitable for selecting essential\
    \ variables to generate simple models that allow understanding\nthe causes of\
    \ calf deaths. Ferreira et al. evaluated beef cattle production performance in\n\
    Brazil, where animal nutrition is measured to improve quality [51].\n4.1.4. Land\n\
    Under the topic of land, we found only two papers that approached Big Data and\n\
    ML to solve their problems. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC) is the federal\n\
    department responsible for agriculture that releases the Annual Crop Inventory\
    \ in Space\nmaps to improve agricultural production. These maps are valuable operational\
    \ space-based\nremote sensing products covering agricultural land use and non-agricultural\
    \ land found\nwithin Canada’s agricultural acreage [52]. Similar work was done\
    \ by Amani et al. to\ndevelop high spatial resolution (30 m) reference maps of\
    \ the cropland extent of South\nAsia. The authors explained a need to improve\
    \ productivity due to the food insecurity\nexperienced in the area [52].\n4.1.5.\
    \ Weather and Climate Change\nOn the other hand, we found two papers under the\
    \ weather and climate change\nheading. Sathiaraj et al. analyzed more than 3000\
    \ weather observation sites in the United\nStates, intending to classify weather\
    \ types in regions across the country [53]. The goal was\nto understand the climate\
    \ type of a speciﬁc region as it has applications in public health,\nthe environment,\
    \ actuarial science, insurance, agriculture, and engineering [53]. Moreover,\n\
    Amaechi and Pham used various ML techniques to analyze climate data and improve\n\
    prediction [54].\nKaur et al. indicate that an essential issue for agricultural\
    \ planning is to estimate\nevapotranspiration accurately, as it plays a crucial\
    \ role in scheduling irrigation water to use\nit efﬁciently [55]. They use ML\
    \ and Big Data techniques to create an H2O model framework\nto determine daily\
    \ ETo. In Ryan et al., they analyze crops using Markov chains, focusing\non weed\
    \ control and management [56].\nIn general, Big Data and ML are two technologies\
    \ used to solve several problems in the\nagriculture ﬁeld. The problems described\
    \ include increased production and quality, disease\ncontrol, cost reduction,\
    \ climate prediction and control, and crop monitoring. Figure 10\npresents a summary\
    \ of the number of papers found. Some papers reported more than one\nproblem to\
    \ be solved. For example, increasing yield and also crop quality were mentioned.\n\
    On the other hand, Figure 11 presents a map summarizing the number of papers selected\n\
    by category vs. problems to be solved.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n16 of 34\n \n\

    \ a map summarizing the number of p\npers selected by category vs. problems to\

    \ and ML. \nFrom Figure11, it is possible to observe that the primary concern\
    \ is the improveme\nof crops to increase production. This concern is due to the\
    \ problem of food security\nseveral regions of the world. On the other hand, there\
    \ is little concern for crop monitorin\nAn example of this concern is observed\
    \ in Sitokonstantinou et al., which shows the mo\nitoring of all crops in Korea\
    \ to avoid overproduction of rice and increase that of oth\ncereals, achieving\

    \ Neural Networks\nSaggi et al. compared NN with the performance of other ML techniques\
    \ [55]. NN was\nthe technique with the best performance because it overﬁtted the\
    \ model and demonstrated\ntremendous abilities for the estimation of daily crop\
    \ evapotranspiration.\nIn Doshi et al., they used NN for the automatic recommendation\
    \ of crops due to their\nmultilabel classiﬁcation. The technique performed well\
    \ in this task with 91% classiﬁcation\naccuracy [37]. Shelestov et al. found that\
    \ the most sensitive parameters for the classiﬁcation\naccuracy using NN are the\
    \ number of hidden neurons and the alpha regression coefﬁcient.\nThe former had\
    \ a much greater impact on the overall accuracy of the model than the\nlatter\
    \ [46]. The authors proposed a value of the alpha coefﬁcient with which the best\
    \ results\nare obtained and indicated that the number of hidden layers in the\
    \ model must be selected\nindependently for each particular case.\nAccording to\
    \ Priya et al., NN are efﬁcient at handling data that have no correlation\nor\
    \ linearity among them [44], but they are ineffective for modeling time series\
    \ which is\nveriﬁed in Balducci et al. where NN was implemented and their performance\
    \ was assessed\nin different tasks including the reconstruction of missing data\
    \ in a time series [40]. In this\ntask, the NN implemented presented a considerable\
    \ prediction error which as the authors\nsuggested, may be due to the use of few\
    \ training data for the one-month time series.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n18 of\
    \ 34\nIn terms of the architecture of NN, they are structures with a single hidden\
    \ layer [39,58],\ntwo hidden layers [40,48,52] and three hidden layers [55]. The\
    \ activation functions used\ninclude sigmoid [48,58], tangent sigmoid [52], and\
    \ rectiﬁed linear unit [55].\n4.2.2. Random Forest\nAccording to Priya et al.,\
    \ some RF applications are harvest prediction, crop yield in\nadverse conditions,\
    \ identiﬁcation of climatic variables, and the analysis of agriculture-\nrelated\
    \ issues such as nitrogen emissions or drought prediction [44].\nKaur et al. veriﬁed\
    \ that this technique behaves efﬁciently in terms of time complexity\nwhen analyzing\
    \ the computational complexity of the algorithm [55]. Doshi et al. (2018)\nimplemented\
    \ RF in crop recommendation due to the support incorporated for multi-\nlabel\
    \ classiﬁcation (MLC) and emphasized that this technique is effective when managing\n\
    missing values, and it is resistant to overﬁtting of the model [37]. This last\
    \ feature is\none of the reasons RF is implemented in the classiﬁcation of farmlands\
    \ in South Asia in\nGumma et al. [59].\nShelestov et al. discovered that the maximum\
    \ depth of each tree and the number of\ntrees in the forest are the most sensitive\
    \ classiﬁer parameters. Increasing the number of\ntrees improves the accuracy\
    \ of the prediction; however, it can make the program up to ﬁve\ntimes slower\
    \ [46]. Sitokonstantinou et al. used this technique to map rice ﬁelds due to the\n\
    large size of the data set they were working with (satellite images) and due to\
    \ the ease of\nthe technique to be executed in a distributed manner [57].\n4.2.3.\
    \ Support Vector Machine\nIn Nóbrega et al., different ML algorithms are compared\
    \ among which is SVM. SVM\ndetects conditions of an animal related to its position\
    \ [50]. Of the algorithms analyzed,\nSVM performed the worst; nevertheless, its\
    \ results do not differ signiﬁcantly from the other\nalgorithms, and all had a\
    \ 95% accuracy. A similar case was observed in Yang et al., where\nafter comparing\
    \ different ML techniques to predict the growth stage of a plant, SVM was\nthe\
    \ least accurate technique; however, this was over 90% [60]. In both cases, SVM\
    \ was not\nthe most suitable technique for the tasks carried out, but it did demonstrate\
    \ a good level\nof accuracy.\nShelestov et al. veriﬁed that the most sensitive\
    \ parameters of SVM are gamma, C,\nand the kernel type used [46]. They took measurements\
    \ on this last point using the\nkernel’s radial basis function (RBF) and sigmoid.\
    \ It was discovered that RBF is the most\nappropriate for crop classiﬁcation tasks.\
    \ Aiken et al. compared different ML techniques\nfor the classiﬁcation of pairs\
    \ of farms [58]. Of these, SVM had the best results in accuracy,\nsensitivity,\
    \ speciﬁcity, and precision. Additionally, it was the technique that required\
    \ the\nmost runtime, being almost double the others. Nevertheless, the authors\
    \ concluded that the\nruntime was not a limiting factor in their study and recommended\
    \ choosing this algorithm\nfor tasks of the same type.\nIn Tombe, Fenu and Malloci,\
    \ and Vasumathi et al., SVM was used to determine the\nhealth status of the crops,\
    \ to predict the severity of late blight in the potato and diseases in\nfruits,\
    \ respectively [48,49,61].\n4.2.4. Decision Tree\nThe efﬁciency of this technique\
    \ is conﬁrmed in Nóbrega et al. where they compared\ndifferent ML techniques to\
    \ classify an animal’s position using an IoT collar [50]. Of the\ncompared techniques,\
    \ the authors emphasized DT due to the low computer time required to\ntrain the\
    \ model and the ease of its subsequent interpretation. In addition, DT presented\
    \ one\nof the best accuracy values and area under the curve (AUC) of the techniques\
    \ compared.\nAnother paper that veriﬁed the DT’s efﬁciency was the one by Yang\
    \ et al. where the\nprediction of the growth stage of a plant was studied using\
    \ different ML techniques [60]. In\nthis paper, the authors concluded that the\
    \ DT was the best algorithm due to the short time\nconsumed and high level of\
    \ precision.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n19 of 34\nIn Balducci et al., they compared\
    \ the performance of different ML techniques for the\nreconstruction of ambiguous\
    \ or corrupt data captured by IoT sensors with DT resulting in\nbeing the technique\
    \ with the best outcomes in most of the experiments [40]. The authors\nconcluded\
    \ that the performance of this algorithm drops if few data are used to train\n\
    the model, and that this is affected differently by the different attributes coming\
    \ from\nthe sensors.\nDoshi et al. compared the DT with other techniques, due\
    \ to its support incorporated\nfor the MLC, for automatic crop recommendation\
    \ [37]. According to Priya et al., this\ntechnique is not advisable for work with\
    \ large scattered data sets, since its performance\ndecreases as the data volume\
    \ increases, and that it does not ideally detect anomalies and\nmanage missing\
    \ data [44].\nFigure 13 presents a map summarizing the number of papers selected\
    \ by ML tech-\nniques vs. problems to be solved. To simplify the ﬁgure, we have\
    \ not considered techniques\nthat were used only once.\nFigure 13 shows NN’s most\
    \ commonly used technique to solve various agricultural\nproblems such as increasing\
    \ production, reducing costs, increasing quality, and predicting\nthe weather.\
    \ NNs are an excellent choice when working with Big Data sets because they\nare\
    \ easy to adapt. This adaptation reduces errors produced by adjusting the weights\
    \ and\nbiases of each neuron based on the data used for training [44].\nOn the\
    \ other hand, in addition to the problems solved using NN, RF was also used to\n\
    monitor the crop through satellite images. RF is ideal for working with massive\
    \ data sets\nsince it needs less time to preprocess the data, is competent in\
    \ global time complexity, and\nworks well with scattered data sets [44].\nAgronomy\

    \ compared RF, SVM, and\nNN techniques [46]. Nobrega et al. used RF, DS, XGBoost,\
    \ KNN, SVM, and Naïve Bayes\ntechniques [50]. Ferreira et al. used K-means, BC,\
    \ RPT, bagging of DT, SB, SVM, NN, and\nLR [58]. Saggi et al. used NN, GLM, RF,\
    \ and GBM techniques [55]. Priya et al. used a\ncombination of techniques such\
    \ as DT, RF, BN, ANN, SVM, and Markov [44]. Besides\ncombining these techniques,\
    \ some of these must be adapted using Big Data systems due to\nvolume, variety,\

    The technologies used to implement Big Data and ML systems in agriculture are\n\
    presented in Figure 14, a cloud of concepts where the size of each concept is\
    \ directly related\nto the number of times it was used in the articles analyzed.\
    \ Of the 30 articles reviewed, the\ntechnology that was identiﬁed the most times\
    \ was Apache Spark, with a total of ﬁve times.\nSeventy-ﬁve percent of the technologies\
    \ identiﬁed were used in only one article, and four\narticles did not detail the\
    \ use of any technology in the implementation of their systems.\nThe use of the\
    \ most used technologies is detailed below.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW\
    \ \n21 of 34 \n \n \nFigure 14. Main technologies used in agricultural Big Data\
    \ and ML. \nThe most common technologies were sensors and satellite imagery for\
    \ collecting ag-\nricultural data. The former was used to take data at the location\
    \ of interest for crops, ani-\nmals, weather, or soil properties [44,45,50]. Satellite\
    \ images were mainly used for moni-\ntoring land and crops in large areas [52,57,59].\
    \ These were obtained through satellites or \nservices from external providers\
    \ such as Google Earth Engine (GEE), a global positioning \nsystem (GPS), Sentinel\
    \ satellites, Landsat satellites, or Google Maps. \nIn implementing Big Data systems,\
    \ the most used file system was Hadoop Distrib-\nuted File System (HDFS) because\
    \ it allows separating data sets, storing them in a distrib-\nuted way in several\
    \ nodes of a cluster, and parallelizing operations on them [57]. Most of \nthe\
    \ implemented clusters were configured with the various programs provided through\n\
    Figure 14. Main technologies used in agricultural Big Data and ML.\nThe most common\
    \ technologies were sensors and satellite imagery for collecting\nagricultural\
    \ data. The former was used to take data at the location of interest for crops,\n\
    animals, weather, or soil properties [44,45,50]. Satellite images were mainly\
    \ used for\nmonitoring land and crops in large areas [52,57,59]. These were obtained\
    \ through satellites\nor services from external providers such as Google Earth\
    \ Engine (GEE), a global positioning\nsystem (GPS), Sentinel satellites, Landsat\
    \ satellites, or Google Maps.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n21 of 34\nIn implementing\
    \ Big Data systems, the most used ﬁle system was Hadoop Distributed\nFile System\
    \ (HDFS) because it allows separating data sets, storing them in a distributed\n\
    way in several nodes of a cluster, and parallelizing operations on them [57].\
    \ Most of\nthe implemented clusters were conﬁgured with the various programs provided\
    \ through\nthe Apache Hadoop framework. Among these, the following stood out Apache\
    \ Hive\nand Apache Kafka. Apache Hive was used to conﬁgure data warehouses that\
    \ streamline\nworking with large data sets stored in distributed units [62,63].\
    \ Apache Kafka was used\nfor the transmission of information or messages to different\
    \ nodes of the designed Big\nData architecture [45,63]. The most widely used technology,\
    \ Apache Spark framework, was\nmainly used for processing the collected data [38,41,50,57,62,63].\n\
    The technology most often identiﬁed in the implementation of ML models is the\n\
    Python programming language [40,48,59]. Among the articles that use Python to\
    \ implement\nthe models, most used libraries that facilitate working with the\
    \ datasets or that implement\nthe models of the ML techniques used in the research.\
    \ The libraries that were repeated the\nmost are Scikit-Learn [48,53], Pandas\
    \ [53], and NumPy [40].\nRegarding the tools for data visualization, Web technologies\
    \ such as PHP [64] or Java\nScripts stood out. The latter stands out above all\
    \ together with libraries such as D3 for data\nvisualization [53], Leaﬂet.js for\
    \ displaying maps, [37] and React for building interactive\nuser interfaces [53].\n\
    In Wang et al., a Big Data system for agriculture is proposed. It is a system\
    \ with a\ndesign based on the collection, storage, analysis, and application of\
    \ pear tree data [62].\nFor the collection of tree growth data (air temperature,\
    \ soil moisture, light intensity, etc.),\na high-precision wireless sensor network\
    \ is used whose collected data are sent via TCP\nprotocol to traditional databases\
    \ (MySQL, MongoDB, etc.). These databases temporarily\nstore the data and serve\
    \ as data sources for the overall Big Data system. For this purpose,\ndata synchronization\
    \ software such as NiFi, Sqoop, or Flume is used, and the data sources\nare synchronized\
    \ with the HDFS cluster that is responsible for storing all the data together.\n\
    SparkSQL is used to read, ﬁlter, and store the data from the HDFS cluster to Apache\
    \ Hive\nand Apache Hbase. The former is used for data analysis, and the latter\
    \ is used for data\nmonitoring and visualization of data statistics. Apache Dubbo\
    \ is used for running farmer\nmanagement services in a distributed manner. The\
    \ article did not detail the technologies\nused to implement ML models.\n4.4.\
    \ Challenges in the Use of ML in Agricultural Big Data\nMost of the selected papers\
    \ explain a series of challenges in the use of ML in the\nagricultural Big Data\
    \ system. We describe each challenge according to the intrinsic charac-\nteristics\
    \ of Big Data: volume, variety, velocity, veracity. We also describe the challenges\
    \ that\narise in the analysis process.\nWang et al. explained challenges in the\
    \ four stages of agricultural Big Data, such as\nhaving various data sources,\
    \ low precision, low performance in real time, long collection\ncycles, high complexity,\
    \ diversiﬁcation, and lack of appropriate data. Three main aspects\nare discussed\
    \ here: data cleaning, data consolidation, and persistent storage. These aspects\n\
    are obtained mainly through Hadoop, Hive, HBase, and Spark [62].\nPriya et al.\
    \ concluded that for the end-users, such as farmers and consumers, to\nachieve\
    \ a good result, the data analysis, data summary, and methods of data interoperation\n\
    must be improved at the same time. Nowadays, a computerized approach to agriculture\n\
    is required to observe and interpret several dangers and treatments such as crop\
    \ diseases,\nﬂoods, and droughts and use the resources available more efﬁciently\
    \ [44].\n4.4.1. Volume\nIn Yang et al., a data detection device with sensors and\
    \ videos is used that commu-\nnicates with the platform in the cloud with the\
    \ TCP Socket protocol, loading the data\ninto the cloud in real time [60]. The\
    \ device transmits data to the platform in the cloud\nat 3 s intervals. The same\
    \ authors created a physical division of the table into discrete\nAgronomy 2022,\
    \ 12, 748\n22 of 34\ntables for each day that data are stored to solve the problem\
    \ of storing a large amount of\ndata in the system. On the other hand, the authors\
    \ create an analysis service based on\nHadoop and a ﬁle service implemented using\
    \ a platform in the cloud. The data kept in\nthe MySQL database are transferred\
    \ to a speciﬁc format to be ﬁled in the HDFS system\nevery day. This should be\
    \ suitable to execute the data analysis service [60]. In Amani et al.\nand in\
    \ Shelestov et al., they use a large amount of satellite data for downloading\
    \ [46,52].\nBy implementing the workﬂow on the platform in the cloud, Shelestov\
    \ et al. overcome the\nchallenges of downloading and processing Big Data. On the\
    \ other hand, Gumma et al. also\nuse satellite images in the Big Data system [59].\
    \ He notes that due to the classiﬁcation of\nlarge areas, the size of the Landsat\
    \ data is considerable (reaching petabyte when dealing\nwith a time series), which\
    \ is why it is challenging to process the data in regular systems [64].\nTo solve\
    \ this challenge, they use the computation platform in the GEE cloud for image\n\
    processing because it has the entire Landsat ﬁle and many raster data sets openly\
    \ available\nfrom NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), and other images that\
    \ can convey the code\nto the data. Thus, the complex multi-temporal data on a\
    \ continental scale can be analyzed\nusing JavaScript or Python and shared and\
    \ replicated by other researchers, reducing the\nbarriers to using supercomputers\
    \ to perform geospatial analyses [59].\nOn the other hand, Sitokonstantinou et\
    \ al. used satellite images with a resolution of\nthe 10 m time series from which\
    \ 167 features were extracted [57]. The authors reported\nthat the automated and\
    \ prompt acquisition of Sentinel images from the available centers\nbecomes a\
    \ challenge. Sentinel data offers hubs different speciﬁcations such as their constant\n\
    archiving policy, data availability, geographic cover, and acquisition latency.\
    \ The authors\nhave developed an application to connect to multiple Sentinel hubs\
    \ and automatically\nseek pertinent data. This intermediary of Sentinel data recovers\
    \ the required products\nfrom the most efﬁcient center that is chosen in terms\
    \ of download speed and product\navailability [57].\nIn Ferreira et al., a large\
    \ amount of image data was used to analyze the coincidence\nof the farms. The\
    \ authors explained that coincidence is a very challenging task because,\ngenerally,\
    \ the documentation of the attributes of the linked entity (i.e., farm) is highly\n\
    inconsistent in all the databases because of spelling errors, errors, or missing\
    \ information,\nand the infeasibility of manual data mining due to the size of\
    \ the data set [58]. On the\nother hand, Ochoa and Guo used input images processed\
    \ through hierarchical convolution\nmodules to reduce the size and gain many more\
    \ channels [65]. Three to ﬁve convolutional\nlayers were used with each image,\
    \ followed by a normalization layer in batches. At the\nend of each module, a\
    \ grouping layer and an activation layer were obtained. Then, the\ncompressed\
    \ images were fed into a set of ascending hierarchical sampling modules.\nIn Abbona\
    \ et al., a large volume of data was analyzed to predict whether the calves\n\
    survive 60 days after birth [51]. The authors looked for a possible solution to\
    \ highlight the\nyoung calves’ strengths and ﬁnd alternatives through variables.\
    \ The authors indicated that\nidentifying such variables is a complex task, but\
    \ it has a solution since the amount of data\nrecorded among the cattle is enormous\
    \ nowadays and manageable through ML techniques.\nAmaechi et al. improved climate\
    \ prediction through a model that uses rules based on\nthe knowledge of experts\
    \ [54]. The rules have been included in enormous data sets in data\npre-processing.\n\
    4.4.2. Variety\nDutta et al. created a database of terrain characteristics based\
    \ on expert knowledge\nin the domain, which is generally undocumented information\
    \ [36]. The authors used the\nknowledge of the domain to offer direction to ML.\
    \ Domain-guided extraction using ML\nis called semantic extraction, which is why\
    \ it produces a base of semantic features. The\nbase of meta-features and the\
    \ base of semantic features were integrated to form a space of\nenriched features\
    \ which was a more signiﬁcant representation of the heterogeneous data.\nTombe\
    \ created a crop image characterization scheme that is applied to determine the\n\
    health status of the crop [49]. Conversely, Rehman et al. used heterogeneous data\
    \ such as\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n23 of 34\ntext, web data, and CSV, among others,\
    \ and from these extracted the information needed to\nconstruct a set of agriculture\
    \ rules to provide recommendations [38]. Sitokonstantinou et al.\nalso used a\
    \ set of rules based on the farmers’ expert knowledge [57].\nFenu and Malloci\
    \ implemented a module to load data automatically for each crop, a\nmodule to\
    \ load data manually for each crop (used by the farmers during the monitoring\n\
    survey), and a module to integrate prognosis models [48]. Ochoa and Guo manually\
    \ classi-\nﬁed data into six classes of land cover: impermeable surfaces, buildings,\
    \ low vegetation,\ntrees, automobiles, and background [65]. Then, the authors\
    \ divided the images into square\npatches of 256 × 256 × 3 with no overlapping,\
    \ collecting data from 20,102 images. In\nVasumathi et al., they collected data\
    \ to ﬁt the quality of the satellite images to analyze plant\ngrowth [61]. They\
    \ achieved contrast stretching or normalization to perform a noise ﬁltering\n\
    process then. In this process, the pixels in the image showed different intensity\
    \ values\ninstead of real values obtained from the image.\nSathiaraj et al. used\
    \ data from a data set for climatic extreme indices and data from a\nNational\
    \ Evaluation of the Climate document published in 2014. The collected data are\n\
    compared daily with a table of climatic thresholds deﬁned to consider the annual\
    \ frequency\nof days that exceeded or fell below a certain threshold. This was\
    \ carried out for each climate\nmeasurement site. This threshold-based data set\
    \ represents the climatic extremes at each\nsite and is a resource of practical\
    \ application to group sites that experience similar trends\nand climatic extremes\
    \ [53].\nRyan et al. used data from the herbicide resistance testing service at\
    \ Charles Sturt Uni-\nversity, New South Wales, Australia, from 2001 to 2015,\
    \ and data from agricultural surveys\napplied in several counties registered in\
    \ the Australian Bureau of Statistics (Australian\nBureau of Statistics, 2015)\
    \ [56]. The ﬁrst data set consisted of annual samples of ryegrass\nreceived for\
    \ herbicide resistance tests on farms all over southern Australia. The postal\n\
    codes of the regions determined the locations of the samples.\nIn Priya et al.,\
    \ the authors indicated data from such factors as climate conditions, soil\ntype\
    \ and quality, the variety of the crop, and its quality, as well as some of the\
    \ dangerous\nconditions of plagues, weeds, and crop diseases [44]. The authors\
    \ indicate that it is\npossible to think of agriculture as a signiﬁcant biological\
    \ ecosystem, where crops interact\nwith several bodies in the ecosystem. In addition,\
    \ none of these entities are ﬁxed and\nvary dynamically; then, for understanding\
    \ the agricultural ecosystem, it is necessary\nto understand the various entities\
    \ [44]. On the other hand, the author noted that the\ninformation compiled is\
    \ accurate and veriﬁed by experts; therefore, when the data are used\nto develop\
    \ ML algorithms, the algorithm is more reliable and provides transparency for\
    \ the\ndevelopment. Once again, the hardware for data collection differs from\
    \ one organization to\nanother, so the collected data can be in different formats,\
    \ and the results can vary [44]. This\nis a constant challenge.\n4.4.3. Velocity\n\
    Of the papers selected, few described challenges due to the speed with which data\n\
    must be collected or processed and then visualized. MapReduce is a type of technology\n\
    used in Big Data to gain processing speed with large volumes of data [43]. Vasumathi\
    \ et al.\nuse the MapReduce algorithm to subdivide the data so that the request\
    \ is only inspected\nin the explicit partition, which increases the query’s efﬁciency\
    \ and recovery time [61]. In\nSaggi et al., they used MapReduce in the H2O system\
    \ to obtain more data fragments than\nthe CPU cores [55].\n4.4.4. Veracity\nIn\
    \ Tarik and Mohammed, they had to perform a pre-processing of the data because\
    \ the\nreal data were often incomplete (lost values, simpliﬁed data), noisy (errors\
    \ and exceptions),\nand inconsistent (names, coding) [39]. These issues caused\
    \ problems in the implementation\nof the Big Data system. Conversely, Ferreira\
    \ et al. reduced the land space as an alternative\nto reduce the number of comparisons\
    \ to be assessed among the attributes of pairs of farms.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n\
    24 of 34\nTo verify the data, they had to compare several approaches based on\
    \ the edition, the\nLevenshtein and Jaro–Winkler metrics, and determinist, stochastic,\
    \ and ML approaches\nto classify the pairs of farms as coincident or noncoincident\
    \ [58]. The authors point out\nthat they store pairs of similar farms, verifying\
    \ the values of each approach. In Donzia and\nKim, the performance of the ML module\
    \ was improved by using an automatic controller\nfor data stored continuously\
    \ in HDFS [45].\nOchoa and Guo prepared the training data for the ﬁrst CNN model,\
    \ dividing the\noriginal aerial images into square patches with a predeﬁned resolution\
    \ [65]. This division\nled them to increase the sample of training data. They\
    \ used techniques to increase data\nthat had to be veriﬁed to improve data quality.\
    \ On the contrary, Vasumathi et al. adjusted\nthe quality of the satellite images\
    \ to analyze plant growth. The adjustment was due to\ninsufﬁcient quality [61].\
    \ They carried out a contrast stretching or normalization process and\nanother\
    \ process of noise ﬁltering of the pixels with different intensity values to obtain\
    \ real\npixels obtained from the image. In Yahata (2017), they use data from photos\
    \ of ﬂowering\nplants to count them and examine their growth [47]. The problem\
    \ is verifying the data when\nthe ﬂower is very close to another one since the\
    \ incorrect coincidences must be reduced.\nThe authors use a robot to improve\
    \ the accuracy of the ﬂower pairing. Sitokonstantinou\net al. developed a framework\
    \ for updating images of the plots to validate the land cover\ndata through ML\
    \ algorithms. With the validated data, detailed maps of land cover at plot\nlevel\
    \ were created to distinguish between rice crops and other types of crops [57].\n\
    4.4.5. Analysis with ML\nDutta et al. investigated how to perform learning, inference,\
    \ and prediction tasks with\nlinked open data [36]. Experts in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld and farmers could potentially deﬁne\nthe entire space of features needed\
    \ to optimize the harvest. Often, that could be in a simple\nformat or unstructured\
    \ knowledge that renders it inaccessible from the system’s point of\nview. The\
    \ authors used four rule builders to formulate these relations: fuzzy rule builder,\n\
    conditional probabilistic rule builder, order logic rule builder, and a threshold-based\
    \ event\nrule builder (where the threshold of a few environmental variables was\
    \ deﬁned directly by\nthe farmers together with an event that led to making an\
    \ unusual decision). Based on the\nspeciﬁc rule of the domain or the relationship\
    \ structure, an ontology translator was created\nfor automatic reasoning from\
    \ the dynamic time-series data from the environmental sensors\nand the networks\
    \ of sensors. The task of this translator was to convert the knowledge\nof the\
    \ domain into a format that could be used in the functional block called “semantic\n\
    signal translator”. This challenge implies that the system can analyze large volumes\
    \ of\nenvironmental data using ML approaches [36].\nTombe proposed a computer\
    \ viewing technique for crop image characterization ap-\nplied to determine the\
    \ health status of the crop [49]. With these data, a deep convolutional\nneural\
    \ network can be used to extract and represent features of the image, and then\
    \ these\nfeatures are fed into the support-vector machine for training and subsequent\
    \ image in-\nterpretation. Gumma et al. employed a similar process with crop images\
    \ to use multiple\ndecision trees to assign classiﬁcation labels and reduce overﬁtting;\
    \ each tree is created\nfrom a sub-section of training data [59]. Given that the\
    \ RF classiﬁcation is a supervised\npixel-based classiﬁer, precise reference data\
    \ without clouds are needed with high-quality\nraster input.\nAmani et al. used\
    \ satellite images to analyze the type of crops on the plots. The object-\nbased\
    \ image analysis could improve crop type classiﬁcation compared with pixel-based\n\
    methods. For this, the authors apply the simple non-iterative clustering (SNIC)\
    \ algorithm\nto segment the layered mosaic image [52]. SNIC is an improved version\
    \ of the simple\nlinear iterative clustering (SLIC) segmentation algorithm that\
    \ beneﬁts from a non-iterative\nprocedure and applies the connectivity rule from\
    \ the initial stage. From this, it was possible\nto use algorithms of deep learning\
    \ ANN for the classiﬁcations of crop types.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n25 of 34\n\
    Shelestov et al. needed to process data and conﬁgure computer resources to use\n\
    state-of-the-art classiﬁcation approaches. In order to solve these problems, they\
    \ developed\nan automated crop classiﬁcation workﬂow based on ML techniques [46].\n\
    Wang et al. used the decision tree algorithm to analyze pear tree demand. The\
    \ authors\nhad to predetermine the standard demand for the growth of the pear\
    \ tree. Each layer of the\nalgorithm is a data comparison process in real time\
    \ with this standard [62]. The goal is to\ncombine ML with a Big Data platform\
    \ to quickly extract data features and data values. The\nresults of this layer\
    \ are presented to the farm administrator via the data application layer.\nIn\
    \ Ferreira et al., “farm pairing” was done in a scenario with a large amount of\n\
    livestock data. They compared the performance of twelve automated pairing methods\n\
    differently [58]. They used two unsupervised ML approaches, including k-means\
    \ clus-\ntering (KC) and bagged clustering (BC). On the other hand, they used\
    \ seven supervised\nML approaches, including recursive partition trees (RPT),\
    \ boosted decision trees (BDT),\nbootstrap classiﬁcation trees based on BCT, stochastic\
    \ boosting (SB), support vector ma-\nchines (SVM), neural networks (NN), and logistic\
    \ regression (LR). The probabilistic and\nML approaches considered the Levenshtein\
    \ metric and the Jaro–Winkler similarity criteria.\nThe authors concluded that\
    \ SVM combined with the Levenshtein metric produced the best\nresults of all the\
    \ approaches, with almost perfect precision, sensitivity, speciﬁcity, and very\n\
    high accuracy.\nSaggi et al. implemented a multilayer deep learning model considering\
    \ multiple\nhidden layers and a rectiﬁed linear active function [55]. The model\
    \ was trained with\nstochastic gradient descent using back propagation. On the\
    \ other hand, Pandya et al. used\nseries prediction methods such as autoregression\
    \ (AR), autoregressive integrated moving\naverage (ARIMA), and vector autoregression\
    \ (VAR). These techniques allowed to face the\ntime interval concept in the transmission\
    \ data, i.e., the transmission properties can change\nover time [63]. Another\
    \ challenge was the efﬁciency of the system to update the ML models\nbased on\
    \ these algorithms to address the time interval of the concept. The authors proposed\n\
    a novel framework to address both challenges.\nAbbona et al. used a more frequent\
    \ set of variables that were encapsulated in the\nmodels constructed by genetic\
    \ programming to investigate their zoological meaning in\ncalf production, evaluating\
    \ the performance of the prediction models [51]. The authors\nnote that the method\
    \ worked well, implying that the ML horizon must be investigated\nfurther and\
    \ that comparisons with other techniques must be made, even in larger data sets\n\
    containing more features. Evolutionary algorithms can be applied to zootechnical\
    \ data,\nobtaining performance models to learn the available data.\nAmaechi and\
    \ Pham employed a model designed by the authors to improve the\nconvolutional\
    \ network approach they propose. Compared with the alternative methods\ntested,\
    \ the authors achieve a high weather forecast accuracy [54]. Table 4 presents\
    \ the\nselected papers and the characteristics of Big Data where they describe\
    \ challenges. We\nadded a column where they present challenges to carry out the\

    \ of\nthe digital agricultural architecture. The authors developed standard architecture\
    \ and the\nsharing of data formats, achieving standardized processing through\
    \ designing a standard\narchitecture of agricultural Big Data [66].\nDespite the\
    \ adaptations made to solve the challenges due to the data’s volume, variety,\n\
    velocity, and veracity, there are still no automated technologies for this procedure.\

    \ data will be\navailable in general repositories containing sufﬁcient metadata\
    \ for the agricultural Big Data\nitself to decide which ML technique to use and\
    \ which adaptation to include. An example\nof this is the processing of satellite\
    \ images stored directly in cloud computing repositories,\nimproving the speed\
    \ and veracity of the data.\n5. Discussion\nAs we have mentioned in this paper,\
    \ there are several challenges for the proper use\nof ML in agricultural Big Data.\
    \ These challenges are due to the intrinsic characteristics of\nBig Data, which\
    \ are volume, variety, velocity, and veracity. To provide a visual map of the\n\
    ML techniques and challenges faced, we propose a framework composed of three main\n\
    sections considering these aspects in the main components of agricultural Big\
    \ Data. The\nﬁrst section of the framework presents the main challenges. The second\
    \ section shows the\nmain ML techniques used and the context or problem to be\
    \ solved. The last section shows\nthe most used technologies. See details in Figure\
    \ 15.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n27 of 34\n \ng\ng\ng\nBig Data, which are volume,\
    \ variety, velocity, and veracity. To provide a visual map of \nthe ML techniques\
    \ and challenges faced, we propose a framework composed of three \nmain sections\
    \ considering these aspects in the main components of agricultural Big Data. \n\
    The first section of the framework presents the main challenges. The second section\
    \ shows \nthe main ML techniques used and the context or problem to be solved.\
    \ The last section \nshows the most used technologies. See details in Figure 15.\
    \ \n \nFigure 15. Framework—main ML challenges in agricultural Big Data.\nIn this\
    \ section, we highlight speciﬁc challenges relevant to ML in the context of\n\
    agricultural Big Data. These challenges are then analyzed from the four Vs dimensions.\n\
    Then, we provide an overview of how emerging approaches address these challenges.\n\
    Examples of these challenges are unstructured data formats, data input from multiple\n\
    sources, “noisy” and poor quality data, data scalability, scalability of algorithms,\
    \ and\nunlabeled data, among others.\nAs shown in Figure 15, the most commonly\
    \ used ML techniques provide the analyses\nnecessary for predictions, recommendations,\
    \ situation determination, and automation.\nThese analyses consider techniques\
    \ such as SVR, NN, RF, DT and Naïve Bayes algorithms.\nA big challenge is to cope\
    \ with a large volume of data. The SVM algorithm has an O(n3)\ntraining time complexity\
    \ and space complexity of O(n2), where m is the number of training\nsamples. An\
    \ increase in the value of m will drastically affect the time and memory re-\n\
    quired to train this algorithm and may even become computationally infeasible\
    \ for big-size\ndatasets [67]. Another challenge considers the RF algorithm. This\
    \ algorithm must be\ntailored for each speciﬁc problem to process the data efﬁciently\
    \ [68].\nAnother challenge is the time needed to perform the computations, as\
    \ this will increase\nexponentially with increasing data size and may even make\
    \ the algorithms unusable for\nlarge data sets. Other challenges to consider are\
    \ class imbalance and bias, which will\nincrease as the volume of data increases,\
    \ causing problems using these algorithms, and\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n28 of\
    \ 34\nmay become unable to generalize adequately to new data. These challenges\
    \ are very\nrelevant as they are present in the most widely used algorithms. Possible\
    \ solutions to these\nchallenges are using cross-validation and parameter tuning.\
    \ Figure 16 presents the number\nof papers per year that use these algorithms.\
    \ It is observed that NN, RF, and SVM are the\npreferred ones for the year 2020.\
    \ On the other hand, Figure 17 represents the relationship\nof the challenges\
    \ between ML, the agriculture industry, and Big Data when it needs to\nbe implemented.\n\
    \ \nrequired to train this algorithm and may even become computationally infeasible\
    \ for big-\nsize datasets [67]. Another challenge considers the RF algorithm.\
    \ This algorithm must be \ntailored for each specific problem to process the data\
    \ efficiently [68]. \nAnother challenge is the time needed to perform the computations,\
    \ as this will in-\ncrease exponentially with increasing data size and may even\
    \ make the algorithms unusa-\nble for large data sets. Other challenges to consider\
    \ are class imbalance and bias, which \nwill increase as the volume of data increases,\
    \ causing problems using these algorithms, \nand may become unable to generalize\
    \ adequately to new data. These challenges are very \nrelevant as they are present\
    \ in the most widely used algorithms. Possible solutions to these \nchallenges\
    \ are using cross-validation and parameter tuning. Figure 16 presents the num-\n\
    ber of papers per year that use these algorithms. It is observed that NN, RF,\
    \ and SVM are \nthe preferred ones for the year 2020. On the other hand, Figure\
    \ 17 represents the relation-\nship of the challenges between ML, the agriculture\
    \ industry, and Big Data when it needs \nto be implemented. \n \nFigure 16. Main\
    \ ML techniques used in agricultural Big Data. \nAnother challenge to consider\
    \ is the variety of data sources (images, videos, sensor \ndata, and expert data,\
    \ among others), as a specific format must be available for the whole \nFigure\
    \ 16. Main ML techniques used in agricultural Big Data.\nAnother challenge to\
    \ consider is the variety of data sources (images, videos, sensor\ndata, and expert\
    \ data, among others), as a speciﬁc format must be available for the whole\ndata\
    \ set. This challenge implies that a data, Da, coming from a data source, DSa,\
    \ must have\nthe same format and representation as other Db data from another\
    \ data source, DSb. From\na technical point of view, it is possible to manage\
    \ a heterogeneous database with sufﬁcient\nmetadata to understand the origin,\
    \ type of data, processing, and changes carried out. A\nrecent technology used\
    \ to manage the heterogeneous database is the data lake [69,70],\nwhich allows\
    \ managing data in different sections: raw data, semi-processed data, and\nfully\
    \ processed data. This technology allows data traceability to be maintained at\
    \ all\ntimes, improving data quality. However, none of the selected papers mention\
    \ the use of\nthis technology.\nAs far as data processing speed, only two papers\
    \ mentioned it [55,61]. Both authors\nexplain the use of MapReduce to achieve\
    \ this goal. This aspect is paramount when Big\nData are implemented as a solution\
    \ to a problem because it is a fact that a large volume of\ndata will be used\
    \ since the data ingestion process in Big Data is constant [71]. On the other\n\
    hand, it should be considered that agricultural Big Data is a fully scalable type\
    \ of system,\nwhich makes the data processing complex, potentially slowing down\
    \ its processing speed.\nAs an example of the above, if we consider a Big Data\
    \ system that uses data coming only\nfrom sensors, we want to add other sources\
    \ such as images or videos. From the above, new\nneeds, restrictions, and decision\
    \ making may appear.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n29 of 34\n \nData are implemented\
    \ as a solution to a problem because it is a fact that a large volume of \ndata\
    \ will be used since the data ingestion process in Big Data is constant [71].\
    \ On the other \nhand, it should be considered that agricultural Big Data is a\
    \ fully scalable type of system, \nwhich makes the data processing complex, potentially\
    \ slowing down its processing speed. \nAs an example of the above, if we consider\
    \ a Big Data system that uses data coming only \nfrom sensors, we want to add\

    \ and decision making may appear.   \n \nFigure 17. Relationship of the challenges\
    \ between ML, the agriculture industry, and Big Data.\nMapReduce has been used\
    \ to increase data processing speed and adapt ML algorithms\ndifferently from\
    \ the traditional one [72]. Besides, it is possible to split the original data\
    \ set\ninto subsets and then combine the partial solutions. However, data distribution\
    \ operations\ncan adversely affect unbalanced data sets. Among the effects is\
    \ the performance when\nclassifying unbalanced data sets, which may even face\
    \ the problem of a small sample\nsize that can be ampliﬁed as the original data\
    \ are distributed on different machines [68].\nAccording to the same author, another\
    \ effect is the change in the data set that occurs when\nthe partitions of the\
    \ training and test set are very different between them. Then, it is\nnecessary\
    \ to design new techniques that can generate synthetic data that best represent\n\
    minority class instances when using a MapReduce framework [68].\nA common assumption\
    \ of ML is that algorithms can learn better with more data and,\nconsequently,\
    \ provide more accurate results. However, massive data sets impose several\nchallenges\
    \ because traditional algorithms were not designed to meet such requirements.\n\
    For example, several ML algorithms were designed for smaller data sets assuming\
    \ that\nthe entire data set can ﬁt in memory [67]. Another assumption is that\
    \ the whole data set is\navailable for processing at training time. Big Data breaks\
    \ these assumptions by rendering\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n30 of 34\nunusable traditional\
    \ algorithms or algorithms that primarily affect their performance [67].\nThe\
    \ same author mentions the existence of ML adaptations, such as deep and online\n\
    learning, to overcome the challenges of ML with Big Data [10]. However, we have\
    \ identiﬁed\na budding use of such algorithms in the selected papers.\nRegarding\
    \ the technologies used in agricultural Big Data and ML, the most used were\n\
    Hadoop, HDFS, Apache Spark, and cloud computing. Hadoop is mainly used to batch\n\
    process the data and, therefore, the data must be stored in a large repository\
    \ [73]. Cloud\ncomputing is a good solution for storage and processing because\
    \ satellite data are already\navailable [52]. Apache Spark is used when streaming\
    \ data processing is required, and\ntherefore data reading is constant [63].\n\
    In agricultural Big Data, a combination of technologies is required since data\
    \ from\nexperts, videos, and satellite images will be batch processed. On the\
    \ other hand, data from\nsocial networks and sensors will be processed by streaming.\
    \ For the case of cloud-based\ntechnologies, there are several tools for the use\
    \ of ML: Microsoft Azure Machine Learning,\nwhich is now part of Cortana Intelligence\
    \ Suite; Google Cloud Machine Learning Platform;\nAmazon Machine Learning; and\
    \ IBM Watson Analytics [74]. These services are offered by\nestablished providers,\
    \ offering scalability and integration with other services and platforms.\nFrom\
    \ our point of view, the most relevant challenge to consider is the design of\n\
    Big Data architecture since they must be ﬂexible and highly scalable, considering\
    \ that\narchitecture design is a complex task [25]. Other challenges are understanding\
    \ the statistical\ncharacteristics of the data before applying algorithms and\
    \ the ability to work with larger\ndata sets [75]. In addition, speciﬁc knowledge\
    \ is required for certain problems in agriculture,\nsuch as increased production,\
    \ quality improvement, and climate change, among others.\nHowever, it is essential\
    \ to note that none of the selected papers includes this last aspect as a\nproblem\
    \ to be faced. According to L’heureux et al., as data size increases, the performance\n\
    of algorithms becomes even more dependent on the architecture used [67]. Then,\
    \ data size\nincreasing makes it necessary to rethink the concept of architecture\
    \ used to implement and\ndevelop algorithms that manage data.\n6. Conclusions\n\
    This paper presented an SLR using the PRISMA protocol, selecting thirty articles\n\
    that explain the use of ML in agricultural Big Data. We analyzed these articles\
    \ from\nthree different points of view. First, we recorded the solutions and challenges\
    \ to different\nagricultural problems. Second, we reviewed the main ML techniques\
    \ used in agricultural\nBig Data and its main difﬁculties and challenges. Finally,\
    \ we recorded the used technologies.\nWe found 36 ML techniques, considering a\
    \ total of 80 implementations. Each paper\nimplemented more than one ML technique.\
    \ NN, RF, SVM, and DT were the most frequently\nimplemented techniques. Despite\
    \ the positive results described in the papers, the imple-\nmentation of these\
    \ algorithms remains a challenge, as there are constant problems due to\nthe increase\
    \ in data size. These challenges imply adjustments in data classiﬁcation, the\n\
    difﬁcult task of calculating the number of training samples, difﬁculties in the\
    \ classiﬁcation\nof unbalanced datasets, and the efﬁcient application of MapReduce\
    \ due to the increase in\ndata volume, among other aspects to consider.\nThe most\
    \ widely used technologies in agricultural Big Data and ML were Hadoop,\nHDFS,\
    \ Apache Spark, and cloud computing. Although these technologies can process a\n\
    large volume of heterogeneous data with reasonable speed, it is still a challenge\
    \ to use\nML algorithms. According to the nature of the data, some adaptations\
    \ will be necessary\nto improve the quality of the analyses. A big challenge is\
    \ the design of agricultural Big\nData architectures since the set of technologies\
    \ will have to be modiﬁed as the volume of\ndata increases.\nThe future of agricultural\
    \ Big Data development and the use of ML is promising.\nThis future will increase\
    \ the development of ﬂexible architectures that consider various\nalternative\
    \ ML techniques according to the conditions of the generated data. This increase\n\
    is possible thanks to the technologies that have been developed and are constantly\
    \ evolving.\nAgronomy 2022, 12, 748\n31 of 34\nOn the other hand, cloud computing\
    \ will increase due to the training of new professionals\nand the improvement\
    \ of network speed. Cloud computing and other tools will include\nmore alternative\
    \ ML techniques, facilitating ﬂexibility.\nIn terms of ML techniques, the use\
    \ of DL and other techniques mentioned in Figure 12\nthat were adapted to speciﬁc\
    \ contexts due to problems with data volume, processing speed,\nvariability, and\
    \ veracity, will increase. However, these problems can be solved by sorting\n\
    the data storage through the data lake.\nAuthor Contributions: A.C. contributed\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAgriculture automation is the\
    \ main concern and emerging subject for \nevery country. Where many types of research\
    \ have been carried out like \nthe implementation of fuzzy logic and Neuro- Fuzzy\
    \ logic,automation \nusing Expert systems and Artificial intelligence which led\
    \ to great \nbenefits.First and foremost, this paper broaches the subject of Artificial\
    \ \nintelligence, machine learning, and embedded system. It further \ndiscusses\
    \ the blending of AI and embedded technology in the \nagriculture sector. There\
    \ are still some areas of problems which are \ncausing the problems to agriculture\
    \ field like Crop diseases \ninfestations, lack of storage management, pesticide\
    \ control, weed \nmanagement, lack of irrigation and water management. In the\
    \ Country \nlike India where the water is one of the major problems for the people\
    \ \nin agriculture sectors,and the government is trying to provide more and \n\
    more support to implement automation in irrigation and agriculture. As \nthe review\
    \ suggests, The automation can be achieved along with smart \nembedded system\
    \ by using the Arduino and Raspberry pi3 with the \ntemperature and moisture sensor\
    \ by deploying the machine learning \nalgorithms and developing essential IoT(Internet\
    \ of  Things). As the \nworld is more turning toward the online storage resources\
    \ cloud \ncomputing is the major choice for data storage and management \nderived\
    \ from the sensors and easily accessible from the user‟sdevices. \nThe automaton\
    \ in agriculture with the implementation of the embedded \nsystem is also a pivotal\
    \ topic for the crop prediction, evapotranspiration \nprocess.  Evapotranspiration\
    \ process is imperative for maintaining the \nstability in the hydrologic cycle,\
    \ sustainable irrigation method, and \nwater management. The paper discusses penetration\
    \ of AI and \nembedded systems in agriculture sector via discussing past \nbreakthroughs.\
    \ The problem of water usage among the farmers leads to \nthe smart irrigation\
    \ system which will also result in the efficient use of \nwater resources. The\
    \ irrigation system proposed is fully automated and \neasily accessible method\
    \ which will be beneficial to the agriculture \nautomation to future scope. \n\

    \ \n1494 \n \nIntroduction:- \nOver the years, science and technology have taken\
    \ a considerable amount of leap in the lives of humans. We as \nmankind have been\
    \ resting on technology whether it is tangible or indirect. With the advent of\
    \ technology in this \ndigital world, we humans have pushed our limit of the thinking\
    \ process and are trying to coalesce normal brain with \nan artificial one. This\
    \ continuing exploration gave birth to a whole new field „Artificial intelligence‟.\
    \ The term \nartificial intelligence was brought forth in front of the world by\
    \ John McCarthy in 1956. It is the process by which a \nhuman can make an intelligent\
    \ machine. AI comes under the domain area of computer science which can be able\
    \ to \ndiscern its milieu and should thrive to maximize the rate of success. AI\
    \ should be able to do work based on past \nlearning. The decision process involved\
    \ with AI should response quickly as accurate as it can. The scientific \nsignificance\
    \ of AI is to program machines such that it can do work in which human intelligence\
    \ is involved. AI can \nbe phrased as “capability to hold two polar ideas in mind\
    \ remain able to function and articulately take a complex \ndecision.”  \n \n\
    AI has penetrated in medical science, education, finance, agriculture, industry,\
    \ security, and many other sectors. \nImplementation of AI involves learning process\
    \ of machines. This brings us to a sub-domain in this AI field \n“Machine learning”.\
    \ The sole purpose of machine learning is to feed the machine with data from past\
    \ experiences \nand statistical data so that it can perform its assigned task\
    \ to solve a particular problem. There are many applications \nwhich exist today\
    \ which includes analyzing of data from past data and experience, speech and face\
    \ recognition, \nweather prediction, medical diagnostics. As scientists advanced\
    \ in AI, they felt a dire need to find a system if \napplied to a machine, it\
    \ can learn itself. Apart from rudimentary problem-solving techniques, there was\
    \ no method \nbefore machine learning that can solve complex problems with the\
    \ help of simpler algorithms. It is because of \nmachine learning that the domain\
    \ of big data and data science has evolved to such a great extent. Machine learning\
    \ \nis a mathematical approach to build intelligent machines. \n \nAs AI stimulated,\
    \ many new logics and method were invented and discovered which makes the process\
    \ of problem-\nsolving more simple. Such methods are listed below. \n1. Fuzzy\
    \ logic \n2. Artificial neural networks (ANN) \n3. Neuro-fuzzy logic \n4. Expert\
    \ systems \n \nAmong all of these, the most widely used and constantly applied\
    \ method for research purposes is ANN. Our human \nbrain is the most complex part\
    \ of the body. Based on the inter linked neural networks, electric signals traverses\
    \ \nthrough the neurons with the help of axons. Synapses which are at the end\
    \ of each node passes the signal ahead. \nANN method was invented by keeping in\
    \ mind the same concept of the working of the human brain. There are \nvarious\
    \ algorithms of this approach. Based on the application, the correct algorithm\
    \ is to be used. ANN is a task-\nbased  method which tells the system to operate\
    \ based on some inbuilt task rather than a conventional computational \nprogrammed\
    \ task. The architecture of ANN consists of three layers :  \n1. Input layer \n\
    2. Hidden (middle) layer \n3. Output layer (Figure – 1) \n \nFigure 1:-Artificial\
    \ neural network layers \nISSN: 2320-5407                                    \

    \ \n1495 \n \nMoreover, Artificial intelligence and machine learning are mostly\
    \ hypothesis and theories. These are programming \nand algorithms. For the implementation\
    \ of these algorithms and logic based concepts, there should be a hardware-\n\
    software interface. The system through which this can be achieved is „Embedded\
    \ systems‟. Embedded systems are \nhardware built systems consisting of memory\
    \ chips with custom software programmed in it. (Figure – 2) \n \nFigure 2:-Embedded\
    \ systems \n \nThis paper encompasses the links which make embedded systems and\
    \ AI coherent with the agriculture sector. \nImplementation of AI and expert systems\
    \ in agriculture is a narrowly defined subject. This topic was discussed by \n\
    Mckinion et al. back in 1985 (1985).Agriculture is the essential part of any country.\
    \ At present South Korea, China, \nNorth America are investing trillions of money\
    \ for development in the agriculture sector and implementing more \nadvance technologies.\
    \ The population is increasing at a very high rate which is directly related to\
    \ the increase in the \ndemand for food.  India is a rich source for food crops\
    \ and especially for species. The agriculture sector is one of the \nmost sensitive\
    \ sectors of the Indian economy, supporting all other sectors and spreading its\
    \ importance in far-\nreaching areas. With the advent of technology in other industries,\
    \ it is a very crucial point to implement automation \nin agriculture. In India,\
    \ farmers perform a traditional method for agriculture which satisfied the needs\
    \ before,but as \nthe world is moving with the fast speed and the population in\
    \ India is increasing exponentially, it is very hard to \nreassure the demands.\
    \ As population increases the demand for food increase and the call for agriculture\
    \ automation \nrises. In recentyear's semi-automated methods have grown and served\
    \ the rising demands but this is not sufficient \nenough to serve the whole purpose.\
    \ A complete automated mechanism is what which will replace the traditional \n\
    agriculture approach. \n \nAutomated mechanisms are implemented on the available\
    \ traditional approach itself. Traditional agriculture \nmethods like drip irrigation,\
    \ sprinkler irrigation, direct pump irrigation,and many others need continuous\
    \ field \nmonitoring by the farmer. These systems can be automated using the Internet\
    \ of Things controlled by a control \nsystem. The fully automated system understands\
    \ the surrounding conditions and operates accordingly.  The fresh \nwater available\
    \ on the earth is very less and effective use of it is the prime goal. The traditional\
    \ methods used for \nirrigation was not very efficient and so to automate the\
    \ irrigation system in order to monitor the field some \nadditional technologies\
    \ like intelligence is in much need so that the system can apply artificial intelligence\
    \ to deduce \nthe agriculture data and results and to predict future results and\
    \ work correspondingly.  Machine learning which is \nthe part of artificial intelligence\
    \ supports the Machine to Machine Communication (M2M). The whole mechanism \n\
    learns the operation and operates as an artificial human brain. However, there\
    \ are numerous problems such as crop \nloss, illiteracy among farmers about the\
    \ crops and efficient use of water.  This paper suggests the comprehensive \n\
    solution to such problems related to agriculture with the help of AI-based irrigation\
    \ systems. The proposed system \nwill make efficient use of theories of AI and\
    \ Machine learning and will manifest with the help of an embedded \nsystem. The\
    \ system will decide the productivity of the soil, crops and irrigation system.\
    \ The system will be designed \nin such a way that it can approach the maximum\
    \ population of India. \n \nLiterature survey \nOver the past 50 years, there\
    \ has been a sustainable development in artificial intelligence due to its robustness\
    \ in the \napplication and is pervasive in every field. One such field is agriculture.\

    \ attached to it. Almost 1.5 billion hectors of land (which is 11 \npercent of\
    \ the total land area) are used for agriculture. Such a business faces many challenges\
    \ on a daily basis and is \nnot smoothly running. Some of the pith problems faced\
    \ by farmers from seed sowing to harvesting of crops are as \nfollows:  \n1. Crop\
    \ diseases infestations \n2. Lack of storage management. \n3. Pesticide control\
    \ \n4. Weed management \n5. Lack of irrigation and drainage facilities.  \n \n\
    Computers and technology started penetrating in this sector from 1983 onwards.\
    \ Since then, there have been many \nsuggestions and proposed systems for betterment\
    \ in agriculture from the database to decision making process. \nFiltering out\
    \ every process, only AI based systems have proved to be the most feasible and\
    \ reliable one. The AI-\nbased method does notgeneralize the problem and gives\
    \ a particular solution to a particular defined complex \nproblem.  \n \nApplication\
    \ of Artificial neural networks in crop prediction and evapotranspiration process.\
    \ \nA method is suggesting the use of ANN algorithms for crop prediction in smartphones\
    \ had been successfully tested \nin 2016 by researchers Ravichandran and Koteeshwari.\
    \ A prediction model was developed. As mentioned above, the \nprediction model\
    \ of this system had three layers. The efficiency of the model was dependent on\
    \ the number of the \nhidden layers. First and foremost, the ANN model was built\
    \ and trained using various algorithms such as Silva and \nAlmeida‟s algorithms,\
    \ Delta-bar-delta,Rprop, and various other to find the most favourable configuration.\
    \ Trial and \nerror method was implemented to choose the number of hidden layers.\
    \ There should be a précised way to scrutinize \nthe selection of some hidden\
    \ layers because the prediction system‟s accuracy is dependent on the number of\
    \ hidden \nlayers. It was observed in the research that more the number of hidden\
    \ layers in the ANN model; the more accurate \nwere the prediction. \n \n \nSince\
    \ the purpose of the system was to make it handy for the farmers, it is developed\
    \ on APK platform. The source \ncode was written in Eclipse with Java codes in\
    \ the backhand,and the algorithm was developed using Matlab and \nANN toolbox.\
    \ The whole file was then extracted on the Android platform so that it can be\
    \ utilized by smartphones.  \nBesides suggesting the crop to the farmer, the system\
    \ also has the additional advantage of advising the farmer for the \nfertilizer\
    \ to be used if the farmer wishes to use the crop of his choice. (Ravichandran\
    \ and Koteshwari, 2016).(Figure \n– 3) \n \n \nFigure 3:-Flowchart of ANN-based\

    \ of ANN in several techniques of estimation of ET. Researchers gathered monthly\
    \ climate data from \nthe Forest research institute (FRI) Dehradun for ET estimation.\
    \ The methods on which the algorithms were applied \nwere: 1. Penman-Monteith\
    \ method 2. Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation.  It was observed that increasing\
    \ the \nnumber of hidden layers in the system resulted in instability in the ET\
    \ estimation. So, training function with \noptimum trial and error method is to\
    \ be chosen for the overall optimized estimation of ET. It was observed that out\
    \ \nof six training algorithms of ANN model, function „trainlm‟ with 75% data\
    \ feed in it was precise and had the best \nnumber of neurons. Furthermore, there\
    \ was a gauging between PM method and ANN model with the single layer \nfeed forward\
    \ back propagation algorithm. ANN model was designed and developed using Matlab.\
    \ Six algorithms \nwere conjured and assessed. As evapotranspiration is of vital\
    \ importance in irrigation and water management, this \nresearch manifested the\
    \ predictive prowess of ANN structure if implemented correctly. ( Nema et al.,\
    \ 2017). \n \nFurthermore, also a method was created to discriminate weed from\
    \ crops with the help of image analysis and neural \nnetworks. It had the accuracy\
    \ of more than 75% without any beforehand plant information fed into the system.\
    \ \n(Aitkenhead et al., 2003).  Shahzadi et al. (2016) developed expert systems\
    \ based smart agriculture system. The \nconcept of IoT in this system was to send\
    \ the data to the server so that actuators of the field should be able to take\
    \ \nappropriate decisions. For that, the server should be intelligent enough to\
    \ take decisions independently. This system \nconsists of temperature, humidity,\
    \ leaf wetness, and soil sensors. It only gives the information about the field\
    \ and \ndoesn‟t act on the irrigation process.  \n \nMachine learning and smart\
    \ embedded systems in the agricultural sector. \nIndia constitutes 4% of the fresh\
    \ water available on the earth out of which, the farming sector consumes 80% of\
    \ \nwater. This is a matter of grave concern. It is imperative that the water\
    \ used in the irrigation system should not be \nwasted. The only way to stop squalid\
    \ of water in irrigation is to introduce a smart system which takes the toll of\
    \ \nusage of water and alleviate the problems as articulately as possible. Many\
    \ researchers and organizations have \nbrought forth the concept of Machine Learning\
    \ and Smart IOT based system for improving irrigation and water \nmanagement in\
    \ agriculture.  \n \nMachine learning had been employed for crop disease prediction\
    \ in 2016. Taking into consideration the socio and \neconomic vitality of agriculture\
    \ in India, researchers Suyash and Sandeep developed a system which predicted\
    \ grape \ndisease beforehand. Any anomaly in the grape plant was noticedonly after\
    \ it was infected and this had a considerable \ndeteriorating effect on the whole\
    \ vineyard. The system employed various sensors such as temperature sensor, leaf\
    \ \nwetness sensors, and humidity sensors in the vineyard. These sensors send\
    \ the data sensed to the database in the \nZigBee server which is linked to the\
    \ sensors. The server will store the data. The server is commissioned with a \n\
    hidden Markov model algorithm in it. This algorithm is present to train the normal\
    \ data sensed by the sensors and \nreport any aberration in temperature, humidity\
    \ or leaf wetness which can result in grape disease to farmer via SMS. \nMachine\
    \ learning is blended in the system beforehand for astute deduction of disease\
    \ in grapes. The additional \nadvantage of this system is it also suggests the\
    \ farmer pesticides and pacifies manual effort in the detection of \ndisease.\
    \ ( Patil and Thorat, 2016).While a similar method of machine learning was employed\
    \ in monitoring the \ngrowth of Paddy crops. This system was developed for increasing\
    \ the yield and productivity of paddy crops. It also \nproved to be cost effective\
    \ and durable. ( Kait et al., 2007).(Figure -4) \n \nFigure 4:-Grape disease detection\

    \ system works on three units. Base unit \n(BU), Valve unit (VU), and Sensor unit\
    \ (SU). The whole system is powered by solar panels. After the successful \ninstallation\
    \ of every unit, BU will send the address to which the data is to be sent to SU.\
    \ Sensors from the SU will \nsense the moisture content and send the detected\
    \ data to a specific address in the BU. If required, BU will send a \nsignal to\
    \ VU so that it can calibrate the position of the valve in order to provide the\
    \ soil with water. However, site-\nspecific use of automatic irrigation system\
    \ took birth in the early 21st century; this method proved to be a significant\
    \ \nsuccess as it reduced the cost, feasibility, and complexity of the developed\
    \ system. Furthermore, the unit can be set \nup which transports the fertilizers\
    \ and pesticides in the field using the same method. For that, new kind of sensors\
    \ \nwould have to calibrate for transmitting accurate information. ( Dursun and\
    \ Ozden 2011). \n \nResearch has been conducted to test the ET based, ICT based,\
    \ and IIS based technology. In Riyadh, a research was \nconducted in Wheat and\
    \ Tomato field in which both sprinkler and drip irrigation method were employed\
    \ and tested \nwith ICT as well as IIS. A graph of water depth versus growth period\
    \ of the crop (weekly) was plotted for all three \nmethods. A concise observation\
    \ concluded that IIS was far more feasible in a matter of water usage than ICT\
    \ and ET \nbased system. It skyrocketed the frugality of water usage from 18%\
    \ to a whopping 27%. (Al-Ghobari et al., 2011). \n \nAlso, Kodali and Sahu (2016)\
    \ presented the use of Losant platform for monitoring the agriculture farmland\
    \ and \nintimate the farmer via SMS or e-mail if any anomaly is observed by the\
    \ system. Losing is a simple Iot based most \npowerful cloud platform. It offers\
    \ real-time observation of data stored in it irrespective of the position of the\
    \ field. \nGutierrez et al. (2014) came up with an automated irrigation system\
    \ which uses the GPRS module as a \ncommunication device. The system is programmed\
    \ into a microprocessor-based gateway which controls the water \nquantity. It\
    \ was proved that water savings were 90% more than the conventionalirrigation\
    \ system. Kim et al. (2008) \nused a distributed wireless network for sensing\
    \ and control of irrigation process from a remote location.  \n \nNeed for smart\
    \ irrigation systems. \nBrief Report on water problems in India: India and China\
    \ alone constitute 2.7 billion people living under the stress \nof water shortage.\
    \ Out of overall water consumption, 70% is consumed in the agricultural process.\
    \ Remaining is \nused in infrastructural pipelines and other miscellaneous works.\
    \ Water leakage is inevitable and uncontrollable in \ncities. Water demand will\
    \ shoot up by 50% shortlyand this fact cannot be vetoed away. The farming fraternity\
    \ is the \nonly option in which water usage can be optimized by employing smart\
    \ irrigation systems.By inculcating smart \nirrigation system, wastage of water\
    \ can culminate to a great extent can abridge water consumption by 20%. ( Gupta\
    \ \net al., 2016). \n \nSmart irrigation systems \nThere is a major problem of\
    \ water wastage and a dearth of water in conventional irrigation methods employed.\
    \ To \ngive an example, Egypt faces a problem of water distribution from the Nile\
    \ river with neighbouring countries. \nAmple research had been carried out to\
    \ solve the problems faced in the irrigation, process. Many companies have \n\
    developed a sensor-based smart irrigation system. These systems have been developed\
    \ for optimal water usage, \nmonitoring of water pollution, and to take care of\
    \ some other grave problems. Soil moisture and temperature sensors \ninteract\
    \ directly with embedded components in the field and take care of required water\
    \ distribution among crops \nwithout farmer‟s interaction.  \n \nWall and King\
    \ (2004) came up with a smart system which controlled valves of sprinklers with\
    \ the help of \ntemperature and moisture sensors deployed in the field. However,\
    \ this system did not consider the water pollution \nproblem. Miranda et al. (2003)\
    \ came up with a distributed irrigation system which works on soil water \nmeasurement.\
    \ M2M (machine-to-machine) technology which allows machines to interact with each\
    \ other \nautonomously and store the data directly in a cloud-based server online.\
    \ This M2M technology is in an incipient \nstage and is developing steadfastly.\
    \ Shekhar et al. (2017) developed a technology which allows machines to \ncommunicate\
    \ themselves. Yang et al. (2007) also developed a complete sensor-based intensive\
    \ irrigation method \nwhich is self-organizing. This system constructed a bottom\

    \ \n1499 \n \nThe proposed AI-based intelligent irrigation system. \nSo far, there\
    \ have been many advancements in precision agriculture. However, almost all the\
    \ breakthroughs \nexcludes the use of an intelligent machine to machine interaction\
    \ in irrigation. Most of the systems fetched the data \nat a particular time and\
    \ responded immediately controlling the valves in the field. There has not been\
    \ any system \nwhich takes the decision based on past experiences and analyzingreal-time\
    \ data. Till now, machine learning has only \nsucceeded to abate crop yielding,\
    \ crop disease detection, and crop management problems. There is no or meagre\
    \ \nresearch in the field of machine learning technique which analyzes the soil\
    \ moisture content based on past data fed \nand controls the irrigation process\
    \ without any involvement of human work.  \n \nTemperature and moisture sensors\
    \ will sense the soil condition at regular intervals and send the data to the\
    \ \nmicrocontroller of the Arduino. Arduino has an inbuilt analog to digital converters\
    \ which will convert input analog \ndata to a digital one. An edge level hardware\
    \ will be connected to Arduino. In this system, raspberry pi is connected. \n\
    The converted signal will be sent to the raspberry pi. Machine learning based\
    \ KNN algorithm is employed in the \nhardware. This algorithm is very simple and\
    \ rudimentary. The sensed temperature and moisture values are then \nengulfed\
    \ in the machine learning algorithm and based on the training values; Raspberry\
    \ pi3 sends the signal to \nArduino to start the pump for irrigation process.\
    \ If the value corresponds to the value needed for the real-time soil \nrequirement,\
    \ then the pump will not get the command to start the process. Regardless of water\
    \ supplied, every time \nthe data is processed in the algorithm, it also updates\
    \ the database. This database holds the information of sensor \nvalues and number\
    \ of irrigation processes. This database uploads itself on a webpage cloud portal\
    \ through which \nfarmers can access the information. (Shekhar et al., 2017) \n\
    \ \nComprehensive research on soil degradation due to natural as well as man-made\
    \ factors should be carried out. A \nhidden Markov model should be designed to\
    \ label and classify various factors affecting soil‟s health. There are \ngovernment\
    \ bodies like soil and water conservation division of the ministry of agriculture\
    \ and the Indian Council of \nAgricultural Research (ICAR) which can help with\
    \ the past statistical data. This accumulated data should be \nclassified and\
    \ labelled inside the neural network. By introducing ANN algorithms juxtaposing\
    \ the KNN algorithms \nwill keep the farmer updated about the condition of the\

    \ is the much necessitate reducing human interventions in practice. Day by day\
    \ demand for \nfood is reaching its high peak and the without execution of the\
    \ modern methods in agriculture it is very hard to \nachieve the increasing demand.\
    \ Agriculture monitoring is the prime concern as it helps to reduce labour and\
    \ increase \nthe production.  Artificial Intelligence has been implemented in\
    \ crop selection and to help the farmer in the selection \nof the fertilizers.\
    \  With the help of the database which the user has gathered and specified to\
    \ the system, the machine \ncommunicates among themselves to decide which crop\
    \ is suitable for harvesting and also the fertilizers which \npromote the maximum\
    \ growth. \n \nAI is also handed-down for water management and irrigation by using\
    \ the artificial neural network (ANN) which \nhelps to build a sustainable system.\
    \ Water management is very important,and ANN is used to set the ET system. It\
    \ is \na veryeffective way to build an irrigation system which controls the amount\
    \ of field water. Machine learning is a \nvery trustful subject,and its application\
    \ can create wonders in the field of agriculture. Machine learning is normally\
    \ \nused to calculate crop yield and to calculate crop growth. Machine learning\
    \ can also be implemented to know the \ncrop disease. The data of the field is\
    \ continuously sent to the server and monitored by the user. Humidity, wetness\
    \ of \nthe leave, colour pigmentation and many other parameters decide the plant's\
    \ health. If there is any change in the \nvalue,the user will be informed on the\
    \ web server itself. Machine learning learns from the past data and implements\
    \ \naccordingly.  \n \nIOT marked its significance to help in the real-time monitoring\
    \ of the data. The user can monitor the data of the \nsensors on the local host.\
    \ IOT is mainly used in an intelligentwatering system where the moisture level\
    \ of the soil is \nmonitored,and if the moisture level reduces below the threshold\
    \ value, the system starts the pump to water the field. \nEffective use of the\
    \ available fresh water is essential and with the advancement in the technology\
    \ and application of \nautomation water crisis can be solved.  \n \nTraditional\
    \ methods in agriculture have minor effects in this modern world. Water scarcity\
    \ and flooding both are the \nmajor problems farmers are facing using the traditional\
    \ approach. Many loop holes in this system and the alarming \nneed to protect\
    \ the agricultural land leads to the development of agriculture automation. This\
    \ paper represents an \nidea to make a system with the use of sensors, IOT and\
    \ machine learning to automate the traditional practices in \nagriculture. The\
    \ idea is to implement ANN and KNN method both in the same system. Raspberry Pi\
    \ module has \nalgorithms of the KNN methodwhich helps the machine to learn from\
    \ the previous data set of crop selection, crop \ngrowth and crop yield to give\
    \ the data to the farmer. Whilethe ANN method continually measures the soil health\
    \ and \nsends the data to the cloud. Use of more layers gives better results and\
    \ more segregated data.  The data is stored on \nthe web server which then can\
    \ be visible to the farmer on the web browser and on the mobile phone too. Real-time\
    \ \nmonitoring of all the data given by the sensors and machines is possible with\
    \ the use of IOT. The HTML code is \ndumped into the Wi-Fi module and as a result,\
    \ farmer can view the data on the local host of the web browser.  This \npaper\
    \ discusses various ideas where advanced technologies can be used to reduce the\
    \ efforts in agriculture. In future, \nif the proposed idea is carriedforward,\
    \ then it would lead to a great reduction in labour, easy agriculture practices,\
    \ \neffective use of water resources and less power consumption. \n \nISSN: 2320-5407\

    \ to the ongoing domestic and international\nlockdown for COVID-19. Many have\
    \ already lost their jobs, and businesses have been unstable in the\nCorona era.\
    \ Apart from educational institutions, banks, privately owned institutions, and\
    \ agriculture,\nthere are signs of economic recession in almost all sectors. The\
    \ roles of modern technology, the\nInternet of things, and artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ are undeniable in helping the world achieve economic\nprosperity in the post-COVID-19\
    \ economic downturn. Food production must increase by 60% by\n2050 to meet global\
    \ food security demands in the face of uncertainty such as the COVID-19 pandemic\n\
    and a growing population. Given COVID 19’s intensity and isolation, improving\
    \ food production\nand distribution systems is critical to combating hunger and\
    \ addressing the double burden of\nmalnutrition. As the world’s population is\
    \ growing day by day, according to an estimation world’s\npopulation reaches 9.6\
    \ billion by 2050, so there is a growing need to modify the agriculture methods,\n\
    technologies so that maximum crops can be attained and human effort can be reduced.\
    \ The urban\nsmart vertical farming (USVF) is a solution to secure food production,\
    \ which can be introduced at\nany adaptive reuse, retroﬁt, or new buildings in\
    \ vertical manners. This paper aims to provide a\ncomprehensive review of the\
    \ concept of USVF using various techniques to enhance productivity\nas well as\
    \ its types, topologies, technologies, control systems, social acceptance, and\
    \ beneﬁts. This\nreview has focused on numerous issues, challenges, and recommendations\
    \ in the development of the\nsystem, vertical farming management, and modern technologies\
    \ approach.\nKeywords: automation; smart vertical farming; sensors; Internet of\
    \ Things; urban farming\n1. Introduction\nIn the 21st century, urbanization will\
    \ be faster, and the population will reach 6.3 billion\nby 2050. 67.2% or 6.5\
    \ billion of these, are expected to live in urban areas [1]. To feed this\ngrowing,\
    \ increasingly urbanized population, the United Nations estimates food demand\n\
    needs to rise by 70% [2,3]. Rapid changes in urban built-up areas and skylines\
    \ in providing\nbuildings and infrastructures to cater to the city center’s larger\
    \ population have altered the\nurban climate into unhealthy living conditions.\
    \ This situation threatens the demand for\nthe basic needs of urban dwellers for\
    \ a livable urban living environment. Furthermore, a\nlarger urban population\
    \ also demands a fresh and good quality food supply [4]. Urban\nsmart vertical\
    \ farming (USVF) is one of the potential solutions to help societies meet this\n\
    elevated demand without additional farmland [5–7]. Figure 1 shows the statistical\
    \ data\nabout the use of vertical farming (VF) market in the world 2019 and 2025\
    \ respectively. In\nrecent years, the global VF market has been increasing steadily\
    \ as population sizes grow\nand urban living becomes more common in urban cities.\
    \ The VF industry reached some\n$4.4 billion in 2019, but the market size is estimated\
    \ to rise to $15.7 billion by 2025. The\nopportunity to utilize vertical space\

    \ to provide an ideal environment\nfor the crop chosen.\nNowadays, automation\
    \ plays a vital role in every ﬁeld of life. Some examples are\nmanufacturing,\
    \ transportation, agriculture, utilities, defense, facility operation [16,17].\
    \ The\nbeneﬁts of automation can be applied in water and wastewater, oil and gas,\
    \ electric power\nand telecommunication systems. Automation is generally used\
    \ in many ﬁelds because it\nreduces human effort, is easy to handle, and is more\
    \ effective and efﬁcient. By the name of\nagriculture, farm automation can automate\
    \ most of the agriculture ﬁelds’ processes, such\nas controlling watering systems\
    \ or ﬂow control and moisture control [18,19]. Similarly, it\ncan build a robot/drone\
    \ for spraying pesticides and plowing [20]. Harvesting machinery\nis also used\
    \ for such purposes: a user-friendly farm automation system, easy user control\n\
    for a layman, control water, plant health condition, and crop production [21].\n\
    In terms of human health, the World Health Organization estimates that more than\n\
    half of the world’s farms still use untreated animal waste as fertilizer, which\
    \ attracts ﬂies\nand may contain weed seeds or diseases that can be transmitted\
    \ to plants. VF has the ability\nto produce crops throughout the year, with greater\
    \ control over food safety and biosecurity,\nwhile also lowering inputs such as\
    \ water, pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers [7]. Food\nprotection is a major\
    \ concern of our day, as there have been several incidents of events\naround the\
    \ world resulting in food recalls due to bacterial infectious diseases, resulting\n\
    in billion-dollar losses. After the crop has been picked, the washing of ﬁeld-grown\
    \ items\nposes a further risk of infection from various bacteria and pathogens.\
    \ This stage, on the\nother hand, has the potential to contaminate the entire\
    \ manufacturing process [22]. While\nthe whole world is badly affected by COVID-19,\
    \ the terrible clutches of natural disasters\nstill plague many people worldwide.\
    \ All scientists’ projections show that the number and\nseverity of climate-related\
    \ disasters are increasing due to climate change, which is cutting\noff the COVID\
    \ virus infection and public health response in the wake of the epidemic. The\n\

    \ of corona and natural disasters has\nan unprecedented impact on economics. Multiple\
    \ reports (e.g., global warming of 1.5 ◦C)\nhave already indicated that one of\
    \ the features of the 21st century will be deforestation,\nbiodiversity loss,\
    \ climate chaos, and global epidemics; COVID-19 might be the latest\nmanifestation\
    \ of this, which has pointed to the horrible meaning of ‘global economy crisis\n\
    emergency’. Since COVID-19 will have a long-term impact, now is the time to prepare\
    \ to\nintroduce USVF.\nUSVF should become an opportunity for urban dwellers to\
    \ producing their food,\ndespite the limited agricultural land in the city center.\
    \ Integration of any available potential\nspaces inside and outside the building\
    \ by adaptive reuse and retroﬁt as part of the urban\nfarming (UF) technology\
    \ should be taken seriously and fully utilized. The design should\nconsider less\
    \ human intervention in operation due to the hectic life of urbanites. An appli-\n\
    cation of the Internet of things (IoT) can be incorporated into monitoring and\
    \ controlling in\nthe USVF system [23,24]. Thus, the UF technology can have bigger\
    \ involvement and contri-\nbution of urban dwellers. Besides producing their foods,\
    \ it contributes to the improvement\nin a healthy living environment and on urban\
    \ microclimate. UF offers an once-in-a-lifetime\nchance to grow food on already\
    \ built soil, maximize domestic food production, and reduce\nfood travel distances.\n\
    This study will include an in-depth examination of the philosophy of USVF as a\
    \ means\nof enhancing efﬁciency, including its forms, topologies, technologies,\
    \ control structures,\nsocial acceptance, and beneﬁts. This review concentrated\
    \ on a variety of issues, challenges,\nand recommendations related to the system’s\
    \ growth, vertical farming management, and\nmodern technology approach. The importance\
    \ of USVF how it plays a vital role in the\neconomy serve as the starting point\
    \ for this review. As the world’s population is growing\nday by day, there is\
    \ a need to modify those orthodox agriculture methods to fulﬁll the\nincreasing\
    \ demand for food. This modiﬁcation can be done by automating the agriculture\n\
    farm. This idea of agriculture farm automation wants to control water consumption,\
    \ the\nmoisture level of soil and water ﬂow, topologies, technologies, control\
    \ systems, social\nacceptance and enables an agricultural business to be more\
    \ productive, efﬁcient and\nproﬁtable.\n2. Types, General Structure and Materials\
    \ of Vertical Farming\nVertical farming (VF) is a practical technology through\
    \ which large quantities of food\ncrops and medicinal plants can be produced in\
    \ a very small space only with the help of\nadvanced technology [25].\n2.1. Types\
    \ of Vertical Farm\nVF is practiced in about 13 different ways in the modern world\
    \ and each way is so\ntechnologically advanced that it is enough to revolutionize\
    \ agriculture [26]. The following\nsection represents a few types of VF utilized\
    \ for smart UF that are rapidly evolving,\ndiversifying, and improving in the\
    \ future of agriculture [7].\n2.1.1. Hydroponics\nHydroponics is a system that\
    \ can be called a key part of VF [26,27]. Very slowly,\nthis system has gained\
    \ popularity. Hydroponics is an approach to developing vegetation\nbarring soil.\
    \ Instead of having their roots supported and nourished by soil, the plant is\
    \ often\nirrigated and supported with the aid of an inert developing medium like\
    \ cocopeat and is\nfed through nutrient-rich water that is indispensable to maintain\
    \ plant growth. Hydroponic\nstructures use 60–70% much less water than regular\
    \ conventional agriculture [28,29]. In\nthis method, the plant roots are immersed\
    \ in the mixture of essential nutrients of the plant\ninstead of the soil, in\
    \ which case the nutrients have to be mixed in the right proportions.\nFigure\
    \ 2 shows the structure of the hydroponics VF in Sweden [30]. Hydroponic VF\n\
    provides many advantages over traditional agriculture, including more productive\
    \ use\nof water and soil, and a substantial reduction in transport costs is carried\
    \ out in urban\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n4 of 40\nareas. However, this paradigm\

    Lighting plays an important role in making food for a crop in VF [53]. In the\
    \ VF\nsystem, since the trees are one on top of the other, sunlight cannot reach\
    \ the trees in the\nmiddle of the day. However, to solve this problem, the trees\
    \ should be kept in a place\nwhere they get enough sunlight at the beginning of\
    \ the day and artiﬁcial light all time. The\nconventional light-emitting diode\
    \ (LED) technologies produce 28% efﬁciency. However,\nmaking an indoor agriculture\
    \ system cost-effective LED requires more efﬁciency, at least\naround 50–60% [54,55].\
    \ The work in [55] proposed two techniques LED or high-pressure\nsodium, to overcome\
    \ such lighting issues to grow better crops in VF. In [56], the authors\nindicated\
    \ the application of LED as greenhouse lighting, and it becomes popular in VF\
    \ in\nterms of its lower energy requirements, long lifetime, low cost.\nPlants\
    \ require blue light with a wavelength of 610–720 nm and red light with a\nwavelength\
    \ of 400–520 nm. The study in [57], evaluated the use of LEDs in place of natural\n\
    light to illuminate the plant. The ﬁndings indicated that the LED light would\
    \ assist plants\nin growing with the used of 3:1 ratio of red and blue LED light\
    \ to produce a reddish purple\ncolor. The perfect color combination for plants\
    \ and vegetables has been determined to be\nblue and red. This composition is\
    \ ideal for promoting rapid plant growth. The combination\nof 23% blue and 77%\
    \ red produces optimal plant growth performance [58].\n2.3.3. Solar PV\nSolar\
    \ PV is a farming method but different from the other traditional methods such\
    \ as\nrooftop VF. It is gaining more popularity in terms of enormous used solar\
    \ which is available\nin the urban area [59]. Usually, the crop growth boosts\
    \ up in the VF by photosynthetic\nactive radiation, and it is not enough Solar\
    \ power must be collected by a collection of\nmirrors from the city’s structures\
    \ to reduce the need for supplemental artiﬁcial light [60].\nAs a result, VF is\
    \ looking for alternatives by looking at solar PV as a source of energy.\n2.3.4.\
    \ Water\nIn agriculture such as VF, water is used to produce fresh crops. The\
    \ use of agricultural\nwater makes it possible to produce crops, vegetables. The\
    \ study in [61] addressed a VF\ntechnology that requires 70% less water and the\
    \ amount of water required is also recyclable.\nHistorically, users of traditional\
    \ agricultural systems were expected to manually check the\nwater level in their\
    \ water tanks. Moreover, uncontrolled water use leads to wastage of\nwater, which\
    \ ultimately causes water scarcity to terminate. In [25], the author indicated\n\
    that showers and washing hand water could be used by ﬁltered other than rainwater\
    \ in\nthe smart VF system, which may help optimize water use. In [61,62], the\
    \ authors indicated\nthrough the geoponics method, water utilizes less than 70%\
    \ in VF, while the hydroponics\ntechnique still using 70% water. Water automation\
    \ systems can be used in VF technologies\nto reduce human effort and error. Additionally,\
    \ users can use an Android program to turn\non and off the water pump. This is\

    \ [82]. These methods are less accurate than the \ndirect method but are less\

    \ to measure acidity, power of hydrogen\nvalue, and alkalinity of substances.\
    \ The use of pH sensors plays a vital role in the industry,\nagriculture, manufacturing,\
    \ pharmaceutical, etc. [21,84,85]. In [84,86], the authors indicated\nusing a\
    \ pH sensor to ﬁnd the nutrient level of agriculture soil that connects to the\
    \ Arduino\nmicrocontroller, reducing fertilizers used in smart agriculture. The\
    \ authors also addressed\npH sensors to collect and monitor real data from different\
    \ soil of SF, which save to cloud\nserver. However, the unnecessary growth of\
    \ the plant in the agriculture farm does not\ngrow well for crops. Therefore,\
    \ to overcome such a problem, pH sensor plays a vital role\nin SF.\nSensor of\
    \ Electrical Conductivity\nThe electrical conductivity sensor is largely used\
    \ in SF to measure the soil solute\nconcentration [87,88]. However, there are\
    \ still some limitations to use it properly in the SF.\nIn [88], the authors addressed\
    \ the soil contains some water and salt that harmful to grow\nup crops, which\
    \ can measure using an electrical conductivity sensor based on Faraday’s\nlaw.\
    \ The study in [89] showed an electrical conductivity sensor used to overcome\
    \ soil\nlimitations, such as measuring soil pore water, reducing cost and saving\
    \ working time.\nTemperature Sensor\nUsually, temperature sensors are used to\
    \ measure soil temperature in the farm\nplant [90,91]. The work in [90] indicated\
    \ the importance of plant growth based on tem-\nperature control processes such\
    \ as photosynthesis, transpiration, absorption. In [92], the\nauthors proposed\
    \ an aeroponic system in agriculture, which indicated plant growth and\ndevelopment\
    \ through temperature. Therefore, the temperature sensor plays an important\n\
    role to measure soil temperature, which increases the efﬁciency of plant growth\
    \ and more\ncrops.\nElectromagnetic Sensor\nElectromagnetic sensors calculate\
    \ the potential of soil particles to conduct or produce\nelectrical charge using\
    \ electric circuits [73,93]. As these sensors are used, the soil is now an\nelectromagnetic\
    \ loop, and any changes in local conditions have an instant impact on the\noutput\
    \ captured by a data acquisition system. In [93], the authors indicated electromagnetic\n\
    sensors for soil measure have become smaller, more rugged, faster, more accurate,\
    \ more\nenergy-efﬁcient, wireless, and smarter.\n3.3. Smartphone Sensor Technologies\
    \ in Smart Farming\nTelecommunications advances are allowing the rapid and more\
    \ reliable delivery of\nsensed data on a global scale. A sensor is a device that\
    \ detects and reacts to an electri-\ncal signal. Traditional phone sensing systems\
    \ need additional infrastructure, which is\nunaffordable to the majority of consumers.\
    \ Smartphones have advanced at a breakneck\npace in recent years, and they have\
    \ evolved into an integral part of everyday life. The\nsensors embedded in them\
    \ allow a variety of mobile application, which are assisting and\ntransforming\
    \ our way of life. Mobile sensors technology can enhance UF by improving\nconnectivity,\
    \ increasing the ﬂow of information, ensuring traceability for large buyers, and\n\
    creating economic opportunities [94,95]. This section illustrates concepts of\
    \ mobile sensors\ntechnology in SF that are currently using in the smartphone\
    \ and comparison among several\nresearch outcomes.\nSensors are a tool that measures\
    \ a physical amount and converts to a signal which\ncan be read and utilized by\
    \ other devices. Most of the mobile sensors are equipped on\nsmartphones. Numerous\
    \ forms of sensors are available nowadays, and several common\nsmartphones include\
    \ accelerometers, GPS, illumination sensors, temperature sensors, gy-\nroscope,\
    \ and barometer. These sensors evolved into a high-quality database for tracking\n\
    many facets of a user’s everyday activities. Three types of sensors are installed\
    \ in smart-\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n13 of 40\nphones: motion sensors, ambient\
    \ sensors, and location sensors [94]. The following Table 1\nsummarizes and illustrates\
    \ a set of popular sensors found in today’s mainstream smart-\nphones. The ﬁrst\
    \ category, motion sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, gravity\nsensors,\
    \ and rotational vector sensors, provides acceleration force and rotational force\
    \ mea-\nsurements. Environmental sensors, on the other hand, provide observations\
    \ of the ambient\nenvironment. This includes measuring the ambient air temperature\
    \ with a thermometer\nand the atmospheric pressure with a barometer, as well as\
    \ lighting with a photometer. Place\nsensors, on the other hand, provide information\
    \ about the physical location of the system.\nMagnetometers, GPS, and orientation\
    \ sensors are examples of location sensors [94].\nTable 1. Familiar smartphone\

    \ are largely used in the SF to predict and assist with necessary\nmaintenance\
    \ [96,97]. The study reported in [96] presented accelerometer sensor plays an\n\
    important role in monitoring the conventional use of equipment in the SF. In [98],\
    \ the\nauthors indicated accelerometer sensors detect running components or motor’s\
    \ health\nconditions through motion, speed, vibration inconsistencies. Therefore,\
    \ users can easily\ntrack the component health condition using an android application\

    \ and mobile devices [94,99]. In [94], the authors indicated a\ngyroscope sensors\
    \ application to detect conventional equipment rotation in SF using an\nandroid\
    \ phone. However, the drawback of this gyroscope sensors application in smart\
    \ VF\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n14 of 40\ndifﬁcult to implement in terms of\
    \ requiring a complex mathematical model to conducts a\nsignal.\n3.3.3. Light\
    \ Sensor\nThe term “smart agriculture techniques” refers to the practice of using\
    \ a sensor system\nto regulate the amount of light available [100,101]. The light\
    \ sensor is a semiconductor chip\nthat detects the presence or absence of light\
    \ and darkness. Photoresistors, photodiodes,\nand phototransistors are all examples\
    \ of light sensors. The study in [100] proposed artiﬁcial\nlighting as a suitable\
    \ option to conﬁrm most of the time availability of light for the healthy\nplant\
    \ in smart agriculture. However, the drawback of artiﬁcial lighting in the SF\
    \ fault\nﬁnds out and unnecessary light in the daytime. Therefore, to detect the\
    \ fault and On/OFF\nartiﬁcial light system in the smart farm using an android\
    \ phone application which reduces\nthe human effort and optimize cost [102].\n\
    3.3.4. Magnetometer Sensor\nBasically, magnetometer sensors are used in SF to\
    \ measure the direction of the workers,\nsuch as walk forwards, walk backward,\
    \ run, harvest fruit. The advantages of using the\nsensors by mobile phone which\
    \ help farmers with decision-making, enabling them to have\na deeper, richer knowledge\
    \ about their farms [94].\n3.3.5. Proximity Sensor\nThe proximity sensors utilize\
    \ to monitor crop ﬂow during collection data in VF [94].\nIn [71], the authors\
    \ usually indicated crop plant temperature control from a heat source\nmeasured\
    \ by a proximity sensor in SF. The study in [94,103] reported proximity sensors\
    \ are\nutilized to measure grain yield in the agriculture farm, which helps to\
    \ reduce human effort,\nmeasure accurate crop, save time, and can work in harsh\
    \ environmental conditions. How-\never, proximity sensors’ drawbacks can detect\
    \ only the metallic target, and the operation\nrange also limited.\n3.3.6. Humidity\
    \ Sensor\nNowadays, the demand for humidity sensors is gaining popularity in SF\
    \ [104,105].\nThe work in [105] addressed humidity sensors play an important role\
    \ in SF, such as tracking\nthe water level of plants, environmental monitoring,\
    \ which suitable time for proper crop\nselection. The authors also indicated the\
    \ humidity sensors are steady and ﬂexible at\nmeasure bio-interface. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges still occur for the awareness of capable\nand wide-scale manufacture\
    \ of adjustable humidity sensors for bio-interface applications.\nIn [106], the\
    \ authors indicated humidity sensors increase their demand in agriculture\nfarming\
    \ by controlling the humidity created by porous materials, namely metal-organic\n\
    structure due to their large porosity and tunable shape. However, the drawback\
    \ of this\nmetal-organic structure is its response time is high and displays a\
    \ narrow sensing range.\n3.3.7. Carbon-Based Sensor\nThe carbon-based sensor has\
    \ many beneﬁts as opposed to other types of sensors. The\ncarbon-based structures\
    \ used in sensor applications are carbon nanotube (CNT), nanodia-\nmond (ND),\
    \ fullerene (FLN) and graphene (GPN). Due to their superior electrical, thermal,\n\
    mechanical, and chemical properties, nanodiamonds, fullerenes, graphenes, nanotubes,\n\
    and hybrid structures have been widely used. Carbon nanostructures, as described\
    \ in [107],\nexhibit a high degree of selectivity, especially when functionalized.\
    \ Carbon nanostructures\nhave grown in popularity as gas sensor applications due\
    \ to their promising structure,\nwhich enables gas detection and quantiﬁcation.\
    \ The high surface-to-volume ratio and\nhollow composition make this material\
    \ suitable for gas adsorption and desorption. The\nidentiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation\
    \ of polluting gases, especially hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S),\ncarbon monoxide (CO),\
    \ carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxide (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and\nmethane, is\
    \ one of the primary applications of carbonaceous materials as gas sensors (CH4).\n\
    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n15 of 40\nThe special properties of nanomaterials,\
    \ such as their compact scale, large surface area, and\nreactivity, make them\
    \ ideal for use in agriculture. CNTs (carbon nanotubes) are primarily\nused in\
    \ agriculture for germination rate, initial crop production, pesticides, and biosensor\n\
    diagnostic tools and evaluation [108]. Nanotechnology is important in the puriﬁcation\n\
    of water. Carbon nanotubes can be used to purify wastewater [109,110]. Adsorption\
    \ and\ndegradation/detoxiﬁcation are the primary strategies for removing contaminants\
    \ from\nsamples using carbon nanotubes. Additionally, not only is it necessary\
    \ to remove toxins\nfrom various environmental compartments, but it is also necessary\
    \ to control pollution\nlevels. Carbon-based nanomaterials can be used to create\
    \ novel, highly effective biochemi-\ncal sensors for the detection of chemical\
    \ compounds at extremely low concentrations in\na variety of environments. In\
    \ [111], the authors stated that carbon-based nanomaterials\nwill account for\
    \ 40% of all nanotechnology contributions to agriculture, both as additives\n\
    and active parts. The bulk of these implementations are currently in their infancy,\
    \ and this\nsection will highlight some interesting methods.\n3.4. Sensors Technology\
    \ in Farming to Monitoring of the Healthy Growth of Crops\nThe proper growth of\
    \ plants is important to enhance the quality of the crop in the smart\nVF. The\
    \ economic and beneﬁt depend on the proper healthy growth of the plant. However,\n\
    there are some essential elements that are required for the growth of plants,\
    \ such as crop life,\nnutrients, crops health condition, and micronutrients [112,113].\
    \ Therefore, monitoring the\nhealth condition of each plant of agriculture farming\
    \ is essential [114]. Therefore, different\ntypes of sensors utilize to overcome\
    \ such issues in smart VF. Table 2 shows the summary of\nthe method used for crop\
    \ health growth monitoring using a different type of camera model\nsensors in\
    \ SF. This list consists of various types, brands, model numbers and application\
    \ in\nSF. The sensor application in SF includes counting faster crop damage accuracy,\
    \ monitoring\nand detecting defect crop growth, and diagnosing the nitrogen of\
    \ crop and tracking leaf\ndamage from the insect.\nTable 2. Review of methods\

    Electronics 2021, 10, 1422\n17 of 40\nIn [115,128] authors proposed Canon PowerShot\
    \ SX20 and Canon PowerShot SX30\nsensors in farming applications because of cheap,\
    \ easy to manage, and potential versatility\nto count faster crop damage accuracy.\
    \ The study in [116,122] reported a Canon EOS REBEL\nT2i and Sony DSC-W80 sensors\
    \ in agriculture application used to monitor and detect crop\ngrowth. However,\
    \ these sensors’ drawback is that image quality is still inferior and not\nperforming\
    \ well in low light. On the other hand, its advantage performs well in a suitable\n\
    lighting atmosphere and low cost. In [117,121], the authors reported visible spectrum\n\
    cameras and 8 MP camera sensors to measure the early stages of crops grown in\
    \ SF\napplications. The merit of such sensors might work in various lighting environments\
    \ with\nstrong controlling efﬁciency and robustness. Therefore, it is suitable\
    \ for VF applications.\nThe study reported in [119,124] proposed high-resolution\
    \ and Raspberry Pi camera sensors\nin agriculture applications to diagnose the\
    \ nitrogen of crops and track leaf damage from\ninsects. It is suitable in VF\
    \ terms of its longevity, fast counting capability, and continuous\nact without\
    \ damage. The study in [120,123] addressed E450 Olympus and ﬂoral reﬂectance\n\
    sensors in agriculture application to observation insects on each leaf and plant\
    \ growth. The\nsensors gain popularity in terms of simple to use, deliver robust\
    \ real data in a short time,\nand strong controlling capability. In [125,137],\
    \ the authors reported an inverted microscope\nand plant village sensors in SF\
    \ application to automatically monitor health conditions in\nplants, which is\
    \ easy to implement, no need complex mathematical model. The authors\nin [138–140]\
    \ reported DFK 23GM021, Hyper HAD CCD, and Logitech digital webcam\nsensors in\
    \ agriculture application to monitor selecting crops in a greenhouse environment\n\
    and various weeds automatically. However, those sensors’ limitation is the accuracy\n\
    required to be enhanced in terms of data delivery time, efﬁciency, and cost. Therefore,\
    \ to\novercome these issues optimization techniques can be utilized.\nThe study\
    \ in [126,141] reported 0.9R-G and JAI AD-130GE sensors in agriculture\napplication\
    \ for proper identiﬁcation of crops cherries and sweet pepper automatically\n\
    in the USVF. However, the challenges are its complexity, cost, and overall efﬁciency\
    \ still\nvery poor. In [127,142,143], the authors proposed a camcube 3.0, UniﬂyM216,\
    \ and MV-\nVDM033SM/SC sensors in agriculture application to harvest the crops\
    \ such as apple,\ncarrot automatically by a robot in SF. The approach has high\
    \ efﬁciency, low cost, and high\nprecision for the overall system compared to\
    \ conventional methods. However, the main\nlimitations are its monitoring accuracy,\
    \ such as nighttime, tracking the exact position of\ncrops. In [129,131,132],\
    \ the authors proposed Monochrome CCD, SONY NEX5N, and\nSONY DSC-W530 sensors\
    \ in agriculture applications to detect crop growth such as tomato,\npotatoes.\
    \ Therefore, the main advantages of such sensors in USVF overall efﬁciency, large\n\
    accuracy, low error, and easy maintenance. In [133,144,145], the authors proposed\
    \ an\nunmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with geolocation, a UAV platform equipped,\
    \ quadrotor\nUAV-RGB, senseFly eBee with RGB and CIR sensors in agriculture application\
    \ to detect\nheight, biomass automatically of crop plants. Therefore, the main\
    \ advantage of such sensors\nin SF is that they are stable, perform well, have\
    \ small defects, are easy to adapt to new\ntechnology, and they have a simple\
    \ operation.\nFigure 11 shows the smartphone applications in agriculture and the\

    4. IoT Framework on Smart Farming\nWith the development of technology and knowledge-science,\
    \ human thought-\nconsciousness is developing. As a result, everything is changing.\
    \ The revolutionary\ndevelopment of life and human thought in the world over the\
    \ last few decades is far more\nexemplary than the changes in the previous few\
    \ centuries. The transformation of the\nagricultural sector, like all other sectors,\
    \ is much more pronounced. Information-driven\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n19\
    \ of 40\nadvances, when all is said in done, are rapidly progressing with the\
    \ improvement of the IoT\nand may turn into a signiﬁcant piece of things to come\
    \ of farming [146–148]. All modern\nmethods are now being followed to ensure more\
    \ production on less land to meet the needs\nof the age, for example, IoT technology\
    \ in USVF. In [149–151], the authors proposed an IoT\na very modern technology\
    \ in SF in which farmers can ﬁnd out problems of yield, such as\nlacking water,\
    \ crop productivity, yield weakness, and also provide quick solutions to such\n\
    issues. In the study [152,153], authors reported a producing efﬁcient yield controlling\
    \ the\natmosphere situation, soil preparation, crop monitoring by IoT. The study\
    \ also indicated\nIoT delivers real-time sensing data which aids in efﬁcient crop\
    \ production.\nFigure 12 shows details IoT based SF structure. The IoT-based SF\
    \ framework consists\nof six interconnected sub-systems: a physical layer, network\
    \ layer, middleware layer,\nservice layer, analytics layer, and user experience\
    \ layer [154–156]. The physical layer\nof SF is consists of various types of components\
    \ such as sensors, actuators, controllers,\nswitches, network gateways, routers,\
    \ etc. The controller is an essential part of this layer\nwhich plays an important\
    \ role in SF to connect network-related functionalities as well\nas other operations\
    \ of sensors and actuators. The main feature of the network layer is\ncapable\
    \ of transferring root-level data from sensors which use different purpose in\
    \ VF.\nThe network layer is a vital technical layer for smart cultivating, which\
    \ is important for\nsending speciﬁc information, network connectivity to the application\
    \ layer. The network\nlayer incorporates various types of wired and remote interfaces\
    \ for associating the weeding\nmachine, food harvester, and for correspondence\
    \ of machines and sensors with cloud\nframeworks. However, the challenge of the\
    \ network layer in SF where IoT generated a\nhuge amount of data is not only the\
    \ reason for storage or maintenance but also the reduction\nof network efﬁciency\
    \ [157,158]. The middleware layer assumes an essential function to\nboost IoT\
    \ security in SF. In [159,160], the authors indicated an IoT-based middleware\
    \ acts\nas device controlling, setting management, sensation, platform ability,\
    \ and surveillance\nrelevant tasks. Middleware remains in the middle of the utilization\
    \ layer and network\nlayer which are capable of handling information and gives\
    \ a combination for connection\nbetween these layers. However, the middleware\
    \ layer includes safe and sensitive data\nstorage, and data transfer over wireless\
    \ is extremely difﬁcult in IoT deployments. IoT\ncloud support service layer assumes\
    \ a vital part in giving distributed storage, Software-as-\na-Service (SaaS) to\
    \ farming issues. Sensor information procurement, materials recognition,\ncrop\
    \ health condition data monitoring, factual investigation administrations are\
    \ cleared to\nencourage the detecting, activating, and infection recognition operation\
    \ [21,68,161]. The\nanalytics layer’s aim is to ensure big data processing for\
    \ crop production investigation\nyield efﬁciency based on environment condition.\
    \ Another sensor-based IoT system for\nthe analytics layer was presented in [162],\
    \ which ensures crop implement fragmentation,\ncompression, and a reassembly mechanism.\
    \ However, the main drawback of the analytics\nlayer in SF since its direct use\
    \ on IoT devices is not viewed as sensible [149,163,164]. The\nuser experience\
    \ layer is developed to aid the purpose of farmer yield productivity, such\nas\
    \ crop growth condition, efﬁciency, soil quality, and environmental situation.\
    \ IoT plays\na vital role to monitor, control, and deliver to farmers an overall\
    \ situation of VF yield\ncondition by different sensors. However, the main challenges\
    \ still most of the IoT sensors\npower by the battery. Therefore, to overcome\
    \ these issues, energy harvesting technology\ncan be utilized to replace batteries.\n\

    \ which is very helpful in remote areas.\nPiezoelectric buzzer\n[193]\nA piezoelectric\
    \ buzzer is one kind of sensor when sound is appalled, and it produces voltage.\
    \ They are utilized in many ﬁelds such as\nenergy harvesting, low power sensors,\
    \ and also SF. Its application in SF to run low-power sensors reduces the dependency\
    \ on the battery.\nElectronic speed control\n[21,194]\nConventional electronic\
    \ speed controllers in farming control room temperature, motor speed and regulate\
    \ the motor voltage. Using this\ndevice in modern farming plays an important role\
    \ in terms of its large energy efﬁciency, less pollution, stability.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n27 of 40\nAgriculture operates somewhat differently today than\
    \ it did a few decades before,\nprimarily due to technical advancements such as\
    \ sensors, processors, robots, and informa-\ntion technology. Agriculture now\
    \ routinely makes use of emerging technology, including\nrobotics, temperature\
    \ and moisture sensors, aerial photography, and GPS. These advanced\ntechnologies,\
    \ precision agriculture, and robotic systems allow businesses to operate more\n\
    proﬁtably, efﬁciently, safely, and sustainably. The primary objective of the Internet\
    \ of things\nis to create a vast network by integrating various sensor devices\
    \ such as GPS, remote\nsensing (RS), radio-frequency identiﬁcation (RFID), laser\
    \ scanners, and networks in or-\nder to comprehend the knowledge exchange of global\
    \ things. IoT can refer to millions\nof networked embedded smart devices capable\
    \ of accumulating data about themselves,\ntheir world, and other connected smart\
    \ devices and linking this data to other devices and\nsystems through the ubiquitous\
    \ Internet [195].\nAmbient daylight, ambient temperature, soil moisture, and humidity\
    \ are all control-\nlable parameters of vertical farming. In addition to the vertical\
    \ columns, the ambient\nparameters must be controlled for each stack, necessitating\
    \ the use of a separate collection\nof sensors for each vertical stack. These\
    \ sensors produce a large amount of data, necessitat-\ning the use of an effective\
    \ data management system. Numerous automation techniques\nare used to maximize\
    \ resource use, including the integration of actuation by automated\nirrigation\
    \ systems, as well as wireless monitoring via IoT in the VF, which is capable\
    \ of\nmanaging sensor data effectively, identifying duplicate sensor readings,\
    \ and visualizing it\nthrough web-based applications.\n4.5. Secure Cloud on Smart\
    \ Vertical Farming System\nThe growth of a country’s population and massive industrial\
    \ development, mainly in\nurban areas, lead to a variety of urbanization problems,\
    \ including housing, food demands,\nschooling, health, and poverty. A new farming\
    \ technique that utilizes minimal land\narea while producing a large crop with\
    \ a secure aspect is highly desired. In [196], the\nauthors addressed a two-factor\
    \ authentication (2FA) scheme to bolster the system’s security\nmeasures. Since\
    \ the electronic device mounted on the indoor farming hydroponic system\ncommunicates\
    \ over the Internet, the 2FA technique is used. Due to the fact that this\nhydroponic\
    \ system would be installed inside the user’s house, this electronic gadget\n\
    will be wired to the user’s home’s network or WIFI. This linking of the computer\
    \ to the\nInternet necessitates proper network protection to mitigate the possibility\
    \ of data leakage\nand sabotage. The 2FA framework will be applied in this system\
    \ through access codes\ngenerated by the gateway (NodeMCU) and a mobile application\
    \ for access veriﬁcation.\nFigure 16 illustrates the total security scheme’s ﬂowchart\
    \ using a 2FA mechanism. It starts\nwith the device module’s controller demanding\
    \ permission to send and receive data over\nthe network via the ThingsSentral-based\
    \ web module. ThingsSentral (TS) is a cloud-based\nIoT device network founded\
    \ by Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia. By supplying the user,\nprogram, and portal\
    \ access code to the TS web service, the controller initiates the ﬁrst\nauthentication\
    \ order. If the codes are valid, TS will send another authentication order.\n\
    The second authentication process generates a request for veriﬁcation and notiﬁcation\
    \ to\nthe customer with a phone app that they must authenticate a request before\
    \ the farming\nmodule can continue operating. The user will authenticate the order\
    \ if approved, at which\npoint TS will allow the remainder of the procedure before\
    \ the controller explicitly stops\nit. If the customer fails to authenticate,\
    \ the whole system is aborted, and the hydroponics\nmodule controller is informed\
    \ of the request’s denial.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n28 of 40\nElectronics\

    \ of Urban Farming\nThe study in [197] addressed as far as a social responsibility\
    \ of USVF contributes more\nin terms of reducing pollution, produce clean air\
    \ and fresh food without using artiﬁcial\nfertilizer. The authors in [198] indicated\
    \ USVF totally brings new technology to produce\nmore food using less water, without\
    \ soil which falls a very good impact on society. In [199],\nthe authors reviewed\
    \ 386 urban tenants in Berlin based on yield farming space capacity\nin an urban\
    \ area, cost, human effort, and overall food production efﬁciency. While over\n\
    80% of the occupants favored VF on the rooftop of the building in terms of sufﬁcient\
    \ light\nfacility, clean air, low pollution, environmental and ﬁnancial beneﬁts,\
    \ fresh food, easy to\nmonitor, simple maintenance, etc. Moreover, the greater\
    \ part of the respondents was eager\nto purchase agricultural items. The study\
    \ also reported in [199] presented a lack of food\ninsecurity produced from VF\
    \ of urban dwellers because of air contamination levels in urban\nareas. The work\
    \ in [200] analyzed 18 rooftop farming leaves and soil conditions compared\nwith\
    \ the natural crop leaf and soil in Korea. The authors in [201] demonstrated the\
    \ effect of\nrising temperatures on air quality at an outdoor rooftop farm atop\
    \ a seven-story building\nin Brooklyn through an on-site observation attempt.\
    \ In [202], the authors measured the\npollution level, crop production costs,\
    \ and monitoring capability in rooftop vegetable farms.\nTherefore, a USVF is\
    \ required to overcome the problem such as air pollution, huge cost,\nsufﬁcient\
    \ food production, various type of crop production all season.\nAdvantages of\
    \ Urban Smart Vertical Farming\nDue to rapid urbanization, USVF has been introduced\
    \ to achieve food security in\nan urban area. VF can be conceivably gainful in\
    \ expanding crop production and adding\nto maintainable UF. Notable beneﬁts of\
    \ rising food inside the urban area can be helpful\necologically, socially, and\
    \ monetarily. VF can also offer solutions for expanding food safety\nworldwide\
    \ [203]. In [203], the authors indicated several advantages in USVF such as raise\n\
    aesthetic beauty, energy generation, urban growth, organic food, preparation for\
    \ the future,\nconservation of resources, VF ﬂexibility, growing higher quality\
    \ produce, and halting mass\nextinction. Besides, the study in [204] addressed\
    \ that USVF has the beneﬁt of absorbing\npolluted carbon-di-oxide from the air\
    \ and increasing the level of pure oxygen in the air,\nenvironmentally friendly,\
    \ helps to control air pollution and noise pollution. As a result, it\nhas a fair\
    \ weight to maintain air quality. The advantages of USFV protect large houses\
    \ in\nthe city from direct sunlight and helps to keep them cool, helps in air\
    \ ﬁltration by absorbing\ndust. On the other hand, the work in [205] addressed\
    \ beneﬁts of these USVF include\nprotection from weather-related problems, utilize\
    \ technologies and devices, helps in air\nﬁltration by absorbing dust, year-round\
    \ production, huge food production within a small\narea of land.\nIn [206], the\
    \ authors described a VF plant structure that delivers a controlled environ-\n\
    ment, the efﬁciency of farms would generally be autonomous of weather and secure\
    \ from\na weather-related problem. The work in [22] addressed VF can produce foods\
    \ year-round.\nThe study in [22] also presented some crops such as different vegetables,\
    \ strawberries can\nproduce all seasons of the year which provides beneﬁt in terms\
    \ of crops could be sold in\nthe same infrastructures, they will not need to be\
    \ transported between production and sale.\nTherefore, USVF provides less spoilage,\
    \ reduces cost, infestation, and energy required than\nconventional farming encounters.\
    \ The advantages of VF reduce the unemployment rate\nand make a new job opportunity\
    \ for urban people who have less education and low expe-\nrience. The study reported\
    \ in [113] also presented a USVF with much ﬂexibility for crop\nproduction, such\
    \ as water protection, healthy food, cash income, not being labor-intensive,\n\
    manageability, marketability, affordability, and sustainability urban growth.\
    \ The authors\nalso indicated VF utilize for drip and hydroponics crop production,\
    \ which can save 50%\nlesser water than typical planting and can hold water. The\
    \ study in [44] also reported\ndelivering vegetables via VF is simply manageable\
    \ and farmers do not need much focus\non soil and plant during growing.\nElectronics\
    \ 2021, 10, 1422\n30 of 40\nBringing back vegetation in any approach deﬁnitely\
    \ improves the quality of the\nurban environment, which is the main goal of urban\
    \ VF. Urban agriculture via SF is also\nexpected to provide environmental beneﬁts\
    \ to urban dwellers. The improvements in urban\nthermal performance and air quality\
    \ reduce air temperature and energy usage for cooling\nloads. Despite providing\
    \ food security for urbanites, this SF system also able to promote a\nconducive\
    \ and liveable living urban environment. VF can manage by family workers such\n\
    as old people, women, young persons because of clean, safe, less dust, ease to\
    \ marketability\nwith high proﬁt. All these beneﬁts indicated a signiﬁcant impact\
    \ on the application of UF\nin the city context. USVF is to provide efﬁcient and\
    \ effective extension services based on\nthe needs of all classes of growers so\
    \ that they can make the best use of their resources and\ncontribute to sustainable\
    \ agricultural and socio-economic development.\n6. Issues and Challenges\nVF technology\
    \ plays an essential role in reducing future food demand, which is one of\nthe\
    \ world’s biggest problems today. However, existing VF technology faces few challenges\n\
    due to various issues, such as high starting cost, low yield variability, energy\
    \ reliance and\nutilization, producing heat by artiﬁcial lighting was presented\
    \ in [41,71,73,74]. In [73,74],\nthe authors reported VF technology would be gradually\
    \ becoming a non-proﬁt industry if\nnot focus on addressing the current issues\
    \ such as energy use, pollution, economy. As a\nresult, current farming is heading\
    \ for a crisis due to the evils of climate change and the lack\nof signiﬁcant\
    \ response to the use of more materials. As a result of high production costs\n\
    and the adverse effects of harmful chemicals used in agriculture on the environment,\
    \ smart\ntechnology’s high-material grain production technologies do not seem\
    \ to be viable enough\nto meet the needs of a growing population. Future crop\
    \ production is considered to be\nvery risky due to the prevalence of diseases\
    \ and inorganic impacts in the changing climate.\nOther than that, equipment location,\
    \ space, and environmental issues have to be taken\nseriously depending on VF’s\
    \ design to maximize crop production. Additionally, shape\nconsiderations such\
    \ as the form and dimensions of the increasing installation, as well as\nthe spacing\
    \ between plants, are a source of difﬁculty for VF. Leafy greens and herbs, for\n\
    example, the needless vertical spacing between tiers of a vertical rack than ﬂowers\
    \ or fruit\nplants. Additionally, lighting systems should be evaluated for their\
    \ heat management\ncharacteristics and conﬁgured to mitigate the warmth generated\
    \ by VF in order to minimize\nany possible adverse effect on development, while\
    \ allowing for adequate air circulation and\nventilation. It is crucial to keep\
    \ in mind that, while food developed using VF techniques\nmay be safer to eat\
    \ than food grown conventionally, hazards may still exist during the\ngrowing\
    \ phase. Dirt and microorganisms from employees, environmental hazards in the\n\
    nutrient medium, water cleanliness and protection, and post-farm handling activities\
    \ such\nas sorting, trimming, and transportation are all examples of such risks.\
    \ Thus, food safety\nmanagement methods such as hazard analysis critical control\
    \ point analysis, as well as food\nsafety assessment and testing, are critical\
    \ in VF, just as they are in traditional agriculture.\n7. Conclusions and Recommendations\n\
    USVF is a current improvement that shows promise for the future. They will be\
    \ open\nto the insistent and additional combination of current technologies and\
    \ in turn use growing\nconvenience and reduce the effort for humans. This review\
    \ considers the diverse ways of\nhow a USVF may be monitored, controlled, and\
    \ built using the IoT, AI, and sensors. The\ncontinuous ﬂow of real data accrued\
    \ from various sensors or systems deployed in a USVF\nis analyzed, and suitable\
    \ actions must be engaged. Although numerous trends exist, only\na few are being\
    \ utilized, and they suffer from certain drawbacks. Thus, the utilization of\n\
    smart technology shows better performance compared with the existing techniques.\n\
    The aim of this study is to recognize SF by conducting a comprehensive analysis\
    \ of the\nstate-of-the-art of IoT in USVF and identifying the most commonly used\
    \ hardware, plat-\nforms, network protocols, and technologies, as well as their\
    \ applicability to the proposed\nsolution. AI and image processing techniques\
    \ have become more prevalent in recent work\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n31 of\
    \ 40\nto develop intelligent farming management. According to the listed IoT applications\
    \ for SF,\nthe most prevalent application is crop monitoring. Signiﬁcant advancements\
    \ in technical\napplications have made it possible to integrate and link multiple\
    \ sensors in networks\nquickly. The microcontroller has been instrumental in the\
    \ rapid growth of IoT projects,\nespecially in the ﬁeld of precision agriculture.\n\
    Based on the literature survey, many past research works are summarized along\
    \ with\nthe various sensor types, technology, and techniques that are suitable\
    \ for the research. This\npaper reviews the USVF sensors categories, IoT technology,\
    \ and hardware components\nsuitable for monitoring and controlling water level,\
    \ crop health condition, moisture of soil,\nproduction of yield and environment.\
    \ The paper has also focused on a comprehensive\nexplanation of USVF technologies,\
    \ monitor and control operation, smart automation,\nstructure, materials, social\
    \ acceptance, beneﬁt, issues, and various trends and applications.\nFinally, the\
    \ study is suggested constructing a pervasive automation system USVF that\nreduces\
    \ human intervention to a minimum.\nThe review has proposed some signiﬁcant and\
    \ selective suggestions for the further\ntechnological developments of USVF based\
    \ on summarizing, synthesize and viewpoint\nfrom the reviewed literature. Some\
    \ possible improvements have been addressed in this\nreview below:\n•\nFocusing\
    \ on food production via USVF activities than using other conventional meth-\n\
    ods in the city, as mentioned in [7,25,203], USVF produces crops throughout the\
    \ year,\nwith greater control over food safety. This will reduce dependency on\
    \ imported\nvegetables.\n•\nEnhance the user control panel for non-technical users\
    \ who use SF. As a result, it is\npreferable to develop a user-friendly interface\
    \ for powerful applications in a control\npanel and based on user experience.\n\
    •\nAppropriate IoT architecture must be built to address the issue of partitioned\
    \ land\ncultivation, which is a concern in several countries around the world.\
    \ Adequate\nstrategy and preparations should be implemented in advance to address\
    \ this problem.\n•\nBy combining big data analytics and cloud-based computing,\
    \ a decision support\nframework can be developed to improve and forecast futuristic\
    \ yield estimation in\ncrop productivity, quality prediction, crop risk prevention,\
    \ and irregular growth.\n•\nRemote-controlled ﬁeld crop planting systems must\
    \ be built in such a way that au-\ntomated planting machines can plate farmers\
    \ more efﬁciently in the ﬁeld. Cloud\nmonitoring and remote multi-device visualization\
    \ have advanced to the point where\noperators/owners can track real-time manipulation.\n\
    •\nHaving a real-time livestock tracking system that enables cloud services to\
    \ improve\nthe farmer’s economic position intuitively. One basic limitation of\
    \ the majority of IoT\nsystems was their inability to conduct rapid data processing\
    \ over a wide range of\nsensor data sources.\n•\nUse big data analytics to address\
    \ disease management problems across many crops\nand to create a consolidated\
    \ farming machinery control system suitable for large-scale\nagriculture.\n•\n\
    Develop a predictive method for determining the pollination time.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ cost management strategies for large-scale agricultural industries dependent\n\
    on big data analytics.\n•\nProvide an easy-to-use climatic knowledge analytic\
    \ service for farmers.\n•\nAnalyze the proﬁt margins of agri-products using big\
    \ data modeling and a supply\nchain management framework.\n•\nAnalytics can provide\
    \ farmers with prior knowledge of the potential rot time of\nagricultural products,\
    \ thereby reducing loss and increasing beneﬁt in terms of value.\n•\nDevelop a\
    \ smart cell phone application to boost the physical farming situation.\n•\nDevelop\
    \ a web-based scheduling system for pesticide sprays based on crop type, rate,\n\
    and time.\nElectronics 2021, 10, 1422\n32 of 40\n•\nCreate a warning system, as\
    \ most systems use warnings to inform the operator/farmer\nof critical events.\n\
    •\nEstablish irrigation schedules based on sensor data and current weather forecasts.\n\
    Irrigation is often applied using sensor data to predict the required amount of\
    \ water\nand electricity accurately. Irrigation schemes, for example, often make\
    \ use of real-time\nweather forecasts to minimize water and energy consumption\
    \ and prevent excessive\nirrigation.\n•\nDevice security is a critical issue.\
    \ Develop a two-factor authentication scheme to\nbolster the protection of the\
    \ affordable indoor hydroponic system.\n•\nAdditional research should be conducted\
    \ on plants’ tolerance for elevated EC and/or\npH. Knowing how resistant plants\
    \ are too extreme pH levels enables device designers\nto create solutions that\
    \ handle hydroponic systems efﬁciently.\n•\nDrone based pesticide sprayer can\
    \ be made for an automatic spray of pesticides and\nfertilizers to get better\
    \ quality of crops with increased quantity. It could help the\nfarmers to spray\
    \ pesticides evenly throughout their agricultural lands.\n•\nFor a smart storage\
    \ house, we can install humidity and temperature sensors that can\nautomatically\
    \ turn the exhaust fan ON when certain humidity or temperature reaches\nthe temperature\
    \ danger zone for food. For food, this danger temperature zone is\nbetween 41\
    \ and 135 degrees for height.\n•\nFor water and food control for cattle, we can\
    \ use conveyor belts to automatically\nsupply food to cattle.\n•\nIncrease in\
    \ monetary income for urban dwellers that uses the smart urban farming\nsystem\
    \ to grow vegetables and sells unconsumed vegetables.\n•\nWe can install a biogas\
    \ plant in the farmhouse to meet all the electric requirements\nand to fully use\
    \ the waste materials of cattle.\n•\nWe can also install a circuit to automatically\
    \ get the power meter reading and electricity\nbills on our cell phone and hence\
    \ get up to date about the power consumption of\nUSVF.\n•\nAtmospheric pollutants\
    \ due to being in an urban environment have a negative effect\non the plants,\
    \ therefore by providing sufﬁcient water to plants (this aids in pollution\nremoval\
    \ and temperature reduction), we utilize long-lived and low-maintenance trees.\n\
    •\nfsUtilize carbon-based nanomaterials can be used as gas sensors to combat air\
    \ pol-\nlution, which has a detrimental effect on plant health, by detecting and\
    \ quantifying\npolluting gases, primarily hydrogen sulﬁde (H2S) and carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO) based\nin [107,108].\nAuthor Contributions: Writing—original draft preparation,\

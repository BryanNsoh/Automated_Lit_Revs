    wine grape grown in arid or semiarid regions is to sustain vine survival and to
    optimize berry attributes for quality wine production. Precision irrigation of
    wine grape is impeded by the lack of a smart, decision support system (DSS) to
    remotely monitor vine water status. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    and field test an Internet of Things (IoT) DSS system for precision irrigation
    of wine grape. The IoT system was comprised of a suite of in situ sensors used
    to monitor real-time weather conditions, grapevine canopy temperature, soil moisture,
    and irrigation amount. Sensor data were collected and stored on a field deployed
    data logger that calculated a daily thermal Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) for
    grapevine using a neural network model with real-time sensor data model inputs.
    The data logger also hosted, via a cellular modem, webpages showing a running,
    12-day history of daily CWSI, fraction of available soil moisture (fASW), irrigation
    amount, and other sensor data. The webpages were accessible to vineyard managers
    via cell phone or computer. The CWSI based IoT DDS system was installed at two
    small acreage, commercial estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over four
    growing seasons. At each vineyard site, the DSS was used daily by the vineyard
    irrigation manager to schedule irrigation events. Neither vineyard manager used
    any other quantitative vine water status monitoring tool for irrigation management
    decisions. The midday leaf water potential (LWP) of grapevines was routinely measured
    by research project personnel. Data collected over the study period at each vineyard
    showed a significant (p < 0.001) correlation with LWP and fASW, providing evidence
    that, under the conditions of this study, the daily CWSI based IoT provided automated,
    remote monitoring of vine water status. Both vineyard managers reported daily
    use of the DSS for irrigation scheduling decisions. Over the four-year study,
    each vineyard manager was able to maintain consistent seasonal average CWSI daily
    values and irrigation application amounts, despite yearly differences in climatic
    conditions. The results of this study demonstrate that a CWSI based IoT DSS can
    be used for precision irrigation of wine grape in a commercial vineyard under
    semiarid growing conditions. The CWSI based IoT DSS used a unique combination
    of neural network modeling, edge computing, and IoT for real-time vine water stress
    monitoring for precision irrigation. Previous article in issue Next article in

    support systemInternet of Things 1. Introduction Irrigation management of most
    field crops aims to avoid plant water stress and maximize yield by supplying water
    to fully meet crop evapotranspiration (ETc). However, in wine grape (Vitis vinifera
    L.), fruit quality attributes are prioritized over yield as a production goal,
    and development of the berry and vine canopy are related to vine water status
    throughout the growing season [1,2]. For example, mild vine water stress between
    veraison (berry softening) and harvest is desirable to prevent berry splitting
    or dilution of flavors or sugars and to slow canopy growth in preparation for
    winter dormancy. Inducing vine water stress through deficit irrigation has also
    been shown to increase vine water use efficiency [3], [4], [5]. Water resources
    in the western U.S. are experiencing unprecedented competitive demand from irrigated
    agriculture, growing urban populations, and environmental and ecosystem restoration.
    Groundwater levels in many areas have steadily decreased from historic levels
    and ground water use is approaching an unsustainable level. In addition, the western
    US is experiencing the worst megadrought since 800 CE [6] leading to historically
    low water levels in many of the regions water reservoirs. Warmer winter temperatures
    due to climate change are predicted to reduce future mountain snowpack, which
    is the source of early irrigation developments in much of the western U.S. The
    growing demand on surface and groundwater resources combined with climate change
    necessitates increased water resource stewardship and crop water productivity
    to meet food and fiber needs of a growing population. Wine grape production in
    semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. is well established but relies
    on irrigation during the growing season for vine growth, survival, and economically
    viable yield. Optimum management of irrigation requires routine direct or indirect
    monitoring of vine water status [7]. Indirect methods for accessing plant water
    status include soil water content or soil water potential measurement and atmospheric-based
    methods [7,8]. Soil water monitoring is a widely accepted tool for estimating
    crop water needs for field crops but in the case of vineyards there are several
    disadvantages. These include spatial variability in soil characteristics and 3-dimensional
    soil wetting patterns from drip irrigation leading to the need to install several
    sensors, which complicates information management and increases cost. Additionally,
    there is a lack of established thresholds for determining vine water status and
    severity [7]. Atmospheric based methods include Bowen ratio energy balance and
    eddy covariance to determine ETc and infer plant water status by comparing measured
    ETc to estimated non-water stressed ETc. These techniques require expensive sensors,
    skilled technical knowledge, and large uniform upwind fetch, especially for eddy
    covariance, which make them unsuited for small commercial vineyard water management
    purposes [7]. A more detailed discussion of indirect methods is provided by Rienth
    and Scholasch [8]. Direct (plant-based) methods for determining plant water status
    rely on measurements of physical plant variables. Unlike indirect methods, plant-based
    methods use the plant as a biosensor in a soil-plant-atmosphere continuum. Conventional
    direct methods include leaf or stem water potential, visual observation, stomatal
    conductance or photosynthesis, sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor pressure
    [7,9]. Midday stem or leaf water potential (LWP) is the most commonly accepted
    direct measurement of vine water status [10] and critical upper and lower water
    stress thresholds have been established [7], making it an effective tool for deficit
    irrigation management. The primary disadvantages of LWP are the limited time of
    day for measurement, the need for repeated measurements due to plant variability,
    and a need for several equipped and trained personnel to cover a vineyard. Visual
    observation is based on the visual growth characteristics of the apical meristem
    or apex of vines, tendrils, and leaf orientation of numerous vines [1,8]. The
    drawbacks of this method include low sensitivity to moderate water stress, time
    lag between water stress and visual observation, and the cost of trained personnel
    to cover a vineyard. Stomatal conductance measures the ease of passage of CO2
    or water vapor through the stomata and is a good indicator of plant response to
    water stress because it changes with atmospheric demand and soil water status.
    It has been shown to indicate the degree of vine water stress but varies with
    timing of measurement and leaf canopy location [7]. The primary disadvantages
    are the cost of the equipment, constant need for calibration, technical skill
    to operate. Sap flow, trunk diameter and leaf turgor are direct measures that
    have been shown to be indictors of plant water stress. However, they have not
    been widely adopted in regional commercial vineyards but have the advantage of
    being automated, which facilitates integration into a deficit irrigation management
    program. Detailed descriptions of other direct methods and their respective advantages
    and disadvantages are provided by [7], [8], [9]. Plant canopy temperature increases
    when solar radiation is absorbed and cools when water is evaporated (transpiration)
    within the leaf structure. A water-stressed plant canopy will reduce transpiration
    and have a higher temperature than a non-stressed canopy [11,12]. This physical
    plant response to water stress makes canopy temperature measurement a viable direct
    method for assessing plant water status. Infrared radiometers have been used to
    measure plant canopy temperature under research field conditions to estimate evapotranspiration
    and drought stress in many crops [13], [14], [15], including grape [16], [17],
    [18], [19], [20], [21]. Infrared thermometry is nondestructive, can be measured
    continuously, can be stationary or mounted on mobile platforms for spatial and
    temporal monitoring [9,[20], [21], [22]], and can be less expensive [23] than
    soil water sensing. Canopy temperature is related to plant water status, but it
    also depends upon solar radiation (Rs), air temperature (Ta), humidity (RH), and
    wind speed (WS) among other things. A method of using canopy temperature to calculate
    a CWSI for irrigation scheduling was proposed over 40 years ago by Idso et al.
    [15] and Jackson et al. [14]. The CWSI normalizes measured canopy temperature
    relative to reference threshold canopy temperatures for a well-watered vine (TLL)
    and a water stressed, non-transpiring vine (TUL) under identical weather conditions,
    resulting in an empirical CWSI value between, 0 (no water stress) and 1 (maximum
    water stress). Unfortunately, the need for TLL and TUL reference temperatures
    under identical weather conditions has limited the use of a CWSI to research scale
    studies and precluded its adoption on a commercial scale [9]. Alternatives to
    actual measurement of crop reference temperatures have been investigated, such
    as artificial wet and dry surfaces [16,[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]] and
    physical and empirical models [14,26,[30], [31], [32], [33]] to predict reference
    temperatures. The required maintenance of an artificial surface has limited use
    on a commercial scale, leaving physical or empirical models as the most logical
    choice. King et al. [33] used measured temperatures of non-water stressed wine
    grape canopies to develop data driven models (neural network, regression) to estimate
    TLL. The models were used to calculate CWSI values for research plots of Malbec
    grapes vines that were differentially irrigated to induce differing severities
    of vine water stress [19] and validated by comparing, over a 5-year period, CWSI
    values with LWP and fASW. The CWSI calculated using model predicted reference
    temperatures was well correlated with LWP (R2 = 0.54) and fASW (R2 = 0.71). When
    CWSI values were used to trigger 28 mm irrigation events, CWSI values increased,
    LWP became more negative, seasonal water application decreased, and grape cluster
    weight decreased. These results demonstrated that a CWSI could be used as an effective
    irrigation scheduling tool for wine grape. Irrigation scheduling based on canopy
    temperature has not been adopted on a commercial scale by vineyard irrigation
    mangers in semiarid regions of northwestern U.S. as evident by the lack of commercial
    systems supporting the application. The objectives of this study were to: develop
    a CWSI based IoT DSS for precision irrigation of wine grape under semiarid conditions;
    field test the CWSI based IoT DSS in two, small acreage commercial estate vineyards
    over four growing seasons; validate the IoT derived CWSI values by statistical
    correlation with LWP and fASW at each vineyard site; and evaluate vineyard manager
    annual consistency in irrigation scheduling. Vineyard irrigation managers were
    allowed to freely decide if they wanted to use the CWSI based IoS DSS for irrigation
    scheduling. Consistency of plant water stress and irrigation application across
    multiple years was used to gage success of the CWSI based IoT DDS system for irrigation
    scheduling as implemented by the vineyard manager. 2. Methods and materials 2.1.
    Field study site characteristics This study was conducted on two small (< 7 ha)
    family owned and operated commercial vineyards in southwestern Idaho USA over
    a four-year period (2017–2020). Both operations were estate vineyards in that
    they have associated wineries that produce branded commercial wines. The vineyard
    sites were located within 30 km of each other but differed in their soil characteristics
    and soil water holding capacities. The soil at vineyard-A (V-A) was a Greenleaf-Owyhee
    silt loam (fine-silty, mixed, superactive, mesic Xeric Calciargids) characterized
    as very deep well drained with moderately slow permeability and an available water
    capacity of 0.2 cm−1 (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vineyard-B (V-B) was located adjacent
    to an ancient volcanic vent that had been subjected to limited volcanic rock mining.
    The vineyard site was reclaimed using surrounding soil and original overburden
    to cover exposed rock resulting in a highly disturbed soil profile. The natural
    soils at the site were Turbyfill fine sandy loam (coarse-loamy, mixed, superactive,
    calcareous, mesic Xeric Torriorthents) and Jacquith loamy fine sand (Sandy, mixed,
    mesic Xereptic Haplodurids), both of which are moderately deep and well drained
    in their natural state with moderately rapid permeability. Available water capacity
    of the Turbyfill fine sandy loam and Jacquith loamy fine sand were 0.12 and 0.07
    cm−1, respectively (USDA Web Soil Survey). Vines in both vineyards were grown
    with double trunks on a vertically shoot positioned, two-wire trellis system with
    moveable catch wires. The vines were trained to bilateral cordons and spur-pruned
    annually to approximately 16 buds m−1 of cordon. Row by vine spacing was 2.7 m
    x 1.8 m at V-A and 2.7 m x 1.5 m at V-B. Irrigation at both sites was applied
    using drip irrigation tubing suspended about 30 cm above ground in the vine row.
    Drip emitter spacing was 76 cm with a flow rate of 3.8 L hr−1 at V-A and 61 cm
    with a flow rate of 1.9 L hr−1 at V-B. The wine grape cultivar evaluated at V-A
    was Chardonnay (2017–2020) and the cultivars at V-B were Malbec (2017–2019) and
    Cabernet Sauvignon (2020). 2.2. Field measurements and instrumentation hardware
    and software Canopy temperature was measured using wired infrared radiometers
    (SI-121, Apogee Instruments, Logan, Utah) with a 36° field of view. The radiometers
    were placed along a single vine row to prevent potential damage to sensor cables
    from vineyard equipment. In each vineyard, two (2017, 2018, 2019) or four (2020)
    radiometers were installed per cultivar. Radiometer cable lengths were 30 m allowing
    a maximum distance of 60 m between radiometers within a vine row. The radiometers
    were installed on vines with representative canopy size and positioned approximately
    15 to 30 cm above fully expanded leaves located at the top of the vine canopy.
    Radiometers were pointed northeasterly at approximately 45° from nadir, with the
    sensor view aimed at the center of solar noon sunlit leaves. The temperature sensing
    area of vine canopy was approximately 10 to 20 cm in diameter and received full
    sunlight exposure during midday. The possibility of background bare soil visibility
    was limited by multiple leaf layers within the canopy below the measured canopy
    location. The infrared radiometer sensor view was periodically adjusted as necessary
    to ensure that the field of view concentrated on sunlit leaves near the top of
    the canopy. The infrared radiometers were installed after fruit set, usually mid
    to late June. Solar radiation (Rs) (SP-110 pyranometer, Apogee Instruments, Logan,
    UT), air temperature (Ta), relative humidity (RH) (HMP50 temperature and humidity
    probe, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT), and wind speed (WS) (034B, Met One Instruments,
    Grants Pass, Ore.) were measured in each vineyard at a height of 2.5 m. Canopy
    temperature and weather parameters were measured every minute and recorded as
    15 min averages on a datalogger (CR6, Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT). The weather
    sensors and data logger were installed in the same vine row and located midway
    between the infrared temperature sensors. The equipment was removed at harvest,
    usually mid to late September. A 1.2 m soil moisture sensor (Drill and Drop, SenTek
    Sensor Technologies, Stepney, SA) was installed in the vine row within 3 m of
    the data logger and within 20 cm of an irrigation drip line emitter. Soil moisture
    was recorded every 30 min measured at 10 cm depth increments to a depth of 1.2
    m. In 2017 and 2018, a tipping bucket rain gage (RainWise, Boothwyn, PA) was placed
    under an drip line irrigation emitter to record cumulative irrigation application
    amount. The rain gage was connected to the data logger and total emitter water
    application was recorded in 15 min and 24 hr increments. In 2019 and 2020 a flow
    meter (36MP.75RG.1, Netafim Irrigation, Inc., Fresno, CA) was installed in the
    irrigation drip line and connected to the data logger. Flow rate was recorded
    in 15 min increments. The field data logger was equipped with a machine-to-machine
    cellular modem (RavenXTA CDMA or RV50 Sierra wireless AirLink, Campbell Scientific
    Inc., Logan, UT) to provide real-time access to the sensor data using commercial
    software. Study personnel accessed sensor data using datalogger management software
    (LoggerNet 4.5, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT). Vineyard managers were provided
    real-time sensor data access through a website. The website was hosted on the
    field data logger. Data logger webpage publishing software (RTCM Pro Development
    4.3.3.6, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) was used to design and publish the
    webpage on the data logger. The website was accessible using either a personal
    computer or a smart phone. The website provided graphical pages with running 12-day
    histories of daily CWSI, soil water content at each depth increment, fASW, daily
    irrigation depth, and latest 15-min averaged weather data, each on a separate
    webpage. The website was available between the hours of 6:00 to 22:00 MDT. The
    cell phone modem was powered down overnight to conserve battery power and to reset
    the modem in case of intruder hacking and malware. The data logger battery was
    charged using a 20 W solar panel. Midday LWP was measured at 7-to-10-day intervals
    in both vineyards in each year of the study to verify vine water status and to
    investigate its correlation with daily CWSI. LWP was measured between 13:00 and
    15:00 MDT on two fully expanded, sunlit leaves from vines adjacent to each installed
    infrared radiometer using a pressure chamber (model 610, PMS Instrument Co., Albany,
    OR) as described by Levin et al. [10,34]. 2.3. Calculated webpage values Information
    shown on webpages hosted by the field data logger was based on several calculations
    performed by datalogger software using measured sensor values. The calculated
    values included daily CWSI, fASW, and daily irrigation depth. Daily CWSI was calculated
    as the average 15-min CWSI between 13:00 and 15:00 MST, which corresponded to
    −1 to +1.5 hr of solar noon. The 15-min CWSI was calculated using the empirical
    equation developed by Idso et al. [15] as: (1) where Tc is measured canopy temperature
    of fully sunlit leaves ( °C). The TLL reference temperature ( °C) was estimated
    using cultivar specific neural network models [32]. Inputs to the neural network
    models were 15-minute averaged values of measured Rs, Ta, RH and WS. The TUL reference
    temperature ( °C) was estimated using the energy balance-based equation of [14]
    as: (2) where ra is aerodynamic resistance (s m−1), Rn is net radiation (W m−2),
    cp is heat capacity of air (J kg-1 °C-1), and ρ is density of air (kg m−3). Aerodynamic
    resistance was estimated using the approach of [30] as described by [33] using
    the same cultivar specific data sets for well-watered wine grapes in southwestern
    Idaho. Values used for ra were 16.8 s m−1 for Malbec and 21 s m−1 for Chardonnay
    and Cabernet Sauvignon. Net radiation was estimated as Rn = 0.9Rs – 60 [33]. The
    fASW for a given soil profile depth was calculated as: (3) where θi is measured
    volumetric soil water content for depth i, θpwpi is estimated volumetric soil
    water content at permanent wilting point for depth i, θfci is estimated volumetric
    soil water content at field capacity at depth i, and n is the number of 10 cm
    soil water content measurement depths considered. Field capacity for each soil
    depth was estimated as the maximum soil water content measured 24 h after an irrigation
    event or soil water content at the beginning of the season for depths below the
    irrigation wetting front. Permanent wilting point (PWP) for each soil depth was
    estimated as 50% of field capacity (FC) or minimum soil water content measured.
    Values for θfci and θpwpi were continually adjusted during the beginning of the
    season as soil water content measurements were collected. Three values of fASW
    were presented in the webpage: 0 to 60 cm, 0 to 90 cm, and 0 to 120 cm. Values
    shown in the webpages were expressed in English units as they were designed for
    use by vineyard managers located in the U.S. Daily irrigation depth was calculated
    as the volume of water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT divided by the drip
    irrigation lateral length represented and vine row spacing. In the case of rain
    gauges, the volume of water measured by the rain gage was divided by the emitter
    spacing and vine row spacing. In the case of flow meters, the daily volume of
    water applied was calculated by summing the flow rate in each 15 min interval
    multiplied by the time interval. The volume of water was divided by lateral length
    downstream of the flow meter and vine row spacing. The calculated irrigation depth
    was presented in the English unit of inches. 2.4. Irrigation DSS vineyard manager
    accessible webpages The irrigation DSS was comprised of six separate webpages
    that displayed daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), soil moisture at depth of 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in) (Fig. 2), soil moisture at a depth of 70 to 120 cm (28 - 48 in) (Fig.
    3), fASW at three soil depths (Fig. 4), irrigation amount (Fig. 5), and weather
    (Fig. 6). The webpages showing CWSI, soil water content (%) and fASW displayed
    data as a running 12-day history. Each webpage had a top menu showing all available
    webpages. CWSI values were graphed independently for each infrared radiometer
    and as the average value of all radiometers. An example of the main webpage at
    site V-B for 13 August through 25 August 2020 is shown in Fig. 1. Soil volumetric
    water content (%) was graphed independently at depth increments of 10 cm (4 inches)
    (Figs. 2,3). fASW (Fig. 4) was graphed independently for soil depths 0 to 60 cm
    (0 - 24 in), 0 to 90 cm (1 – 36 in), and 0 - 120 cm (0 – 48 in). Daily irrigation
    amounts (Fig. 5) represent water applied between 0:00 and 24:00 MDT. Fig. 1, Fig.
    2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show data for V-B from 13 August through 23 August 2020.
    Weather conditions in each vineyard (Fig. 6) were displayed as the most current
    15-min average value for Ta, RH, WS, and wind direction. For ease of use, the
    values for Ta and RH were displayed graphically as well as numerically. Download

    Linear and multiple regression were conducted using Microsoft Excel data analysis
    tools. Graphical, linear, and multiple linear regression and variance analysis
    were used to quantify and evaluate relationships between variables. Regression
    line significance was evaluated using ANOVA (p < 0.05). Neural network model development
    was performed using the MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox (MathWorks, Natick, Mass.)
    [33]. Graphs were generated using Sigmaplot 14 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA).
    3. Results 3.1. Climatic conditions Climatic conditions during the four-year study
    relative to 20-yr (1996–2016) averages are summarized in Table 1. The climatic
    conditions during the four study years were generally within one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean with a few exceptions. Alfalfa-based reference evapotranspiration
    was greatest in 2018 and exceeded the 20-yr mean by more than one standard deviation.
    The combination of high mean air temperature and daily solar radiation, and low
    mean relative humidity and April through September precipitation resulted in the
    high reference evapotranspiration in 2018. October through March precipitation
    was greatest in 2017 and exceeded one standard deviation of the 20-yr mean. April
    through September precipitation in 2019 and 2020 exceeded one standard deviation
    of the 20-yr mean. Growing-degree days was greatest in 2018, coinciding with highest
    mean daily air temperature and high reference evapotranspiration. Table 1. Climatic

    water stress Linear relationships between plant water stress measures fASW, LWP,
    and CWSI at each vineyard for the four study years combined are summarized in
    Fig. 7. All the linear relationships between the water stress measures were statistically
    significant (p < 0.001). The linear relationships between fASW versus LWP and
    daily CWSI versus LWP had similar R2 values for both vineyards. The linear relationship
    between fASW and CWSI at V-B had a much greater R2 than for V-A (0.58vs 0.32).
    Variability in the fASW vs CWSI data was similar between the vineyards, but daily
    CWSI spanned a greater range at V-B resulting in a greater R2. The greatest data
    variability occurred between daily CWSI and LWP for both vineyards. The greater
    variability is likely due to CWSI and LWP responding differently to Ta, RS, RH
    and WS. Download : Download high-res image (968KB) Download : Download full-size

    Relationship between seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts The seasonal
    average values for daily CWSI and the cumulative amount of irrigation applied
    between 1 July and 15 September in each study year at each vineyard are shown
    in Table 2. The seasonal average daily CWSI values for each vineyard were largely
    consistent over the four-year study. Seasonal daily CWSI values were higher for
    V-B as the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager
    of V-A. The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly
    increase a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding
    capacity of the sandy soil. Table 2. Average daily crop water stress index (CWSI)

    DSS vineyard manager accessible webpages An example of the irrigation DSS running
    12-day history and weather webpage is presented for V-B for 13 to 23 August 2020
    (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6). An irrigation event, starting
    the evening of 18 August 2020, increased soil water content to a depth of 60 cm
    (24 inches) (Fig. 2) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1). An irrigation
    event starting on the evening of 23 August increased soil water content to a depth
    70 cm (28 inches) (Fig. 3) and decreased the daily CWSI to near zero (Fig. 1).
    The estimated fASW increased on 18 August and 23 August (Fig. 4) as soil water
    contents increased (Fig 2) due to irrigation events. Prior to irrigation on 18
    Aug, daily CWSI was greater than 0.6 (Fig. 1), while fASW for the 0 to 120 cm
    soil profile was about 0.3 and increased to greater than 0.8 following irrigation
    on 23 Aug. Midday on 25 August daily CWSI was near zero while fASW was about 0.78.
    An overnight irrigation event started on 18 August is depicted as two irrigations
    since it spanned two days (Fig. 5). The first irrigation event applied about 10
    mm (0.4 inch) and the second irrigation event applied about 21 mm (0.8 inch),
    which collectively decreased daily CWSI from 0.6 to near zero (Fig. 1) and increased
    fASW from 0.3 to 0.8 (Fig. 4). The observed variability among radiometers on the
    irrigation DSS webpage for daily CWSI values (Fig. 1), was likely attributed to
    high spatial variability in soil profile characteristics. Limiting historical
    data on the irrigation DSS webpage to a running 12-day period was to optimize
    time efficiency of the user web browsing experience. The infield data logger that
    hosted the irrigation DSS webpages had limited computing capacity, so limiting
    the historical data time frame to a running 12-days offered a reasonable compromise
    between data viewability on a cell phone and time to transfer the data to the
    user webpage interface device. A running 12-day historical record was sufficient
    to establish trends in CWSI or soil water availability useful in making irrigation
    management decisions. The vineyard managers in this study only wanted to know
    if they need to irrigation today and were largely uninterested in historical CWSI
    values. The 12-day historical length can be increased if deemed necessary by uploading
    the data to the cloud and using cloud based graphical software to display the
    same information for the full growing season. 4.2. Relationship between measures
    of vine water status and irrigation A seasonal graph of the irrigation DSS data
    for V-B in 2020 shows an interconnected response among the measured and estimated
    DSS parameters (Fig. 8). Values for daily CWSI and midday leaf water potential
    shown in Fig. 8 are averages of the measured values and fASW is for the 0 to 120
    soil profile. Prior to initiation of measurements on 13 June, there was above
    average precipitation in 2020 (Table 1). The prior precipitation is evident by
    the status of well-watered vines on 13 June (Fig. 8). Daily CWSI was low, fASW
    was > 0.55 and LWP was less negative. A rainfall event on 29 June was associated
    with a decrease in the daily CWSI, an increase in fASW and a less negative LWP.
    Prior to the irrigation event on 20 July, the daily CWSI steadily increased coincident
    with a more negative LWP. The small irrigation event on 8 July had minimal influence
    on daily CWSI or LWP potential as fASW remained below 0.55. Irrigation events
    prior to 17 August reduced CWSI and made LWP less negative for only a few days
    and fASW remained 〈 0.55 for most of the duration. The seasonally highest CWSI
    values and most negative LWP values occurred between 28 July and 24 August. The
    irrigation event on 23 August and precipitation events on 17 and 24 August decreased
    CWSI to near zero, increased fASW to 〉 0.55 and LWP became less negative, all
    of which indicated a short period of increase in vine water status. Between 24
    August and the next irrigation event on 1 September, the CWSI increased, fASW
    decreased, and LWP became more negative. The relatively large (> 25 mm) irrigation
    event on 3 September decreased daily CWSI to 〈 0.2, increased fASW to 〉 0.8, and
    LWP became less negative. The last irrigation on 11 September reduced daily CWSI
    to near zero, increased fASW to nearly 0.9 and increased LWP to > −0.9 MPa. Download

    Average daily CWSI, fraction of available soil water (fASW) in 0 to 120 cm soil
    profile, midday leaf water potential (LWP), precipitation, and irrigation during
    the 2020 growing season at V-B. The fASW is a common method used to express crop
    water stress for field crops. Wine grape is well-watered when fASW is greater
    than 0.55 [35]. The corresponding seasonal responses of fASW, midday LWP, and
    the daily CWSI to irrigation and precipitation events (Fig. 8) supports the usefulness
    and accuracy of daily CWSI for real-time irrigation management of wine grape irrespective
    of soil characteristics that may influence these values. 4.3. Comparison of vine
    water stress measures between vineyards The slopes of linear relationships between
    the fASW versus LWP or daily CWSI differed between vineyards (Fig. 7). This may
    be partially due to differences in soil textures and permeability between the
    vineyards. V-A had a silt loam soil with low to moderate permeability while V-B
    had a sandy soil with high permeability. Water applied by the drip irrigation
    emitter likely resulted in different wetting patterns between vineyards with a
    deeper wetting pattern and less lateral spreading at V-B. There was likely limited
    soil water availability outside the immediate area of the emitter wetting pattern
    at V-B due to the low water holding capacity of the sandy soil. The soil water
    sensor was installed within 20 cm of an emitter and may have provided a better
    measurement of total soil water at V-B than V-A. The greater water holding capacity
    of the silt loam soil at V-A likely resulted in much more stored soil water from
    non-growing season precipitation, limiting the range in fASW over the growing
    season. However, the range in LWP were similar between vineyards. The low permeability
    of the soil at V-A may have restricted movement of soil water to the roots. Lastly
    the soil at V-A exhibited silica cementation ranging from 45 to 60 cm deep during
    soil sensor installation that may have restricted root growth. Ample soil water
    was measured below 60 cm in the root zone (data not shown) but very little extraction
    occurred during the growing season supporting the suspicion of limited root presence
    below 60 cm. The presence of ample soil water below 60 cm limited the range in
    fASW over the growing season and if it was largely unavailable to the vines would
    result in high daily CWSI and low LWP values despite fASW > 0.55. Despite a significant
    linear relationship between daily CWSI and midday LWP for both vineyards (Fig.
    7), there is considerable variability in the relationships, which precludes use
    of CWSI as a direct surrogate for LWP. A quadratic relationship between CWSI and
    LWP averaged over four wine grape cultivars was reported by [21], which depicted
    a similar degree of variability. [36] reported LWP ranging from −0.51 to −1.15
    MPa for well-watered grapevines in California with LWP linearly related to vapor
    pressure deficit (VPD) and Ta. They also reported a linear relationship between
    LWP and VPD for water stressed vines, but with reduced dependence on VPD compared
    to well-watered vines. The results of this study are consistent with the findings
    of [36] as the relationship between CWSI and LWP (Fig. 7) could be represented
    by a piece-wise linear relationship with CWSI ≈ 0 for LWP > −1.15 MPa. Solar radiation
    also influences LWP and LWP measurements should be collected on cloudless days
    [36]. The LWP values reported in this study were made over a wide range of VPD
    and on days with variable clouds. Additionally, some LWP values reported in this
    study were not collected on the same vine used for canopy temperature measurement,
    another source of variability in the relationship between CWSI and LWP. Overall,
    the presence of water stress detected by LWP measurement was also indicted by
    daily CWSI as calculated in this study, demonstrating that CWSI can be effectively
    used as an irrigation management tool for wine grape. The vineyard managers in
    this study were successful in using daily CWSI to achieve similar levels of plant
    water stress over multiple years, despite yearly differences in evaporative demand
    and growing season precipitation. The primary advantage of using CWSI as an irrigation
    management tool is the ability to automate data collection for daily monitoring
    of water stress with minimal labor. The linear relationship between fASW and daily
    CWSI exhibited less variability than the linear relationship between fASW and
    midday LWP (Fig. 7), especially for V-B. Thus, CWSI was a more direct indicator
    of available soil water than LWP. For V-B, when fASW was > 0.55, indicating well-watered
    vines, CWSI was 〈 0.1 supporting the rational than CWSI should approach zero for
    well-watered vines and approach one for severely watered stressed vines as the
    linear relationship depicts. However, for V-A a fASW value of 0.55 corresponds
    to a CWSI value 〉 0.5, which clearly does not follow the rational of CWSI, indicating
    an error in estimating fASW. As forementioned, this discrepancy is likely due
    to the effective root zone of the vines less than the 120 cm depth used to compute
    fASW. The estimates of FC and PWP of the soil at V-A could also be in error, which
    could lead to overestimation of fASW. If estimates of the fASW at V-A were reduced
    by 25%, a fASW value of 0.55 would correspond to a CWSI value < 0.1, like V-B
    and a CWSI value of 0.6 would correspond to a fASW of 0.37. The unrealistic over
    estimation of fAWC at V-A based on measured midday LWP and calculated daily CWSI
    highlights the difficulty in accurately quantifying the fASW using a single soil
    moisture profile measurement with drip irrigated crops. Drip irrigation results
    in a 3-dimensional wetting pattern that makes reliable estimation of root zone
    available soil water difficult at best. As an example, [37] reported that nine
    neutron probe measurements in one quadrant of a vine root zone, to a depth of
    3 m, was necessary to quantify soil water content of drip-irrigated grape vines.
    The difficulty in quantifying fASW in drip irrigated vineyards highlights the
    advantage of using plant-based methods for assessing vine water status such as
    CWSI provided the reference temperatures TLL and TUL can be reliably estimated.
    4.4. Seasonal CWSI and seasonal irrigation amounts between vineyard managers Neither
    vineyard manager in this study used any type of quantitative plant or soil water
    monitoring techniques to aid in irrigation management decisions prior to the installation
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. Prior to this study, the irrigation managers
    at both vineyards made irrigation decisions based upon intuition, previous experience,
    and crop appearance [1]; so, there was a reasonable expectation that the vineyard
    managers would actively use the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS. At the beginning
    of the first study year, the vineyard managers were briefed on the concept of
    CWSI for monitoring plant water status and were given the guideline that a daily
    CWSI value of 0.3 corresponded to approximately a 70% ET rate relative to a well-watered,
    100% ET. Beyond that initial guidance on how to interpret the daily CWSI value,
    the vineyard managers independently accessed the irrigation DSS webpages and made
    irrigation management decisions without input from research project personnel.
    At the end of the first study year both vineyard managers reported that they routinely
    accessed the irrigation DSS webpages for daily CWSI and fASW and used the information
    to support irrigation management decisions. In each of the remaining three years
    of the study, both vineyard managers, at their discretion, continued to access
    the irrigation DSS webpages and use the daily CWSI to facilitate irrigation management
    decisions. Seasonal average daily CWSI values (Table 2) were higher for V-B as
    the vineyard manager preferred higher plant water stress than the manager of V-A.
    The higher daily CWSI value at V-B was also higher because it would rapidly increase
    a couple days after an irrigation event due to the low water holding capacity
    of the sandy soil. Cumulative irrigation water application was surprisingly similar
    across vineyards, particularly for years 2018 through 2020, despite differences
    in soil water holding capacity and vineyard managers. Cumulative irrigation was
    low in the first year of the study at V-A due to above average non-growing season
    precipitation and higher water holding capacity of the silt loam soil. The narrow
    range in seasonal average daily CWSI (0.23 to 0.31 for V-A, and 0.36 to 0.44 for
    V-B) and cumulative irrigation (1.14 to 134 mm) in 2018 through 2020 suggests
    that vineyard managers effectively used the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS to develop
    and maintain a consistent deficit irrigation management program. 4.5. Irrigation
    decision support system limitations The data-driven models used in this study
    provided reliable estimates of TLL and TUL in real-time for the semiarid climatic
    conditions of the study site, which was representative of the irrigated wine producing
    locations in the pacific northwestern U.S. The climatic conditions under which
    these data-driven models were developed were representative of the conditions
    in this study. However, the models may not perform as well in other regions with
    weather conditions outside the database range for model development. For example,
    in areas where daily windspeeds exceed 5 m sec−1. Wind speeds higher than 5 m
    sec−1 were not included in the database used for model development and grapevines
    are known to reduce stomatal conductance under high winds [38,39]. A wind induced
    reduction in stomatal conductance would result in an increase in canopy temperature
    independent of plant water stress and, since the data-driven model estimate of
    TLL would be too low, the calculated CWSI value would be elevated. Canopy temperature
    data for well-watered vines under high wind conditions would need to be included
    in the data set used to calibrate the neural network model for estimating TLL
    in windy semiarid regions. There are climatic conditions that can result in a
    calculated CWSI value of less than zero or greater than one. Wet canopy conditions
    typically result in measured canopy temperature that is less than the TLL predicted
    by the data driven model. This results in a negative CWSI value regardless of
    soil water availability. The original development of the CWSI concept by [15]
    was limited to clear sunny conditions. However, the data driven model for predicting
    TLL that was used in this study uses a database of well-watered vine canopy temperatures
    that were measured under variable cloudy conditions. The data driven model can
    therefore predict TLL for variably cloudy conditions. While the data-driven model
    used for predicting TLL is valid for solar radiation < 100 W m−2, TUL predicted
    using Eq. (2) for low levels of solar radiation can be approximately equal to
    TLL resulting in CWSI values less than zero or greater than 1. In this study,
    solar radiation less than 200 W m−2 often resulted in CWSI values less than zero.
    [40] also found solar radiation greater than 200 W m−2 was necessary to reliably
    use canopy temperature measurement for irrigation scheduling. In this study, daily
    CWSI was limited to a maximum of one and a minimum of zero in software to avert
    illogical values. The effect of wet canopy and low solar radiation on calculation
    of daily CWSI is evident in Fig. 8 on 18 and 24 August when a value of zero was
    assigned to daily CWSI during rainfall events. Limiting daily CWSI value to zero
    due to low solar radiation or wet canopy has little practical impact on use of
    CWSI for irrigation management as vine water stress is low under these circumstances
    due to low evaporative demand. When calculated CWSI is greater than one due to
    low solar radiation, limiting the value of one is more problematic as this results
    in a very erroneous representation of vine water stress that could lead to an
    unnecessary irrigation event. The climatic conditions leading to errors in calculating
    CWSI (rainfall, low solar radiation) are limited to 1-to-3-days in duration in
    the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not prevent application
    of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region. Software used to compute
    CWSI can be modified to detect these events and indicate to the user that the
    daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value for the day preceding the rainfall
    or low solar radiation event can be used to guide irrigation decisions as plant
    water stress will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally as ET will be small
    under low solar radiation conditions. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system
    developed and implemented in this study focused on two small acreage, commercial
    estate vineyards in semiarid southwestern Idaho USA. The climatic conditions at
    the study sites were representative of vineyards in the semiarid irrigated regions
    of the Pacific Northwest U.S. Small acreage vineyards can be found throughout
    the region and most do not have staff with irrigation science training, nor can
    they afford to hire trained vineyard irrigation management professionals or services.
    They need affordable irrigation scheduling tools that are easy to maintain and
    indicate when to irrigate to maintain a desired level of vine water stress. The
    vineyard managers at the study sites were pleased the system reliably and timely
    indication of vine water stress without having to spend time collecting soil water
    content measurements needed to estimate fASW or measure leaf water potential.
    While this study focused on small commercial estate vineyards, the IoT irrigation
    DSS concept is applicable to larger commercial vineyards where it could be used
    to provide plant water stress information needed to ground truth remote sensing
    based estimates of the ratio of actual-to-reference ET such as those provided
    by GRAPEX [41] or OPENET (https://openetdata.org). These remote sensing-based
    estimates have a minimum spatial resolution of 30 m, which is larger than the
    minimum dimension of irrigation management blocks in many commercial estate vineyards,
    hence they are not necessarily applicable to small commercial estate vineyards
    in the region. The CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study
    used expensive scientific grade equipment, which proved invaluable to investigate
    the validity and adoptability of the system for irrigation management in wine
    grapes. The infrared temperature sensors cost $700 each, the multifunctional precision
    data logger was $2000, and the cellular modem with accessories was $700 totaling
    over $6100 excluding web page publishing software and climatic sensors. The soil
    moisture sensor cost is not included as it is unnecessary for calculation of the
    CWSI. The cost of the equipment used in this study is prohibitive for small vineyards
    to monitor just a single location. Vineyard manager acceptance and adoption of
    the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system implemented in this study justifies continued
    development and enhancement of the system. Future work will focus on incorporating
    less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power, low-cost radio
    communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station. The base
    station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and used to
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. These system enhancements would increase size of the vineyard
    area represented by daily CWSI measurements, encompassing multiple cultivars and
    irrigation blocks or irrigation management zones in larger vineyards. 5. Conclusions
    A CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS was developed, and field tested at two small acreage
    commercial wine grape estate vineyards in southwestern Idaho. Irrigation DSS webpages,
    accessible to vineyard managers via cell phone or computer, provided a running
    12-day history of CWSI daily values, soil moisture and current weather conditions.
    Data-driven models were used to estimate reference temperatures needed to calculate
    the CWSI using real-time environmental inputs for Rs, Ta, RH, and WS. Edge computing
    on a solar powered, field-deployed data logger was used to calculate the CWSI
    and fASW, and the data logger was used to host webpages of the irrigation DSS.
    The data logger was connected to a cellular modem located in the vineyard. The
    vineyard managers routinely used the irrigation DSS webpage for the CWSI and soil
    moisture to make irrigation management decisions. The average daily CWSI and irrigation
    amounts between 1 July and 15 September were similar between years over the four-year
    study for each study vineyard suggesting that the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS
    was effective in assisting irrigation management decisions. Linear relationships
    between daily CWSI, midday LWP, and fraction of available soil water were significant
    (p < 0.001) at both study sites. The coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.58)
    for the linear relationship between daily CWSI and fraction of available soil
    water for V-B was better than that for midday LWP (R2 = 0.38) indicating daily
    CWSI was the most reliable indicator (less variable) of vine water status. The
    data-driven models used to estimate TLL and TUL can result in CWSI values outside
    the theoretical range of 0 to 1 when the canopy is wet from precipitation or solar
    radiation is <200 W m−2. These climatic conditions are limited to 1-to-3-days
    in duration in the semiarid regions of the pacific northwestern U.S. and do not
    prevent application of the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS system in the region.
    These climatic instances can be detected by IoT irrigation DSS system software
    and indicate to the user that the daily CWSI is unavailable. The daily CWSI value
    for the day preceding the rainfall or low solar radiation event can be used to
    indicate plant water stress since it will decrease with rainfall or increase minimally
    as ET will be small under low solar radiation conditions. The hardware and software
    used to implement the CWSI based IoT irrigation DSS in this study was very reliable
    but too expensive for practical commercial application. Future work will focus
    on incorporating less expensive infrared temperature sensors coupled with low-power,
    low-cost radio communications to allow wireless transfer of data to a base station.
    The base station will be connected to the internet using a cell phone modem and
    upload canopy temperature measurements across a vineyard to a cloud computing
    platform. The cloud computing platform software will be used to host webpages
    like those used in this project to allow real-time monitoring of canopy temperature
    at sensor locations across a vineyard and display daily CWSI for each canopy temperature
    monitoring location. Funding The work reported in this paper was partially funded

    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\

    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\
    \ of power reduction technique based on data mitigation schemes\nfor previous\
    \ research in agricultural applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n17 of 45\nTable\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\

    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\
    \ \nReference [144] proposed a modular architecture for a wireless sensor node\
    \ implemented for PA \napplications. The sensors employed in this modular were\
    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to \nFigure 3. Example of\

    \ the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as a transceiver to\n\
    transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to reduce the power consumption).\
    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\
    \ analysis of several scholars in terms of sensors, actuators, IoT devices, and\
    \ IoT\nplatforms that can be used to support agricultural applications.\nSensors\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

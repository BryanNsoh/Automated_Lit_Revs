    and services 1. Introduction Plasmopara viticola (P. viticola), commonly known
    as downy mildew, is a North American origin fungus [1]. It invaded Europe at the
    end of the 18th century [1]. Downy mildew attacks vines mostly during spring when
    plants are in their most stressful developing stages. As a fungus, it has a two-stage-infection
    cycle of primary infections and repeated secondary ones [2,3,4]. The first signs
    of the fungus development from oomycete occurs in spring inflorescence growth,
    close to the 12th E-L vine stage [5], and its results are devastating if not detected
    and treated early [3,4,6]. Two significant environmental parameters influence
    P. viticola’s fungus growth. These are temperatures between 10 °C and 32 °C and
    increased humidity levels [3,7,8,9]. The spring oospores’ maturity succeeds the
    fungus oospores’ overwintering. Then spring environmental conditions lead to sporangia
    germinations, which in turn incubate zoospores that form germinations during wet
    periods, spread by wind or rain splashes to nearby leaves or berries [2,6,8].
    Downy mildew oospore maturation starts with mild and rainy days in spring, usually
    with prolonged rainfall (e.g., at least 3–6 mm), temperatures between 12 and 26
    °C, and relative humidity above 90% [2]. Then, the oospores form sporangia that,
    with the help of rain splashes and wind, reach the potential host tissue, typically
    wet young leaves near the soil. As a primary infection cycle, sporangia releases
    zoospores. The germinated zoospore infects young green tissues through open stomata
    and produces a mycelium that, by colonizing the intercellular spaces, leads to
    the appearance of oil spots on the leaves [2,6]. Germination mechanisms work faster
    when the temperature is between 20 and 24 °C and when there is rainfall or concentration
    of leaf litter [8,9]. According to [2,4,6], as a secondary infection cycle, the
    fungus initiates asexual reproduction, producing sporangiophores. Sporangia are
    released from the tip of the sporangiophores’ branches, and the released zoospores
    will emerge as secondary infections. In this cycle, the zoospores reach the berries,
    giving them a whitish appearance. The initial oil spot lesions usually appear
    as a brownish area spreading on the infected tissue at this stage. The cycle (up
    to sporangiophores’ production) typically lasts 5–7 up to 18 days [3,6,8]. According
    to Rossi et al. [4], sporangia incubation occurs at temperatures between 9.5 °C
    and 32 °C, and wet conditions or relative humidity above 65% ( [10]). On American
    varieties, the phenomenon occurs at temperatures ranging from 10 to 30 °C, with
    an optimum at 18–20 °C [11]; however, on Vitis vinifera Caffi pinpointed sporulating
    temperatures between 10.6 and 32.9 °C. Nevertheless, the authors consider Zacho’s
    observations for a minimum sporulating temperature of 13 °C for Vitis vinifera
    [12]. Furthermore, according to Caffi et al. [6], rainfall used by the majority
    of downy mildew models does not seem to be a triggering factor for secondary infections
    because the surface wetness for zoospore release and mobility can be generated
    by dew. As modern Viticulture is continuously Industrialized and its practical
    appliances are automated, revolutionary viticulture technologies are incorporated
    into the vine fields [13,14]. Such technologies refer to sensors that monitor
    environmental conditions near the vine plants or vine plant clusters [2,15,16,17].
    These data acquisition technologies bring forth elaborated processes, supported
    by machine learning or deep learning models, to improve agricultural practices
    in a more precise manner (proximal sensing) [14]. Focusing on the downy mildew
    fungus and the interventions that need to be accounted for the amelioration of
    this disease, the paper focuses in the following subsections on existing downy
    mildew (P. viticola) models applicable for viticulture use as well as Decision
    Support Systems that host such models for downy mildew forecasts at vine-plant
    level [15,16,18,19,20]. 1.1. Related Work on Viticulture Downy Mildew Models Several
    models have been proposed over the years, either of heuristic origin (empirical)
    or deterministic via experimentation (mechanistic), for P. viticola predictions
    [9,21]. Many of them have been incorporated into existing DSS systems [21]. The
    following models are presented in the literature as empirical models: Muller model
    is an empirical model based on temperature observations setting the infection
    occurrence when leaves are o 2 cm in diameter (E-L 9 development stage) and after
    heavy rain. According to this model, If the weather is dry (east wind), there
    is no risk of downy mildew, nor if the mean daily temperatures are below 12 °C
    or above 28 °C [10], the incubation period can be calculated in days. The actual
    daily add-ons to the sum based on the average daily temperature are provided by
    [22]. Rule 3–10 is an empirical rule set by [23]. The rule states that infections
    initiate when the following conditions occur: Temperature, 𝑇≥ 10 °C, vine shoots
    of 10 cm long, and at least 10mm of rainfall over the last 24–48 h. Goidanich
    model. This model assumes initiation of primary infections at E-L 12 development
    stage, based on Rule 3–10. After infection, the percentage of daily development
    of incubation is calculated as Infection Risk Cycles (IRC), using an index value
    (Goidanich Index-GI) based on the average daily relative humidity and temperature
    until it reaches 100% [24]. An appropriate table of Goidanich’s model infection
    percentages is used for both primary and secondary infections [19]. Above 25°,
    IRC is constant. Furthermore, according to Puelles et al. evaluation [25], this
    model on Vitis vinifera usually delivers over-prediction infection blocks with
    very few matches to field observations. Nevertheless, this differs from the research
    in northwestern Spain provided by [26]. EPI model. This model, developed by Stryzik
    et al. [27], uses an EPI index metric that represents the pathogen potential infection
    energy 𝐸 𝑝 for primary infections and the kinetic energy 𝐸 𝑐 for secondary infections.
    For primary infections, it utilizes a set of equations that consider monthly rainfall
    and temperature, the number of days with rain per month, and the rainfall during
    the last ten days. For secondary infections, the model takes into account inputs
    of temperature, relative humidity, and relative humidity at night [9,28]. Potential
    infection energy 𝐸 𝑝 is calculated using Equation (1) from October until January
    [27]. 𝐸 𝑝 =2·[𝑘( 𝑅 𝑖 − − √ − 0.95 𝑅 𝑚 − − − − − − √ )]+0.2·[ 𝑅 𝑖 · 𝑇 𝑖 − − − −
    − √ −( 0.95 𝑅 𝑚 𝑇 𝑚 − − − − − − − − − √ )]−[ 1.5𝑅 𝐷 𝑚 18 𝑙𝑜 𝑔 10 𝑅𝑑 𝑅𝐷𝑑 ] (1)
    where the value k is 1.2 in October, 1 in November, and 0.8 for the rest of the
    months (until March), 𝑅 𝑖 is the daily rainfall, 𝑅 𝑚 is the mean monthly rainfall,
    𝑇 𝑖 the mean daily temperature, 𝑇 𝑚 the mean monthly temperature, 𝑅𝑑 cumulative
    rainfall the last ten days, 𝑅 𝐷 𝑚 , number of monthly rainy days and 𝑅𝐷𝑑 number
    of rainy days the last ten days [27]. Equation (2) gives the kinetic energy of
    the model calculated from April until September and corresponds to primary and
    secondary infections since the model assumes that oospore maturity is reached
    by the 31st of March [27]. 𝐸 𝑐 =0.012· 1 4 (5·𝑅 𝐻 𝑚 𝑛𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 +3·𝑅 𝐻 𝑖 10–18ℎ ) 2
    𝑇 𝑖 − − √ −𝑅 𝐻 2 𝑖 10–18ℎ 𝑇 𝑚 − − − √ 100 (2) where 𝑅 𝐻 𝑚 𝑛𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡 is the average
    relative humidity at night, and 𝑅 𝐻 𝑖 10–18ℎ is the average relative daily humidity,
    𝑇 𝑖 the average daily temperature, and 𝑇 𝑚 the monthly average temperature. Finally,
    the EPI index value is calculated based on Equation (3) [27]. 𝐸𝑃𝐼= ∑ 𝑂𝑐𝑡 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑐ℎ
    𝐸 𝑝 + ∑ 𝐴𝑝𝑟 𝑆𝑒𝑝𝑡 𝐸 𝑐 (3) From October until the end of March, the value of the
    EPI metric is an estimate of oospore maturation, where the first infection occurs
    when EPI > −10, while the EPI increases for three consecutive days [27]. Empirical
    models are easier to implement using sparse meteorological stations’ sensory data
    input, they require further evaluation and calibration to the applied viticulture
    environment. On the other hand, mechanistic models try to capture the infection
    mechanism in a holistic, more deterministic manner. Nevertheless, it requires
    the calculation of more elaborate metrics that cannot be easily inferred directly
    from environmental sensors. The following mechanistic models are presented in
    the literature. Downy Mildew foreCast is a model that tries to provide primary
    and secondary infection predictions. It uses a probabilistic normal distribution
    for primary infections using Equation (4) [29] 𝑃(𝑑)= 1 𝜎 2𝜋 − − − √ 𝑒 − (𝑑−𝜇)
    2 2 𝜎 2 ,𝜇=118−0.3 𝑅 𝑎 ,𝜎=13.5+0.02 𝑅 𝑎 (4) where mean and standard deviation
    parameters are calculated by parameter 𝑅 𝑎 , which is the cumulative rainfall
    effect at the end of January according to Equation (5) [29]. 𝑅 𝑎 = ∑ 21𝑆𝑒𝑝𝑡 31𝐽𝑎𝑛
    𝑅 𝑚 + 𝑠𝑡𝑑( 𝑅 𝑚 ) 𝑅 𝐷 𝑚 −2 𝑅 𝑖 (5) where 𝑅 𝑚 is the mean monthly rainfall, 𝑠𝑡𝑑(
    𝑅 𝑚 ) is the mean standard deviation of monthly rainfall, 𝑅 𝐷 𝑚 are the total
    monthly rainy days and 𝑅 𝑖 is the daily rainfall. Primary infections initiate
    when the daily probability 𝑃(𝑑) outcome reaches 3%. From this day forth, secondary
    infections are calculated as mentioned at [29]. It is considered that infections
    occur when rainfall is at least 2 mm and T ≤ 11 °C, while for seven up to 22 days
    after the beginning of oospore germinations [29]. UCSC model was developed by
    Rossi et al. [8]. The model simulates, using a granularity time step of one hour,
    the entire process, starting from oospore maturation and germinations to zoospore
    discharge and dispersal and finally to secondary infection cycles [9]. The model
    uses sensory measurements of temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and
    rainfall as inputs. Briefly, the model calculates the time when the first break
    of the oospore’s dormancy occurs (about the 1st of January), as well as the primary
    and secondary infection progress, by calculating the Relative Incidence of Infection
    (RII) metric value [2,4,8]. The metrics used by the model are shown in Table 1
    [8]. Furthermore, Table 1 at [9], shows the model input parameters for oospore
    maturation and oospore-zoospore germination stages. UR model. This is a Goidanich-table-based
    model alternative that tries to address both primary and secondary infections
    [25]. According to this model, oospore maturation in winter is reached if the
    value of a cumulative temperatures sum reaches 140–160 °C. This sum ∑ 𝑇 𝑚 is calculated
    using mean daily temperatures ( 𝑇 𝑚 ), starting from the 1st of January, and using
    the following Equation (6) [30,31]. ∑ 𝑇 𝑚 =∑{ 𝑇 𝑚            −8 𝑇 𝑚
               𝑇 𝑚            <8 𝑇 𝑚            ≥8
    (6) If oospore maturation is reached, then oospore germination occurs, providing
    primary sporangia either when mean relative humidity 𝑅 𝐻 8ℎ > 80 and mean temperature
    𝑇 8ℎ > 8 for an 8-h window or when mean precipitation occurs more than 5 mm (
    𝑅 𝐹 𝑚 > 5) for the last 48 h. The first dispersion of zoospores is reached after
    oospore germination, when mean rainfall RF > 3 mm and 𝑇 𝑚 > 8 for a 6 h interval
    (a modified 3–10 Rule). Then primary infections occur, if Degree hours Dh > 50,
    calculated based on Equation (7) [30,31]. 𝐷ℎ= ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑇 𝑖         ,𝑖𝑓𝑅
    𝐻 ℎ ≥90 (7) where 𝑇 𝑖 is the hourly temperature (hour 𝑖=1…𝑛 ) and 𝑅 𝐻 ℎ is the
    hourly relative humidity. Secondary infections are calculated using the Goidanich
    table index. To achieve sporulation for secondary infections, two conditions needed
    to be met: 𝑅 𝐻 ℎ ≥90 % or temperatures between 12 °C and 29 °C for at least 4
    h at night [25]. Additionally, the model considers that exposure to more than
    6 h above 30 °C results in the death of oospores, both for primary and secondary
    infections [32]. Milvit Model. Developed by the French Plant Protection Service
    in the late 80s. It is a potato downy mildew simulated model, a pathogen with
    similar pathogen characteristics to P. viticola [33]. As mentioned by Magnien
    et al. [33], it uses temperature and relative humidity, four stages of the pathogen
    cycle. It is also supported by a DSS system. Nevertheless, this model is not taken
    into account since it is not targeting the phenological characteristics of V.
    vinifera and since, as mentioned by Puelles et al. experimentation [25], it has
    shown both over-prediction and under-prediction infection blocks compared to field
    observations. Vitimeteo—Plasmopara is a mechanistic model based on experimental
    observations, created by Bleyer et al. [34]. This model tries to predict both
    primary and secondary infections. The main model components are three stages:
    (1) Maturation oospores stage, (2) primary, and (3) secondary infections. Regarding
    (1) and (2) the UR model is used. However, secondary infections are calculated
    using mean temperature 𝑇 𝑚 degree hours Dh > 50, if 3 < 𝑇 𝑚 < 29, and if hourly
    relative humidity 𝑅 𝐻 𝑚 > 95% [34]. Table 1. UCSC model metrics and coefficients
    [8]. The aspect of incorporating deterministic epidemiology models for precision
    viticulture planning is significant. Therefore, Savary et al. presented the critical
    factors and framework to develop dynamic epidemiology models for dual process
    epidemics [35]. That is, by calculating the disease x rate: 𝑑𝑥 𝑑𝑡 =𝑐· 𝑅 𝑐 𝑝(𝑥)𝑓(𝑥)·(1−𝑝(𝑥))ℎ(𝑥|𝑦)
    , as part of a model that takes into account an introductory infection rate as
    weight 𝑅 𝑐 , that compensates for the number of dispersed propagules per infectious
    lesion and its infectious efficiency. In contrast, 𝑝(𝑥) is the probability of
    the regression process of infected tissues, while 𝑓(𝑥) represents the disease
    rate x, considering disease multiplication, environmental parameters, latencies,
    and plant growth. ℎ(𝑥) is the healthy issues growth parameter according to either
    infection rate x or plant growth parameter y. Based on the previous paragraph
    mentioned framework, Bove et al. [3] developed a two-stage infection P. viticola
    simulation model taking into account environmental metrics of temperature, humidity,
    and variety that affect primary and secondary infections. According to Bove et
    al.’s elaborated model simulation scenarios, four major parameters can be considered
    catalytic on the rate of secondary infections: age, temperature, moisture, and
    grape variety [7]. Table 2 presents the simulation results of [7], under different
    temperature and humidity conditions, expressed as fuzzy sets, that downy mildew
    infestations depend on. Table 2 has been used as a piece of base information to
    implement the fuzzy logic annotation process of their deep learning model proposition.
    Regarding vine aging, Reuveni has experimented with vine leaf aging and vine aging,
    showing increased resistance of both older leaves and older vine plants [36].
    Variety also plays a significant role, as mentioned by [37]. Their paper examined
    16 Italian grape varieties over four years and indicated the grape variety resistance
    variance towards downy mildew. The authors highlight here the results from the
    studies [36,37] that both grapes’ age and variety are discriminant factors for
    downy mildew. These factors can be considered uniform if a single grape variety
    is studied and cultivated in a specific designated area of origin, with slight
    aging variations in the examined area cultivation fields. Table 2. P. viticola
    dependence on environmental parameters, according to [7], based on [11,38].    Since
    Millardet in 1882 who discovered the effects of copper against downy mildew, by
    observation, the Boareaux mixture was created using copper sulfate (CuSO4) and
    lime (Ca(OH)2) in water with a copper sulfate analogy of 2–3% up to 4%, the most
    suppressing competitive towards P. viticola. Another similar mixture is the Burgundy
    mixture that uses sodium carbonite (Na2CO3) instead of lime [39]. Therefore, the
    most successful protective treatment is using pesticide products based on the
    Bordeaux mixture solution before fungus development. Nevertheless, its uncontrolled
    use can threaten human health and soil [40], and therefore, precise treatment
    is required, applicable only at the early development stages before flowering
    and during berry formation. When environmental conditions favor fungus development,
    more active substance FRAC group 4 [41] fungicides are used [42]. In infection
    germination peaks, mixtures of copper protectants and phosphate-based fungicides
    can arrest the infection [43]. We also have to mention the use of microorganisms
    for the bio-control of plants as the alternative to chemical pesticides [39].
    1.2. Conclusions of Downy Mildew Models Examination Based on Section 1.1 presentation
    of existing models used for downy mildew, the following remarks are reached by
    the authors: Unlike the experimental varieties and conditions examined, all models
    fail to cope with the phenomenon’s evolution over attributes such as different
    environmental conditions, variety, and vine ages. No mechanistic model can be
    set as a catholic-holistic model due to the non-uniformity of the attributes described
    above, with the exception of some conservative empirical generic rules (for example,
    Rule 3–10). Mechanistic models trying to time the downy mildew disease process
    accurately can easily lead to erroneous calculations of significant offsets if
    the coefficients or variable parameters used do not match the examined environmental
    conditions that have been experimentally calculated (miscalibration). That is
    why, in several cases, empirical models can outperform mechanistic ones and can
    provide much more safe-ground predictions. Most mechanistic models target on-time
    evolution modeling of downy mildew and do not excerpt a decision suggestion required
    by Decision Support Systems. They are leaving such decisions to the non-expert’s
    eye. Such as precision viticulture practices (for example, vine leaves removal)
    or pesticide appliances and analogies (such as Bordeaux mixture products appliance).
    All models, specifically mechanistic ones (of higher sensory measurements, high
    granularity dependency), utilize meteorological station measurements. Such measurements
    are kept at best in hourly mean intervals. Furthermore, meteorological stations
    located at high elevation grounds, with 5–20 km radius coverage, servicing large
    areas of nonuniform terrestrial fields, cannot cope with the condition extrapolates.
    Due to this type of exploited input, they can provide only best-effort forecasts
    of significant field-level disease variations, thus leading to over-pesticide
    field uses in many cases. Downy mildew mechanistic models are trying to provide
    time-frames and thresholds for primary and secondary infections corresponding
    to large areas of different conditions. Because their inputs are in sparse hourly
    periods and are of single points of reference (single meteorological stations),
    without experimental calibrations of their coefficients, on field vine clusters,
    or on the monitored field areas, such models will consistently be outperformed
    by empirical ones. Next-generation Agriculture 4.0 models should target mostly
    suggestions or phenomena evolution time-frame breakpoints. Their calculations
    should not be deterministically inferred by a single equation but by a machine
    learning process that has as input a time series of annotated measurements. To
    achieve better than best effort plant level forecasts, dense input real-time or
    close to real-time measurements of 1 min, 5 min, or at least 10 min periodic intervals
    are needed. Furthermore, more sensor nodes are required, installed in the viticulture
    fields of at least 0.5 Ha coverage areas per sensor node, providing measurements
    of wetness or soil moisture or evapotranspiration, vapor pressure deficit, or
    at least temperature and humidity. The next-generation models should consider
    a simplified approach regarding their data inputs, outputs, and trainable coefficients
    so that the training process is algorithmic and easy to program as a repetitive
    process that can provide a set of different trained models inferring different
    forecasts under different field conditions. More data-driven machine-learning
    alternatives must be exploited to provide a holistic approach to cope with different
    environments. As mentioned by [44], ML algorithms, such as binomial LASSO regression,
    random forest, and gradient boosting, can infer better results and more accurate
    results than existing mechanistic models. Nevertheless, up to now, these models
    have yet to outperform mechanistic ones due to the lack of annotated measurements
    for model training purposes, thus degrading their accuracy and precision. Therefore,
    a more of a fuzzy logic annotation approach is fundamental to acquiring annotated
    data. Before presenting the authors’ deep learning implementation for P. viticola
    incident forecasting, a short subsection follows with the existing state-of-the-art
    Decision Support Systems implementing the described downy mildew detection models.
    1.3. Downy Mildew Forecasting DSS Systems Several Decision Support Systems that
    provide P. viticola predictions in the Mediterranean area have emerged over the
    last decade and are presented in literature [21]. One of the first DSS systems
    attempts for P. Viticola using meteorological station data inputs end empirical
    models is GrapeMilDeWS [45]. Rossi et al. [46], created a DSS system called vite.net
    utilizing meteorological station data inputs and from farmers’ meteorological
    sensors monitoring Vine Units (VUs) to provide decision support towards downy
    mildew using empirical models and mechanistic ones, specifically the UCSC model
    [4,8]. Agrometeo and Vitimeteo DSS systems also utilize weather stations to provide
    P. viticola primary infections and observe first oil spot alerts using a table-based
    Vitimeteo-Plasmopara model [47]. The authors of [26], created a custom system
    for dense micro-climate monitoring, collecting data from nearby meteorological
    stations, using average temperature, rainfall and pathogen concentration on the
    previous day and applying a linear regression prediction line, calculating the
    infection risk using the Goidanich algorithm [24]. Similarly, Decitrait DSS provides
    cultivation practices and forecasts using Goidanich and EPI models [48]. Finally,
    the authors of [49] presented a set of tools used for partitioning viticulture
    areas in Greece and post-processing data analysis of meteo station sensory measurements
    in the vicinity of these vine areas. In addition to precision viticulture treatments
    and DSS systems with inputs from sparsely located meteorological base stations,
    advancements in IoT and cloud technologies can provide new advanced Decision Support
    Systems (DSS) capable of better than micro-climate monitoring using dense monitoring
    stations for less than 2km sensory measurements acquisition [50]. Such systems
    can collect environmental data even at the plant-vine level using cheap IoT meteorological
    stations that aid farmers in making tactical and operational decisions. Towards
    vine-plant sensory monitoring, Perez et al. [19] presented a DSS system (VineSens)
    that utilizes two types of monitoring end nodes using ARM MPUs that transmit temperature,
    humidity, and moisture sensory measurements. The measurements are transmitted
    over Wi-Fi to gateways, and then data is transmitted over 3G/4G(LTE) to the central
    DSS logging service using the appropriate ReST HTTP API. The system utilizes the
    Rule 3–10 and the Goidanich model for mildew predictions. Furthermore, Trilles
    et al. [16] presented a cloud-based DSS system called SEnviro that includes edge
    IoT devices with temperature, humidity, and rainfall sensors. Using edge computing
    nodes, the Goidanich model cumulative index is calculated at the node level, and
    appropriate alerts are sent to the farmers via SMS. Other communication channels
    are also supported. SEnviro system can periodically collect measurements using
    GPRS transponders over long distances [16] and utilizing Wi-Fi transponders for
    short distances, as mentioned in [51]. The benefits of this platform are the use
    of open-source APIs, Non-relational sensory measurements data storage capabilities,
    and mainly its ability to perform end-node edge computing [16]. The authors express
    only a slight concern about how the selection and control tasks of different edge
    computational models can be performed at the SEnviro things edge nodes since relevant
    information is not provided in [16]; that is information regarding the control
    and orchestration of edge computational models or over-the-air SEnviro nodes forecasting
    model selections and updates via the SEnviro platform. Mezei et al. implemented
    the Winet DSS, which uses NBIoT technology [52], to implement autonomous nodes
    spread on vine fields. Their DSS implementation transmits temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture sensory measurements over UDP protocol streams to the Winet
    central service. For mildew predictions, a custom model that uses the 3–10 Rule
    for infection initiation and a polynomial equation: 𝑓(𝑡)=0.076 𝑡 2 −3.454𝑡+42.925
    fitted on the Muller model [10,18]. ZenAgro company [20] has implemented a DSS
    system using open-source ThingsBoard Application Service and sensory data acquisition
    SDK [53]. Their platform is capable of monitoring vine parameters of temperature,
    humidity, and leaf wetness via LoRa point-to-point transmissions, currently updated
    to LoRaWAN Dragino sensors capable of data transmissions using the LoRaWAN class
    A protocol [54]. Their DSS now provides only P. viticola forecasts using Rule
    3–10 and a simplified Muller model [10]. Hnatiuc et al. have implemented a vine
    disease detection framework supported by a sensory measurement data collection
    service that implements clustering and classification algorithms using TensorFlow
    [55] and utilizing IoT devices that monitor plant level sensory parameters of
    temperature, leaf moisture, soil moisture, sap flow meters, solar radiation sensors
    and soil oxygen sensors [17]. Further technological achievements on plant-level
    monitoring for P. viticola in grapevines systems and services include the use
    of ground base LiDAR scanners for leaf area index estimations as mentioned in
    [56,57], as well as the use of static cameras modules that utilize deep learning
    Faster-RCNN, SSD and Yolo object detection models on real-time or close to real-time
    intervals using RGB image acquisition from grapevine fields [15,58]. Such RGB
    images can also be acquired for deep learning model training and inferences by
    mobile cameras or low-altitude flying drones (flying 3–5 m above vine clusters).
    In addition, multispectral and specifically hyperspectral imaging (HSI), acquired
    from handheld cameras or methodologies for HSI image acquisition from drones [59],
    can provide more detailed color information than RGB images. The imaging spans
    at 400–800 nm bands are set for plant activity monitoring by calculating normalized
    vegetation coefficients, crucial in environmental remote sensing [60]. Reflectance
    differences between 470 nm and 700 nm frequency bands can easily distinguish and
    extract vine leaves contours [60]. Furthermore, reflectance differences combined
    with using Support Vector Machines (SVMs) can distinguish downy mildew spots on
    symptomatic leaves in the bands of 500–700 nm and 800–1000 nm, as mentioned at
    [61]. This paper focuses on sensory-measurement-driven DSS systems capable of
    issuing downy mildew forecasts and recommendations. Table 3 presents each system
    mentioned in the literature and its corresponding capabilities. The authors set
    these capabilities as Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) required for vine-level
    monitoring, forecasting, and decision support. DSS systems presented in Table
    3 have been examined based on the following KPIs set by the authors for plant-level
    monitoring and support: Table 3. Viticulture DSS systems capabilities. Meteo Station
    Data: Weather the DSS system also receives data inputs from meteorological stations
    via specifically designed protocols or interfaces. Meteorological stations. IoT
    Plant level Monitoring: Whether the DSS system acquires plant-level information
    using IoT sensors. Auto location tracking: Whether the DSS system can track its
    data input sources using GPS receivers (locality). data acquisition: The schema
    form that the DSS logging service stores the sensory data measurements, that can
    sustain big data records of different measurements-attributes over time as mentioned
    at [62]. Low-cost data transmissions: Covers the low-power data transponder specifications
    of DSS systems that use nodes capable of plant-level monitoring. Such transponders
    are RF-based, NBIoT, LoRa, LoRaWAN, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, or BLE/Bluetooth, which maintain
    low energy footprints, in contrast to the power consumption of GSM GPRS/3G/4G-LTE
    transponders [63]. This performance characteristic also considers the required
    network provider costs per node, especially for technologies such as NBIoT and
    GSM/GPRS/3G/4G. ReST API: If the DSS system includes appropriate SDK API to fetch
    data measurements or forecasts by clients using HTTP/UDP/CoAP/MQTT or custom protocol
    requests [64]. Interfaces: Type of accessible user interfaces offered by the DSS
    system (Web, Mobile App, Custom Application UI) OpenSource components: If the
    DSS utilizes open-source components SDKs or libraries Installation-Maintenance
    efforts: Whether the DSS system and its end vine-level nodes are easy to Install
    and scale, and the farmers’ minimum or no maintenance efforts are required. As
    shown in Table 3, both SEnviro and ZenAgro DSS systems are the ones that fulfill
    all DSS system capabilities (KPIs), set as necessary DSS capabilities by the authors
    for vine-level monitoring. Medium installation efforts are set for SEnviro because
    custom User Interfaces and panels have to be made for the Open Geospatial Consortium
    (OGC) SensorThings API [65], or Sensor Observation Services (SOS) [66]. This paper
    presents a new DSS system architecture called thingsAI. The proposed system adopts
    ZenAgro’s DSS architecture regarding LoRaWAN sensory data transmissions and vine-level
    nodes for sensory measurements. ThingsAI utilizes long-range autonomous GPS-equipped
    devices called motes. These devices include sensors that use different profiles
    to monitor temperature and humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture [15]. ThingsAI
    also utilizes autonomous LoRaWAN meteorological stations. These stations include
    additional pressure, wind speed, direction, and rain gauge sensors. ThingsAI measurements
    data storage engine utilizes the No-SQL capabilities of the Cassandra database
    [67,68], and ThingsBoard Web panels and alerts logic to provide messages via Twilio
    SMS, e-mail, and Slack interfaces [53]. ThingsAI also includes independent docker
    containers to implement, train, and infer deep-learning classifiers and detectors
    [69]. In such a dockerized container, the deep learning algorithm proposed by
    authors called the fuzzy-stranded-NN model is installed. The following section
    presents the author’s thingsAI implementation and their proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN
    algorithm, based on the stranded-NN implementation of [70], for detecting downy
    mildew. 2. Materials and Methods This section provides information regarding the
    proposed thingsAI high-level system architecture, motes structure, and the authors’
    deep learning algorithm proposition for detecting downy mildew events. 2.1. Proposed
    High-Level System Architecture This paper proposes a new high-level architecture
    based on open-source libraries and tools comprising a system called thingsAI.
    Figure 1 illustrates the core structural parts of our proposition. These components
    can be categorized as field components and cloud components. Field components
    include IoT modes and devices that collect field measurements. In contrast, cloud
    components include the Virtual Machines and Dockerized services [69] that provide
    measurements storage, Deep Learning algorithms computational tools and services,
    and farmers’ monitoring and management User Interfaces. In detail, the thingsAI
    system architecture is comprised by the following components: Figure 1. Proposed
    thingsAI high-level system architecture. Vine field device components: These include:
    1. the IoT mote devices equipped with GPS receivers and a LoRaWAN transponder,
    acquiring field sensory measurements (see Figure 1, (1)), such as temperature,
    humidity, leaf wetness and soil moisture, and 2. the LoRaWAN meteorological stations
    (see Figure 1, (2)), which include a GPS receiver, LoRaWAN transponder, pressure,
    temperature, humidity, wind speed, direction sensors, and a rain gauge. In each
    viticulture field, the farmers place the IoT motes to measure plant-level sensory
    parameters of different mote profiles, for instance, temperature and humidity,
    according to our downy mildew experimentation. The suggested coverage area for
    an IoT mote is more of a regular hexagon with either height ( ℎ=2𝑎𝑐𝑜𝑠( 30 ∘ ≈1.732𝑎
    ) or width ( 𝑤=2𝑎 ), where a = 100 m. That is, a coverage area of 𝐴= 3 𝑠 2 2·𝑡𝑎𝑛(
    30 ∘ ) ≈2.598 𝑎 2 per IoT mode device. The authors set the maximum coverage area
    for an IoT mode for vine-level monitoring up to 1 Ha. Usually, IoT motes are placed
    according to the following rules: (1) If there is a significant elevation difference
    between two points in a field more than 1 m, (2) If there is a slope of more than
    20°, offering different soil drainage, and (3) if there is tree coverage near
    the field contributing to a significant reduction of at least 2 h of sun throughout
    the day concerning the rest of the viticulture field. LoRaWAN meteorological stations
    are usually installed in pinpointed locations based on the ground morphological
    characteristics, covering field areas of 70–80 Ha. The field components also include
    the LoRaWAN gateway, which acts as a sensory measurements concentration and thinsAI
    data forwarding point to the thingsAI LoRa Server [54]. The sensory motes transmit
    measurements of temperature and humidity every 𝑇 𝑝 period intervals. These intervals
    can be programmable over the air by the farmers via ThingsBoard panels (with a
    minimum value of every 1 min and a maximum value of 4 h), using Class A LoRaWAN
    data reception windows RX1, RX2 [71]. The motes also transmit GPS location LoRaWAN
    frames that can be set to every 8–48 h. The same applies to the LoRaWAN meteorological
    stations. The LoRaWAN meteorological station coverage area may extend more than
    70–80 Ha and is used to capture meteorological measurements that accurately correspond
    to the included viticulture fields vine-clima. There is no need for vine-level
    measurements of wind speed, direction, or rain since their variations can be accurately
    captured using at least 1 km meteo-stations dense coverage. LoRaWAN meteorological
    stations are autonomous battery-operated devices with a mean power consumption
    of 1.8–3 W, transmitting measurements per-minute intervals via class A LoRaWAN
    protocol to the LoraWAN gateways. For the meteorological stations, different communication
    technologies can also be used, such as NBIoT UMTS(3G) or Wi-Fi, in order to transmit
    measurements to the thingsAI cloud infrastructure directly through the ThingsBoard
    container (see Figure 1, (7) ThingsBoard AS) bypassing the LoRaWAN application
    server (see Figure 1, (4) LoRaWAN AS). The thingsAI system field components utilize
    a dense grid of GPS-equipped IoT motes (see Figure 1, (1)) and a sparse grid of
    GPS-equipped LoRaWAN meteorological stations (see Figure 1, (2)) to provide sensory
    measurements at vine level. All motes (see Figure 1, (3)) transmit their GPS location
    using LoRaWAN frames via the gateway. The gateways use two communication technologies
    (NBIoT and LoRaWAN) deliberately made to minimize telecommunication provider costs.
    NBIoT transponders could have been used instead of LoRaWAN for end-device data
    transmissions (motes and meteorological stations). Nevertheless, such a technological
    alternative enforces a per mote SIM card annual communication fee for the farmers.
    Depending on the number of IoT motes used, the provider fees could reach up to
    2–4€/device/month. Instead, the authors propose using the LoRaWAN communication
    as a free long-range narrow-band alternative of a single connection point with
    one cellular telecommunications link at the gateway bridge. Since the LoRaWAN
    coverage extends from 5–12 km, a single gateway may cover a significant portion
    of a huge cultivation area [72]. LoRaWAN gateways (see Figure 1, (3) LoRaWAN gateways),
    are responsible for forwarding IoT mote measurement frames to the LoRaWAN network
    service and, therefore, to the application server (Figure 1, (4) LoRaWAN container)
    [69]. This is achieved by maintaining Internet connectivity via a cellular NBIoT
    network provider at the gateway level. The LoRaWAN gateways are autonomous devices
    of continuous operation, with a mean power consumption of 5–6 W, because they
    are operating simultaneously two different transponders: an NBIoT(GR-800MHz/B20)
    UART transponder of a 10 MHz/channel bandwidth and a LoRaWAN (EU:863–870 MHz)
    concentrator board of a 125 KHz/channel bandwidth. In areas where the B20 band
    is unavailable, the UMTS B21 band of 2100 MHz is used with higher channel bandwidths
    of 20 MHz/channel. All IoT motes and meteorological stations join the LoRa server
    using Over The Air Activation (OTAA). All IoT motes and meteorological stations
    have ADR LoRaWAN capabilities enabled. All motes transmit sensory data via the
    available LoRaWAN channels 1–8 and receive downlink windows RX1 via the data transmitting
    channel and RX2 at 869.5 MHz [71]. Cloud Components: These are mainly docker containers
    that reside in a single or multiple cloud Virtual Machine instances [69]. The
    thingsAI cloud components as shown in Figure 1, include the: 4. LoRaWAN container
    of the chirpstack LoRa server [73], the 5. Cassandra No-SQL clustered database
    [74], for storing sensory measurements, the 6. AI containers running deep learning
    training and classification, prediction tasks, and the 7. ThingsBoard Application
    Server (AS), platform container capable of providing visualization outputs, motes
    control, and suggestions-alerts to the end users. The chirpstack LoRa server [73]
    (see Figure 1, (4)), is an open-source network and application server capable
    of receiving encrypted AES-128 data transmissions from the LoRaWAN gateways. Upon
    data validation and decryption, the data are pushed to the Chirpstack container
    mosquito Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) service [75]. Then, the appropriate
    data logging agent using MQTT subscribe mechanism acquires the sensory measurements
    and submits them as HTTP post-device telemetry requests, depending on the LoRaWAN
    mote device ID, to the ThingsBoard Application server [76]. The ThingsBoard AS
    (see Figure 1, (7) ThingsBoard AS) is responsible for controlling all thingsAI
    devices (motes and meteorological stations) and device attributes at the application
    level, as well as storing the per-device sensory measurements and GPS locations
    at the Cassandra distributed Database cluster [74] (see Figure 1, (5)). In the
    ThingsBoard AS container reside the data logging service, the geo-location module,
    acquiring Google Map layers information (see Figure 1, (8)), the RPC motes control
    service, and notification services described in detail in Section 2.3. Finally,
    the thingsAI cluster (see Figure 1, (6)), described in Section 2.3, is a set of
    docker containers where the Deep Learning models, models’ training agents and
    inference services are instantiated, providing classifications and predictions.
    The following subsection reveals technical characteristics of the IoT motes and
    LoRaWAN meteorological stations used by the thingsAI system. 2.2. ThingsAI IoT
    Motes and Stations thingsAI end-devices have been implemented to provide a dense
    distributed grid of monitoring sensors. The implemented sensory devices called
    motes design is illustrated in Figure 2a. These devices operate autonomously and
    can be easily attached to striped viticulture fields’ viticulture iron corner
    stands. The end motes can be automatically spotted by the thingsAI system via
    their GPS receivers and are equipped with temperature and humidity sensors. Several
    other sensors, such as leaf wetness and soil moisture sensors, can be attached
    to these end devices, providing different profiles supported by the thingsAI data
    transmissions LoRaWAN protocol. Figure 2. IoT plant-level monitoring LoRaWAN motes,
    meteorological stations and vine field placements of motes and meteorological
    stations. (a) IoT plant-level autonomous LoRaWAN sensory motes with GPS receivers
    included. (b) IoT plant-level monitoring motes placement in viticulture fields.

    unit boards including onboard communication LoRaWAN transponders and GPS receivers.
    (d) IoT plant-level LoRaWAN meteorological station placement in viticulture fields.
    ThingsAI system IoT mote installations are performed using the following criteria:
    At least one sensory mote must exist in a rectangular area of 100 × 100 m (1 Hectare)
    called the maximum partitioning area If required due to elevation differences
    >0.8–2 m, the maximum partitioning area can be clustered into two or more areas
    where different motes are placed (vertical partitioning) If significant variances
    inside the maximum partitioning area occur with respect to direct hourly solar
    radiation measured daily at W/m due to shadowing caused by nearby tree clusters
    or other environmental factors, such as nearby water streams. Such calculations
    preferably take into account either monthly mean hourly differences of Vapor Pressure
    Deficit (VPD) in kPa for months May–Aug or reference evapotranspiration 𝐸 𝑇 𝑜
    , in mm, based on PenMan-Monteith equations [77], as a cumulative sum for months
    May-August. At least one monthly variance of VPD ≥0.4 , or a yearly evapotranspiration
    difference of 30 mm/y, taking into account as a full year the months of May-Aug,
    denote an area partitioning into two different regular hexagon areas, whose centers
    are the two variation points of either VPD or 𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 . The components included
    in the IoT plant-level motes (see Figure 2b,c, 1), are design-illustrated in Figure
    2a, and are the following: Either a COTS 32 bit ESP32 cortex-M3 MPU 32 MHz, of
    128 KB Flash, 16 KB or RAM and 4 KB of EEPROM and LoRaWAN onboard transponder
    that periodically collects and transmits sensory measurements using LoRaWAN frames
    [78], or Seeduino LoRaWAN RHF76-052AM board with the ATSAMD 48 MHz CPU and an
    onboard GPS receiver [79] can be used. DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor.
    Other sensors, such as leaf-wetness and soil moisture sensors, can also be attached.

    NEO-6M GPS on board UART receiver. 3.6 V, 8000 mA Lithium replaceable battery
    case connected with the board using a JST2.0 cable. External casing magnet for
    easy attachment to iron vineyard corners (see Figure 2a, 7, and Figure 2b, motes
    attached to iron corners). External tie wraps can be used for better grasping.
    Plastic IP67 casing. GPS antenna. LoRAWAN antenna. thingsAI motes sensory data
    and GPS location transmissions are controlled by the LoRaWAN Application server
    per mote accordingly, using downlink LoRaWAN control frames. Usually, sensory
    measurements are transmitted every 1–4 h so as to conserve motes energy. Motes
    and meteorological stations’ GPS location frames are usually sent every 24 or
    48 h or more. thingsAI IoT end-nodes data transmission application protocol uses
    two modes: (1) binary data mode and (2) stream data mode transmissions, controlled
    by the LoRaWAN Application Server. Binary data transmission’s advantage is the
    1–3% less battery consumption by reducing the over-the-air data transmission time
    compared to stream transmissions. Nevertheless, external APIs and interfaces can
    manipulate stream transmissions much more easily, favoring the system’s scalability.
    The thingsAI meteorological stations are illustrated in Figure 2d. Their processing
    unit and interface board are illustrated in Figure 2c, 2. It includes a Seeduino
    LoRaWAN RHF76-052AM board with the ATSAMD 48 MHz CPU and an onboard GPS receiver
    [79]. The Seeduino has an onboard GPS receiver, which is using a UART serial port
    where NMEA data are accumulated. It also has an onboard SPI connected, 14 dBM
    868 MHz, LoRaWAN transponder. The sensors attached to the meteorological stations
    using the Seeduino digital interface pins are a DHT22 humidity sensor, a BMP280
    pressure-temperature sensor connected to the I2C Seeduino digital pins, and via
    the Seeduino analog pins, an analog wind direction, speed sensor, and an open-type
    analog rain gauge. The meteorological station’s field placements (see Figure 2d)
    usually follow a dense micro-climate grid monitoring approach of 1–1.5 km of coverage
    radius [50]. LoRaWAN meteorological stations also operate autonomously. Usually,
    data transmissions of meteorological stations are statically performed every 1
    min, and their GPS location data transmissions every 24–48 h. Due to the per-minute
    granularity of sensory data transmissions and the number of sensors, meteorological
    stations are never in sleep mode. For this reason, a 12 V Pb 60 Ah battery and
    a pull-down 12–5 V converter are used to power those stations, including a 10–12
    W/12 V PV panel directly connected to the battery using alligator clips. Both
    IoT end motes and LoRaWAN meteorological stations use the Over The Air Activation
    OTAA mode and class A mode for LoRaWAN frame transmissions [54]. That is, prior
    to each transmitted frame, a LoRaWAN join process initiates according to the LoRaWAN
    protocol specification. The following subsection describes in detail the thingsAI
    cloud distributed services and LoRaWAN data transmission protocol used both by
    thingsAI motes and meteorological stations. Section 2.3 provides detailed information
    regarding the thingsAI system offered services and interfaces. 2.3. ThingsAI LoRaWAN
    Application Protocols and Cloud Services The following services have been implemented
    in the thingsAI system: (1) the data logging service, (2) the geo-location module,
    (3) the distributed database architecture and interfaces, (4) the RPC motes control
    service, (5) the AI containers model training agent and inference service, and
    (6) the ThingsBoard data visualization and notification services. The data logging
    service is on the ThingsBoard container. Its main functionality is to subscribe
    to the MQTT service of the open-source chirpstack LoRaWAN Application server for
    a specific application topic names and for every mote or meteorological station
    device ID in that area, as registered to the ThingsBoard Application Server (AS).
    The data logging service can store measurements in the Cassandra database cluster
    by performing ThingsBoard AS HTTP POST requests using each device’s unique token
    ID for authentication. ThingsBoard also has an MQTT broker installed, but it is
    not used for publishing requests directly since token authentication knowledge
    per device is required to publish data. Instead, the chirpstack MQTT broker is
    used as a central gathering point for all messages under a single application
    area topic. Henceforth, the data logging service is responsible for the per-device
    message classification and database sensory records submissions using per-device
    JSON HTTP POST requests. The devices’ Universally Unique Identifiers (DEV-UUIDs)
    and authentication tokens are maintained separately in the ThingsBoard PostgreSQL
    database. The data logging service uses this UUID-authentication token tuple information
    to listen for MQTT messages and forward HTTP POST measurement requests to the
    ThingsBoard AS, which in turn stores these measurements in the database cluster.
    The geo-location module is instantiated in the ThingsBoard AS. It includes a map
    panel User Interface that can be added to a specific farmer’s monitoring dashboard
    and a set of notification rule chains that may notify the farmer using external
    ReST APIs (via e-mail, SMS, or Slack messages). The module keeps track of specific
    customer-farmer device nodes and updates the per-farmer map panel with the locations
    of the owned mote devices. The map panel can illustrate mote and meteorological
    station locations in real-time using the Google Maps API and satellite layer view.
    The panel can also illustrate the latest telemetry sensory data, recorded date,
    and battery status using the JavaScript marker popup balloons. Suppose a polygon-activated
    area is enabled (by drawing a default polygon at the map panel). In that case,
    the module can issue notifications if a node moves out of the polygon of interest
    (geofencing), the motes’ GPS coordinates have not been received for more than
    48 h, or the mote battery is low. The Cassandra No-SQL clustered database is a
    decentralized concept of database nodes that have the same responsibility, and
    data replication is performed by cloning data from one to the next. All mote records
    are parts of the same database with different cluster copies. This means that
    the ThingsBoard AS can directly access any mote stored data, thus enhancing data
    availability and speed in contrast to the MongoDB hierarchical clustered alternative.
    Data availability is, in fact, a more crucial parameter than speed for DSS systems
    offering forecasts since several agents from the AI containers may try to access
    data over time for model training and inference processes. However, as mentioned
    by [68], Cassandra outperforms MongoDB for large time ranges, while they have
    a comparable performance for shorter ones. For example, suppose statistical analysis
    trends are requested to plot mean temperatures on-demand over the last 20 years
    or when the requested data size is above 1 M records. In that case, some minor
    visualization latencies may occur, at most 5–10 s. Nevertheless, its direct any-node
    connect architecture makes it an ideal database for minimizing data loss and corruption
    compared to a hierarchical clustered model such as MongoDB [67]. The Remote Procedure
    Call (RPC) control service is instantiated on top of the ThingsBoard AS. It includes
    a set of control options that can be set per device entity as server attributes.
    Such attributes are the time interval, which specifies the mote telemetry transmission
    period, and the GPS time interval, which specifies the GPS latitude-longitude
    coordinates acquisition and transmission intervals. Other control options that
    can be specified are the device-enable attribute and the device-GPS-enabled device
    server attributes. End motes and meteorological stations data transmissions are
    performed using class-A LoRaWAN protocol. In order to cope with different types
    of sensory motes having different types of sensors installed, different device
    profiles have been implemented. Profile S1 indicates a temperature-humidity mote.
    Profile S2 indicates a meteorological station with installed temperature, humidity,
    pressure, wind speed, direction sensors, and rain gauge (meteorological station
    profile). Profile S3 indicates a temperature-humidity and leaf wetness sensor,
    and profile S4 corresponds to a temperature-humidity and soil moisture sensor.
    Two different types of frames concerning sensory measurements or GPS location
    are also being transmitted (Type 1 and Type 2 accordingly). Table 4 shows Type
    1 sensory measurements payload frame encoding for both binary and stream modes
    of motes operation. Table 5 shows Type 2 GPS location payload frame encoding for
    binary and stream modes accordingly. The end motes sensory transmission process
    flow is illustrated in Figure 3. Figure 3. LoRaWAN class A data transmission process
    of mote devices and meteorological stations. Table 4. ThingsAI LoRaWAN frame data
    encoding for sensory measurements—Type 1 message. For profile S1, the maximum
    frame size for stream mode is 30 bytes, while for profile S2, the maximum frame
    size for stream mode is 50 bytes. Table 5. ThingsAI LoRaWAN frame data encoding
    for GPS measurements—Type 2 message. Maximum GPS measurements frame size for stream
    mode is 44 bytes. LoRaWAN mote data transmission process initiates with the sensory
    measurements data collection and set up of the control parameters, including parameters
    such as periods of sensory and GPS location data transmissions, GPS timeout, and
    transmission mode (binary or stream). Upon successful measurements collection,
    the device battery status is checked and using the appropriate alarm field, as
    indicated in Table 4. For sensory measurement transmissions, the data frame encoding
    process initiates (see Figure 3), and LoRaWAN class-A data transmission occurs
    without the data acknowledgment flag set. Then, the end device checks whether
    the GPS location transmission interval is reached. If so, a time interval of 500
    s to 2 min to acquire NMEA GPS data from the GPS UART port is initiated as set
    by the GPS timeout control parameter. A LoRaWAN frame is constructed upon a successful
    GPS fix, and GPS data are payload-encoded using Table 5. GPS LoRaWAN frame transmissions
    are followed with appropriate ACK (acknowledgment frame) reception from the network
    server during the class-A receive window intervals L1 and L2. During this mote
    frame receiving state, the LoRaWAN AS down-links the control data updates using
    explicit stream encoding of comma-delimited control streams. The end devices receive
    these control parameters and update their EEPROM or Flash control variables. After
    each data transmission, the motes sleep until the next measurement interval, as
    shown in Figure 3. The same measurement process applies to the meteorological
    stations with the difference that GPS measurements may be completely disabled
    (GPS turn off control command). If the meteorological station devices acquire
    measurements per minute intervals, due to the large number of sensors that need
    measurements to be acquired (which requires a mean data acquisition time of 25–30
    s including a 5–15 s OTAA join process), the meteorological devices are never
    put to sleep mode. The following Section 2.4 describes the proposed authors’ deep
    learning model for the downy mildew events detection implemented by the authors
    in their thingsAI system implementation. 2.4. ThingsAI Downy Mildew Model There
    are significant implications for using deep learning models regarding precision
    and decision making. Nevertheless, there are limited existing annotated datasets.
    That is because the need to annotate the sensory datasets properly requires efforts
    by experts, thus still leaving space for deterministic and empirical models to
    be used. Towards this direction, Fuzzy logic can offer an alternative utilizing
    fuzzy measurement sets and fuzzy operations that, if properly supervised, can
    lead to automated annotation processes. Moreover, the data annotation steps can
    be performed by auto-encoders to provide vine-level big-data collections as trainable
    datasets based on human fuzzy linguistic rules. Such datasets can, therefore,
    be exploited to train deep learning models for precise classification and prediction
    purposes rather than deterministic mechanistic models that are hard to implement
    or generalized empirical models. Towards this automated annotation necessity,
    the authors propose a new Fuzzy-stranded-Neural Network (Fuzzy-stranded-NN) model
    for detecting downy mildew events. That is, using sets of Neural Networks of arbitrary
    depths so as to detect outliers or breakpoints more accurately in contrast to
    empirical or deterministic models with erroneously calibrated coefficients and
    parameters due to environmental diversities. The authors first presented the proposed
    Stranded-NN model for detecting Industrial machinery outliers [70], now used for
    detecting downy mildew. The Fuzzy part of this model proposition deals with the
    automatic annotation tasks of measurements based on fuzzy logic observations,
    similar to the ones mentioned in Table 3. The model input is a batch of m number
    of time-series measurements such as 𝑚≥8 and 𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑑(𝑎)==0 , where a is the number
    of sensory attributes used, in our case temperature and humidity measurements
    (𝑎=2) . These batches are given as input to the model with a specific order (𝑇,𝐻)
    . The model batch input series of: 𝑇 0 , 𝐻 0 ,…, 𝑇 𝑖 , 𝐻 𝑖 ,…, 𝑇 𝑚 , 𝐻 𝑚 measurements,
    represent a 1D array of (𝑚,1) , measurements taken from a specific thingsAI sensory
    mote: 𝑠 𝑙 , where 1<𝑙≤𝑘 . All measurements are entered in a chronological order
    stream of 𝑡 0 ,…, 𝑡 𝑖 ,… 𝑡 𝑚 𝑎 timed ( 𝐴 0 ,…, 𝐴 𝑛 ) sensory attributes. This
    1D array is called model measurements input batch and corresponds to a specific
    time length that equals to 𝑇 𝑝 = ∑ 𝑚 𝑎 𝑖=1 𝑡 𝑖 − 𝑡 𝑖−1 . The fuzzy-stranded-NN
    algorithm includes different Neural Network sub-models, each capable of accepting
    a specific batch size input (𝑚,1) for training and inference processes. Our proposed
    model has been constructed using Python TensorFlow framework [55,80] and has been
    implemented in an AI container of the thingsAI system as a periodic inference
    service that predicts the criticality of the mildew events using three major classes:
    (1) Normal class that corresponds to the class when the downy mildew infections
    are in pause, mildew-1 when the downy mildew infections are linearly evolving
    or mildew-2 when the downy mildew infections are exponentially evolving. Two more
    classes are built in the model corresponding to extremely low and extremely high
    temperatures with declining infection phenomena. The model can maintain different
    batch sizes of different time intervals 𝑇 𝑝 . This can be achieved by partitioning
    a specific time interval 𝑑𝑇 using different m lengths for specific measured attributes
    a. The model acts as a prediction classifier presenting an output of the five
    classes: Cold stress, Mildew-1, Mildew-2, Normal and Hot stress. Cold and Hot
    stress classes correspond to the mildew decline phenomena classes due to very
    low and high temperatures that prevail; the normal class corresponds to the non-evolving
    phenomena class, while mildew-1 and mildew-2 classes correspond to the linear
    and exponential infections evolving classes accordingly. To provide classification
    vector outputs, all batch inputs need to be annotated (classified) to one of the
    above classes and rules based on either experimental results (taken from fungus
    traps) or simulation results as the ones presented in Table 2. Based on the input
    batch size (𝑚,1) , the following Equation (8) determines each strand’s number
    of hidden layers q, where 𝑞≥2 : 𝑞={ 2 𝑖𝑛𝑡(𝑙𝑜 𝑔 2 (𝑚))−1 9≤𝑚≤32 𝑚>32 (8) If 5>𝑞≥3
    , two hidden layers instantiate for these strands of 𝑛𝑛=64 , 16 neurons per layer
    accordingly. The minimum value of batch input measurements is 𝑚=9 . If the number
    of hidden layers 𝑞>2 , then the total number of trainable parameters p per model
    strand as well as the number of neurons 𝑛 𝑛 𝑖 per 𝑖𝑡ℎ hidden layer are calculated
    using Equations (9) and (10) accordingly. 𝑝= 2 𝑞 + ∑ 𝑖=0 𝑞−4 2 𝑖𝑛𝑡(𝑙𝑜 𝑔 2 (𝑚))−𝑖
    (9) 𝑛 𝑛 𝑖 ={ 2 𝑞 2 𝑞−𝑖 𝑖=1,2 𝑖>2 (10) where q is the total number of hidden layers
    calculated by Equation (8). For example, let us assume per-minute measurements
    of two attributes, temperature, and humidity (𝑇,𝐻) , acquired by a sensory mote
    𝑠 1 in batches of m = 48 and m = 80 measurements. Each batch includes 24 and 40
    periods 𝑇 𝑝 of temperature and humidity measurements. For the input batch values
    of m = 48 and m = 80, the fuzzy-stranded-NN algorithm generates two fully connected
    neural network models of three 𝑞=3 and 𝑞=4 hidden layers accordingly. The neurons
    per hidden layer are 𝐿 32 1 − 𝐿 32 2 − 𝐿 16 3 for m=48 and 𝐿 64 1 − 𝐿 64 2 − 𝐿
    32 3 − 𝐿 16 4 for m = 80. If the measurements correspond to two attributes (𝑇,𝐻)
    , and each measurement is hourly measured, then the prediction time intervals
    𝑇 𝑝 = 24 h for m = 48 and 𝑇 𝑝 = 40 h for m = 80. In order to eliminate degraded
    gradients, L1 regularization is also performed in each hidden layer, but the ability
    to introduce dropout layers per strand to avoid over-fitting has been disabled
    to improve accuracy results [70]. Table 6 presents the fuzzy-stranded-NN model
    hyperparameters that can be fine-tuned during the model training process. Table
    6. Fuzzy-stranded-NN model hyperparameters and their default tuned values. A separate
    training process for each model strand must be performed for the model to provide
    multi-strand classification results. Therefore, an initial big annotated dataset
    of temperature and humidity measurements is needed. The training dataset has been
    acquired using a thingsAI meteorological station that the authors have placed
    in a viticulture field in Zitsa, Epirus, Greece. The meteorological station device
    could acquire temperature, pressure, humidity, wind direction, speed, and rain
    measurements per minute from 2018 to 2023. In order to obtain additional temperature
    and humidity measurements, the Open-Meteo API has been used [81], taking hourly
    measurements from 2010–2018. In order to expand these measurements to minute scale,
    a padding process has been implemented using a second-order polynomial kernel
    in the form of 𝑎 𝑥 2 +𝑏𝑥+𝑐 between two 𝑖 𝑡 ℎ interval hourly measurements, let
    𝑇 1 , 𝑇 2 , 𝑇 1 ≠ 𝑇 2 and 𝐻 1 , 𝐻 2 , with 𝐻 1 ≠ 𝐻 2 . If 𝑇1=𝑇2 , or 𝐻 1 = 𝐻 2
    then a random uniform padding process has been used starting from the base temperature
    𝑇 1 or humidity 𝐻 1 in the (𝑚𝑖𝑛,𝑚𝑎𝑥) range of ±0.5 for temperatures and ±1 for
    humidity measurements accordingly. Each one of these measurement 𝑇,𝐻 pairs have
    been annotated into the five different classes using an automated fuzzification
    process of semi-automated set rules. The fuzzy sets for temperature measurements
    include low temperatures (temp-cold set), of low temperatures up to 10 °C, where
    mildew infections do not occur according to the literature [12], mildew temperatures
    (temp-critical set) where primary and secondary infections occur (10–23 °C) [7],
    normal-class temperatures set (temp-normal) where secondary infections occur at
    a slower pace (23–32 °C) [7] and extremely hot temperatures where the infection
    cycle stops and diminishes over time (above 32 °C) [11]. The fuzzy sets used for
    humidity measurements include the dry set of humidity values up to 40%, the wet
    set of humidity values above 40% and up to 75% of incremental rate infections,
    and the moist set of humidity values above 75% of exponential rate infections
    [7]. Bounded sigmoid membership functions (MF) have been used for temp-cold and
    temp-hot sets according to the experimentally calculated using Equation (11).
    𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥· 4𝑙𝑜𝑔(3) 𝑙𝑜𝑤−ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ ·9 𝑒 𝑙𝑜𝑤·− 4𝑙𝑜𝑔(3) 𝑙𝑜𝑤−ℎ𝑖𝑔ℎ ,1≥𝑓(𝑥)≥0 (11) where
    x corresponds to the 𝑓(𝑥)=1 membership function (MF) center value and low and
    high are the arbitrary bounded sigmoid minimum and maximum values, where the corresponding
    confidence level values are zero. The same applies to dry and moist humidity sets.
    For all other sets of temperature and humidity domains, triangular sigmoid functions
    have been used. Each membership function (MF) output value is the fuzzy probability
    of confidence of a specific temperature or humidity value corresponding to a specified
    fuzzy state-set. Figure 4a,b illustrate the membership functions of temperature
    and humidity sets used for the sensory data automatic annotation process. Figure
    4. (a) Temperature fuzzy sets, MF and their corresponding confidence levels. (b)
    Humidity fuzzy sets, MF and their corresponding confidence levels. (c) Fuzzyfication
    output sets, MF, and their corresponding confidence levels. (a) Illustrates confidence
    levels of temperature sets over temperatures, (b) illustrates confidence levels
    of humidity sets over temperatures. In contrast, (c) illustrates both detection
    classes’ confidence levels and confidence levels per class of the fuzzy annotation
    outputs based on the fuzzy inference rules. The fuzzy inference output set uses
    temperature as the base measure. It has five fuzzy states that correspond to the
    stranded-NN classifier outputs (1–5): Class-0 of cold abiotic temperature state,
    class-1, is the mildew-1 state for primary infections and low secondary infections,
    class-2, is the mildew-2 state for low primary infections and high secondary ones,
    class-3 is the normal state class for minimum secondary infections, or secondary
    infections at decline and the class-4 corresponds to hot abiotic stress conditions
    of high temperatures. Figure 4c shows the membership functions of the fuzzification
    output results corresponding to the fuzzy-stranded-NN classes (0–5). The fuzzy
    outputs are calculated from the fuzzy inputs according to the fuzzy rules presented
    in Table 7. These fuzzy rules are the non-automatic part of the fuzzy annotation
    process. The agriculturist experts can set them accordingly on the area of interest
    in a fuzzy manner. Table 7. Fuzzy inference rules for the fuzzy inferred class
    annotation of the stranded-NN model. keyword plus. Table 7 lingual hedges of plus,
    minus, and very modify the curves of the membership function values performed
    at the Mamdani-based fuzzy outputs as mentioned in [82]. The linguistic term very
    corresponds to the square of the output ( 𝑀 𝐹 𝑣 =𝑀 𝐹 2 𝑣 ). The linguistic term
    plus equals 𝑀 𝐹 𝑣 =1.2·𝑀 𝐹 𝑣 , while the minus hedge corresponds to 𝑀 𝐹 𝑣 =0.75·𝑀
    𝐹 𝑣 . With the use of the proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN model, the thingsAI platform
    can offer decision support regarding farmers’ intervention breakpoints starting
    from the 1st of May and focusing mainly on secondary infection cycles intervention
    events can be estimated from the model inference class outputs provided by Equation
    (12). 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 = ⎧ ⎩ ⎨         1 𝑘 𝑐 𝑝 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓 ·𝑑𝑇, 𝐶 𝑖 𝑝 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓 ·𝑑𝑇, 1 𝑘 𝑛
    (1− 𝑝 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓 )·𝑑𝑇, 0, 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠=0 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠=1,2 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠=3 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠=4 (12) where 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 is the
    daily interval fraction that the disease is in progress. The 𝐶 𝑖 values denote
    the model inference class value (For example, class 1 (mildew-1) and 2 (mildew-2)),
    and 𝑝 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑓 is the confidence level that the predicted inference class result belongs
    to that specific class, as calculated by the model. Coefficients 𝑘 𝑐 , 𝑘 𝑛 determine
    the contribution percentage of the disease as a weight parameter for cold abiotic
    and normal classes accordingly. Suppose the model inference output denotes a class
    0 (cold abiotic) or class 3 (normal); parameter values in the range of 9≥ 𝑘 𝑐
    , 𝑘 𝑛 ≥3 can be used. 𝑑𝑇 is the corresponding periodic time interval that the
    model issues detections (inferences), as presented in Table 8, 𝑑𝑇 value. The 𝑑
    𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 value is measured in daily intervals, using Equation (11). The total number
    of secondary infections progress 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 is expressed as a cumulative sum in days
    by Equation (13). 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 = ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁 𝑇 𝑖 (13) where i is the model counted
    inference intervals cycles starting from the 1st of May. According to the bibliography,
    the initial oil spot lesions typically appear between 7 and 18 days. This means
    that an intervention breakpoint must be set when the 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 reaches this value,
    usually set to 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 = 7–12 days, in between the infection period intervals set
    by [3,6,8]. The system issues appropriate intervention alerts if such breakpoints
    are reached. When such a breakpoint elapses, the value of 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 is set to zero,
    i is set to 1, and the calculation is repeated for the following breakpoint interval.
    Table 8. Fuzzy-stranded-NN batch measurement sizes and inference intervals over
    number of 𝑇,𝐻 measurements acquired by a single thingsAI mote. In the following
    sections the authors present their experimentation with their proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN
    downy mildew classifier model. 3. Experimental Scenario The author’s experimentation
    took place in a 0.7 Ha viticulture field of the Debina white grape variety in
    Zitsa, Epirus, Greece. The experimental setup included one LoRaWAN meteorological
    station set up in the middle of the field and three end motes (hkt_thp1–3) whose
    viticulture field placements were based on the elevation and VPD mote criteria
    of 2021. The end motes data transmissions have been set to hourly intervals. The
    meteorological station data transmissions have been set to every minute. Figure
    5 shows the viticulture field and the installed temperature and humidity motes
    (motes htk_thp1–3), as illustrated on the ThingsBoard AS map-panel, over the satellite
    layer of the Google Maps API [83]. The motes used in this experimental scenario
    include temperature and humidity sensors. The installed meteorological station
    includes temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, wind direction sensors,
    and an open-type rain gauge. Figure 5. Experimental Debina variety viticulture
    field and end motes (thp1–3) placements as illustrated at the ThingsBoard motes
    map panel. The meteorological station has been placed in the center of the vine
    field. The authors tested and validated their end-mote proposition by collecting
    temperature and humidity measurements per end-mote and presenting these results
    using the appropriate ThingsBoard AS dashboard User Interfaces. Moreover, appropriate
    dashboards have also been created for the LoRaWAN meteorological station that
    can illustrate measurements in real-time, hourly, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
    Measurements have been collected from the viticulture field motes for 2021–2023
    and for the months of March until September for each year accordingly. At first,
    the fuzzification process was executed using the MF functions and fuzzy rules
    described in Section 2.4. The fuzzy inference class annotation outputs for different
    temperature and humidity values are illustrated in Figure 6. Figure 6. ThingAI
    fuzzy-stranded-NN model auto-annotation process over collected temperature and
    humidity values. Two classes of linear rate evolving mildew-1 and exponential
    rate mildew-2 are used. Mildew-1 tries to cope with oospore maturation and primary
    sporulation, while mildew-2 with secondary infections. The fuzzy-stranded-NN model
    has been trained using the collected temperature and humidity measurements. In
    order to circumvent model erroneous prediction for years 2021–2023 due to over-fitting,
    additional hourly temperature and humidity measurements have been acquired from
    years 2011–2023 from the Zitsa meteorological station using the OpenMeteo historical
    API [81] (acquiring Zitsa area historical data for months March until September
    each year (2011–2020)). Additionally, all OpenMeteo hourly measurement intervals
    have been padded to a minute scale as described in Section 2.4. From this training
    process, the author’s meteorological station collected data from the years 2021–2023,
    which have been kept and used by their model evaluation scenarios. The collected
    data set, upon data padding, included a total of 4.8 million temperature-humidity
    measurement pairs. These value pairs have been annotated and fed as input to the
    fuzzy-stranded-NN model using 80% of the dataset for training and 20% for testing.
    From the fuzzy stranded model, the strands of temperature-humidity batches of
    size n = 16, 48, 80, 160, 480, and 960 have been trained using the fuzzy annotated
    dataset as input. Before different batch size model strand training, the input
    measurements data have been partitioned into batches of measurements. Since the
    fuzzy annotation process has been performed for each measurement of 𝑇,𝐻 separately,
    the per batch aggregated annotated fuzzy output class and class confidence level
    (that expresses the probability that a set of measurements belongs to a class),
    have been calculated as a mean value of the class and confidence vectors per batch.
    According to the mentioned partitioning and batch annotation steps, different
    annotated batch input sets have been created for each strand to train. The per-strand
    training process used the default model hyperparameters as presented in Table
    6. Section 3.1 presents the trained fuzzy-stranded-NN model evaluation results.
    3.1. Training Model Evaluation For the proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN model validation
    and evaluation, the technique that we use to minimize the loss is the Adaptive
    Momentum Estimation algorithm or Adam optimization, starting with an initial high
    learning rate parameter of 0.01 that is gradually reduced by a factor of 𝑓= 10
    −2 ,𝑛𝑒 𝑤 𝑙𝑟 =𝑙𝑟·𝑓 . This adaptive callback monitors cross-entropy loss, and if
    no improvement is seen for three epochs (patience = 3), the learning rate is reduced
    until the value of 𝑙𝑟= 10 −4 . During epoch evaluation stages using the test dataset,
    both accuracy and the categorical cross-entropy loss function, which calculates
    loss between the actual labels and predictions for multi-class data, is used,
    based on Equation (14). 𝐿 𝑡𝑜 𝑡 𝐶𝐸 = ∑ 𝑗=1 𝑛 − ∑ 𝑖=0 𝐶 𝑦 𝑗 ̂ 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎 𝑙 𝑖 ·𝑙𝑜𝑔( 𝑦
    𝑗 ̂ 𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑖 ) (14) where i = 0…C, the classifier classes, 𝑗=1…𝑛 , the testing
    set members, and 𝑦 ̂ 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎 𝑙 𝑖 , 𝑦 ̂ 𝑝𝑟𝑒 𝑑 𝑖 , the actual and predicted classification
    vectors, expressed as a cumulative value called total loss. Similarly, the accuracy
    metric is calculated for each epoch during testing as the percentage of the predicted
    classification values ( 𝑦 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑 ) that match actual values ( 𝑦 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒 ) over the
    total number of testing set members. The confidence metric 𝐶𝑜𝑛 𝑓 𝑗 , for each
    j predicted class output, expresses the distance between the maximum predicted
    value ( 𝑝 𝑣 𝑖 ) upon normalization of the classifier output vector and the actual
    ground truth class i (vector element position), expressed by Equation (15). 𝐶𝑜𝑛
    𝑓 𝑗 =|𝑚𝑎𝑥{𝑝 𝑣 𝑖 }|,𝑖=0…𝐶 (15) The metrics of accuracy and total loss( 𝐿 𝑡𝑜 𝑡 𝐶𝐸
    ) have been used for each one of the model strands and different epoch values
    of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, and 80 per strand accordingly. Figure 7 illustrates
    the accuracy results over batch size n for different epoch values, while Figure
    8 illustrates the total loss values over batch size n for different epochs. Figure
    7. Proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN model accuracy per strand over trained epochs. Figure
    8. Proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN model loss per strand over trained epochs. From
    Figure 7 accuracy results, the accuracy starts with the highest value of 95% for
    n = 16, and 92–93% for stranded models of n = 160, 80 and 48 batch sizes over
    10–20 epochs. However, these high accuracy scores start decreasing above 20 epochs,
    achieving minimum accuracy scores of 85% at 40 epochs. The model accuracy stabilizes
    close to 90% for 60–70 epochs and close to 90.5% at 80 epochs. Total loss for
    models n = 16, 48 remains constant for all epochs, while for n = 80, 160, the
    loss decreases starting from 10 to 20 epochs, and above 20 epochs, it also remains
    constant. This means that for small batch input size strands (up to 160 measurements
    batch), at least a number of 20 epochs is needed for the loss to minimize. Above
    20 epochs, introducing more epoch cycles can contribute to improved accuracy results
    of 0–5% up until 80 epochs. This improvement is mainly caused by the adaptive
    learning rate mechanism of the Adam optimizer used by the model. Above 80 epochs,
    accuracy remains constant, offering no more than 0.5–1% improved accuracy results.
    The proposed fuzzy-stranded-NN model manages to maintain a mean accuracy result
    of 90.5% for stands of batch size less than 160 measurements. and mean accuracy
    of 90% for strands of batch size above 480. The number of measurements per batch
    size is presented in Table 6. Large batch size strands of n = 480 and n = 960
    present significant losses for low training epochs (less than 50 epochs) as shown
    in Figure 7. This is due to the excess size of their network and the large number
    of parameters that need to be trained, leading to categorical losses for a low
    number of epochs. However, above 70 epochs, the loss slowly decreases, presenting
    a minimum mean loss value of 0.7 at 80 epochs. Nevertheless, the pertained loss
    of high batch size strands is at least 100–120% more than their small batch size
    counterparts. This is not the case for the accuracy. As shown in Figure 7, for
    n = 480 and 80 epochs the accuracy of 91% has been achieved because of the adaptive
    learning rate is similar to the accuracy of small batch size strands. Table 9
    presents the number of hidden layers and trainable parameters for the different
    strands according to their input measurements batch sizes. Table 9. Fuzzy-stranded-NN
    model number of hidden layers and training parameters per input batch sizes. The
    same accuracy results close to 90.5% can also be achieved for n = 960 for more
    than 80 epochs up to 120 trainning epochs. For 80 epochs though, the n = 960 strand
    presents the least accuracy of 89.5%. Concluding, the maximum accuracy difference
    for all stranded networks at 80 epochs is more or less 1% from the mean model
    strands accuracy of 90.4%. This means that for 80 training epochs, all strands
    present almost similar accuracy results close to 90% with a window of improvement
    of 0.8–1.2% for training up to 120epochs. This is not the case for total loss,
    where the loss of lower strands is at least two times lower than that of bigger
    strands. This, of course, mainly affects the confidence values of the classification
    outputs and not the output class values. The following Section 3.2 presents the
    author’s model experimentation on the debina white grape variety. 3.2. Trained
    Model Experimentation In order to validate their model further, the authors performed
    the following experimentation in their viticulture field of reference for the
    years 2021–2023. The authors used their meteorological station measurements and
    their fuzzy-stranded-NN model to provide daily model classifications for their
    five-model output classes. Figure 9 shows their meteorological station rainfall
    measurements, and Figure 10 shows the vapor pressure deficit values for the years
    2021 to 2023. Figure 9. Viticulture field meteorological station 8 h rain measurements
    for years 2021–2023. Figure 10. Viticulture field meteorological station 8 h mean
    VPD measurements for years 2021–2023. For 2021, the authors performed five protective
    treatments starting from the 15th of May using Bordeaux mixture every 15 days
    until the 15th of July. The same methodology has been repeated for 2022, with
    the difference that the fifth fungicide intervention has been replaced with leaf
    removal close to the fruit, leaving it exposed to sunlight. Both of these precision
    viticulture cases have been characterized as normal cases that led to mean productivity
    results of 680 kg/1000 m2 for 2021 and 590 kg/1000 m2 for 2022. The productivity
    difference between the years 2021 and 2022 is mostly due to other infections,
    specifically white mildew and specifically for botrytis cinerea, that have been
    treated on a separate intervention at the beginning of August each year, while
    the white mildew disease has been treated along with downy mildew fungicide interventions
    starting from the 1st of July. The experimental vineyard is a 40-year-old debina
    vineyard, and during the experimentation, no irrigation or fertilization plans
    have been performed. The authors also confirm that their intervention planning
    managed to prevent and eliminate completely even early downy mildew appearances
    for years 2021 and 2022. For the year 2023, the authors performed no interventions,
    closely monitoring the progress of the disease, which started to appear with a
    minimum number of sporangia at the back of some leaves on the 1st of June. What
    followed was a catastrophic collapse. At least one oil spot/tree appeared until
    12/6, the first signs of the disease at the fruit appeared until 20/6, and until
    30/6, the whole fruit has been led to necrosis, with most of the leaves/tree having
    oil spots. The productivity results of the year 2023 were 0 kg/1000 m2, thus characterizing
    this experiment as a mildew outburst case. Furthermore, the year 2023 has been
    characterized as a year of mildew outbursts in the area of Zitsa, where most of
    the nearby farmers did not manage to save their crops. A few that did were forced
    to perform 7–8 interventions from May until the end of August to save 70–80% of
    their production, while farmers that performed 5–7 interventions managed to save
    30–50% of their production accordingly. Since most of the farmers in this viticulture
    area have in mind periodic planning of at most five interventions/year, usually
    applied after more than 5 mm/h of rainfall of more than 2 h, the fact that more
    than five interventions were needed for 2023 led to interventions misplanning
    and thus productivity losses. Since the installed thingsAI meteorological station
    offers per-minute measurements, the strand of batch size n = 960, which offers
    8 h interval predictions, has been used. Two main reasons led to the selection
    of this strand. First, it’s NN depth that makes it a deep learning representative
    concerning its similar accuracy results towards less deep strands, and second,
    its meteorological station measurements granularity. Table 10 summarizes the mean
    VPD and rainfall results for the years 2021 to 2023. Table 10. Average monthly
    rainfall and Vapor Pressure Deficit values for years 2021–2023. As shown in Table
    10, it is obvious that for 05/2023, there was an increase in monthly rainfall
    5 and 3 times more compared to 2021 and 2022. For 06/2023 and 06/2022, there was
    also an increase in monthly rainfall three times more than in 2021. The same pattern
    applies for the 8/2022 and 8/2023 concerning 2021. Significant variations in rainfall
    appear for July. However, due to the small mean values (≤0.3) and high mean VPD
    values (>1.5), they are considered similar for all years in terms of downy mildew
    incubation time. Regarding the mean VPD values between 2021 and 2023, the VPD
    differences are of value 0.36 for May, 0.61 for June, 0.2 for July, and 0.56 for
    August. These differences signify that monthly mean VPD reductions of more than
    0.3 kPa over the years, especially for May and June, can lead to faster downy
    mildew growth and, thus, more frequent interventions to ameliorate it. The authors
    experimented with the n = 960 strand of their model, which corresponds to a measurement
    time frame of 8 h ( 𝑑𝑇=0.33 day). The authors calibrated their model coefficients
    𝑘 𝑐 = 1 4 and 𝑘 𝑛 = 1 6 , derived from Equation (12), using the year 2021 as reference.
    Furthermore, they set a breakpoint for an imminent intervention 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 when the
    metric reaches the value of 12 infection cycle days. The following sections present
    the author’s intervention results over normal and mildew outbursts, as the model
    predicted. 3.3. Scenario I: Model Experimentation under Normal Conditions The
    authors model experimental results for 2021 and 2022, characterized as normal
    conditions cases, are illustrated in Figure 11. Figure 11. Viticulture field 𝑇
    𝐼𝑁𝑇 values for the years 2021 and 2022. As shown in Figure 11, the 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 infection
    cycle days are represented on the y-axis as a cumulative sum, calculated by Equation
    (12). Time of 8h intervals are shown on the x-axis, as denoted by the n = 960
    model strand, starting from the 1st of May until the end of August. When the cumulative
    sum of 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 infectious days reaches the value of 12 days, then an alert is
    triggered by the thingsAI system, indicating an intervention breakpoint, and the
    value of 𝑑 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 is set to zero for the cycle to repeat. Four intervention breakpoints
    have been triggered for 2021, while five breakpoints have been triggered for 2022.
    The first three breakpoints have been triggered almost at the same time intervals
    for both years, while there is a delayed offset of 10 days for the fourth breakpoint
    for 2021 with respect to 2022 and a fifth single breakpoint at 27/8 for 2022.
    From the farmer recorded interventions, only four interventions were required
    for the year 2021 instead of five performed and exactly five interventions for
    the year 2022 in order to disperse downy mildew infections. 3.4. Scenario II:
    Model Experimentation under Downy Mildew Outbursts The author’s model experimental
    result for the year 2023, characterized as a downy mildew outburst case compared
    to the normal case of 2022, is illustrated in Figure 12. Figure 12. Viticulture
    field 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 values for the years 2022 and 2023. The experimental results, illustrated
    in Figure 12 show an increase in the number of interventions required for 2023
    concerning 2022 from 5 to 7 interventions and also pinpoint significant intervention
    offsets from 2 up to 10 days. This increased frequency and offsetting made it
    hard for the farmers to cope with such environmental changes compared to their
    previous years’ practices, thus leading to significant productivity losses or
    collapses due to downy mildew infections. Additionally, the authors compared their
    model intervention outcomes for the year 2023 with the infection alerts provided
    by the Goidanich model, as adapted by [84]. The authors use a Goidanich index
    value of at least 100 to trigger an alert (resetting its value each time) and
    a cumulative rainfall RF > 10 mm for 72 h starting from the 1st of May for primary
    infections to occur. Figure 13 illustrates the fuzzy-stranded-NN n = 960 input
    batch size 𝑇 𝐼 𝑁𝑇 outputs compared to the Goidanich model alert results, using
    GI > 100, for imminent interventions during the 2023 mildew outburst in the Zitsa
    area. Figure 13. Viticulture field 𝑇 𝐼𝑁𝑇 values and GI values for the year 2023.
    The experimental results show that both the Goidanich and fuzzy-stranded-NN models
    detected the same number of seven seasonal interventions, as indicated by the
    number of triggered alerts issued by both models. Additionally, the fuzzy-stranded-NN
    model for May-July proposes earlier interventions with a mean offset of 5.3 days
    (from 1/5 until 6/8) concerning Goidanich alerts for interventions. This is indifferent
    for the rest of August, where the Goidanich model proposed one intervention 12
    days prior to the one proposed by the fuzzy-stranded-NN model. These offsets are
    probably because the GI index starts increasing from the 8th of May due to the
    72 h cumulative rainfall value > 10 mm threshold required for GI to start counting
    and the GI > 100 threshold value set. In conclusion, this validates the proposed
    model’s results compared to the most used model for alerts triggered by DSS systems.
    Nevertheless, further evaluation is required, set by the authors as future work.
    4. Conclusions This paper presents a new cloud-based Decision Support System architecture
    for the viticulture industry called thingsAI. It utilizes autonomous end-node
    devices called motes and meteorological stations to provide a dense plant-level
    measurement acquisition grid. Mote devices and meteorological stations use low-power,
    long-range LoRaWAN technology for their data transmissions. The thingsAI system
    includes a distributed Cassandra sensory data-collection entry-point and dockerized
    cloud-ready services hosting its deep learning models for classification and prediction
    inference tasks. Furthermore, the thingsAI system is equipped with the open-source
    ThingsBoard Application Server rule chains, alarms, and User Interfaces to deliver
    sensory measurement trends, suggestions, and decision results to the farmers.
    Focusing on the downy mildew disease in viticulture and an extensive literature
    study on the methods used for the detection of downy mildew, the authors denote
    that existing ones are either too simplified or complex enough. Simplified in
    using measurements such as rainfall due to the lack of dense measurement grids.
    Complex, such as the mechanistic models of hard algorithmic processes for DSS
    systems to implement, rely on many parameters of extensive experimental calibration.
    Specifically, the mechanistic models focus mainly on the deterministic representation
    of the downy mildew development with minimum accountability on different varieties,
    environmental conditions, and climate change. That is, if applied, they do not
    provide useful feedback information for the farmers to use. The authors implemented
    a deep learning model called fuzzy-stranded-NN to ameliorate the discrepancies
    between theory and application of the mechanistic models. The model utilizes an
    automated data annotation process based on semi-automated fuzzy rules. Using simplified
    lingual expressions, the farmer’s or agronomists’ experience can explicitly set
    these rules arbitrarily. The proposed model also utilizes several neural networks
    called strands, each of arbitrary layer depths based on the number of input measurements
    used, called input batches. This way, more precise predictions can be inferred
    based on the density of input measurements offering vine-level detections. Existing
    meteorological station grids may offer up to 15 min of sensory measurements and
    forecasts. The trained model strands can use these meteorological forecasts to
    provide 4–7 days of downy mildew forecasts and emerging and future interventions.
    The authors experimented with their downy mildew model implementation on the debina
    white grape variety in its protected designation of origin cultivation area of
    Zitsa, Epirus, Greece, under normal cases and downy mildew outbursts. From their
    experimental scenario, the author’s fuzzy-stranded-NN model proposition trained
    on downy mildew fuzzy annotated datasets successfully issues accurate intervention
    breakpoints as indicated by the farmers, providing detection accuracies above
    90% as indicated by model testing. The authors’ fuzzy-stranded-NN detection outputs
    have also been validated using the Goidanich model index under mildew outburst
    cases, where it successfully managed to provide the same number of monthly interventions
    as the Goidanich model. Limitations of the presented thingsAI system are the LoRaWAN
    coverage required for the motes data transmissions to the cloud. This limitation
    can be easily surpassed with the use of a sparse grid of LoRaWAN gateways due
    to the 5–12 km coverage radius per gateway offered by the LoRa narrow-band chirp
    modulation. Another limitation is the mote’s autonomous operation. Motes transmitting
    measurements every hour may lead to the depletion of their included battery packs
    every 3–4 months. Thus, farmers’ efforts are required to monitor, replace, and
    recharge the mote’s battery packs. Regarding the fuzzy-stranded-NN algorithm as
    a generic algorithm for events classification, there are limitations on both the
    fuzzy and strand parts of the model. Focusing on the fuzzy part, the definition
    of the most accurate membership functions that represent a measurement or metric
    or a phenomenon and the expression of the most representative fuzzy rules for
    the auto-annotation process is critical and must be performed cautiously. Nevertheless,
    simulation and trial-and-error experimentation can easily surpass errors in this
    fuzzy semi-supervised process. Regarding the model NN strands, more than an adequate
    number of measurements due to limited input sources may lead to poorly trained
    narrow model strands of low accuracy results. The authors set as future work the
    further experimentation of their proposed system and downy mildew model under
    different environments and vine varieties. The authors set future work to incorporate
    more models into their thingsAI system, focusing on deep learning irrigation planning
    models and other disease decision models specifically for botrytis cinerea and
    white mildew. The authors also set as future work the cross-comparison of their
    model proposition to existing mechanistic models for further improving their model
    toward the differentiation among primary and secondary downy mildew infection
    points, providing different valuable insights accordingly to the farmers. Author

    Introduction Farming has been vital to humans for millennia. Recent years have
    witnessed the implementation of numerous advanced technologies because of rapid
    population growth. The term “smart farming” refers to the application of cutting-edge
    communication and technology in the agricultural sector [1]. Modern-day smart
    farming drives worldwide demand. It involves using contemporary technology and
    sensors in agriculture. Agricultural land is typically monitored by sensors and
    managed by software. Using cutting-edge technology, yield of the agriculture land
    increases with less labor intervention. It also agricultural practices by minimizing
    the consumption of resources such as fertilizers and water. Using varied farming
    methods can make farming more environmentally friendly and create higher-quality
    products [2]. In smart farming, cloud computing helps farmers in numerous ways.
    Globally, there is a great deal of data pertaining to weather, crops, and soil

    Keywords Smart farming Precision agriculture Traditional farming Cloud computing
    Quality control Supply chain management 1 Traditional Farming: An Overview Traditional
    farming which is a practice that involves the intensive use of inherent knowledge,
    primitive tools, various natural resources, organic manures, and fertilizers and
    the cultural beliefs of farmers can be defined as primitive farming. Around 50%
    of the world’s population still uses it and it is shown in Fig. 1 [37]. Fig. 1
    Traditional farming Full size image 1.1 Key Characteristics of Traditional Farming
    1.1.1. Subsistence Farming: Traditional farming is mainly subsistence, where only
    sufficient quantities of food are produced by the farmer to feed his family and
    sell surpluses on the local market. The focus shall be on the cultivation of crops
    required for survival, like rice, wheat, and vegetables [7]. 1.1.2. Use of Natural
    Resources: The traditional farming method is based on the exploitation of natural
    resources, for example, soil, water, and seeds. To enrich the soil and increase
    the growth of crops, farmers use organic manures and compost. They are also using
    their animals’ strength to plow the land and for carrying goods. 1.1.3. Crop Rotation
    and Intercropping: A significant technique used in traditional farming is crop
    rotation and intercropping. Crop rotation allows for the sowing of various crops
    over some time in order to preserve soil fertility and avoid soil depletion. To
    achieve maximum productivity and minimize the risk of failure of crops, intercropping
    involves planting various crops in a single field. 1.1.4. Extensive farming with
    simple tools and crops: Extensive farming with simple tools and crops harkens
    back to a time when farming was more about the breadth of land than technological
    intensiveness. Instead of focusing on maximizing yield per unit of land, as in
    intensive farming, extensive farming relies on vast tracts of land and typically
    yields less produce per hectare. The reliance on basic tools—like the hand plow,
    scythe, and hoe—means that the relationship between the farmer and the land is
    direct and unmediated by complex machinery. Such a method, while less efficient
    in terms of yield, can be more sustainable since it often avoids the exhaustive
    use of chemicals and heavy machinery that can degrade soil health over time. 1.1.5.
    Usage of Simple and Traditional Means: Simple and traditional means of farming
    are a testament to time-honored agricultural practices that have sustained communities
    for centuries. Instead of relying on advanced machinery, chemical fertilizers,
    and genetically modified organisms, these methods harness the natural synergy
    between land, water, and seeds. Farmers using such techniques often employ hand
    tools like hoes, sickles, and wooden plows, following rhythms dictated by nature
    rather than industrial timetables. Crop rotation, composting, and natural pest
    management are cornerstones of this approach, ensuring that the land remains fertile
    and productive over generations. 1.1.6. Usage of Natural Seeds and Manure: In
    traditional farming, the use of natural seeds preserves the genetic diversity
    of crops, ensuring resilience against pests, diseases, and changing climate conditions.
    These seeds, often passed down through generations, are adapted to local soils
    and weather patterns, optimizing their growth potential. Complementing this, the
    application of organic manure not only enriches the soil with vital nutrients
    but also promotes its microbial health, leading to more robust and sustainable
    crop yields. 1.1.7. Sustainability and Resource Efficiency: Sustainability and
    resource efficiency are intrinsic to traditional farming methods, which have evolved
    over generations to work in harmony with local ecosystems. These practices often
    prioritize the health of the soil, water conservation, and biodiversity, ensuring
    the land remains fertile for future crops. By leveraging nature’s processes and
    cycles, traditional farming reduces waste and minimizes the need for external
    inputs, making it both environmentally and economically sustainable [9]. 1.2 Impact
    and Implications Soil organic matter is reduced by the primitive method of framing,
    and in a short period crops will take over the nutrient content of the soil. This
    is why farmers are forced to go somewhere else for farming. This results in the
    process of deforestation where the forest lands are converted to farms, ranches,
    or urban use. Jungle rainforests have the highest concentration of deforestation.
    The forests, which led to the situation of deforestation, had to be savagely cut
    and burned to allow for cultivation. Soil erosion is a process that is caused
    by natural physical forces of water and wind, as well as factors associated with
    agricultural activity such as plowing, to remove topsoil. Traditional farming,
    rooted in age-old practices, plays a pivotal role in preserving biodiversity by
    maintaining a diverse array of crops adapted to various environments. These methods,
    often devoid of synthetic chemicals, reduce environmental pollution, safeguarding
    both the land and water sources. Traditional farming can occasionally produce
    lower yields than modern agricultural techniques, which could present problems
    for feeding expanding populations. Finding a balance between traditional practices
    and contemporary needs is crucial because traditional farmers may experience economic
    constraints and competitiveness as the global economy grows more intertwined [8].
    2 The Transformation of Traditional Farming into Smart Farming Precision agriculture,
    which was first introduced in the early 1990s, marked the beginning of the evolution
    of smart farming. Precision agriculture is a method of farming where technical
    instruments are used to focus on specific farm areas that require attention, such
    as the moisture content of the soil or nutrient shortages. Utilizing data analysis
    tools, smart farming technology combines input optimization and waste reduction
    techniques to increase yields while lowering expenses [1]. In recent years, a
    diverse set of cutting-edge technologies have been gathered by the smart farming
    movement. When used in conjunction with a camera or sensor, a drone can provide
    invaluable information on the health of a crop and its potential yield. In order
    to make informed decisions about irrigation and fertilizer application, farmers
    can utilize soil sensors to measure soil moisture, temperature, and nutrient content
    [2]. Farmers everywhere may now make use of IoT-enabled sensors and tools to optimize
    their weather, irrigation, and fertilizer management. For data to facilitate well-informed
    choices, it must be consolidated in one place [3, 4]. 2.1 Traditional Farming
    The old farming method is one of the ancient ways of agriculture which has existed
    for hundreds of years. To grow crops and raise livestock, it is necessary to use
    indigenous methods of cultivation. The sun, rain, and soil are mainly relied upon
    by farmers in order to guarantee crop health and productivity. They cultivate
    and harvest their crops in traditional methods, giving plants and animals what
    they need to survive. Traditional farming is still an effective means of food
    production even though it may be technologically less advanced than smart farming.
    Farmers have an excellent understanding of the land and vegetation that may grow
    on it, so they are able to take care of their cattle as well as deal with pests,
    insects, or diseases. This experience will typically be passed down to younger
    generations, enabling them to adapt to changing conditions and develop their methods
    over time [12]. 2.2 Smart Farming Smart farming aims at using modern technologies,
    in order to increase the effectiveness and productivity of agriculture. Everything
    from using sensors and drones for crop monitoring to the use of artificial intelligence
    that can predict weather conditions or optimize irrigation schedules could be
    included. Smart farming can help to increase farmers’ yields and reduce their
    use of resources over time, which may lead to improvements in agricultural sustainability.
    Nevertheless, some opponents argue that intelligence farming can help to consolidate
    and exacerbate existing problems such as water scarcity [6, 10]. 3 Introduction
    to Smart Farming: An Overview Smart farming aims to enhance the quality and quantity
    of products so that they are useful for humans by using advanced technology, information,
    and communication in agriculture. The transformation from traditional farming
    to smart farming involves the following key components (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Smart
    farming Full size image 3.1 Sensing Technologies An agricultural sensor is one
    of the sensors applied in smart farming. The sensors provide information that
    will help farmers to monitor and optimize the crops in response to changing environmental
    conditions. Electrochemical sensors facilitate the collection, processing, and
    mapping of soil’s chemical data. Usually, it’s fitted onto specially designed
    sleds. They provide the relevant details needed for agricultural purposes including
    the level of nutrients in the soil and pH values [11]. 3.2 Software Tools and
    Applications With the use of agriculture software applications specifically tailored
    to meet agricultural needs and challenges, farmers will be able to enhance their
    efficiency and control over all aspects of their operations. The aim is to speed
    up the process of making important managerial decisions through these agricultural
    software tools. But farming applications are much more than a means of saving
    time; they also help farmers to make informed and predictive decisions. By referring
    to the past crop rotation data, obtained from satellite images combined with technical
    recommendations for growing specific types of crops, software programs and mobile
    applications can recommend the most profitable planting plan (Fig. 3) [38]. Fig.
    3 Web applications for smart farming Full size image 3.3 Communication Systems
    Old farming practices and poor resource management are frequent problems, for
    example, lack of appropriate storage facilities, excessive pesticide usage, or
    overirrigation. The asymmetry of information can be directly addressed by appropriate
    communication channels and tools for farmers. There are a lot of current protocols
    that can be used, such as Wi-Fi 802.11n, LoRaWAN, WiMAX Ethernet, LRWPAN, BLE
    Bluetooth Low Energy RFID, MQTT, Zigbee, Sigfox, etc. [13]. 3.4 Telematics and
    Positioning Technologies To achieve minimum effort and optimum results, farmers
    need to select the best means of tracking and managing their machines. Telematics
    solutions that monitor the location, speed, and maintenance of these vehicles
    can be used in order to reduce downtime and increase their efficiency through
    smart farming. With telematics data, farmers can monitor the performance and usage
    information, make better-informed decisions for daily usage such as seed and fertilizer
    distribution and long-term usage such as predictive maintenance, and maximize
    their equipment’s ROI [14]. 3.5 Hardware and Software Systems Smart farming involves
    the usage of various sensors for soil monitoring, water, light, humidity, and
    temperature. Technologies in telecommunications such as advanced network technologies
    and GPS are involved. Various hardware and software for specific applications,
    enabling the use of IIoT solutions, robotics, and automation are used. Numerous
    agricultural management software solutions such as Farmbrite, Agrivi, Farmlogs,
    Granular, Conservis, Agworld, Croptracker, Trimble, Agriculture, Farmlogic, Harvest
    Profit, etc. are available for modern agriculture. Each of them has its own specific
    functions. 3.6 Data Analytics Solutions Analytics along with the Internet of Things
    represent a number of use cases in agriculture and are, for example, remote monitoring
    of agricultural machinery and its performance, analytics for the monitoring of
    farm operations and to improve their efficiency, and predictive analytics for
    accurate weather forecast. Digital soil and crop mapping can be carried out using
    data science. Farmers and agronomists may use this information to optimize the
    use of their land, thereby gaining better understanding of what crops are needed.
    Moreover, the forecasting of weather patterns and crop yields can also be based
    on data science. 3.7 Human-Machine Association A variety of tasks, such as planting,
    irrigation, pest control, and soil analysis, can be performed by introducing various
    flexible machines. The benefits of higher productivity, lower labor charges, and
    a reduction in the usage of harmful chemicals are available to farmers when these
    processes are automated. The majority of the agricultural work in today’s farm
    is done by tractors and machines that till the ground, plant seeds, and perform
    other tasks. Tillage harvesting equipment loosens the soil, kills weeds or competing
    plants, and prepares the area for planting. 3.8 Sustainability and Resource Efficiency
    Smart farming emphasizes resource efficiency and sustainability. Resource efficiency
    is measured in terms of how effectively resources such as land, energy, rainwater,
    underground water, and labor are used in agricultural production. It is a topic
    of great importance in sustainable agriculture because it can help mitigate negative
    environmental effects on agricultural production while maximizing productivity
    and profitability. The transformation from traditional farming to smart farming
    represents a leap forward in the agricultural sector. It involves the integration
    of various sensors, software programs and applications, communication systems,
    data analytics, and positioning technologies to create a highly responsive, efficient,
    and productive agricultural environment. This evolution not only enhances productivity
    but also shapes agricultural sectors’ ability to meet dynamic market demands while
    promoting sustainability and human-machine collaboration. 4 Cloud Computing: Understanding
    Its Fundamental Concepts Cloud indicates a network or the Internet. This mentions
    a technology used to store, receive, and access data from a network instead of
    local disk drives by using distant servers on the Internet. All sorts of data
    such as files, pictures, documents, audio, and video can be included. To understand
    more about cloud computing, let us explore its fundamental concepts. 4.1 Cloud
    Computing Architecture: Key Components Cloud computing is an on-demand service
    that you can use via the Internet to manage and run your applications. In cloud
    computing, the “cloud” denotes only a network or servers that are used by your
    web applications, databases, and so on. Compute, storage, database, networking,
    and security are some of the fundamental key components of cloud computing [15].
    Let’s delve into the key components and types of cloud computing architecture.
    4.1.1 Compute The processing capacity required by the system and application to
    handle the data and perform a variety of calculations may be considered as compute.
    This computing power required for the server can be obtained from a cluster of
    virtual machines on the cloud instead of having it installed in an existing local
    data center. A virtual machine’s computing capability depends only on the hardware
    resources allocated to its host computer. The CPU, storage, memory, and network
    bandwidth of the machine in which the VM is running are referred to as compute
    resources. Today, most cloud service providers have done a fine job of preparing
    an extensive set of pre-configured servers that can be used for all kinds of tasks.
    4.1.2 Storage The main advantage of storing data in a cloud environment is that
    it allows the user to increase their storage capacity without having to maintain
    or buy additional local hard drives. If a disk failure occurs, it will be hard
    to prevent data corruption. Data can be stored on a physical storage server which
    is hosted by the cloud service provider for an indefinite period in the cloud
    environment through logical pools. The user can store various types of data, e.g.,
    pictures, files, and backups. 4.1.3 Databases A database is a system for the storage
    and management of structured and unorganized information. Cloud service providers
    typically manage and offer cloud databases as a service. This means that the user
    no longer has any responsibility for maintaining or updating the components of
    a database instance, such as updates to operating systems and software patches.
    In actuality, scalability and availability of cloud databases are also very high.
    4.1.4 Networking The cloud is a vast network of computers that interact, share,
    and integrate to offer specific services to its clients. Cloud service providers
    guarantee that their infrastructures can constantly maintain a quick network connection
    in order to meet the expectations of their end users. The user’s application may
    be disseminated globally thanks to the cloud’s ability to provide a worldwide
    link. 4.1.5 Security The cloud’s remote, secure data centers are where data is
    kept. This indicates that hazards to users like theft and data breaches are rare.
    When using a cloud service, the user’s obligation is more heavily centered on
    data management. Users will be able to gain access to a set of tools in the cloud
    environment that allow them to achieve higher security levels. With regard to
    encryption and decryption of data, users are responsible for themselves. To access
    the applications, the users have the option to authenticate or authorize selected
    users and services. 4.2 Characteristics of Cloud Computing Cloud computing offers
    a wide range of characteristics that might be beneficial to customers, along with
    those specified by the National Institute of Standards Technology (NIST) [16].
    Let us have a brief discussion on them: 4.2.1 On-Demand Self Service Computer
    services like server time and network storage can be automatically provisioned
    with cloud computing. There will be no need for interaction with the cloud service
    provider. To view the cloud services and monitor their usage, provisioning and
    de-provisioning the services, the customers using the cloud can access their cloud
    accounts through a web self-service portal. No human administrators are required
    to access the cloud computing services. 4.2.2 Broad Network Access Broad access
    to the Internet is another essential feature associated with cloud computing.
    Cloud services are made available to the user over the network on various portable
    devices, such as smartphones, tablets, notebooks, or desktop computers. Internet
    is used for public clouds; local area networks are used for private clouds. In
    cloud computing and wide network connectivity, both latency and bandwidth are
    crucial factors affecting the quality of service. 4.2.3 Resource Pooling Multiple
    customers using the multitenant model can share physical resources with one another
    through resource pooling. These models assign and reassign physical and virtual
    resources to multiple users on the basis of demand. Multitenancy supports the
    sharing of application and infrastructure between customers while maintaining
    privacy and security. Although the customer may not have been able to determine
    exactly where their resources are located, he or she is free to specify a location
    at a higher level of abstraction such as country, state, and data center. Some
    of the resources that customers can pool are memory, processing, and bandwidth.
    4.2.4 Rapid Elasticity In order for customers to scale quickly based on demand,
    cloud services may be flexibly configured and released, sometimes automatically.
    There are virtually unlimited capabilities available for provisioning. These capacities
    can be used by customers in any quantity at any time. Without additional fees
    or charges, customers also have the option of scaling up their cloud use, capacity,
    and costs. With rapid elasticity, the user need not buy computer hardware. Rather,
    the cloud service provider’s computing resources can be used. 4.2.5 Measured Service
    A metering capability that is appropriate for the type of service will optimize
    resource utilization at an abstraction level in cloud systems. For example, a
    measured service may be used for monitoring the storage used, processing capacity
    utilized, bandwidth consumed, and users utilizing them. The payment shall be made
    on the basis of the actual consumption of the customer by means of a payment for
    what, what you use, model. For both consumers and the service providers, a transparent
    experience will be achieved with monitoring, control, and report on use of resources.
    4.2.6 Resiliency and Availability Cloud computing resilience refers to the fact
    that, in case of an error, a service can be quickly repaired. The speed of its
    servers, databases, and networks to get back up and running after a disruption
    is an indication of cloud resilience. A copy of stored data shall be created by
    cloud services in order to avoid loss of data. Copy version from the other server
    shall be restored when one server loses data for any reason. In cloud computing,
    availability is an adherent concept. Cloud services offer the advantage of being
    able to view them remotely, which means that you do not have restrictions on geographical
    location when using their resources. 4.2.7 Flexibility As their businesses grow,
    companies will have to expand. The cloud service provides clients with more flexibility
    of movement, and they don’t have to restart the server anymore. In order to avoid
    overspending on the resources they do not need, they can also choose from a range
    of payment options. 4.2.8 Remote Work Users benefit from cloud computing by being
    able to work in a remote location. Remote workers can safely and rapidly obtain
    corporate data through the use of their equipment, e.g., laptops or mobile phones.
    Remote workers can also communicate with each other and use the cloud effectively
    to carry out their tasks. 4.3 Cloud-Based Services Cloud computing refers to the
    practice of storing, managing, and processing data rather than local or personal
    computers on an international network of remote servers that are maintained in
    a web site. Cloud providers are companies that offer these types of computing
    services and typically provide them for free or at a price determined by usage.
    The foundations of cloud computing are grids and clusters. Five broad categories
    account for the majority of cloud computing services (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Cloud-based
    services Full size image 4.3.1 Software as a Service (SaaS) An Internet-based
    method of offering services and applications is software as a service. Users are
    only given access to the Internet so they can avoid having to install or update
    software or deal with other laborious hardware and software administration tasks.
    Users can deploy and run programs on their computer or data center with its assistance,
    saving money on hardware expenditures and software upkeep. SaaS originates from
    the cloud services provider, which offers users entire software solutions for
    pay-as-you-go purchases. As long as they don’t need to be downloaded or installed,
    the majority of Internet browsers can be used to access software as a service
    applications. The application as a service might be referred to as web-based software,
    on-demand software, or hosting software [17]. 4.3.2 Platform as a Service (PaaS)
    Platform as a service is the area of cloud computing that offers a setting for
    programmers to create Internet-based apps and services. Users can access the PaaS
    service by using just a web browser because it is located in the cloud. The PaaS
    provider’s own infrastructure must host all hardware and software. As a result,
    PaaS enables customers to avoid installing their own proprietary hardware or software
    for the creation and management of a new application. Consumers are in charge
    of deploying and configuring apps in an application hosting environment but not
    the cloud infrastructure itself, including the network, servers, operating system,
    and storage environment [18]. 4.3.3 Information as a Service (IaaS) Services for
    infrastructure IaaS refers to the method by which IT services are outsourced to
    support various processes. The term “infrastructure as a service,” or “IaaS,”
    refers to a service that enables the outsourcing of infrastructure, including
    web servers, various devices, networking hardware, and other items. Hardware as
    a service (HaaS) is another name for IaaS. IaaS users are charged according on
    the number of users, typically by the hour, week, or month. Customers may also
    be charged based on how much virtual machine space they utilize by some providers.
    IaaS only offers the underlying operating systems, security, networking, and servers
    needed to construct applications and services and to deploy development tools,
    databases, etc. [19]. 4.3.4 Anything as a Service (XaaS) “Anything as a service”
    (XaaS) also known as “everything as a service” denotes a general category of services
    related to both cloud computing and remote access. It also recognizes the enormous
    number of products, tools, and technologies now being delivered as a service to
    users via the Internet. Essentially, it is possible to turn any IT function into
    a service for enterprise consumption. Instead of paying for the service through
    an upfront purchase or license, it is made available as a discretionary consumption
    model. XaaS can also be called everything as a service. Today, the majority of
    cloud service providers are offering anything that can be classified as a service
    by combining all these different services together and providing some other services
    [20]. 4.3.5 Function as a Service (FaaS) Function as a service (FaaS), is a cloud-computing
    service that enables the customers to execute code as a response to events, without
    having the need for managing the complex infrastructure associated with building
    and launching the related microservice applications. When hosting software applications
    on the Internet, it is normally necessary to provide and run a virtual or physically
    based server, as well as operating system and web server services. With FaaS,
    a cloud service provider provides full automatic management of physical equipment,
    virtual operating system, and web server software. This ensures that the developers
    are focused exclusively on specific functions in their application code [21].
    5 Integration of Cloud Computing in Smart Farming The integration of cloud computing
    in smart farming leads to a transformative approach to optimizing production processes,
    enhancing quality control, and enabling predictive maintenance. Cloud computing
    techniques play a vital role in analyzing large volumes of data generated by interconnected
    sensors, devices, and machines in a smart farming environment. By extracting valuable
    insights from the reference data obtained from the cloud, other smart farming
    facilitates real-time decision-making, production optimization, and adaptive farming
    can be carried out [22,23,24]. Here’s a broad overview of how cloud computing
    can be integrated into smart farming. 5.1 Data Management A number of sensors
    are being used in smart farming using the Internet of Things (IoT) to monitor
    environmental conditions. The sensor’s primary task is to gather data across the
    field and send it into the cloud. A number of basic measurements are set up in
    the cloud, and these will be compared to sensed data [5]. 5.2 Data Collection
    and Retrieval Data collection and retrieval are the most common uses of cloud-based
    software in agriculture. In order to provide accurate and rapid information, it
    stores a large amount of data on weather, crop patterns, soil quality, harvesting,
    and satellite imagery. The cloud stores all the data relating to the farm, making
    it easy to access. In this way, the data can be used more rapidly to identify
    a remedy in order to avoid large losses when crops are afflicted with symptoms
    similar to those seen 10 years earlier. 5.3 Data Processing and Analysis Database
    management in the cloud environment allows decision-makers to make precise decisions
    and connects all data sources that are available for farms such as weather data,
    market data, agricultural data, GIS, and water availability. Weather data agricultural
    data, geographic information system, and water availability, all forms of old
    and existing data and current information must be analyzed in detail before valuable
    information is made available on optimal requirements to plant seeds, water, or
    pesticides. Whenever there is a discrepancy in the growth of crops, these systems
    have an alert system to communicate with the farmers. Therefore, in the event
    of a pest attack, these systems work effectively to inform farmers of relevant
    information. 5.4 Data Storage and Dissemination Data storage is the core of predictive
    analysis. Storage of data has always been a hardware-based system; thus, the infrastructure
    requires constant monitoring and updates. The data was permanently lost if the
    hardware had been damaged. Today, agricultural technology has evolved to cloud-based
    systems that mean there is no need for investment in hardware purchases or maintenance.
    All information is available 24 hours a day and can be accessed from your computer
    or mobile device. Other devices and solutions can also benefit from this approach
    of data storage for further analysis. With more data on farms available, it’s
    easier for farmers to gain an accurate picture of agriculture output and management,
    the detection of pests and diseases, as well as yield estimates. 5.5 Real-Time
    Data Analysis The deployment of scalable cloud computing with powerful analytic
    tools to identify patterns in data and obtain new information is called cloud
    analytics. Businesses increasingly rely on data analysis to achieve competitive
    advantage, advance scientific knowledge, or improve human life in a variety of
    ways. With cloud-based analytics tools, data collected from various sensors can
    be processed and analyzed in real time. This offers farmers immediate insights
    into soil health, weather conditions, and crop status, facilitating timely interventions
    and decision-making. 5.6 Remote Monitoring and Control Through cloud integration,
    farmers can remotely monitor and control various farming operations via smartphones,
    tablets, or computers. This involves using cloud-based software to modify irrigation,
    track equipment, and even deploy drones. 5.7 Enhanced Decision Support Systems
    When machine learning and artificial intelligence are linked into cloud platforms,
    a powerful decision-support system for farmers can be created. These systems can
    forecast agricultural yields, evaluate disease risks, and optimize irrigation
    schedules thanks to the power of cloud computing. 5.8 Continuous Improvement The
    ability of cloud computing to continuously learn and adapt is one of the key advantages
    of smart farming. Models can be updated with fresh data, allowing them to develop
    over time as they take into account differences in production processes and real-world
    experiences. 5.9 Cost Efficiency Farms can save the expenses of maintaining and
    upgrading their on-site IT infrastructure by implementing cloud computing. Additionally,
    cloud service models often operate on a pay-as-you-go basis, which means farms
    only pay for the computing resources they actually use. The integration of cloud
    computing into smart farming offers immense potential to transform the way products
    are produced, quality is ensured, and resources are managed. By harnessing the
    power of the cloud and AI, farmers can achieve higher efficiency, improved product
    quality, reduced costs, and enhanced sustainability, thereby shaping the future
    of the agricultural industry. 6 Implementation of Cloud Computing in Various Stages

    and retailers, ensuring synchronized operations. In essence, cloud computing in
    smart farming transforms the agricultural supply chain from a traditionally fragmented
    and reactive system into a cohesive, transparent, and agile entity, leading to
    reduced costs, minimized wastage, and maximized value delivery to the end consumer.
    Overall, cloud computing plays a crucial role in driving innovation and efficiency
    across various aspects of smart farming, helping farmers adapt to the rapidly
    changing technological landscape and stay competitive in the global market. 9
    Challenges in Integrating Cloud Computing with Smart Farming Integrating cloud
    computing with smart farming presents several challenges that need to be addressed
    to ensure successful implementation and maximize the benefits of both technologies
    [28]. Here are some of the key challenges: Infrastructure Deficiency: Many rural
    areas lack the necessary infrastructure, such as high-speed Internet and data
    centers, to fully harness cloud computing capabilities. High Initial Costs: Setting
    up sensors, and IoT devices, and integrating them with cloud platforms require
    a significant initial investment. Digital Literacy: Farmers, especially in developing
    nations, might not be well-versed in advanced technologies, making adoption challenging.
    Data Security Concerns: Storing sensitive agricultural data on the cloud raises
    concerns about potential breaches and misuse. Reliability Issues: Internet connectivity,
    especially in remote farming areas, can be intermittent, affecting real-time data
    access and decision-making. Integration Hurdles: Integrating various existing
    farming technologies with new cloud-based platforms can be complex. Regulatory
    Challenges: In many countries, regulations related to data storage, transfer,
    and cloud computing are still evolving, posing legal challenges. Data Overload:
    While cloud computing can handle vast amounts of data, farmers might get overwhelmed
    by the sheer volume of information and struggle to make sense of it. Cultural
    Resistance: Traditional farmers might resist transitioning to tech-based practices
    due to deep-rooted beliefs or fear of the unknown. Vendor Lock-In: Committing
    to one cloud service provider might hinder flexibility and make it challenging
    to switch or integrate other services in the future. Scalability Issues: As farms
    grow and diversify, ensuring that cloud solutions scale efficiently can become
    a challenge. Limited Customization: Off-the-shelf cloud solutions might not cater
    to the unique requirements of every farm, necessitating customization which can
    be costly and time-consuming. Maintenance and Upgrades: Regular system maintenance
    and software upgrades might require technical expertise which not all farmers
    possess. Privacy Concerns: Sharing data about crop yields, farming techniques,
    and other proprietary information on the cloud might raise concerns about intellectual
    property rights. Environmental Concerns: The energy consumption of vast data centers
    powering cloud services has environmental implications, which could be a point
    of contention for eco-conscious farmers. Overcoming these challenges requires
    a collaborative effort among cloud architects, domain experts, farmers, and cloud
    service providers. Successful integration of cloud computing with smart farming
    involves careful planning, continuous monitoring, and adaptation to ensure that
    the technology delivers the desired benefits while mitigating potential risks.
    10 Conclusion In conclusion, cloud computing emerges as a transformative force
    in the realm of smart farming, acting as the digital backbone that supports a
    new age of agricultural efficiency and innovation. Its capability to store, process,
    and provide real-time data analytics brings unparalleled advantages to farmers,
    from optimizing resource use to predicting market trends. While challenges do
    exist in its integration, the overarching benefits, such as increased yields,
    reduction in wastage, and supply chain optimization, position cloud computing
    as an indispensable tool for the future of farming. As the world grapples with
    increasing food demand and climate uncertainties, leveraging the cloud’s prowess
    in smart farming becomes not just an opportunity but a necessity for sustainable
    agricultural growth. References J.C.K. Wells, J.T. Stock, Life history transitions

    Farming and agriculture have always been an alternative to man to meet his needs
    and expenses. In many cases, it has been the only source of livelihood. This trend
    began thousands of years ago and has evolved in such a way that it even helped
    in maintaining a balance in the economic affairs of many nations. Today, the agricultural
    sector serves as the backbone of many countries. It plays a major role in the
    social, cultural, and economic aspects of a nation [1]. The whole food industry
    of the world is based on the agricultural sector, and it provides employment to
    many people. Along with these advantages, there are also a few disadvantages of
    the expanding agricultural sector which cannot be neglected [2]. To meet the needs
    of a huge population within a short span of time, the experts are expanding the
    agricultural sector in an unhealthy manner. To increase the yield and productivity,
    a high number of fertilizers and pesticides are used which are harmful to the
    ecosystem [3]. This affects the surrounding flora and fauna resulting in their
    extinction. The clearing of forests and grasslands to transform them into agricultural
    lands are also affecting the climatic conditions of the concerned region. Another
    demerit is the overexploitation of natural resources such as land and soil [4].
    As the farmland increases in size, a large amount of fresh water is utilized for
    irrigation purposes. This also affects the amount of groundwater resources and
    causes scarcity if continued for a longer time. As a result, studies and research
    were done to tackle these issues and find an alternative to conserve our environment
    without affecting the quality and quantity of crop production. Agriculture has
    undergone many stages of development based on the circumstantial necessities of
    man and has benefited in numerous ways. This advancement in the field of farming
    and agriculture was not a sudden breakthrough but the result of long-term research
    and experiments involving various technological aspects. Through the innovations
    at each stage, they took conventional farming that involved manual labor, time,
    and energy to another level where each of these was replaced by technology which
    in turn saved time and resources, improved yield production, and made all other
    jobs easier. This way, ordinary farming was upgraded using various smart ideas
    which resulted in smart farming. The introduction of technology in the farming
    sector was a breakthrough and provided solution to all the problems [5]. Within
    a short span of time, Artificial Intelligence-based systems overtook the traditional
    farming methods. These systems were controlled by robots and wireless networks
    which provided high-quality yield with less impact on the environment. Hence,
    farming techniques were modified by integrating the advanced technologies with
    the conventional methods to be known as smart farming. In other words, it is the
    process of incorporating modern technology-based software and systems such as
    drones, sensors, etc. to extract information and data to improve the quality and
    quantity of agricultural products. A similar revolution, precision agriculture
    made smart farming more realistic. While smart farming concentrated on the wider
    aspects of the agricultural sector, precision agriculture did wonders in the core
    area [6]. To be precise, it is all about measurements and observations of individual
    crops and acting based on the data collected by smart farming devices. Precision
    livestock farming is another area of precision agriculture that manages and monitors
    the welfare of farm animals using technology. Devices such as wireless networks,
    cameras, drones, computers, etc. are used for this purpose, and they monitor the
    various factors that affect the farm animals. Some of the main benefits of precision
    livestock farming are improved animal health and growth, high milk production,
    and early detection of diseases. Like smart farming, precision agriculture and
    farming are also widely adapted as it is a multidisciplinary approach that involves
    collaborations with veterinarians, scientists, engineers, climatologists, etc.
    These both are closely associated processes, and together they provide us with
    high-quality yield production. 2 The Evolution of Farming: From Conventional to
    Smart The history of farming and cultivating crops for food production began centuries
    ago. It was a significant phase in the evolution of mankind. This type of farming
    is labor-intensive and requires more effort and dedication from the farmers. Various
    external factors such as climate, soil condition, temperature, etc. also influenced
    the traditional agriculture domain significantly. Any type of variations in these
    factors affected agriculture as a whole, and visible changes were seen in the
    yield production. This type of farming never guarantees a profitable income. As
    time went by, the human population began increasing in an uncontrollable manner
    which resulted in an inflated need for food, land, water, other natural resources,
    etc. People started clearing more and more land for cultivation as there came
    a drastic demand for food. This affected nature more severely. Deforestation for
    crop cultivation and housing resulted in soil erosion, landslides, and many other
    disasters. It is one of the major reasons behind the extinction of many varieties
    of plants and animals. Another reason is the increased use of fertilizers and
    pesticides which are harmful to farm-friendly microbes and animals. They are also
    responsible for the disintegration of the soil quality. These harmful chemical
    substances enter the water bodies through running water and deplete the water
    quality. This causes a threat to the living organisms in the oceans and other
    water bodies. As the farmlands are expanding day by day, the demand for freshwater
    resources is also increasing. The process of irrigation requires a lot of water,
    and the primary source is groundwater. This groundwater reliance has reached an
    extent where the study reports show overused and mismanaged groundwater resources
    in many parts of the world. The establishment of industries and urbanization is
    also a reason behind the deterioration of land and other natural resources. Climatic
    changes and their causes on the environment are other aftereffects of traditional
    farming. Recent studies have shown that agriculture contributes largely to the
    increased presence of many harmful pollutants such as methane in the atmosphere.
    Methane is a greenhouse gas, and the excess amount of it can cause a greenhouse
    effect which results in damages such as ozone layer depletion. This increases
    the temperature which causes a rise in the sea level. Damage to the ozone layer
    will allow the harmful ultraviolet rays to reach the Earth’s surface which when
    come in direct contact with the skin results in major skin diseases such as sunburns,
    cancer, etc. In this way, conventional farming was creating many problems for
    humankind and its surroundings [7]. As a result, man was forced to find an alternative
    to these challenges which gave way to the establishment of smart farming. This
    farming method utilizes technologies to improve crop production as well as the
    environment. Technology took the agriculture domain to a higher level where it
    not only made the often-tedious tasks easier but also provided many solutions
    to various complications of conventional farming. Smart farming and precision
    agriculture are two such technology-driven farming concepts that focus on managing
    and preparing the agricultural industry with frameworks to include advanced technologies
    such as big data, the Internet of Things, and machine learning for tracking, monitoring,
    analyzing, automating, and executing operations. 3 Intelligent Computing and AI:
    The Brain Behind Smart Farming Intelligent computing is an integration of advanced
    computing technologies and various other fields such as Artificial Intelligence
    (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and deep learning
    (DL) to mimic human abilities such as learning, decision-making, reasoning, and
    problem-solving. These systems have the ability to analyze and process large volumes
    of data to make decisions and thus improve their performance over time based on
    the experiences and interactions. The introduction of these technologies to the
    agricultural sector brought many high-level transformations and advances to farming
    and cultivation [8]. Artificial Intelligence has been a trending topic in computer
    science for many years. It is a generally used term to describe a computer that
    uses intelligence to perform a particular task. In other words, it is the ability
    of a machine to learn from previous experiences to solve a particular problem.
    This form of learning from experiences and replicating human intelligence is accomplished
    through various algorithms which are defined specifically for this purpose [9].
    As time passed by, many advances happened in this branch of science and resulted
    in the development of subsections known as machine learning (ML) and deep learning
    (DL). Machine learning technologies are one of the widely used mechanizations
    in recent advances. It is a subset of Artificial Intelligence where the machines
    are trained instead of explicitly programmed, to behave in the same way as that
    of the human brain. Machine learning is a revolution as it doesn’t have to program
    each application just like that of the traditional computing technologies. Instead,
    data which are commonly in the form of images, text files, etc. are collected
    and used in training the system. Such trained systems can produce good results
    when tested with data that is similar to that of the trained ones. Some examples
    of machine learning that we experience in the farming sector are the detection
    of diseases and pests on the crops [10]. The machine learning algorithms are categorized
    into three types of learning. They are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
    learning. Regression and classification algorithms come under the category of
    supervised learning where at each stage the model is taught to perform the actions
    using labels and features acquired from the data [11]. There won’t be any associated
    labels to the features that are collected from the data in the case of unsupervised
    learning. Here, the goal is achieved only based on the features and patterns [12].
    Clustering and association rules are the common types of unsupervised learning.
    Based on the similarity among the patterns, the data will be categorized accordingly.
    However, decision-making is the main element in reinforcement learning [13]. This
    is nothing but the act of training the system to behave optimally in a particular
    environment so that it can provide an accurate result. Even if there are many
    challenges while adopting machine learning techniques, their usages and numerous
    benefits to the mankind make them powerful. This gave way to other sectors and
    industries such as health, farming, automobile, finances, etc. to rely on machine
    learning technologies for further advances. Deep learning is another subfield
    of Artificial Intelligence that uses the neural networks to analyze and process
    data which is similar to the working of a human brain. It is said to be more advanced
    and powerful than the machine learning as it uses a large volume of dataset to
    perform the sophisticated tasks. In agriculture, DL is used for tasks like identifying
    diseases in crops by analyzing images of leaves. It can automatically detect visual
    signs of diseases, enabling timely interventions [14]. The unimaginable growth
    of all these industries in recent years is a clear evidence to depict the effectiveness
    of advanced technologies. The contributions of each sector have boosted us socially
    and economically [15]. Smart farming, driven by the integration of Artificial
    Intelligence (AI) technologies, is revolutionizing traditional agricultural practices.
    The cutting-edge potential of AI can be seen in a variety of applications, from
    crop health prediction to real-time data analysis for decision-making [16]. These
    developments have the ability to transform farming methods and significantly boost
    production. Real-time data analysis is one of AI’s most important contributions
    to smart farming. Agricultural landscapes are surrounded by sensors and IoT devices,
    which create an uninterrupted stream of data. AI algorithms are excellent at analyzing
    these data, obtaining useful insights, and presenting them in a way that is easy
    to understand for informed decision-making [17]. Farmers can receive instantaneous
    information regarding pest activity, temperature changes, and soil moisture levels,
    enabling timely interventions that maximize resource use and crop yield. Additionally,
    the predictive power of AI offers a significant advancement in the way farmers
    monitor crop health [18]. By the use of highly sophisticated machine learning
    algorithms, AI has the ability to foresee the probable disease breakouts by analyzing
    the historical data along with the real-time data. This helps the farmers to take
    active measures to find remedies and protect their crops from the diseases at
    the earliest. Also, it promotes environmentally friendly practices by minimizing
    the need for excessive pesticide or fertilizer application. The power of AI goes
    beyond an individual farm and includes an interconnected agricultural environment.
    It can provide thorough knowledge which has the power to guide the entire supply
    chain by combining data from multiple sources such as satellites, market trends,
    weather forecasts, etc. These data-driven strategies help the farmers to make
    decisions on what and when to plant and harvest the crops which enhance efficiency,
    cut waste, and improve the profitability of the entire agricultural sector [19].
    However, integration of AI in smart farming has its own challenges and drawbacks.
    Some of these are listed below: Accessibility and quality of data: These systems
    require high-quality data to perform accurately. But a major challenge faced while
    integrating AI in smart farming is the unavailability and inconsistency of the
    datasets. Therefore, ensuring the quality and availability of data has to be taken
    significantly. Privacy and security of data: Safeguarding famers’ details and
    crop information is of utmost importance as these are sensitive and valuable data.
    It is important to provide data privacy and security to the farmers while using
    technology-induced farming methods. Initial investments and cost: Implementation
    of AI-based equipment is costly and requires expertise to do the installations.
    The small-scale farmers and the ones that are new to the field may find it difficult
    to meet such needs. Therefore, proper funding and guidance from the authorities
    have to be sanctioned and taken care of. These commonly faced challenges have
    to be addressed and rectified as the farmers’ proficiency in technology can vary
    depending on various factors. Other than this, there are other challenges such
    as unpredictable environmental factors, ethical concerns, etc. which also can
    occur while adapting to AI-based smart farming. 4 Cultivating Insights: ML and
    DL in Precision Agriculture Machine learning and deep learning techniques have
    demonstrated their prowess in analyzing complex agricultural data. This section
    will showcase how these algorithms are employed to predict crop yields, detect
    diseases, and enhance crop management strategies. Technology has taken the agriculture
    domain to a higher level where it not only makes the often-tedious tasks easier
    but also provides many solutions to various complications of conventional farming.
    Smart farming and precision agriculture are two such technology-driven farming
    concepts that focus on managing and preparing the agricultural industry with frameworks
    to include advanced technologies such as deep learning and machine learning for
    tracking, monitoring, analyzing, automating, and executing operations [20]. There
    are numerous applications of machine learning and deep learning algorithms in
    the field of smart farming. Currently, technology-oriented devices are involved
    from selecting a particular land for farming to processing the cultivated crops
    into edible food items. In the previous sections, we have seen the key features
    and basic functionalities of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Now,
    let us see how these techniques are employed in the agricultural sector to predict
    crop yields, detect diseases, and enhance crop management strategies. 4.1 Maintaining
    Crop Health Constant monitoring of crops to improve their health is a time-consuming
    process. There are various external and internal factors that influence the health
    of the crops. Ample amount of rainfall, temperature, sunlight, and proper soil
    conditions are some of the necessary aspects in plant growth [21]. Even though
    the plant receives all these requirements, it doesn’t guarantee a successful crop
    production. Internal aspects such as damaged seeds, diseases, pest infestation,
    etc. can make them barren and unhealthy. The traditional way of tackling this
    issue is the manual observation of the plants. This process requires a lot of
    effort and time. And the person who does this should be an expert in all these
    fields, especially on varieties of diseases that affect plants. Performing these
    tasks manually will be difficult, and farmers with less knowledge will find it
    impossible to identify the diseases [22]. In this case, precision agriculture
    can be used as a solution. Various automated systems are developed under precision
    agriculture to identify the diseases affecting agricultural crops at an earlier
    stage. There are also systems based on big data and other technologies to monitor
    external factors such as weather changes and rainfall. The data from such systems
    can be analyzed to find out the optimum conditions that are necessary for healthy
    crops. They are mostly in the form of Excel files and images and collected using
    wireless sensors, drones, and cameras. This data will be stored for further use
    by the farmers to produce high yields. Automated systems that analyze soil conditions
    are also used widely. Adding fertilizers to an already fertile piece of land can
    degrade the existing quality of soil in that region. This happens when the chemicals
    present in the fertilizers affect the elements that make the land fertile. In
    this scenario, it is very necessary to evaluate the soil conditions [23]. An idea
    of the amount of minerals and nutrients present in the soil can tell us how much
    more we must provide so that the plant will be free from nutrient deficiencies.
    Supplying large quantities of nutrients can degrade the quality of both soils
    and crops. The excess amount of minerals will act as toxins to the plants which
    can affect their growth. All these issues can be answered using automated systems.
    Using sensors and other technology-based devices, they collect the required data
    and will be used in the prediction systems. Another set of automated systems is
    used in disease and pest detection in crops. This is another significant area
    that should be given great care so as to provide a high-quality yield. The diseases
    affecting a plant could spread to other crops on the farm within a short span
    of time. This is the same for pest infestation also. Proper identification and
    remedies should be done at the earliest. Technology-driven devices and software
    packages are better options than the conventional ways of tackling these issues.
    A wide range of images and videos of the diseases and pests affected in the same
    farmland and other farmland with the same crops will be collected using drones,
    software systems, and other wireless sensor networks. Based on these datasets,
    an automated system will be developed, and the developers train them using the
    collected data [24]. There are various types of algorithms available for this
    purpose. Even now, studies and research are done in this area to produce more
    accurate results. After training, the system will be tested with a new set of
    data and if it shows good results will be used in the farms for the early detection
    and identification of diseases and pests [25]. These techniques can also be used
    to provide good care and protection to the crops in a less period. The given image
    (Fig. 1) shows the basic block diagram of a crop disease identification model.

    Full size image 4.2 Production of High-Quality Yield The production of good quality
    yield is a challenging factor in the case of small-scale and large-scale farming
    [26]. One major reason behind this is the dependence of yield production on various
    fields such as soil, climatic conditions, water resources, temperature, etc. Hence,
    a healthy combination of all these factors results in a good quality yield. Conventional
    farming techniques cannot be relayed in this scenario. With their limited facilities
    only, a certain feature can be predicted and is not of much use. Involving technology-based
    devices such as wireless sensors, drones, AI-based robots, and software can give
    more accurate results [27]. These advanced systems help us to track the crop conditions
    at various levels so that we can do the necessary activities accordingly. Wireless
    sensor networks are mainly used to monitor the environmental conditions that are
    necessary for agricultural crop cultivation. These sensor networks are designed
    in a manner that has a base system that controls all the activities and connects
    it to the Internet to share the acquired data. Drones, on the other hand, do multiple
    activities such as fertilizer distribution, data collection, water supply, etc.,
    in large-scale farming. Using drones, we could see the very minute details of
    a crop even if it is a large farmland. This is helpful in the case of crop disease
    detection and classification [28]. Robots are other effective tools in smart farming.
    They can be used to reduce human labor and a lot of time [29]. They can be programmed
    and trained according to their needs. Software packages are developed based on
    the collected data to predict the yield and future results. Figure 2 is a center-pivot
    irrigation system which is very famous for its efficiency and the ability to irrigate
    uneven terrain uniformly. Fig. 2 Center-pivot irrigation system. (Source: https://www.infosys.com)
    Full size image 4.3 Land Suitability, Yield Prediction, and Classification Land
    and its surroundings are an important aspect of farming and crop cultivation.
    An efficient system with the ability to gather accurate information about agricultural
    land will be a useful tool for the farmers. Today, such prediction systems with
    advanced technologies are built using machine learning algorithms. In the olden
    days, to predict whether the respective land is suitable for cultivation, farmers
    didn’t have many sources. Only after years of observation and experience they
    were able to make partially correct decisions. Artificial Intelligence and other
    technologies have brought a drastic change to the farming sector. Machine learning
    models built to predict the land suitability use real-time data such as soil composition,
    availability of water resources, temperature, humidity, other climatic factors
    such as rainfall, and the requirements of the vegetative crops that are planned
    to cultivate. There are various machine learning algorithms developed to predict
    such systems with high accuracy [30]. The advantages of these land suitability
    prediction models based on machine learning algorithms make them important in
    today’s world. They foresee the quantity of yield produced and according to the
    amount a farmer can add more of it for a higher production without causing any
    damage to the environment. There is a high demand for such models, and prediction
    algorithms such as support vector machine, neural networks, K-means clustering,
    etc. are used to build them [31]. 4.4 Crop Management and Harvesting This is another
    area of the agricultural sector where machine learning algorithms are applied
    frequently. Crop management is an important aspect as it has a significant role
    in the economy of a nation. Therefore, it is mandatory to make sure that they
    are receiving proper monitoring at regular intervals of time. But it is always
    difficult to manage the crops in a large farmland. And manually doing this is
    even more tedious. As a solution to this, many computerized automated models are
    developed to manage the crops without any human intervention. They use machine
    learning algorithms and other technologies to build such systems [32]. Devices
    such as drones, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), wireless sensor networks, robots,
    etc. are used to collect various types of data to monitor and manage the agricultural
    crops [33]. The data collected can be preserved for future uses and helps in analyzing
    the requirements of each crop during its growth. This reduces the overutilization
    of fertilizers and the exploitation of natural resources. Many large-scale farming
    uses drones and helicopters for the distribution of fertilizers and water. Weeds
    that grow among the crops are also detected and eliminated using machine learning
    technologies. At each stage, the crops are provided with necessary requirements
    for their growth and development. Many systems are enhanced with special features
    which can detect and notify farmers of the presence of diseases and pests. There
    are also systems that indicate the harvesting or fruit ripening time so that the
    farmers can make the necessary preparations for it. Artificial Intelligence-based
    devices are used for harvesting which reduces the human labor and time. Machine-based
    harvesting is also a cost-effective process. This type of innovation using machine
    learning algorithms has made the farming sector more advanced and eco-friendlier
    at the same time. Even today, much research and studies are done in this field
    to make it more feasible and environmentally sound. 4.5 Seeds and Sapling Quality
    Prediction Another challenging factor in crop production is the quality of the
    seeds used. Even if the farmers use land that is of high quality, there is no
    point if they sow a dormant or an unhealthy seed. So, it is very important to
    make sure that the seeds and sapling used are healthy and productive. It was an
    impossible task in the olden days. But today with the help of technologies such
    as machine learning, deep learning, etc., we can find the health of a seed within
    a short span of time. Predictive algorithms are used here, and the systems that
    give high accuracy could be used for real farming purposes. They improve the farming
    sector by providing a yield that is of high quality. Even the quantity of the
    crop production is also enhanced by using such models. Figure 3 is a general pictorial
    representation of the crop yield estimation in an automated model. Fig. 3 Crop
    yield estimation model. (Source: https://www.geog.ucl.ac.uk) Full size image 4.6
    Reduce Ecological and Environmental Damages Following a smart farming culture
    can benefit us in various ways. One main advantage is the elimination of environmental
    hazards that have occurred because of conventional farming. Agricultural pollution
    can be eliminated to a large extent through eco-friendly smart farming methods.
    Utilization of herbicides, an alternative to harmful pesticides, and less usage
    of fertilizers can reduce the emission of greenhouse gases. The traditional farming
    process consumes a lot of fresh waters, and this can affect the available water
    resources. Even if water comes under the category of renewable resources, we must
    realize the fact that improper usage of all these resources can make them disappear
    from this Earth itself; hence, it is important to follow sustainable farming culture.
    Providing water for irrigation based on crop needs and soil conditions can be
    effective to reduce water scarcity [34]. The use of wireless sensors and software
    helps us to monitor the plants to find the amount of water and other minerals
    required. This reduces the overutilization of water and fertilizers. And we will
    be able to supply an adequate amount of water and necessary fertilizers as per
    the analyses and records. 4.7 For an Improved Decision-Making in Farming Sector
    Smart farming and precision agriculture have already started paving our path to
    follow a systematic and planned farming. A farmer should improve his planning
    and decision-making skills as he becomes more market-oriented. One of the major
    challenges faced by the farming sector is the pressure on everyone to be updated
    and informed to make appropriate decisions. Using technologies such as GPS satellite,
    drones, sensors, etc., we can gather data from history to create a predictive
    model so that we can choose the suitable crops that can give higher yields. This
    form of decision-making is more accurate and provides better results. Gathering
    other details such as weather condition, soil nature, crop features, etc. can
    help us to provide them with their exact needs. As a result, computerized automated
    systems are developed widely for accurate prediction and improved decision-making
    in the agricultural sector [35]. 5 Ensuring Transparency and Trust: Blockchain
    in Agriculture In recent years, blockchain technology has drawn a lot of attention
    due to its potential to increase openness and trust in a variety of industries,
    including agriculture. The farming sector faces difficulties with regard to information
    asymmetry, traceability, and inefficient supply chains. Using blockchain in agriculture
    can solve these problems and have several advantages such as the following: Supply
    Chain Transparency: Blockchain can be used to provide a transparent and unchangeable
    record of every step in the agricultural supply chain. Every transaction and movement,
    from planting and harvesting through processing, packaging, and distribution,
    can be documented on the blockchain. This minimizes the possibility of fraud,
    forgery, and unauthorized alterations by ensuring that all parties have access
    to correct and up-to-date information about the products’ whereabouts of manufacture
    and travel. Quality Assurance and Traceability: A digital ledger that maintains
    the whole lifespan of agricultural products, including details about the procedures
    employed, certificates gained, and any quality testing carried out, can be created
    using blockchain technology. Food safety may increase as a result of this transparency
    because any problems can be swiftly found and resolved. Accessibility and Consumer
    Trusts: Greater traceability and transparency can increase consumer trust in the
    items’ authenticity and quality. This may open up new domestic and foreign markets
    where customers are willing to pay more for reliable items. Smart Contracts and
    Automation: Smart contracts are agreements that automatically carry out their
    obligations because they are written in code. Smart contracts can automate a number
    of operations in agriculture, including payment settlements, quality assurance,
    and compliance verification. For instance, if sensors or outside data show that
    a farmer’s produce meets a given quality level, they can be automatically paid.
    Integration of technological expertise and a clear understanding of the specific
    challenges and opportunities within the agricultural sector can result in the
    successful implementation of blockchain technology which has the potential to
    revolutionize the agricultural industry by enhancing transparency, traceability,
    and trust throughout the supply chain. 6 Connecting Fields: 5G’s Impact on Smart
    Farming The advent of 5G technology promises unprecedented connectivity and low
    latency. This section will explore how 5G is poised to revolutionize smart farming
    by enabling real-time data collection, precision farming through remote-controlled
    machinery, and IoT integration. The launch of 5G technology has the potential
    to significantly impact various industries, including agriculture. The possibilities
    provided by 5G can be very useful for smart farming, which uses cutting-edge technologies
    to optimize agricultural methods. Few impacts of 5G technology in smart farming
    are given below: Monitoring of real-time data: Gathering of real-time data and
    its transmission are made possible by 5G’s high-speed and low-latency capabilities.
    The use of sensors, drones, and other IoT devices to monitor factors, like soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity, and crop health across their fields, provide
    precise information to farmers based on which they can take quick actions. Precision
    agriculture: By customizing activities to certain regions of a field, precision
    agriculture strives to maximize agricultural yields and resource efficiency. Precision
    remote control of machinery and equipment is made possible by 5G. For instance,
    real-time, minimally delayed operation of autonomous vehicles and drones enables
    precision planting, spraying, and harvesting. Remote operations and management:
    The utilization of cloud-based platforms and mobile applications enables farmers
    to remotely monitor and manage their operations. Farmers can access data, manage
    equipment, and make decisions from anywhere as a result of 5G’s quick and dependable
    connectivity, which improves operational effectiveness. Livestock management:
    Wearable gadgets can be utilized in livestock husbandry to monitor animal behavior
    and health. Farmers can improve animal well-being and efficiency by real-time
    monitoring of vital signs and behavioral patterns to identify health issues early.
    Smart irrigation: Sensors powered by 5G can offer precise information on soil
    moisture levels, enabling irrigation with the right amount of water. This can
    minimize operational expenses, increase crop quality, and reduce water waste.
    Predictive analytics: 5G enables the real-time analysis of data from a variety
    of sources to produce insights and predictions. Machine learning algorithms can
    analyze sensor data, weather forecasts, and historical trends to produce recommendations
    for the best times to plant, how to prevent disease, and more. Supply chain management:
    Real-time connectivity provided by 5G can improve supply chain traceability and
    transparency. Every stage of the supply chain, from the farm to the consumer,
    may be watched, ensuring product quality, cutting waste, and fostering consumer
    trust. Agri-robotics: Robotic weeding, picking, and trimming are just a few of
    the advanced agri-robotics applications that 5G can support. Using 5G connectivity,
    these robots may be remotely controlled and steered, improving efficiency and
    lowering the need for manual labor. Virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR): They
    are immersive technologies that enhance our sensory experiences and interactions
    by blending the digital and physical worlds, in which 5G is well suited for due
    to its low latency. With augmented reality (AR) glasses, farmers can receive information
    about the field they are viewing in real time, such as crop health information
    or upkeep guidelines. Collaboration and knowledge-sharing: 5G makes it possible
    for farmers, professionals, and researchers to collaborate and share data easily.
    This helps people to share their finest ideas, perspectives, and solutions to
    agriculture-based problems. Despite the significant advantages of 5G for smart
    farming, there are some challenges to take into account: Infrastructure: An extensive
    infrastructure and a proper network coverage are required for 5G installation
    which limits it to the urban areas due to the poor network in rural areas. Cost:
    For farmers, especially small-scale enterprises, installing 5G infrastructure
    and buying appropriate devices can be expensive. Data privacy and security: They
    are more important as more data is produced and sent, especially sensitive agriculture
    data. Spectrum and regulatory issues: Spectrum allocation and regulatory frameworks
    may have an impact on the availability and deployment of 5G networks. Therefore,
    the low-latency connectivity and the high speed of 5G network have the potential
    to change smart farming enabling real-time data collection, remote monitoring,
    precision agriculture, and advanced analytics. The agricultural industry may experience
    a gain in productivity, resource efficiency, and sustainability as the technology
    develops and becomes more generally available. 7 Harvesting Insights: Big Data
    Analytics in Precision Agriculture Big data analytics in precision agriculture
    is a significant advancement in modern farming practices which has the potential
    to transform raw agricultural data into actionable insights. By incorporating
    cutting-edge data analytics, precision agriculture, which adapts cultivation methods
    to specific circumstances, has undergone a revolution. This integration makes
    it easier to extract important insights from enormous and varied datasets, which
    results in improved agricultural processes. The acquisition and merging of data
    from multiple sources form the basis of precision agriculture. A huge amount of
    data is produced by sensors, drones, weather stations, machines, and satellite
    pictures. Big data analytics easily integrates these various data sources, giving
    farmers a thorough understanding of the state and dynamics of their farms. The
    basis for making informed decisions is this thorough knowledge. The interpreting
    and processing abilities of big data analytics are essential in making sense of
    the gathered data. Huge amounts of data are searched through by sophisticated
    algorithms and models, which then reveal complex patterns, trends, and connections.
    It also reveals major relationships between crop yields and elements including
    soil type, irrigation intensity, and temperature variations [36]. These observations
    assist farmers aiming for increased output with beneficial guidance. The predictive
    ability of big data analytics in precision agriculture is among its most alluring
    features. The technology may predict future circumstances and results by examining
    historical and real-time data. The capacity to predict problems and opportunities
    gives farmers the flexibility to proactively modify their strategies and plans.
    Big data analytics also provides prescriptive advice in addition to predictions.
    These practical recommendations allow farmers to adjust planting timings, irrigation
    schedules, and fertilization methods. Precision agriculture is primarily driven
    by resource optimization, and big data analytics is essential to attaining this
    goal [37]. Waste is minimized, and environmental effect is decreased by adjusting
    the distribution of resources like water, fertilizers, and pesticides based on
    unique field conditions. The technology also assists in the early detection of
    pests, illnesses, and other hazards to crops. Monitoring many data sources enables
    quick responses that stop and lessen these problems. Another factor that sets
    apart precision agriculture driven by big data analytics is the customized decision-making.
    The technology permits the study of data that is unique to particular fields within
    a field. This level of specificity enables farmers to customize their choices
    to the distinctive qualities of each region, leading to improved efficiency and
    results [38]. The insights from big data analytics lead to cost savings in an
    economic perspective. The profit margins of farmers are boosted by greater resource
    use, higher yields, and reduced operational inefficiencies. Therefore, we can
    say that the integration of big data analytics in precision agriculture represents
    a fundamental change in the agricultural industry as it improves productivity,
    sustainability, and responsiveness which made precision agriculture a cornerstone
    of contemporary agricultural methods. 8 Orchestrating Farms: The IoT Revolution
    The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled smart devices and sensors to gather real-time
    data from agricultural fields. It is a network of interconnected machines, sensors,
    and systems that communicate and share information digitally. The IoT technology
    has transformed the conventional agricultural activities by facilitating real-time
    data gathering, analysis, and automation. As a result, many areas of farming are
    managed precisely and efficiently. The major areas enhanced by IoT technology
    are discussed below: Developments in irrigation using IoT: Irrigation has typically
    relied on predetermined schedules or manual monitoring, which can result in inefficient
    water use and unequal distribution. IoT uses sensors embedded in the ground to
    monitor soil moisture levels and send information to a central server. The precise
    amount of water required in various fields is then calculated using this data.
    Automated irrigation systems can be remotely managed and changed based on current
    information. This methodical technique reduces wasteful use of water, encourages
    ideal crop growth, and even guards against overwatering, which can result in soil
    erosion. Pest control using IoT: Agricultural sector faces an ongoing difficulty
    in controlling diseases and pests. IoT-enabled technologies provide a preventative
    strategy for pest management. Temperature, humidity, and other environmental elements
    that affect insect behavior can be monitored in the field by sensors. Potential
    insect outbreaks can be predicted using this data along with information from
    weather forecasts and historical trends [39]. IoT technologies also enable farmers
    to apply interventions like targeted pesticide spraying precisely where and when
    needed by providing them with notifications and recommendations. This decreases
    the need for extensive chemical use, lowers expenses, and has a minimal negative
    influence on the environment. Livestock management using IoT: Livestock and dairy
    farming are an important area of agricultural sector. Milk, dairy products, eggs,
    meat, etc. are essential in our day-to-day life. They also provide us with other
    beneficial things such as manure and wool and even help in farming. Therefore,
    it is very important to monitor the health and welfare of these animals. To improve
    dairy farming, we must receive products that are of high quality and quantity
    without affecting or disturbing their health and life. IoT technologies provide
    solutions such as real-time monitoring and better animal care for livestock husbandry
    [40]. These systems use wireless sensor networks, cameras, software, robots, etc.
    to monitor, analyze, and collect the data. Using this data that are collected,
    the farmers could identify the animals with poor health. They can also use robots
    to feed them and guide them to grazing in the fields. Artificial Intelligence-based
    devices are used in large farms to milk the cows and to reduce labor to a large
    extent. Farm animals can be monitored at any time from any location using drones
    and cameras. This type of tracking of farm animals helps farmers from losing them.
    Even the behavioral abnormalities of the cattle due to any diseases or pests also
    can be easily notified if the farmers follow a visual tracking system. This type
    of automated model helps to preserve the data and records easily and provides
    an insight into the financial and operational aspects. Farmers also can get familiarized
    with each animal through such automated models even if there are a large number
    of animals. Wearable gadgets with sensors can monitor an animal’s health, activity
    level, and even behavioral habits. Farmers are able to remotely check on the health
    and welfare of their cattle by enabling the transmission of this data to cloud-based
    platforms [41]. Alerts are generated if anomalies are found, allowing for prompt
    intervention. IoT technology also helps feed distribution be optimized, ensuring
    animals get the proper quantity of nourishment. This method encourages healthier
    animals, more output, and lower mortality rates. There are various other fields
    that use IoT to flourish in today’s farming practices. All these examples show
    how seamlessly integrating technology into farming practices can enhance the efficiency,
    sustainability, and productivity of the agricultural sector. 9 Digital Twins,
    Mobile Applications, and Cloud Computing for Smart Farming A digital twin is a
    virtual representation of a physical object or system, such as a farm, a field,
    or even a single plant. In order to build a dynamic and interactive virtual counterpart
    to the actual agricultural environment, this method makes use of the power of
    cutting-edge technologies, such as sensors, Internet of Things (IoT) devices,
    and data analytics. Smart farming uses digital twins as crucial instruments for
    accurate decision-making and process optimization. Farmers can view data in real
    time gathered by sensors positioned throughout their fields and livestock. The
    digital twin is then fed with this information to produce a virtual depiction
    of the farm’s conditions. The ability of digital twin approach for predictive
    modeling and analysis is one of its significant benefits. Farmers can learn more
    about how various factors, such as weather patterns, soil moisture levels, and
    planting methods may interact and affect crop growth by simulating these factors.
    Farmers may proactively modify their practices to enhance yields and resource
    efficiency, thanks to this foresight. The benefits of digital twin idea also extend
    to sustainability and risk management. Within the virtual environment, farmers
    can model the effects of pest outbreaks, droughts, or extreme weather conditions.
    As a result, they can create mitigation techniques and backup plans that they
    can quickly use when similar circumstances arise in real life. The introduction
    of mobile applications revolutionized the agricultural sector drastically as it
    gives farmers immediate access to vital information, empowering them to make knowledgeable
    decisions and manage their businesses more successfully. These smartphone apps
    provide a variety of benefits across several facets of agricultural management
    in the context of smart farming. Through sensors and IoT devices, farmers can
    remotely monitor their fields, crops, and livestock to stay informed on important
    elements like soil moisture, temperature, and animal behavior. Rapid responses
    to developing situations and prospective problems are made possible by this rapid
    connectivity [42]. Additionally, these apps are essential for precision agriculture
    since they let farmers create precise field maps, specify planting zones, and
    optimize machinery routes. Such capabilities enable precision seeding, variable-rate
    fertilizer and pesticide delivery, and tailored irrigation, all of which boost
    agricultural yields and resource utilization. Mobile apps also speed up data gathering
    and analysis by enabling farmers to directly input data on planting plans, yields,
    and pest observations into their devices. Farmers are given the tools they need
    to make data-driven decisions so they may achieve greater results. In summary,
    mobility in agriculture is transforming how farmers run their businesses, promoting
    improved effectiveness, sustainability, and success in the context of contemporary
    farming. The adoption of cloud computing technologies in agriculture has ushered
    in a new era of productivity and connection, revolutionizing conventional farming
    methods and paving the way for farming in the clouds. Delivery of computing services
    through the Internet, including storage, processing power, and data analytics,
    is referred to as cloud computing. This technology has several advantages for
    agriculture and has completely changed how farmers operate and make decisions.
    The capacity to store and access enormous volumes of data from anywhere at any
    time is one of the main benefits of cloud computing in agriculture. Cloud-based
    platforms allow farmers to upload and preserve information about soil characteristics,
    crop yields, weather patterns, and other topics. A comprehensive digital record
    of all agricultural activities is kept in this central location, enabling data-driven
    decision-making. Furthermore, having access to this information enables farmers
    to work with professionals, researchers, and other interested parties, exchanging
    knowledge and insights that help them make well-informed decisions. Precision
    agriculture also greatly benefits from the use of cloud computing. Farmers can
    produce precise field maps and remotely monitor conditions by combining data from
    numerous sources, including sensors, drones, and satellite photos. Cloud computing
    also improves agricultural risk management. By running models and simulations
    on cloud platforms, farmers can simulate various scenarios and make predictions
    about possible outcomes. For example, they can determine how different weather
    conditions affect agricultural growth or forecast the effects of shifting market
    pricing. Farmers may create risk mitigation plans and make well-informed decisions
    that can protect their revenue, thanks to this proactive approach. The successful
    convergence of digital twins, mobile applications, and cloud computing has ushered
    in a new era of extraordinary creativity and efficiency in the quickly changing
    environment of modern agriculture. A wave of change in smart farming has been
    sparked by the dynamic interaction of digital twins, which provide virtual representations
    of the real world; mobile applications, which give farmers access to real-time
    insights and management tools; and cloud computing, which offers scalable data
    storage and processing capabilities. This effective trio enables farmers to adopt
    sustainable practices, allocate resources efficiently, increase productivity,
    and make educated decisions. A future where agriculture is not just smarter but
    also more resilient, productive, and tuned in to the changing requirements of
    an expanding globe is promised as these technologies continue to develop and converge.
    10 Case Study in Leaf Disease Detection The case study detailed here demonstrates
    the integration of technologies to provide the agricultural sector with more accurate
    results within a short span of time which can enhance the soil management and
    disease control strategies to another level. Case study on disease detection:
    The applications of machine learning technologies in different fields are discussed
    in the previous sections. Advances related to vegetative crops and their high-quality
    production are a prominent area as it can benefit under any circumstances. One
    major problem that is influencing the production, quality, and quantity of the
    crops is the varieties of diseases and pests affecting the plants. This is damaging
    the food industry and agricultural sector as a whole. The mutated variations of
    diseases are a real challenge to the farmers. Many automated systems are designed
    as a solution to tackle this issue. These models use machine learning technologies
    to detect and classify diseases accordingly. Each model is designed with many
    sophisticated algorithms at every step in order to generate an accurate result.
    Here is a system that is built using the latest machine learning algorithms to
    identify the diseases affecting the common vegetative crops. Figure 4 shows the
    general block diagram of an automated crop disease identification system. Fig.
    4 The general block diagram of an automated crop disease identification system
    Full size image These are the major steps in a disease detection model. The first
    and foremost activity is to gather the necessary data which must be fed to the
    system. In most cases, leaf images are used as data as they contain diseases,
    symptoms of diseases, and various other details. Pest and infections also affect
    other parts such as roots, stem, fruits, and flowers of the plants, and therefore,
    they can also be used as dataset. Once these images are collected, they must undergo
    preprocessing. It is done using various algorithms, resizing images without any
    data loss and with the help of many filtering techniques. This step is mainly
    taken to eliminate the presence of noise and other distortions that exist in the
    image. The unwanted portions of the image such as the background and other parts
    that don’t contain the disease or symptoms also can be removed during this stage.
    This is an important step as further processes depend on the preprocessed image.
    The preprocessed images are then segmented using various segmentation algorithms.
    These algorithms help us to segment the image into multiple partitions, and the
    formations of smaller sections are based on the similar characteristics of the
    pixel values. Watershed segmentation, canny edge detection, etc. are some of the
    conventional segmentation algorithms available. Recently, many hybrid algorithms
    are developed to obtain more accurate results. These segmentation algorithms help
    the system to extract the necessary features easily which results in proper feature
    extraction. They are extracted from the dataset fed into the system and are used
    to train the system to get familiarized with diseased and healthy leaf images.
    This helps the system to identify a diseased leaf image when tested using a similar
    image. There are algorithms to perfectly extract the features from a data, and
    this is a crucial step to develop an accurate model. Here, we have taken two common
    rice leaf diseases such as brown spot disease and leaf smut which are great threats
    to rice production (Figs. 5 and 6, respectively). The images of diseased and healthy
    rice leaves were collected from here and preprocessed using the median filter
    to remove the noise. The unwanted background portions were also removed. After
    segmentation, the features that represent each disease were extracted to train
    the system. The features extracted for leaf smut are the black lesions present
    on the leaves and the dry, gray-colored leaf tips and the brown-colored large
    lesions for brown spot disease. Fig. 5 Leaf smut disease Full size image Fig.
    6 Brown spot disease Full size image 10.1 Dataset The dataset used here is collected
    from an online dataset repository known as UCI machine learning repository. A
    total of 470 images are taken and divided into a training and testing set of 422
    images and 48 images, respectively. 10.2 Classification The final step is the
    classification of images into the two categories, diseased or healthy. Again,
    there are various classification algorithms available to classify the input image.
    In our work, we have taken three supervised classification algorithms. Each one
    is trained and tested using our dataset, and the obtained experimental results
    along with the comparative study of each algorithm are shown here. 10.2.1 K-Nearest
    Neighbor Algorithm It is one of the simplest algorithms that can be used in both
    classification and regression problems. This algorithm determines the K-nearest
    neighbors, and based on this neighbor weight, they determine the label of the
    samples. The aim of this algorithm is to classify the testing set by calculating
    the distance between the test samples and the training samples. The equation used
    here is $$ D\\left(u,{v}_i\\right)=\\sum \\limits_{f\\varepsilon F}{\\omega}_f\\delta
    \\left({u}_f,{v}_i\\right)f $$ (1) where D is the training set with vi training
    samples and u is the testing sample. In this algorithm, the k values are based
    on the data values. After performing the classification, it is observed that the
    accuracy on the testing set is 91.6% when k value is taken as 1 and accuracy is
    72.95% when the k value is 3. 10.2.2 Decision Tree This is another classification
    algorithm that is used widely. Here, the algorithm partitions the dataset into
    two sections by taking a suitable value as the root. The splitting of the data
    continues till the values in each group become homogeneous. The decision tree
    algorithm is based on a greedy approach known as iterative dichotomies3 (ID3).
    In this method, the tree is constructed using concepts such as entropy and information
    gain which are borrowed from information theory. Here, entropy calculates the
    values that do not belong to the class. If all the values are of the same type,
    then it shows zero entropy. And when the values are different from that of the
    group, the entropy becomes positive. The given Eq. (2) shows the entropy value:
    $$ E=\\sum \\limits_c^{i=1}-{P}_i{\\log}_9{P}_i $$ (2) Here, c represents the
    number of classes. The next node in the tree is selected using the information
    gain concept. The node with highest information gain is determined for this purpose.
    That is calculated using Eq. (3): $$ G\\left(S,A\\right)=E(S)-\\sum \\frac{\\left|{S}_v\\right|}{\\left|S\\right|}E\\left({S}_v\\right)
    $$ (3) In this equation, A denotes the known value, G is the gain, and E represents
    the Entropy. Sv is the subset of A as it has the value v in it. The test set gave
    an accuracy of 97.91% after performing classification using the decision tree
    algorithm. 10.2.3 Naïve Bayes Classifier This is another commonly used classification
    algorithm that works according to the Bayes theorem. Naïve Bayes classifier is
    known as a probabilistic classifier as the prediction is based on the probability
    of an object. For this, first, the dataset is represented using a frequency table.
    A likelihood table is generated by finding the probabilities of the selected features,
    and the posterior probability is calculated using the Bayes theorem. The equation
    to select the best hypothesis is given by the following: $$ {\\displaystyle \\begin{array}{c}\\wedge
    \\\\ {}y\\end{array}}= amP(y)\\prod \\limits_n^{i=1}\\left(P\\left({x}_i|y\\right)\\right)
    $$ (4) The accuracy obtained after performing Naïve Bayes classifier by the test
    set is 56% which is very less compared to that of K-nearest neighbor and decision
    tree classification algorithms. 10.3 Result Table 1 shows the accuracy of the
    three classification algorithms when trained and tested using diseased and healthy
    rice leaf images. Table 1 Accuracy of the three classification algorithms Full
    size table The comparison of the accuracy obtained from the three classifiers
    is shown in the given graph (Fig. 7). Fig. 7 Accuracy obtained from the three
    classifiers Full size image 11 Conclusion Technological advances have transformed
    conventional farming practices to another level. Today, it is known as smart farming
    which uses intelligent robots and smart machines to propel the agricultural industry
    forward. A huge transformation has occurred since machine learning technologies
    invaded the agricultural sector. The rapidly increasing population is putting
    a tremendous pressure on the natural resources and grasslands for their food and
    other requirements. Due to this, many problems such as global warming, soil erosion,
    deforestation, climatic changes, etc. have been stimulated, making the situation
    even more serious. Fortunately, modern farming methods equipped with machine learning
    technologies are making it possible to meet the challenges faced by the industry.
    In this chapter, we have discussed the various applications and roles of machine
    learning technologies in smart farming. Many diagnostic applications powered by
    these highly advanced technologies are used by the farmers to retrieve complete
    information and find correct remedies to combat the diseases. To innovate and
    improve the potential of advancing technology, agricultural experts and other
    technologists are expected to provide their maximum effort and enthusiasm. Besides,
    it is our duty to educate and spread the importance of precision agriculture.
    We must encourage everyone to embrace new technologies such as machine learning,
    Artificial Intelligence, etc., as they have the potential to increase yield and
    productivity. References S.K.S. Durai, M.D. Shamili, Smart farming using Machine

    of cultivating plants and rearing livestock to obtain food and other products.
    It serves as a source of sustenance and provides employment opportunities for
    people. Farmers carefully choose the most suitable crop for their land by considering
    yield comparisons based on price, market demand, selling price, cultivation budget,
    and crop production range [1]. Once the crop is selected, the next step in the
    agricultural process is land preparation, which involves adding fertilizer to
    maintain optimal soil fertility and minimize the impact of crop diseases. It also
    entails designing the irrigation system based on the land layout. The subsequent
    stage is seed selection, which considers price, quantity, and water requirements
    specific to the area. Seed selection aims to enhance yield and improve the crop’s
    disease resistance [2]. The fifth step in the crop farming cycle is irrigation,
    which ensures that the crop receives adequate water and is conducted promptly
    to support growth until harvest. Crop growth is a crucial aspect of the farming
    cycle and encompasses monitoring overall crop development [3]. Farmers monitor
    fertilizer deployment, compare crop growth with expected outcomes, and take pre-emptive
    measures against diseases. The final stage is harvesting, which entails harvesting
    the crop at the optimal time and using appropriate methods or machinery suitable
    for the specific crop type. All these steps are vital for cultivating a healthy
    crop. Traditional agricultural methods often neglect the importance of these steps,
    resulting in suboptimal crop yields. Several technologies emerged in agriculture
    to enhance crop productivity. In this work, we propose an IoT-driven approach
    to optimize the fertilization. 1.1 Fertilization Fertilization is the process
    of applying fertilizers to enrich the nutrient composition of the soil. Fertilization
    plays a vital role in stimulating the growth of crops and increasing overall production.
    Farmers utilize fertilizers to improve soil productivity and quality. Fertilizers,
    whether obtained from natural or synthetic sources, can take the form of organic
    or inorganic substances. Their primary function is to be applied to the soil,
    delivering vital nutrients to plants [4]. These nutrients are available in significant
    amounts or in a form that plants can readily utilize. In agriculture, fertilizers
    are categorized into bio-fertilizers and chemical fertilizers [5]. Bio-fertilizers
    use organic waste and other biological agents to enhance soil fertility. At the
    same time, chemical fertilizers consist of the primary nutrients Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potassium (NPK) and secondary nutrients such as Magnesium, Calcium, and Sulfur.
    Fertilization Techniques: Numerous techniques are employed for fertilization.
    However, in traditional fertilization methods, farmers often lack awareness of
    the specific nutrient requirements of the soil. Consequently, fertilizers are
    applied without consideration of the soil''s nutrient composition. The farmers
    cannot accurately assess the levels of critical nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorous,
    and Potassium (NPK) in the ground. As a result, the quantity of fertilizer applied
    may lead to either over-fertilization or under-fertilization of the area. Issues
    with existed fertilization techniques: Lack of farmer awareness regarding the
    precise role of fertilizers in crop production. Crop damage from excessive fertilizer
    application affects the plants’ health and increases productivity. Time and labor-intensive
    nature of the traditional fertilization methods. Imbalanced soil nutrient levels,
    particularly with respect to Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Potassium (NPK), leading
    to compromised crop quality and reduced yield. 1.2 IoT in Agriculture IoT, an
    emergent technology, facilitates the interconnection of intelligent devices via
    the Internet. It creates a global network that links various instruments to achieve
    specific goals [6]. IoT, utilizing multiple technologies, enhances convenience
    and comfort in daily life. Its applications extend to numerous fields, including
    intelligent agriculture [7], smart cities [8], smart homes [9], innovative business
    solutions [10], health care [10], intelligent vehicles, and sports and leisure
    activities [11]. Integrating IoT technology into traditional agriculture has increased
    intelligent agriculture [12]. Smart agriculture employs smart control and decision-making
    devices that enable timely and accurate decision-making. This approach ensures
    efficient resource allocation by supplying water and fertilizers based on demand,
    thereby minimizing resource wastage and maintaining soil fertility levels. The
    adoption of modern techniques in agriculture aims to enhance crop quality and
    production. IoT has transformed agriculture into precision agriculture and micro-agriculture
    [13]. Precision agriculture involves implementing site-specific management systems
    for crops [14]. It focuses on maximizing agricultural output while minimizing
    resource inputs [15]. In precision agriculture, digital technology, remote sensing,
    global positioning systems (GPS), and IoT are utilized to optimize farming practices
    and reduce costs. Smart farming automates various farming tasks and reduces the
    need for human intervention. Traditional agriculture has evolved into precision
    agriculture with the integration of IoT technology [16]. IoT applications in agriculture
    include soil monitoring systems [17], smart farming [18], intelligent irrigation
    systems [19], and the supply of fresh agricultural products [20]. IoT-enabled
    e-agriculture applications effortlessly provide real-time information, benefiting
    rural farmers and reducing human workload. One such application is smart farming,
    which combines agriculture and IoT technologies. Agri-IoT is a framework designed
    to assist farmers by providing timely information about farm conditions and potential
    risks, enabling them to protect their crops from damage [18]. 2 Related Work In
    recent years, the agriculture field has witnessed the emergence of various techniques
    aimed at enhancing productivity and improving crop quality. Several of these techniques
    are discussed in this section. Khelifa et al. have introduced an intelligent irrigation
    system utilizing IoT technology [19]. This system is specifically designed to
    conserve water resources in Algeria and contribute to the country''s agricultural
    economy. Addressing the challenges faced by farmers, Mohanraj et al. have developed
    an automated agriculture field monitoring system [17]. The model encompasses various
    components: knowledge acquisition, comprehension, analysis, knowledge base, and
    the crop selection phase. Lee et al. have introduced an IoT-based agriculture
    production system [21]. In the pursuit of enhancing crop quality and productivity,
    Marie and Rosman have developed a model for detecting NPK levels using an optical
    transducer [12]. Ryu et al. reported an IoT-based connected farm for an intelligent
    farming system [22]. The design incorporates sensors and controllers that utilize
    the Internet via platforms like Cube and Mobius to collect data. With the help
    of a smartphone application, farmers can remotely control various aspects of their
    farm, including water supply, nutrient levels, ventilation, cover usage, and LED
    lighting. Haghverdi et al. have introduced a site-specific water production function
    (WPF) [23]. This system utilizes techniques such as neural networks, k-nearest
    neighbor, and linear regression to design and evaluate the WPF. P and Mahalakshmi
    have proposed an IoT-driven field monitoring and automated irrigation system,
    which is specifically designed for areas with low water levels [24]. Sensors monitor
    the crop field and transmit data to web servers using wireless transmission. Farmers
    receive periodic notifications on their mobile devices, allowing them to monitor
    the condition of their crops from anywhere. To improve soil fertility, Wang et
    al. have introduced a precision irrigation–fertilization controller system [25].
    This system manages the pH concentration by mixing water to maintain the desired
    level. To overcome the challenges related to scalability and compatibility of
    IoT devices, Cambra et al. have introduced a novel IoT-based agriculture monitoring
    system [26]. The system utilizes a service-oriented architecture (SOA) with a
    standardized interface (LoRa by Lora Alliance) for device communication. In farming,
    Bhowmick et al. have introduced an IoT-enabled innovative agriculture application
    [27]. Further, the fertilization issues are resolved using a low-cost IoT-based
    fertilizer notification system [16]. The NPK sensor, designed with colorimetric
    principles using LDR and LED, is connected to a microcontroller unit for NPK value
    analysis. Dewi and Chen have created a decision-making system that relies on IoT
    data collection [28]. This system effectively utilizes IoT devices to gather localized
    data on crucial parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, humidity, water
    level, and light intensity. Das et al. have presented an intelligent agricultural
    system using IoT in India [29]. This system focuses on mitigating crop loss during
    harvesting and post-harvest stages by incorporating several sensors (soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, E-nose motion, and pest sensors) with the Raspberry Pi
    model. For optimizing fertilizer recommendations, Premashudha and Leena have introduced
    an IoT-enabled solution [30]. The DSS utilizes cloud web GIS servers, mobile applications,
    and kiosk systems. Joshi and Goudar have introduced an IoT-based automated solution
    [31]. This system enables farmers to control electric water motors using their
    Android phones, providing convenience and reducing dependency on electricity for
    irrigation. Pandithurai et al. have presented the digital monitoring of soil and
    crops using IoT in the Agro-Tech system [32]. This system combines IoT applications
    with traditional agricultural techniques. Kamienski et al. have developed an intelligent
    water management system for precision irrigation [33]. Mucherino et al. have incorporated
    data mining techniques into the agricultural field [34]. The k-means clustering
    algorithm is utilized in wine fermentation to group apples into clusters based
    on their growth patterns. It facilitates classification as good or bad for further
    fermentation. 3 IoT-Based System for Fertilizer Detection The proposed model operates
    in three stages: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the data
    acquisition phase, wireless sensor nodes collect information on soil nutrients
    and other fundamental inputs from the fields. Subsequently, the collected data
    is formatted appropriately, incorporating additional details such as crop type
    and time frame, before being transmitted to a remote server. The transformation
    process is tailored to the application and performed using smart devices. Finally,
    data analysis occurs on the remote server, and the resulting insights are communicated
    to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 IoT-based model for precision agriculture Full
    size image 1. Data Acquisition: The data acquisition phase encompasses several
    vital operations, including deploying wireless sensor nodes, network configuration,
    and data collection. The first step involves selecting the area for cultivation.
    Subsequently, wireless sensor nodes are deployed in the field, configuring the
    network accordingly. Once deployed, the nodes collect data on primary nutrients
    (NPK) and other external parameters such as temperature, moisture, and pH. The
    collected data is then streamed and made available on the farmer''s smartphone
    for access and monitoring. The soil samples are collected from various regional
    locations to normalize the NPK values. IoT-based wireless NPK sensors are embedded
    in the soil. 2. Data Transformation: The collected data is processed and transformed
    into the appropriate format to meet the application''s requirements. This transformation
    ensures that the data is compatible with the desired analysis or processing tasks.
    Additionally, the data is supplemented with additional inputs such as the type
    of crop, time frame, and any other relevant information. Once the data is appropriately
    formatted and enriched, it is migrated to a remote server or cloud platform for
    further analysis and processing. 3. Data Analysis: The farmer''s request is processed
    at the cloud platform, and a response is generated based on soil nutrient values
    and external parameters’ analysis. The analytic process considers the farmer''s
    input and compares it with the collected data to provide relevant information
    and recommendations. For example, suppose a farmer queries about the fertilizer
    requirements for a specific crop. In that case, the system analyzes the soil nutrient
    values. It provides a response that includes the recommended amount of fertilizer,
    composition guidelines, and suitable temperature conditions for optimal crop growth.
    This response is returned to the farmer, enabling them to make informed decisions
    and take appropriate actions in their agricultural practices. 3.1 Toy Example
    1. Data Acquisition Step 1: Choose the area for cultivation. Step 2: Install and
    configure wireless sensor nodes in the selected area. Step 3: Gather data using
    the deployed sensor nodes (Table 1). Table 1 Acquisition phase data from sensors
    Full size table 2. Data Transformation Step 4: The user determines crop selection
    and time frame, and the collected data is organized and transferred to a cloud
    platform. 3. Data Analysis Step 5: Load the sample values or data into memory.
    Step 6: Set the algorithmic parameters, such as “population size = 10”, “number
    of clusters (Ki = 1)”, and maximum number of iterations = 20, where i = 1, 2,
    … n. Step 7: Select the initial seed point K1 (15.949, 1.718, 13.068, 6.2, 30).
    Step 8: Evaluate the objective function and update the solution. Step 9: Check
    the termination condition. If it is met, stop the process; otherwise, repeat the
    steps. Step 10: Obtain the optimal solution. For example, the optimal solution
    obtained after the 20th iteration is K1 (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30). The
    optimal values (4.634, 1.57, 4.715, 6.6, 29.30) are compared with the predefined
    database values for wheat crops shown in Table 2. Table 2 List of crops with NPK,
    pH, and temperature values Full size table Based on this comparison, the predicted
    amount of fertilizer (NPK) is (5.366, 0.43, 1.2), the variation in pH is 0.1,
    and the suitable temperature is 2.3. The response is then sent back to the farmer,
    suggesting implementing these recommendations in the cultivation area. 4 Conclusion
    and Future Scope This research introduces an approach that utilizes IoT technology
    to create a model for fertilizer detection. The aim is to precisely forecast the
    ideal amount of fertilizer required for cultivating crops. The model consists
    of three main phases: data acquisition, transformation, and analysis. During the
    data acquisition phase, soil nutrient values are collected, while in the transformation
    phase, the collected data is processed and transferred to a cloud platform for
    further analysis. Subsequently, a suitable response is generated and communicated
    back to the farmer. The proposed model effectively addresses common fertilization
    challenges such as over-fertilization, under-fertilization, and nutrient imbalances,
    all while ensuring cost-effectiveness. Future research will focus on incorporating
    additional external parameters like humidity and weather conditions to enhance
    the model’s accuracy. Additionally, the cultivation area will be divided into
    distinct regions, enabling a geographically based analysis to optimize crop quality
    and production further. References Spuhler D, Carle N (2019) Retrieved from https://sswm.info/sswm-solutions-bop-markets/improving-water-and-sanitation-services-provided-public-institutions-0/crop-selection

  description: Cotton, a crucial cash crop in the textile industry, faces significant
    threats from various diseases that can impact both yield and fiber quality. This
    research explores the integration of Internet of Things (IoT) innovations to revolutionize
    cotton plant disease detection, providing real-time monitoring and data-driven
    decision support for sustainable agriculture practices. The proposed system employs
    wireless sensor networks deployed in cotton fields, UAVs equipped with advanced
    imaging technology, and a centralized data processing platform. These components
    collect crucial environmental parameters, such as temperature, humidity, and soil
    moisture, alongside high-resolution images of the cotton crops. The dataset is
    then transmitted to a centralized platform where machine learning algorithms and
    analytics are applied for precise disease detection. Machine learning models,
    trained on diverse datasets containing images of cotton plants with various diseases,
    analyze incoming data to identify potential outbreaks promptly. Upon detection,
    the system triggers automated responses, such as notifying farmers or activating
    precision-targeted treatment protocols, minimizing environmental impact and optimizing
    resource usage. Implementation of this IoT-driven disease detection system not
    only enables early intervention but also contributes to sustainable agriculture
    by reducing reliance on broad-spectrum pesticides and optimizing yield. The collected
    data supports long-term trend analysis, offering insights into crop management
    practices and encouraging the adoption of precision agriculture. This research
    demonstrates the efficacy of IoT technologies in addressing critical challenges
    in cotton farming, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for sustainable
    agriculture. By presenting a comprehensive framework for disease detection and
    management, this study aims to contribute to the ongoing discourse on utilizing
    technological innovations for ensuring food and fiber security in an ever-changing
    agricultural landscape.

  description: The agricultural sector plays an important role in contributing significantly
    to the gross domestic product (GDP) growth in developing countries. On the other
    hand, agriculture is widely affected by major factors such as environmental changes,
    natural disasters, pesticide control, and soil and irrigation-related issues,
    which reduce crop yield. The convergence of Industry 4.0 and agriculture offers
    an opportunity to move into the next generation of Agriculture 4.0. The internet
    of things (IoT), remote sensing, machine learning, deep learning, big data, cloud
    computing, thermal imaging, end-user apps and unmanned aerial vehicles offer a
    full-stack solution. IoT provides the ubiquitous connectivity of smart devices
    to the internet to collect, process and analyse a large amount of agriculture
    field data more quickly and synthesize them to make smart decisions using various
    machine learning and deep learning algorithms. This study reviews the challenges
    and major issues in the IoT agriculture domain and explores its emergence with
    new technologies. It covers the existing literature and illustrates how IoT applicationbased
    precision agriculture solutions have contributed. A case study on weed detection
    for smart agriculture using the YOLOv5 model is presented, achieving high accuracy.
    Finally, various IoT agriculture use cases are discussed, along with current research
    issues and possible solutions for future IoT-based agriculture advancement.

    10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3344038 Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Service provisioning
    is still on the rise in today’s information systems as we are heading for a world
    of massively integrated services and the so-called service ecosystem. Service
    provisioning is of paramount importance in various business domains such as precision
    agriculture, supply chain management, and smart tourism [1]. For instance, with
    the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), agricultural practitioners and data
    engineers expect to benefit from real-time data provisioning for the sake of advanced
    analytics. A customer who wishes to use a data service would choose between offerings
    that provide the same data packages (e.g., the pH of water and humidity) but at
    different service levels. Similarly, a tourist might consider multiple tour offerings
    and pick the most favorable in terms of service levels. Once the service offerings
    that are made available in such a service ecosystem exceed a critical number,
    we expect a novel service registry and lookup mechanism.1 Distinguishing functionally
    similar services by their quality is vital for effectively browsing through a
    large number of service offerings to finally make a decision [2]. Once the customer
    has picked an offering, she enters a service contract with the provider. The service
    level at which this service contract comes into effect, hence called the service-level
    agreement (SLA), captures the mutual agreements between the customer and the service
    provider. Recordings of these service levels over time, if securely stored using
    a mutually trusted mechanism, would suggest how reputable a provider has been
    of late. To this end, search results viewed by the customer should be sorted by
    the reputation of the service providers before being further customized to match
    the customer’s preference. The concept of SLA has been investigated to a great
    extent in service-oriented cloud computing and telecommunications. SLA research
    falls into the following directions [3], [4]: describing (i.e., formally representing
    the SLAs taking into account penalty rules) such as iAgree,2 monitoring (keeping
    track of whether an SLA is respected during the execution of services), negotiation
    (mutually adapting an SLA while executing services to avoid a contract violation),
    and enforcement (executing the rule-based clauses stated in an SLA). Compared
    to research on the monitoring and negotiation of SLAs, there has been less intensive
    research on enforcement of SLAs so far. Recently, due to the emerging utilization
    of blockchains in business, the line of research on the enforcement of SLAs has
    gained traction in the service engineering community. Immediately after its introduction
    with the cryptocurrency Bitcoin [5] in 2009, blockchain technology has received
    massive, steady attention as a highly potential technology capable of disrupting
    established systems in various domains by overcoming their over-centralized institutional
    and technological architectures. Facilitated by this decentralization narrative,
    blockchain technology has been widely researched and has become productive in
    a wide range of successful ICT architectures– beyond and often independent of
    its original utilization in cryptocurrencies [6], [7]. As described by NIST (National
    Institute of Standards and Technology), “Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper
    resistant digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion [...]” [8]. In
    this sense, blockchains has been described as a highly promising technology for
    utilization in organizations [9] as well as between organizations [10], and beyond,
    at the level of governments and societies 7], [11. Currently, the blockchain mainstream
    transcends the blockchain vision into the vision of the so-called Web3.3 The Web3
    vision shows all the ingredients of the blockchain vision and its many initiatives
    that are centered around a notion of decentralization of payments, financial services,
    digital identities, data and business models [13], [14], [15]. However, Web3 steps
    further and aims at taking blockchain decentralization to a next level by making
    it ubiquitous, turning it into a universal ecosystem. As such, it has been perceived
    and described recently by leading analysts such as Gartner [16], Forrester [17],
    Forbes Technology Council [18] and Harvard Business Review [19], [20], [21]. Our
    research in this realm has resulted in a novel definition of dynamic SLAs that
    incorporate human-in-the-loop penalty rules and measures the percentages of how
    often a provider s to the rules stated in an SLA. Eventually, our investigations
    led to the idea of realizing and enforcing dynamic SLAs on the basis of a private
    blockchain, which we call penalty-aware SLAs in this paper. In case the provider
    fails to fulfill a penalty despite having tried all available alternatives, this
    enforcement mechanism records a breach of contract in an underlying ledger, and
    thus recalculates the provider’s rule-abiding rate. In our previous studies, we
    advocated for penalty-aware SLAs in the tourism sector [22], we investigated how
    digitizing dynamic SLAs makes the enforcement of the penalty rules programmable
    [23], we conceptualized the SLAs for data service provisioning in smart farming
    [24]. This article reports on our full-fledged work on the conception, construction,
    and validation of such a cross-domain platform for SLA-minded service lookup called
    PenChain. Service-oriented computing and service provisioning are crosscutting
    concepts with highest relevance for all business domains [25], [26], [27], and,
    wherever services are provided, proper SLAs are a critical success factor. Similarly,
    in the last decade, blockchain technology has been successfully applied in countless
    projects from all kinds of domains, ranging from payment services [14], [28] over
    financial services [29], [30], insurances [31], [32], real estate [33], [34],
    manufacturing [35], [36], [37], agriculture [24], [38], [39], food production
    [40], [41], logistics [42], [43], healthcare [44], [45], tourism [22], [46], to
    e-government [7], [11], [47], [48], public administration [49], [50], [51], and
    e-court [52], [53], [54]– just to name a few. Therefore, we argue that PenChain
    is relevant to a maximally wide range of domains. Similarly, as the design of
    PenChain does not rely on any domain-specific characteristics, it is not restricted
    to any specific kind of domain. Indeed, we see PenChain applicability in, e.g.,
    all of the above-mentioned domains. The contribution of our work is threefold.
    First, we provide formality for dynamic penalty-aware SLAs and devise a ranking
    algorithm that sorts service offerings according to the reputation of their service
    providers and the customers’ preference. Second, we propose a distributed application
    architecture oriented towards Web3 that enforces penalty-aware SLAs and objectively
    calculates the reputation of service providers.4 Third, we conduct two scenario-based
    evaluations of PenChain discussing its use in the case of high-precision agriculture
    and in the case of automotive manufacturing industry. The enforcement mechanism
    devised in PenChain proves to be useful for programmatically enforcing the penalty-aware
    SLAs in the presented use cases provided that the underlying private blockchain
    comes with a matched capability and the penalty rules are articulable. The paper
    roadmap proceeds as follows. Section II is dedicated to preliminary and related
    work. In Section III, we formulate our research questions. In Section IV, we propose
    our general framework for enforcing penalty-aware SLAs. In Section V, we provide
    a scenario-based evaluation of PenChain as a solution for high-precision agriculture.
    The scenario offers an in-depth engineering analysis of PenChain for the provisioning
    of IoT data services. Furthermore, as part of this scenario, we explore some architecture
    characteristics of PenChain. In Section VI, we provide a scenario-based evaluation
    of PenChain as a solution for automobile manufacturing. In Section VII, we delve
    into the potential future directions of our study. We finish the paper with a
    conclusion in Section VIII. SECTION II. State-of-the-Art Advancements In this
    section, we summarize the scholarly work on SLA-enabled service management and
    its enabling technologies (blockchains, Web3). A. Service-level agreements SLA-related
    research has been studied extensively in fields such as engineering, economics,
    management science, and psychology. These articles can be categorized into the
    following four groups. SLA definition. SLA is a set of promises, guarantees, and
    obligations that the service provider makes to the client [57]. SLA provides details
    not just on service standards but also on any agreed-upon remedies, penalties,
    or level requirements. Many attempts have been made to explain SLAs, but most
    of them have focused on online services and cloud computing. The online service-level
    agreement, also known as the WSLA, was first presented by IBM research as a framework
    for generating and monitoring SLAs. [58]. Research on this definition of SLA is
    more diversified in many different domains [59]. Real-time SLA monitoring. The
    practice of ensuring that service level agreements are met is known as SLA monitoring.
    It might be performed by a third party or by IT staff. Moreover, SLA monitoring
    is a radical resolution strategy in situations of SLA breaches and key commercial
    issues for the services industry [60]. For instance, Labidi [61] described a semantic
    SLA modeling and monitoring technique for cloud computing. Several theories have
    been proposed for IoT [62], [63], some focusing on blockchains [64], [65]. SLA
    negotiation. SLA negotiation is the process of negotiating the level of quality
    and service that is acceptable to both parties. It is often used in the context
    of information technology and software development. Some studies have focused
    on the subject of SLA negotiation, highlighting the responsibilities and problems
    involved, and proposing frameworks for resolving the issue with cutting-edge technology
    [66], [67], [68]. SLA enforcement. Research in this area aims to improve SLA management
    by creating, monitoring, and encouraging users to report service faults. For example,
    the work conducted by Nakashima [69] leverages Ethereum to propose a collection
    of Web APIs that automate SLA lifecycle enforcement on a blockchain. Furthermore,
    Zhou et al. [70] proposed a witness approach to the enforcement of SLAs using
    smart contracts. In the domain of IoT services, Alzubaidi [71] proposed a blockchain-based
    decentralized approach to assess SLA compliance and enforce consequences within
    cloud-based Internet of Things applications. SLAM [72] is a self-contained, autonomous
    and trusted framework for continuous SLA monitoring in a multi-cloud environment
    that is blockchain-based and employs smart contracts to discover SLA breaches.
    For this purpose, Abhishek et al. [73] presented a blockchain-based system that
    ensures the integrity of client logs and verifies SLA breaches, resulting in a
    reliable ecosystem. Neidhardt [74] introduced a blockchain-based monitoring mechanism
    to ensure customer trust in services. Blockchain technology would help monitor
    SLAs and improve service trust in cloud computing [57], [75], [76]. Similar solutions
    may be found in fog computing [77], edge computing [78], and 5G, 6G networks [79],
    [80]. Viewing the blockchain as a trusted ledger that records all service attributes,
    a blockchain-based service recommendation system [81] and an auditing solution
    to protect 5G consumer data [82] are prominent. Smart contracts are increasingly
    being used to build autonomous applications [83], [84]. In [85], the public Ethereum
    blockchain platform is recommended for SLA monitoring and penalty enforcement.
    Such a framework has been proposed in [86] to monitor SLA terms and compensation
    in an automatic and decentralized manner using smart contracts and blockchain
    technologies. They have recommended that compensation should be set up either
    through basic notifications or automatically through a web application. Singh
    and Lee [87], [88] provided an approach to a blockchain cloud based on SLA specifications.
    It provided a more in-depth overview of the construction of smart contracts geared
    toward SLA. Uriarte et al. [89] presented a distributed SLA management using smart
    contracts and blockchain technology. The aforementioned research has a common
    goal: building more open and egalitarian systems for customers and providers.
    While the studies we surveyed mostly examine SLAs in cloud computing SLAs over
    specific parameters, we investigate if a real-life SLA incorporates not only technically
    measurable indicators but also penalty rules that are contractually articulated
    to protect the service consumers’ rights in many sectors. We follow the recently
    emerging trend that we make the case in this subsection. More specifically, we
    utilize distributed ledger technology to determine the reputation of service providers
    and whether or not a provider is responsible for indemnification. B. Blockchain
    Key Characteristics NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) characterizes
    blockchain technology as follows: “Blockchains are tamper evident and tamper resistant
    digital ledgers implemented in a distributed fashion (i.e., without a central
    repository) and usually without a central authority (i.e., a bank, company or
    government). At their basic level, they enable a community of users to record
    transactions in a shared ledger within that community, so that, under normal operation
    of the blockchain network, no transaction can be changed once published.” [8].
    The NIST description is in accordance with the mainstream perception, where de-centralization
    is a key ingredient of the blockchain technology approach. However, when we aim
    to have a more systematic understanding of decentralization versus centralization,
    a more sophisticated approach is needed that also takes into account the differences
    between various technology objectives as well as levels of centralization– see
    Table 1. This is important, as decentralization at the level of institutions and
    decentralization at the level of technology are, in general, incommensurable;
    rather, they work together to achieve concrete technology objectives. TABLE 1
    Landscape of Various Technology Objectives; in Regards to the Main Subjects of
    Decentralization, Supporting Blockchain Technology Concepts, and Supporting Concepts
    of Established Technology Disintermediation aims at removing intermediaries “such
    as banks and notaries” [90] in service of lowering transaction costs [91] in the
    sense of transaction cost economics [92], [93], [94]. Therefore, disintermediation
    is about re-shaping institutions as part of “complex technological systems” [94]
    and even re-shaping the institutional stack of the whole society [95]. Disintermediation
    is the key ingredient of the blockchain vision [13] and, subsequently, the Web3
    vision [13]. Blockchains are seen as game changers here, i.e., as key enablers
    of disintermediation by providing new trust anchors. The old trust anchors (companies,
    authorities) are replaced by utilizing consensus protocols in peer-to-peer networks.
    As such, blockchain technology re-combines concepts and algorithms from the fields
    of peer-to-peer [96] networks and cryptography [97], [98]. Fault tolerance (here:
    tolerance against failure of hardware/software/network infrastructure) and attack
    tolerance (tolerance against malicious players) need to be achieved by decentralization
    at the level of technology, i.e., by means of distributed computing [96]. With
    blockchain technology, both fault tolerance and attack tolerance are subsumed
    under Byzantine Fault Tolerance [99], [100], and are addressed by consensus protocols;
    whereas, with established technology, fault tolerance is addressed by high-availability
    clusters [101], [102], [103] and attack tolerance is addressed by cybersecurity
    technology products such as firewalls [104], [105] and VPNs (Virtual Privacy Networks)
    [105], [106]. High performance is achieved by parallelization. In the context
    of databases, parallelization (which is a form of technological decentralization)
    is investigated under the label of sharding, both in blockchains [14], [107],
    [108] and established database technology.5, 6, 7, 8 In blockchains, timestamping
    is a critical technical feature needed in distributed consensus protocols [109].
    Timestamping has its own right from the perspective of business logic, which is
    usually referred to as document timestamping. Document timestamping does not necessarily
    need to rely on disintermediation. For example, the blockchain of KSI (Keyless
    Signature Infrastructure) [110], [111] can be run centrally by a central service
    provider; still, the KSI blockchain utilizes decentralization at the level of
    technology to address fault tolerance and high performance [112]. The established
    (decentralized) base technology for implementing timestamping is public key infrastructure
    (PKI) [113]. Within a single organization, timestamping can be achieved by (centralized)
    database journaling [114], [115]. C. Blockchain-Enabled Platforms for Data Exchange
    and Service Provisioning IoT redefines existing protocols to establish a more
    connected network of devices, allowing data to be readily collected and exchanged
    even when there is no formal human-to-human or human-computer contact. That is
    why IoT data has a huge potential for software firms and will expand even more
    when blockchain technology is used. Liu et al. [116] asserted that blockchains
    could provide high-quality and secure data sharing for industrial IoT applications.
    In parallel, many studies are being conducted on blockchain platforms to address
    data management and integrity concerns brought about by IoTs in various industries
    [117]. Furthermore, the blockchain was connected to edge computing servers to
    improve data quality and securely handle the compute-intensive activities demanded
    by IoT devices [118]. Ardagna et al. [119] presented a reliable data collection
    method based on blockchain technology and smart contracts. It attempts to filter
    out any untrusted data based on trust criteria. Moreover, this method would evaluate
    the state of IoT devices and the gathered data. Blockchain-based IoT solutions
    are ideal for streamlining company automation, achieving substantial cost savings,
    and improving user experience [120]. Using blockchain technology and SDN, Hameed
    et al. [121] proposed a scalable method for the IoT device key and trust management.
    Simulation demonstrates that this combination can store the public keys of IoT
    devices on the blockchain and efficiently route network traffic using SDN. Similarly,
    Siddiqui et al. [122] observed that with the assistance of AI, adaptive resource
    management frameworks for IoT networks would be developed, including blockchain-based
    SDN frameworks. Distributed ledger technology has emerged as an enabler of accountability
    and transparency in cloud computing [123] and network service [124]. Expanding
    on the application of blockchain technology, Singh et al. [125] delved into its
    potential to improve the transparency and security of electronic health records.
    This exploration of blockchain’s capabilities aligns with the broader efforts
    in various industries, such as IoT and healthcare, to address data management
    and integrity concerns. Recent years have witnessed a growing research interest
    in the use of blockchains in monitoring the service provisioning and enforcing
    the SLAs of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). Most significantly, the selection
    of the best-fit UAVs in terms of reputation and operational costs is governed
    using blockchain technology and machine learning [126]. D. Web3 According to the
    current most standard explanation, the web has emerged in stages of Web 1.0 and
    Web 2.0 and is currently to be transformed into Web 3.0 [12]. In parallel, the
    vision of Web3 [16] is currently widely discussed by major technology analysts
    such as Gartner [16], Forrester [17] and Forbes Technology Council [18] as well
    as the Harvard Business Review [19], [20], [21]. Web3 needs to be carefully distinguished
    from the standard Web 3.0 vision9– although the objectives of Web3 and Web 3.0
    share some commonalities. According to the (rather minimal) standard explanation,
    the web started as a static web, named Web 1.0, which was about organizations
    sharing their content. Next, Web 2.0 was about enabling individuals to share their
    content. Practically, this can be connected to the emergence of social media platforms.
    Additionally, Web 3.0 [12], also coined the Semantic Web [127], is about turning
    the web into a web of knowledge. This means that knowledge presentation is standardized
    so that it becomes automatically processable. Consequentially, Web 3.0 is typically
    identified with the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) standards RDF (Resource Description
    Framework)10 and OWL (Web Ontology Language).11 Albeit this standard explanation
    reflects some of the most important aspects of the history of the Web, it does
    not adequately grasp some other crucial, more complex evolvements. In particular,
    a major stage of the Web, which is not reflected in the standard explanation,
    was the introduction of e-commerce. Technologically, this was enacted by the introduction
    of SSL (Secure Socket Layer), which was the necessary precondition to enable payments
    on the Internet [128]. Then e-commerce was also the driver of web technologies
    for data exchange and service computing [129]. Furthermore, Web 2.0 needs a closer
    look. The vision was about enabling individuals to create content on the Web,
    however, originally in the vein of the peer-to-peer (“distributed”) mentality
    of the early days of the web. What we have actually seen, however, is the emergence
    of tech giants (Big Tech) getting into control over the individuals’ data– it
    was exactly this development that has led [130], [131] to propose the web decentralization
    project Solid (Social Linked Data) [132], [133]. The Web3 vision takes blockchain
    disintermediation to the next level by making it ubiquitous, encompassing not
    only payments and financial services but also digital identities, data, and business
    models [15]. [20] have characterized the Web3 as “a decentralized, blockchain-based
    internet ecosystem owned and operated by its users” and their expectations are
    high towards Web3 being “our chance to make a better internet” [20]. We summarize
    a series of most significant Web3 characteristics as present in the current discourse
    by comparing each of them briefly with the current situation of Web 2.0 [14],
    [15]: Web3 Payments. In the current web, payments are online bank transfers between
    accounts that are hosted by commercial banks. There exist “digital payments in
    existing currencies– through Paypal and other guillemetright e-money guillemetleft
    providers such as Alipay in China or M-Pesa in Kenya” [134], however, these digital
    payments still rely on bank transfers in the backend. In regards to today’s tiered
    monetary system, payments are therefore done with M1-money– due to the necessary
    involvement of commercial banks [135]. Instead, in Web3, cryptocurrencies enable
    direct payments between web users, i.e., payments without intermediaries. The
    genuine Web3 currencies are neither owned by a central bank nor collateralized
    commercial bank money, i.e., they do not belong to the established monetary system
    and, therefore, cannot be classified as being M0- or M1-money. Note that the central
    bank digital currency [136] is usually not considered part of the Web3 vision.
    Financial Services. Currently, financial services are not considered a part of
    the web, even though they are made accessible through web-based e-commerce services.
    Instead, the Web3 vision relies on built-in DeFi [137], [138], [139]. Here, financial
    services are considered an integral part of Web3– disrupting both established
    commercial banking and investment banking. Identity. In the current web, online
    identities are created and linked to real-world identities through legally trusted
    entities, which rely on established routines of personal identity proofing [140].
    These online identities rely on public key infrastructures (KPIs) or cloud-based
    identity solutions, each of them with a different level of technological and organizational
    maturity [141]. Authorities and companies serve as trust anchors in the creation
    of online identities. The Web3 stands for a paradigm shift and strives for self-sovereign
    identity [142], [143]– consequentially extending the tradition of the peer-to-peer
    community [96]. Consensus protocols are seen to replace traditional trust anchors,
    and again disintermediation is seen as the crucial notion. Data Ownership. In
    the current Web, data is owned and utilized by companies. Instead, in the Web3
    vision, data is owned and utilized by the users [20], [144]. Business Models.
    From the perspective of Web3, the current web is dominated by Silicon Valley tech
    giants such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. Business models center around super-scaling
    e-commerce and social media/networks that commercialize the data of their customers.
    The Web3 envisions new business models [145] that are (i) based on new forms of
    organization such as the decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) [146] and/or
    (ii) rely on the utilization of genuine Web3 currencies (cryptocurrencies) or
    other Web3 assets such as NFTs (non-fungible tokens) [147], [148], [149]. Genuine
    DeFi business models (decentralized payment services, decentralized fundraising,
    decentralized contracting) are particularly important [138] for the Web3 vision.
    The vision of ubiquitous integration of emerging technology has become widely
    known as the Internet of Things (IoT)– the Web3 vision can be characterized as
    the Web of Everything, and even more, the Web of Everything and Everybody, since
    the idea of being “owned and operated by its users” [20] can be considered the
    key ingredient of Web3. SECTION III. Research Questions In service computing,
    SLA description languages have gained a lot of research attention. Due to the
    lack of technological support, executing an SLA that has been agreed upon by the
    provider and its consumers without human intervention remains one of the most
    challenging questions. Before we entered the digital transformation era, the mainstream
    thought on the subject was to introduce a regulatory entity whose main job is
    to monitor and referee service provisioning. This agent12 keeps an eye on all
    service transactions and, in case of dispute, might invoke a pre-programmed unit
    to kick off a negotiation workflow to avoid a breach of contract. As distributed
    ledger technologies continue to advance at a rapid pace, enforcing the SLAs has
    now become a technologically supported research attempt. However, before reaching
    this point, we will have to address a few research questions in the following.
    Let us elaborate on these research questions in Subsections III-A, III-B, and
    III-C. RQ1: The penalties specified in a dynamic SLA dictate what the provider
    and its customers should do in the event of a dispute. To make these rules computer-interpretable,
    in what ground logic or formal languages shall we express them? RQ2: How to digitize
    penalty-aware SLAs to enable an enforcement mechanism and the computation of an
    objective unbiased reputation in service provisioning? RQ3: How to gear up a distributed
    ledger to enforce relevant penalty rules during a service transaction? A. In What
    Ground Logic or Representational Technique Would the Penalty Rules be Expressed?
    (RQ1) Handling penalty rules becomes increasingly important in service operations,
    as evidenced by a great amount of scholarly work on rule-based modeling and monitoring
    [150], [151], [152], [153], [154]. We head for dynamic SLAs (which incorporate
    human-mediated factors such as the penalty) as opposed to static ones (which mainly
    describe uptime/downtime and availability constraints). Although a penalty rule
    is in place to primarily protect service customers, it should give the provider
    multiple chances to repair any spontaneous SLA violation during a service transaction.
    Should the provider run out of opportunities to take action to fix such a violation,
    a breach of contract is finally recorded to report that the customer’s expectation
    was not met? In other words, the penalty rule, being triggered by a spontaneous
    SLA violation, dictates a path for both the customer and the provider to follow
    through with the goal of fixing the said violation and eventually discarding it.
    We were in search of a ground logic or a formal language expressible enough to
    represent a penalty rule that articulates cascaded reparation actions. B. How
    to Digitize the Penalty-Aware SLAs to Enable an Enforcement Mechanism and the
    Computation of an Objective Unbiased Reputation in Service Provisioning? (RQ2)
    The dependability of a service system or an ecosystem of services is in part linked
    to how we control the SLAs. We argue that, unlike many present-day intermediary
    websites that rely on subjective customer feedback, the next-generation service
    ecosystem should employ a novel technique for objectively calculating the service
    providers’ ratings using logs of computerized SLAs. Digitizing penalty-aware SLAs
    is non-trivial for the following reasons: (a) Suppose we have found an appropriate
    logic for the representation of the penalty rules, we are still in need of a computer
    in the loop to fire the reparation actions articulated in these rules without
    human intervention; (b) Digital evidence of service provisioning (e.g., breach
    of contract, service quality not met, missing items) involving multiple parties
    has to be collected from heterogeneous computing devices13 and must be recorded
    safely in an integrity-assured database. C. How to Gear up a Distributed Ledger
    for Enforcing the Penalty Rules? (RQ3) The enforcement of SLA-bound penalty rules
    shall not be (a) tampered with by any involved parties; or (b) operated by humans
    despite the possible involvement of anthropomorphic entities. With distributed
    ledger technologies now on the rise, we expect to use blockchain’s smart contracts
    and ledger capabilities as technological leverage to execute such human-in-the-loop
    penalty rules. A smart contract is essentially a program stored on a blockchain
    and executed automatically when certain conditions are met. Technically speaking,
    we need to translate the logic of these human-in-the-loop penalty rules into the
    computer-in-the-loop program code of one or more smart contracts. SECTION IV.
    The PenChain Framework In this section, we first describe the top-level components
    of PenChain (Subsection IV-A), which is complemented by Subsection IV-E looking
    under the hood. In the next subsections IV-B, IV-C, and IV-D, we lay the groundwork
    for the representation of SLAs, how to combine them for the sake of service bundling,
    and how to rank service offerings by their SLA. The algorithms are presented in
    Subsection IV-F. In Subsection IV-G, we showcase the chief function of PenChain.
    A. Overall Architecture As illustrated in Figure 1, we proceed by defining the
    top-level components of PenChain together with those on the provider’s side and
    the customer’s side. The nodes of Customer-Node, Provider-Node, and PenChain-Main
    each represent a cloud or a computing server. Customer-Node refers to a node that
    hosts the user interface (Browser) through which customers request a service registered
    in PenChain. Provider-Node hosts Browser and another component that facilitates
    service provision (Providing Services). As a customer in PenChain might one day
    become a provider following the rationale of Web3, Provider-Node should be backward
    compatible with Customer-Node. FIGURE 1. The component view of PenChain’s system
    architecture. Show All PenChain-Main is the node that hosts the following components
    of PenChain: service discovery, service log, SLA enforcement, and quality assessment.
    The component of System Log, which captures the log of all service transactions,
    is connected to Service Registry and Service Façade via a ternary connector. The
    component of Assessment Unit sends an assessment of artifacts created during a
    service transaction to the underlying blockchain, hence a connector that links
    it to SLA AutoGovern Blockchain. This assessment is also sent to System Log for
    storing the transactional evidence of the service being consumed. Service Façade
    is the entry point for customers to search for individual service offerings or
    a service bundling. Service Registry facilitates the discovery of services and
    allows the query of their SLA. According to the principle of non-interference,
    as we demonstrate in Figure 1, service delivery actually occurs outside PenChain-Main.
    For instance, an accommodation service is an exchange act that takes place between
    a hotel and a group of tourists with the minimum intervention of PenChain. This
    concern is even more prevalent in the domain of data provisioning due to data
    privacy– data exchange takes place between the consumer and the provider without
    having PenChain-Main participative involved. Though Assessment Unit in our architecture
    records transactional evidence by invoking components Logging (to write in a cloud
    database) and Quality Assessment (to obtain an assessment of the service outcome),
    it is nevertheless not participatively engaged in any service transaction mediated
    by PenChain. Within the SLA AutoGovern Blockchain structure, two pivotal components
    stand out: the Smart Contract for Penalty Rules and the Smart Contract for Reputation.
    The former autonomously enforces penalty regulations, while the latter systematically
    evaluates service providers’ adherence to SLA parameters. By judiciously incorporating
    smart contracts, this intricate structure signifies a pioneering step in penalty
    rule management and reputation assessment, reshaping SLA administration. B. Capturing
    Penalty Rules to Represent a Penalty-Aware SLA Our formal reasoning offered in
    this subsection is twofold: (a) the modeling of the penalty rules, which explicitly
    addresses research question RQ1; (b) the logic behind comparing the SLAs, which
    in part addresses research question RQ2. A penalty rule represents contractual
    obligations between service providers and consumers. Modeling these rules requires
    the use of a language designed for contract modeling that considers them as business
    contracts. Business contracts specify obligations, permissions, and prohibitions
    as mutual agreements between business parties [155], as well as the terms of the
    contract breach. In the context of our study, we are more interested in the ways
    in which the rules are formulated and the distribution of compensation. Deontic
    operators capture the contractual modality (i.e., obligations, permissions, and
    prohibitions) [156]. Governatori represents a contractual rule as r: A 1 , A 2
    … A n ⊢C where each A i is an antecedent of the rule and C is the consequent.
    Each A i and C may contain deontic operators. Specifically, the connective ⊛ can
    therefore be informally read as “failing which”. This means that the symbol ⊛
    can be used to represent a relationship between two compensations. It implies
    that if the first compensation is not fulfilled, the second compensation will
    be carried out. O hotel α⊛ O hotel σ mandates that a hotel be required to ensure
    that α is achieved. Failure to do so results in a violation, which the hotel can
    repair by supplying σ . Governatori offers additional formality to reason about
    the merging of contractual rules in his work. Example 1:Let us consider the situation
    where a tourist and her family decided to book a deluxe room at Jade Hotel for
    their summer vacation. A penalty rule in this accommodation service reads: “Jade
    hotel will provide a room with a balcony and a view of the sea. If the hotel cannot
    arrange a sea view room as promised, it shall arrange an alternative room with
    a luxurious interior design, or a king-size double bed. If this compensation option
    is unavailable, Jade Hotel will offer two adult members of the tourist family
    free access to the hotel’s spa during their stay. If neither of these compensations
    could be made, the tourist is entitled to a 50% discount on her accommodation
    at Jade Hotel upon checkout.”. We formally express this penalty rule as, r: ¬seaview⊢
    O hotel AltRoom ⊛ O hotel FreeSpa ⊛ O hotel DiscountWhenCheckout where the components
    are expressed in first-order logic as follows: seaview ≡∃ro∈Jade,t∈Tourist:booked(t,ro)∧BalconyWithSeaView(ro)
    AltRoom ≡∃ar∈Jade,t∈Tourist:(LuxuryInterior(ar)∨KingSizeDoubleBed(ar))∧CheckIn(t,ar)
    FreeSpa ≡∃spa∈Service,ar∈Jade,t∈Tourist:FreeAccess(ar,spa)∧CheckIn(t,ar) DiscountWhenCheckout
    ≡∃ro∈Jade,t∈Tourist,spa∈Service:booked(t,ro)∧CheckOut(t,ro)∧Discount50Percent
    Figure 2 elucidates the same penalty rule diagrammatically by representing all
    the aforementioned deontic components as pictograms. The diamond pictogram to
    the left of this diagram signifies the triggering condition of the penalty rule.
    The three rounded rectangles next to this diamond stand for compensation actions
    stated in the rule. A block arrow corresponds to either a compensated outcome
    or an uncompensated outcome. A thin arrow connecting two compensation actions
    implies a “failing which” connective, i.e., should the action at the start of
    an arrow fail, the action at its end shall be triggered. FIGURE 2. Diagrammatic
    equivalent of the deontic logic for the penalty rule publicized by Jade Hotel.
    Show All Transitioning to a distinct realm of study, we encounter the concept
    of a semiring, an algebraic structure characterized by two fundamental operations.
    A semiring can be thought of as being similar to a ring but without the requirement
    that the addition operation be commutative. The two operations in a semiring are
    called addition and multiplication. In other words, it is an algebraic structure
    that generalizes the properties of a ring and a semigroup [157]. Definition 1
    (Semiring):A semiring is a tuple ⟨A,⊕,⊗, 0 ¯ , 1 ¯ ⟩ where, A is a set and 0 ¯
    , 1 ¯ ∈A ; ⊕ , called the additive operation. It is a commutative, associative
    operation having 0 ¯ as its neutral element (i.e. a⊕ 0 ¯ =a= 0 ¯ ⊕a,∀a∈A ); ⊗
    , called the multiplicative operation. It is an associative operation such that
    1 ¯ is its identity element and 0 ¯ is its absorbing element (i.e. a⊗ 0 ¯ = 0
    ¯ = 0 ¯ ⊗a,∀a∈A ). Moreover, ⊗ distributes over ⊕ (i.e. ∀a,b,c∈A , we have a⊗(b⊕c)=a⊗b⊕a⊗c
    ). An idempotent semiring is a semiring whose additive operation is idempotent
    (i.e., a⊕a=a ). This idempotence property allows us to endow a semiring with a
    canonical order defined as a⪯b iff a⊕b=b . We specify the meaning of operators
    ⊕ and ⊗ for reasoning about services in Subsection IV-C. In our work, a set denoted
    A refers to the set of SLAs in a certain business domain. We consider A={⟨ x 1
    , x 2 .. x n ⟩} , where x i represents the i -th most important objective of an
    SLA. In particular, we make a case for the three SLA objectives defined below
    with the objective of penalty rules being understandably considered the foremost.
    We acknowledge that different customers might develop different views on the significance
    of these SLA objectives. In other words, SLA objectives should be flexibly sequenced
    rather than rigidly sequenced in what we call the customer-centric representation14
    of SLAs. Now, let us define the notions of satisfaction, rule-abiding rate, and
    cost in Definition 2, Definition 3, and Definition 4, respectively. Definition
    2 (Satisfaction):Informally, the satisfaction of a service perceived by end users
    is related to the reliability and empathy of this service [158]. For business
    services, the satisfaction is formally defined as the ratio of the number of successful
    service deliveries to the total number of service transactions. Definition 3 (Rule-Abiding
    Rate):A service is associated with several penalty rules, which are supposed to
    be respected at run-time. The rule-abiding rate (and the breach rate) of a penalty
    rule is defined as the ratio of the number of times the said rule is respected
    (unrespected) to the total number of times the said rule is activated. Formally,
    we have rule-abiding rate=1−breach rate . A rule-abiding rate of an SLA, or rule-abiding
    rate for short (denoted as r ), is defined as the minimum value of rule-abiding
    rates of all penalty rules involved. Definition 4 (Cost):Let C 0 ={ c 1 , c 2
    ,… c n } be the initial set of values of the cost incurred by services. By closure
    of C 0 , we mean the smallest set that contains all finite summations of elements
    in C 0 : C + 0 ={ ∑ ∞ k=1 ( c i 1 +…+ c i k )| c i k ∈ C 0 } . As such, the cost
    set is defined as C= C + 0 ∩[0,cos t max ] where cos t max is the highest cost
    the customer can pay. A cost (denoted as c ) is a payment for a service, which
    is an element of C . C. Aggregating Services The practice of aggregating services,
    colloquially known as service bundling, is exercised in various business domains.
    The central idea of service aggregation is to offer additional service offerings
    as packages at a more competitive price. To proceed with service bundling, for
    simplicity, let us assume that the SLAs of all the atomic services are denoted
    as a set of triples A={⟨r,s,c⟩} where rule-abiding is the most important objective,
    satisfaction: the second, and cost: the least. Now we aggregate the SLAs of the
    constituent services. Suppose that we have n services and consider the i -th service
    for which we write L i ={ ℓ ij |j=1,…, m i } where ℓ ij represents the j -th level
    of its multilevel SLA. Now, let us put α i ℓ ij to denote the j -th level of the
    i -th service’s multilevel SLA where i∈[1],[n] ; j∈[1, m i ] . This construct
    is in fact a triple ⟨r,s,c⟩∈R×S×C , where R,S,C are the sets of rule-abiding rates,
    satisfactions and costs, respectively. Definition 5:To represent the multilevel
    SLA of service aggregation, we consider a group of aggregated services as a subset
    of k services { so i |i∈I⊂[n],|I|=k } each of which comes with multilevel SLA
    as exemplified in Table 4. Out of this subset, the cartesian product of the multilevel
    SLAs of the aggregated services is represented by a 2-dimensional array of size
    ( ∏ i∈I m i )×k , where each element is a triple ⟨r,s,c⟩ . For each given row
    consisting of k SLAs in this array, we already know the fixed level ℓ i ∈ L i
    is defined. Hence we write ⟨ r i ℓ i , s i ℓ i , c i ℓ i ⟩ , i∈I , for the SLAs
    in this row. Then we define the combined SLA (denoted as Ω ), over these SLAs
    as follows: Ω= ⨀ i∈I⊂[n] α i ℓ i =⟨ min i r i ℓ i , min i s i ℓ i , ∑ i∈I c i
    ℓ i ⟩ (1) View Source Example 2:We request a group of services as subset {s o
    1 ,s o 4 ,s o 5 } (i.e. k=3 ) and I={1,4,5} . Suppose that we have L 1 ={ ℓ 11
    :Intermediate, ℓ 12 :Advanced} , L 4 ={ ℓ 41 :Basic} and L 5 ={ ℓ 51 :Intermediate,
    ℓ 52 :Advanced} . Of this subset, the Cartesian product of this set is represented
    by a two-dimensional array of size ( ∏ i∈I m i )×3 as follows, ⟨ r 1 ℓ 11 , s
    1 ℓ 11 , c 1 ℓ 11 ⟩ ⟨ r 1 ℓ 11 , s 1 ℓ 11 , c 1 ℓ 11 ⟩ ⟨ r 1 ℓ 12 , s 1 ℓ 12 ,
    c 1 ℓ 12 ⟩ ⟨ r 1 ℓ 12 , s 1 ℓ 12 , c 1 ℓ 12 ⟩ ⟨ r 4 ℓ 41 , s 4 ℓ 41 , c 4 ℓ 41
    ⟩ ⟨ r 4 ℓ 41 , s 4 ℓ 41 , c 4 ℓ 41 ⟩ ⟨ r 4 ℓ 41 , s 4 ℓ 41 , c 4 ℓ 41 ⟩ ⟨ r 4
    ℓ 41 , s 4 ℓ 41 , c 4 ℓ 41 ⟩ ⟨ r 5 ℓ 51 , s 5 ℓ 51 , c 5 ℓ 51 ⟩ ⟨ r 5 ℓ 52 , s
    5 ℓ 52 , c 5 ℓ 52 ⟩ ⟨ r 5 ℓ 51 , s 5 ℓ 51 , c 5 ℓ 51 ⟩ ⟨ r 5 ℓ 52 , s 5 ℓ 52 ,
    c 5 ℓ 52 ⟩ For each given row consisting of three SLAs, since we already know
    the fixed level, we, therefore, have < r i ℓ i , s i ℓ i , c i ℓ i > , i∈I . Hence,
    we rewrite the first row as, ⟨ r 1 ℓ 1 , s 1 ℓ 1 , c 1 ℓ 1 ⟩ ⟨ r 4 ℓ 4 , s 4 ℓ
    4 , c 4 ℓ 4 ⟩ ⟨ r 5 ℓ 5 , s 5 ℓ 5 , c 5 ℓ 5 ⟩ In this row, we apply Formula 1
    to determine the combined SLA and label it Ω q , where q serves as row indices.
    Ω 1 =⟨min{ r 1 ℓ 1 , r 4 ℓ 4 , r 5 ℓ 5 },min{ s 1 ℓ 1 , s 4 ℓ 4 , s 5 ℓ 5 },(
    c 1 ℓ 1 + c 4 ℓ 4 + c 5 ℓ 5 )⟩ =⟨min{93%,94%,94%}, min{94%,95%,98%},($5+$10+$20)⟩
    =⟨93%,94%,$35⟩ View Source We repeat this task for each remaining row in the two-dimensional
    array above. As a result, Table 2 presents the combined SLAs for the following
    service aggregation s o 1 (Intermediate), s o 4 (Basic), s o 5 (Intermediate)
    into Ω 1 ; s o 1 (Intermediate), s o 4 (Basic), s o 5 (Advanced) into Ω 2 ; s
    o 1 (Advanced), s o 4 (Basic), s o 5 (Intermediate) into Ω 3 ; s o 1 (Advanced),
    s o 4 (Basic), s o 5 (Advanced) into Ω 4 . TABLE 2 Service Aggregation Involves
    Compiling the SLAs of the Constituent Services D. Search Results Ranking The set
    of SLAs for a particular business domain is referred to as A in this work. We
    write A={⟨ x 1 , x 2 .. x n ⟩} where x i represents the i -th most important objective
    of an SLA. Again, for the sake of simplicity, let us denote the set of SLAs as
    A={⟨r,s,c⟩} where r : rule-abiding rate, s : satisfaction, c : cost. In particular,
    we argue in favor of the three SLA objectives specified in the following, with
    the objective of penalty rules being the one that is, naturally, seen as the most
    important. We understand that the importance of these SLA objectives may be interpreted
    differently by specific clients at different times. The SLA objectives should
    not be rigorously sequenced and should have some degree of flexibility in the
    order in which they are presented in the customer-centric depiction of SLAs. We
    recall that PenChain facilitates service aggregation, allowing atomic service
    offerings to be bundled to enrich the service offerings on offer. They will be
    mixed up in a search result, necessitating a polymorphic ranking procedure that
    sorts them by the SLA regardless if they are atomic, bundled or an aggregation
    of aggregated services. More precisely, we are in search of an effective comparison
    technique that works uniformly for all SLAs denoted as triples ⟨r,s,c⟩ . To devise
    a comparison technique, we treat A as a totally ordered set. The total order on
    a set is a form of ordering the elements of the set, assuming that certain elements
    precede others, with the understanding that any two elements can be compared in
    one way or another. Formally, we have Ω i ≥ Ω j if ( r Ω i > r Ω j )or( r Ω i
    = r Ω j )∧( s Ω i > s Ω j )or( r Ω i = r Ω j )∧( s Ω i = s Ω j )∧( c Ω i ≤ c Ω
    j ) . In order to reason about the SLAs, we utilize the mathematical construct
    of semiring where the ⊕ operation is the max operation concerning this order.
    The ⊗ operator is a multiplication that acts differently on each component of
    an element in A . The ⊗ operator’s action on R , S is taking the minimum. The
    ⊗ operator’s action on C is ordinary addition. More precisely, let a=⟨ r 1 , s
    1 , c 1 ⟩ and b=⟨ r 2 , s 2 , c 2 ⟩ , then a⊗b is defined as follows. a⊗b:=⟨min{
    r 1 , r 2 },min{ s 1 , s 2 }, c 1 + c 2 ⟩ View Source Example 3:Table 3 shows
    an ordered list of aggregated services where Ω 3 ranks first and Ω 2 is the least
    preferred aggregation. The column to the right of this table prints the combined
    SLA of the listed aggregated services, explaining why they are ranked first, second,
    etc. as shown in the leftmost column. TABLE 3 Service Aggregations are Sorted
    by Their Combined SLA in the Same Way Service Offerings are E. Under the Hood
    of Penchain Figure 3 illustrates the inner workings of PenChain-Main – a node
    where the components of PenChain are deployed excluding computing from the provider
    and the customer sides (see Figure 1). We utilize the layered architecture style
    to describe how components could be developed and deployed in tandem with smart
    contracts that update the trusted ratings of the service providers and enforce
    the penalty rules in PenChain. They are organized into three layers, namely Business
    Layer, Persistence Layer, and Blockchain Layer. FIGURE 3. PenChain utilizes replaceable
    and loosely-coupled units for keeping track of the service transactions and enforcing
    the penalty-aware SLAs. They are conceptually organized into three layers. Show
    All 1) Business Layer The layer to the top of Figure 3 represents the business
    logic of PenChain. It is organized into four groups. Group 1 is made up of interconnected
    modules that interact directly with service providers and give some input to the
    other modules in subsequent layers to serialize the service transactions: Services,
    SLAs, and Penalty Rules. Group 2 (Aggregator and Ranking) assists the customers
    in locating a service offering or an aggregated service by computing the SLA parameters
    in accordance with Definition 5. The modules in this group send requests to the
    next layer (Persistence Layer) to perform data queries on the cloud database.
    The customer engagement is carried out by Group 3, which is comprised of the following
    modules: Search and Contract. In addition to allowing customers to view the contractual
    specifics of the service they are bound to, including its SLA, the Contract module
    makes any in-progress compensation attempt to fix a breach of contract, which
    could be activated by invoking Penalty-Aware SLAs. The key modules in Group 4
    invoke the next two layers to write down the service’s transactional evidence
    to both the cloud database and the blockchain. 2) Persistence Layer As the name
    suggests, the layer situated in the middle of Figure 3 helps serialize service
    transactions that were executed. General handles the transaction log of a service
    that is not highly confidential (e.g., location, timestamp, service participants
    who were engaged in the transaction, and the actual SLA that was associated with
    the service). Logs stores more sensitive information about the service (e.g.,
    quality experienced by the customers and whether it falls below or surpasses a
    critical threshold value). Both write the service’s transactional records they
    receive from Group 1 and Group 4 of Business Layer down to a cloud database (our
    pick here is Azure SQL Database). 3) Blockchain Layer The bottom layer depicted
    in Figure 3 is dedicated to the underlying distributed ledger and essential smart
    contracts of PenChain. It is designed to store immutable records as successive
    blocks, each representing a service transaction. Technically, we install a private
    blockchain using Hyperledger technologies on our cloud. We refer to Hyperledger’s
    storage capacity as DB-Blockchain, which is made of two separate data sources:
    an internal LevelDB15 and an external CouchDB.16 The former holds chaincode data
    as key-value pairs, while the latter facilitates sophisticated data queries in
    the chaincode. Logging in Business Layer submits the assessment of a service transaction
    and the corresponding hash in Azure SQL Database to Smart Contracts for Transactions
    in this layer through Blockchain API, activating Smart Contracts for SLAs in order
    to reassess the SLA’s satisfaction. Upon receiving this request, the module submits
    a compensation request to Penalty-aware SLAs via Penalty Enforcement API in Business
    Layer if the assessment falls short, indicating an instantaneous breach of contract.
    Now, the control is granted to the modules in Business Layer again. Acceptable
    indemnification criteria have been incorporated into Contract. In effect, Penalty-aware
    SLAs monitors the compensation workflow that has already been activated and sends
    a confirmation to Smart Contracts for SLAs to update the SLA’s rule-abiding rate.
    To illustrate that there are requests and confirmations that go back and forth
    between the involving modules, we put two 2-way block arrows to express this compensation
    workflow in Figure 3. 4) Programmatic Enforcement A smart contract, also known
    as a chaincode in Hyperledger, is a computer program that defines the rules and
    conditions for executing transactions. In this subsection, we walk through such
    a chaincode to illustrate why the enforcement of penalty-aware SLAs is attainable
    owing to blockchain’s smart contracts. In other words, we propose a programmatic
    enforcement of the SLAs. The chaincode is written rather straightforwardly in
    accordance with the general structure of the penalty rules expressed in deontic
    logic. Nevertheless, to fully implement a penalty rule, we programmatically rely
    on modules mounted on the provider’s server that are external to the blockchain.
    These modules, which are replaceable on the provider’s side, realize reparation
    actions of the penalty rule in question on behalf of the service provider whose
    rule is being fired. LISTING 1. This chaincode on Hyperledger Fabric implements
    a generic penalty rule, which might trigger human-in-the-loop actions via API
    calls. Show All Let us turn our attention to Example 1 again while walking through
    the chaincode given in Listing 1. We declare an entry-point function named callPenaltyRule,
    for which the arguments are wrapped in an array of strings called attributes.
    Let us recall that a typical penalty rule represented in deontic logic contains
    a series of antecedents and a consequent. To be able to programmatically enforce
    the said penalty rule, we first fetch the list of external APIs corresponding
    to these deontic components (at line 12 of Listing 1) and store them in an ordered
    array named apiList by invoking a user-defined function called getExternalAPIList.
    The code comments that span lines 8–10 exemplify what the array actually holds
    when running the chaincode to enforce the penalty rules described in Example 1.
    Note that the chaincode presented here is generic in the sense that it is programmed
    to trigger any compensation modules that have been readily deployed at the service
    provider involved in the contract (identified by ContractID). The function then
    attempts to submit a request to an API-mediated module17 in apiList (at line 16
    of Listing 1) until the compensation is confirmed. If an error occurs during the
    request owing to, for instance, technical failure or the service provider’s inability
    to compensate (for example, a situation where a hotel has no compensation options
    to make up for a tourist who checked in a non-oceanfront room). If no post requests
    are confirmed at all, which signifies that the penalty rule in question has not
    been adhered to, status still holds the boolean value of false after the loop
    is terminated. when they published their penalty rules. At line 26 of Listing
    1, function calRuleAbidingRate is utilized to recalculate the rule-abiding rates
    of the involved service provider (identified by ProviderID) to write down whether
    the penalty rule in question (identified by RuleID) has been respected or not
    (indicated by status). It is worth mentioning how the rule-abiding rate for an
    SLA is algorithmically calculated and updated down the ledgers. Upon the activation
    of a penalty rule, a dedicated smart contract in the underlying blockchain of
    PenChain immediately increments the total count of rule firings by one, regardless
    of the final outcome of this rule that is determined later on. As the penalty
    rule approaches its completion, if the involved customer remains uncompensated
    after having tried all compensation actions specified in the penalty rule, the
    same smart contract increments the count of SLA breaches associated with the respective
    service offering. Finally, a re-calculation of the rule-abiding rate is performed
    according to Definition 3. F. Ranking Algorithms We propose algorithms needed
    for ranking a set of service offerings, allowing the search result to be sorted
    in that best matches the customers’ preferences. Service offerings are mixed up
    in a search result– some of them might be of the same function but are offered
    by different providers. Moreover, an element in this list could be either an atomic
    service or a service aggregation. The proposed algorithms materialize our groundwork
    on the semiring presented in the previous subsections. The main idea is to devise
    Algorithm 2 as a comparator function that will be fed into a sorting function
    (Algorithm 1). Algorithm 1 Sorting a Search Result by the SLAs Taking Into Account
    the Customer’s Preference Show All Algorithm 2 Comparing a Pair of Service Offerings
    by Their SLAs Show All L serv in Algorithm 1 denotes a set of service offerings
    listed in a search result. We recall that the SLA objectives are flexibly sequenced
    according to the customer’s preference. L objective is an ordered list that determines
    the relative importance of constituent objectives in the SLA through the lens
    of the service customer. For example, if the rule-abiding rate matters most to
    a certain customer, the corresponding item is placed first on her L objective
    . This list needs to be re-sorted in descending order when PenChain records a
    substantial amount of additional view counts, suggesting that the service customer
    has re-prioritized the SLA constituent objectives in their mind. The algorithm
    is designed to work with an unlimited number of constituents, although in this
    work we assume that L objective is a list of three. The algorithm addresses two
    possibilities: a newly registered customer who has yet to interact with PenChain
    (e.g., to submit a search request, to view different service offerings listed
    in a search result) and a returned customer whose viewing history is kept track
    of her profile. Note that this algorithm treats all elements of L serv in the
    same way, regardless of whether they are atomic or aggregated. Algorithm 2 acts
    as a comparator function that determines whether a given service ( sl a 1 ) should
    be placed above or below another ( sl a 2 ) in a search result. The list represented
    by L objective is literally passed from Algorithm 1, telling which SLA objective
    is the foremost criterion, the second most important, and so on. To make this
    algorithm generic, in the main loop, we iterate through all elements of L objective
    , not necessarily confined to the three SLA objectives as we make the case in
    this paper. We assume that each objective is associated with an optimization operation,
    either maximization or minimization, advising us to retain the order (e.g., comparing
    the satisfaction) or reverse it (e.g., comparing the costs) when comparing. The
    loop continues down the list of L objective until we can figure out whether sl
    a 1 is preferred over sl a 2 or vice versa. This algorithm returns zero if it
    passes all the objectives in L objective without decisively determining the order
    between sl a 1 and sl a 2 , suggesting that these two services should be placed
    in the same position within the search result. G. Multi-Criteria Search In this
    subsection, we showcase an advanced search feature of PenChain that allows service
    consumers to search for and locate the right service offering. To enable this
    search feature, we make sure that the service offerings in PenChain are fully
    populated with details including the service location18 when the providers publish
    their offerings in the service registry. As illustrated in Figure 4, a text box
    with auto-complete in the right pane allows the geographical location of the service
    to be entered. Suggestions of the location in this text box are sourced from Bing
    Maps for the customer’s convenience. The search result is displayed live on the
    map in the left pane, with service offerings uniformly shown under the same teardrop-shaped
    icon but at various locations. Each of them comes with a tooltip that pops up
    when the customer clicks on it, revealing its name and further details of the
    service being represented. To give an example, on the map, there is a teardrop-shaped
    icon that is yellow in color representing a data service that provides periodic
    readings of the water’s pH level in a farming site. The customer may find other
    widgets in the tooltip useful for viewing the SLA-bound historical values of the
    service she is looking at, which is instrumental in improving the customer’s comprehension
    of the rating of its service provider. FIGURE 4. Service offerings in a search
    result are visually shown on Bing Maps, offering the service customer a spatial
    sense when examining them prior to a possible service binding. Show All An alternative
    user interface to our multi-criteria search is depicted in Figure 5. The search
    dialog here provides several text boxes that allow the customer to enter the service
    details: keywords, expected costs, and, of course, the service location. The search
    result is then shown in a tabular form further below in the figure, which is sorted
    according to the core ranking algorithms of PenChain (see Subsection IV-F). The
    text box where the customer enters the location of the service in Figure 5 is
    enhanced with auto-complete data fed from Bing Maps just like its counterpart
    in the search dialog of Figure 4. FIGURE 5. A tabular view of a search result
    that allows the service customer to comprehensively examine service offerings
    listed in a search result before choosing one of them. Show All The service customer
    may toggle the search mode at any time as she interacts with PenChain. In both
    modes, she should be able to pick a service offering from the search result to
    proceed further (e.g., adding it to a service shopping cart or checking out to
    enter a service binding contract). SECTION V. Scenario-Based Evaluation (i): Case
    of High-Precision Agriculture Data exchange as a service is a common saying in
    modern smart farming. For instance, HARA19 is a blockchain-based platform for
    data exchange in the food and agriculture sector. Agdatahub20 operates trusted
    platforms for secure data exchange. Centre for Data Sharing21 makes a prominent
    use case for data sharing in agriculture. In the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam,
    a community of research institutions, corporations, and agricultural extension
    organizations alike forge digital solutions to offset the effect of climate change
    on the aquatic environment. They need a service provisioning platform that allows
    both in-house and cloud-based IoT data providers to provision real-time farming
    datasets. Central to this platform is a multi-criteria search function that allows
    a location-based, schema-specific search request (e.g., looking for all service
    offerings that report on the pH levels of all farming sites located in a given
    province of Vietnam) to be submitted, for which the search result shall be sorted–
    the closer to the top of this search result a provider is placed, the higher reputation
    score it has from the requesting end-user’s perspective. As more and more data
    service offerings become available to these end-users, PenChain’s service registry
    and discovery would let them gain access to the right offerings that best match
    their intention. Penalty rules captured in the SLA of an IoT data service may
    state what compensation the customer is entitled to (e.g., a discount voucher,
    a data provisioning package for free), but should not be unreasonably one-sided.
    We proceed with the case as follows. In Subsection V-A, we describe the need to
    enforce the SLAs of data provisioning in smart shrimp farming. We analyze the
    imperfections of the supporting IoT sensor technology in Subsection V-B. In Subsection
    V-C, we present an uptake of IoT data services, where our goal is to demonstrate
    the relevance of our PenChain framework to the enforcement of penalty-aware SLAs
    in a specific business domain as a case study. Separately, in Subsection V-F and
    Subsection V-G, we discuss the scalability and the trustworthiness of PenChain,
    respectively. To make this Section as a whole self-contained, we explain the underpinning
    technologies and their interplay in Subsection V-D. A. Challenges of the Context
    The Lower Mekong River Basin in Vietnam has a unique physical terrain with interlaced
    ditches and canals. The region’s terrain is well suited for farming and fishing,
    making agriculture a significant part of its economy. This business sector comprises
    corporations, private shrimp farming families, and many other IoT players. In
    light of precision agriculture, the productivity of shrimp farming depends on
    water quality, fluctuation in water temperature, stability of dissolved oxygen,
    etc., necessitating the monitoring and automated regulation of these parameters.
    Unfortunately, data gathering is an error-prone and costly technical process,
    particularly when collecting datasets on the sparsely spread shrimp ponds in the
    region. With the ubiquity of the Internet of Things, agricultural professionals
    and data engineers expect to benefit from next-generation data provisioning and
    service engineering. B. Imperfection of the Available Technology As more and more
    data service offerings become available to end users, a novel approach to service
    registry and discovery should be in place to let them gain access to the right
    offerings that best match their intention. In PenChain for precision agriculture,
    we distinguish between a cloud-based IoT agency and an in-house IoT station, even
    though they all utilize sensors to collect data [24], [159]. The former operates
    its sensors over a relatively large area, while the latter usually has sensors
    installed in a rather small area (typically confined to its farming site). They
    both make real-time farming datasets readily obtainable for the end-users. To
    facilitate data delivery, the cloud-based IoT agency relies on a computing cloud
    to perform data conditioning and offer data analytics. The in-house IoT station
    is equipped with limited computational power and almost only transmits instantaneous
    readings without any fancy analytics tools. Regarding business goals, cloud-based
    IoT agencies provide farm data primarily to earn money. The in-house IoT data
    providers may use the data they collect for (a) gaining insight into, or at least
    monitoring their own farming activities; (b) making the datasets collected over
    their farming sites accessible to the end-users and other in-house providers at
    a significantly lower price compared to that of the datasets provided by the cloud-based
    IoT agencies. Introducing modern IoT facilities to agriculture would create a
    marketplace for data exchange and an ecosystem that fosters the collaboration
    between farmers, agricultural engineers, data experts, research institutes on
    precision agriculture, etc. PenChain could be tailored to this market following
    the so-called data-as-a-service models. C. The Proposed Solution In Table 4 we
    populate the data services offered in PenChain. Each service is uniquely identified
    by a label ( s o 1 , s o 2 , etc.) and is referred to by a short name. The service
    providers are anonymously denoted as P 1 cloud , P 2 in−house , P 3 in−house and
    P 4 cloud . To the right of Table 4, we describe the contractually formulated,
    multilevel commitments between these service providers and end users. We show
    no more than three levels for each of these service agreements to keep it simple.
    The basic, intermediate, and advanced levels are with a logical progression to
    monthly costs and data frequency. Geographically speaking, P 1 cloud is located
    in Giang Thanh, P 2 in−house in Kien Luong, P 3 in−house in Hon Dat, P 4 cloud
    in Ha Tien. These proper names refer to the rural districts of Kien Giang Province
    in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam. TABLE 4 PenChain Facilitates the Provisioning
    of IoT Data Services in the Mekong Delta The service providers P 2 in−house and
    P 3 in−house are farmers who deploy IoT sensors on their farms located in one
    of the above-mentioned rural districts. They invest in IoT-enabled equipment to
    monitor their crop and optimize their agricultural production. They rely on on-site
    sensors to provide live readings of pH and alkalinity in a localized area. Due
    to the lack of computing power and storage, their readings in the past might not
    be available for analytics. In contrast, the other two providers– denoted as P
    1 cloud and P 4 cloud , harness cloud computing to provide the end-users with
    enriched data (e.g., spatio-temporal extrapolation) about water temperature and
    water pollution over a relatively large farming site, which they do not own. Hi-tech
    agencies such as P 1 cloud and P 4 cloud obtain the appropriate permission from
    the farm owners to operate their IoT devices, networking infrastructure, and cloud
    servers in the field crops of farmers. Their business is to collect large datasets
    of agricultural production and disseminate them to earn money. As shown in Figure
    6, PenChain allows end-users to request data services offered by the aforementioned
    service providers. End-users in this scenario encompass DevOps developers, research
    organizations, and government agencies. They make use of the service offerings
    listed in Table 4 to compose service-oriented applications, for example, by combining
    services s o 1 and s o 2 . Thanks to PenChain, the research organizations can
    obtain agricultural data for scientific purposes by invoking, e.g., services s
    o 3 and s o 6 . Government agencies rely on numerous data packages obtained through
    services s o 4 and s o 5 to fine-tune the agricultural extension for fisheries
    development in the area. To give a sense of the ranking of the services, a research
    laboratory interested in pH readings would prefer s o 6 to s o 3 because the former
    comes with an agreement level that is favorable to the latter. FIGURE 6. An aggregator
    business model for data services in PenChain. Show All Over the months, the DevOps
    developers who compose a service-oriented application for water monitoring will
    ask for additional data services that are not listed in Table 6. One way to meet
    this demand is to aggregate functionally related data services (e.g., both s o
    1 and s o 2 provide data readings in the water) to provision more sophisticated
    data packages for a farming site (e.g., reporting on the water temperature and
    water conductivity of the same shrimp pond). Speaking of service-oriented programming,
    s o 1 and s o 2 together as a service aggregation would come in handy programmatically.
    The aggregate of s o 1 and s o 2 involves mixing their water-related data and
    results in their multilevel SLAs being compiled and rationalized. D. Underpinning
    Technologies In this subsection, we discuss our difficulties in adopting blockchain
    technologies and DevOps tools in enforcing any penalty-aware SLAs that are associated
    with data provisioning. To understand how PenChain facilitates data exchange in
    smart farming and guarantees that the agreements stated for data provisioning
    are followed through on, let us look under the hood. 1) Microsoft Azure We emulate
    the applications in use for both service providers and customers on Azure.22 This
    platform comes with a built-in monitoring capability for Web services, which we
    found useful for stress testing and deploying concurrent emulations. As for data
    handling, PenChain utilizes cloud-based relational database services provided
    by Azure SQL that perform relational queries, searching and data synchronization.
    2) Blockchain The permissionless mode of public blockchains (e.g. Ethereum) is
    at the expense of privacy, performance, and scalability. A private blockchain
    eliminates this problem by running as a permissioned blockchain with flexible,
    extensible consensus and access control techniques. As such, public blockchain
    networks are not suitable for launching the decentralized program for a business
    solution [160]. Businesses can collaborate with distributed ledger developers
    to launch their business-to-business and cross-industry applications using a private
    blockchain. In line with this approach, we chose Hyperledger Fabric for its modular
    architecture, which facilitates future scalability. Most notably, the latter versions
    of Hyperledger Fabric come with Byzantine Fault Tolerance consensus mechanism
    to ensure system integrity by mitigating the influence of malicious nodes and
    ensuring continued operation despite failures or malicious actions. Speaking of
    the hardware configuration and operating system of our cloud server that hosts
    the blockchain network. It comprises a 4-core CPU and 6GB of memory and has 64-bit
    Ubuntu Linux 18.04 installed. We deploy a version later than 2.0 of Hyperledger
    Fabric featuring a channel and three nodes as shown in Figure 7. The service providers
    in PenChain get represented by two of the nodes in this channel, whereas the service
    customers vote for the third node. The rationale behind having more representatives
    of the providers in our private blockchain network is to acknowledge that the
    providers who join PenChain are likely to evolve into organizations later in their
    business cycle while the presence of the customers is confirmed. We establish
    three peers within each node, namely Anchor (enabling self-discovery and cross-node
    communication), Endorser (generating signatures to validate transactions), and
    Committing (creating ledger-based transaction storage). Note that Ordering arranges
    and constructs the transaction blocks following the Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    protocols. FIGURE 7. The endorsement, ordering and commitment in PenChain’s underlying
    private blockchain network. Show All In Figure 7, service transactions originating
    from the Logging module in the business layer are dispatched to Endorsers via
    Fabric-Client in Step ①. Moving to Step ②, the Endorser peers within each node
    jointly validate, sign and transmit the resulting transaction back to Fabric-Client.
    During Step ③, Fabric-Client transmits these endorsed transactions to Ordering
    for broadcasting. Lastly, in Step ④, Ordering distributes the transaction block
    to the Committing peers within each node where ledger-based copies of the transaction
    block are serialized in a non-undoable way. 3) Programming the Smart Contracts
    Smart contracts written and deployed on PenChain’s blockchain serve two purposes.
    First, they recalculate the accumulated rating of a data service provider upon
    receiving a confirmation of the quality of the data exchanged or a breach of the
    SLA contract. A special module of PenChain that automatically assesses the quality
    of exchanged data will record any irregularity of data exchange caused by sensor
    malfunctions, connection timeout, data handling problems, etc. Such an issue would
    trigger a smart contract that updates the rating of the service provider involved
    in this data transaction. Second, special smart contracts in PenChain– illustrated
    in Listing 1, are programmed to fire workflow actions scripted in a penalty rule
    to trigger the compensation workflow upon detecting an SLA violation. E. Service
    Publishing, Discovery and Binding Service-oriented computing involves a wide range
    of phases, with service publishing, service discovery and service binding being
    the major phases. We point out to what extent PenChain would address these engineering
    phases. To make the case for PenChain’s usefulness for service provisioning, we
    set up eight client apps on a cloud that is separated from our Microsoft Azure
    cloud where PenChain was deployed. Service publishing. We follow the common architecture
    of service-oriented computing by which penalty-aware services should be made available
    to registered customers in PenChain. Any client application (i.e., software that
    allows a customer to consume services in mutually trusted ways via PenChain) linked
    to our platform shall access this service registry without any restriction. Our
    SLA-oriented service aggregation technique helps enrich the search space in PenChain,
    allowing more service offerings to be listed in a search query. We require all
    providers to publicize their penalty rules when joining our platform. Unfortunately,
    it is a shortcoming of PenChain that we do not fully establish a technical workflow
    detailing how to publish penalty-aware services. Service discovery. One of the
    chief functions of PenChain is reputation-driven service lookup, i.e. how service
    offerings are sorted in a search result depends in part on the reputation of their
    provider. As can be seen in Figure 4 and Figure 5, this function has an intuitive
    user interface where customers can view their search results as: (a) a set of
    services matching the search criteria, which are sorted by their SLA; (b) a filtered
    list of service offerings displayed on Bing Maps. The former helps the customer
    comprehend her search result by displaying all service offerings together with
    service aggregations, while the latter is more intuitive and gives a spatial sense
    of the service lookup mechanism in PenChain. Service binding. PenChain was built
    with the modality in mind, by which modular clusters will communicate with each
    other through APIs. A unit that assesses customer satisfaction is located in the
    same cloud as the “main” of PenChain, which will be invoked in every service transaction23
    via a designated API. The “main” of PenChain then triggers a smart contract to
    update the provider’s rating according to the confirmation returned from the assessment
    unit. As such, PenChain consists of loosely coupled units that are considered
    to be replaceable. To this end, service binding is done with minimum intervention
    from PenChain, letting the service transactions run their course. Yet PenChain
    is able to enforce publicized penalty rules (and update the provider’s rating
    accordingly) associated with a service transaction if the situation is not going
    in an unintended workflow. F. Scalability of PenChain Whether PenChain scales
    up to accommodate the increasingly high number of service providers and service
    consumers chiefly depends on two factors: (a) the ability of its cloud-based applications
    and databases to reliably and elastically handle a growing number of service transactions;
    (b) the capability of the underlying private blockchain to respond to an increasingly
    large volume of read/write operations for the same reason. In this analysis, we
    investigate the second factor, acknowledging that the first factor has been thoroughly
    studied from the point of view of high-performance computing and microservices
    architecture. Suppose that PenChain harbors n service providers, each of whom
    will at least launch m data service offerings. There may be several variants of
    a service offering that differ in terms of SLA. Let k be the number of times a
    service offering is successfully bound to some customer (the more customers registered
    who transact via PenChain on a regular basis, the higher k ). Interviewing local
    farmers at farming sites where we obtained experimental datasets suggests that
    the frequency of data exchange in precision agriculture shall be no more than
    four times per day. Therefore, the total number of service transactions per day
    can be written as, G=n×m×k×4 , or n×m×k÷360 transactions per minute. Let us analyze
    the load sustained by PenChain in a few typical schemes as follows, which are
    colloquially depicted in Figure 8. FIGURE 8. We offer an analysis on the scalability
    of PenChain in terms of the overall responsiveness of its underlying blockchain.
    The heatmap-like visualization in each of the four areas represents the burden
    on the underlying blockchain. Show All Provider dominance. Suppose that there
    are a large number of ( n=1000 ) providers registered in PenChain to do the business
    of agriculture data provisioning. They each exhibit nine data service offerings
    ( m=9 ). If a service offering is bound to at least nine customers ( k=9 ), PenChain
    processes 225 transactions per minute on average. Customer dominance. PenChain
    attracts a large number of customers that frequently request data service offerings
    from a relatively small number of providers ( n=100 ). Each provider offers nine
    service offerings ( m=9 ), each of which is bound to 50 customers ( k=50 ). PenChain
    processes around 125 transactions per minute in this scheme. Balanced & lightweight.
    This scheme is characterized by a relatively low number of providers and customers
    who transact on a regular basis. For example, there are only five providers (
    n=5 ) each publishing 15 data services ( m=15 ). Service offerings are binding
    to at least three customers ( k=3 ). PenChain sustains a light load in this scheme,
    precisely requiring only one transaction per minute. Heavy load. PenChain sustains
    a high burden of transactions in this scheme, which is in stark contrast to the
    previous scheme, when both the service providers and customers dramatically increase
    in number. In the first two schemas, namely provider dominance and customer dominance,
    regardless of what clouds the data services and customer applications shall be
    deployed to, we need to upgrade the server that hosts our Hyperledger Fabric,
    which is currently the bottleneck of PenChain, as the private blockchain database
    is notoriously unresponsive under high load. We note that the cloud database counterpart
    MS Azure is rather elastic, requiring a hashing mechanism that links a transaction
    written down to the blockchain database to its extended log entry in the cloud
    database. PenChain would scale up in the third scheme. As analyzed in Section
    IV, PenChain consists of the following loosely coupled components: data services
    deployed either on the provider’s cloud or MS Azure, customer applications, the
    “main” and the underlying blockchain. In all scenarios, the scalability of PenChain
    depends on computing resources allocated to the providers’ cloud and the Azure
    cloud for its “main” as well as the responsiveness of Azure SQL database and Hyperledger
    Fabric in use. G. Enhancing Data Security and Minimizing Biasedness Given the
    dynamic and evolving landscape of security on blockchain-based platforms, we recognize
    that a dedicated analysis would illuminate potential vulnerabilities, threats,
    and the overall resilience of the PenChain platform against malicious activities
    [161]. A comprehensive security evaluation necessitates an exhaustive exploration
    of attack vectors, consensus mechanisms, smart contract vulnerabilities, and potential
    data breaches [162]. In our research, we focus on data security, with the aim
    of improving trustworthiness and minimizing unbiasedness when it comes to evaluating
    penalty-aware SLAs. Specifically, PenChain was designed and engineered with the
    following in mind: (i) the on-chain database is wired to the off-chain counterpart;
    (ii) programmatic enforcement of penalty rules and algorithmic calculation of
    the rule-abiding rate; (iii) advocating the use of scanning devices (e.g., a QR
    code reader) and dedicated software plugins (e.g., detecting flawed or useless
    data cells in data provisioning) to digitize the satisfaction rate whenever possible.
    In this subsection, we elaborate (i) for the sake of data security while stressing
    that (ii) and (iii) together make the evaluation of the SLAs more evidence-based
    and unbiased, as opposed to notoriously unverifiable feedback (baseless feedback
    in the worst cases) left by humans on today’s mainstream intermediary websites.
    To enhance data security in PenChain, we decouple a service transaction into a
    transaction block stored in Hyperledger (on-chain data) and a transaction log
    recorded in Azure SQL (off-chain data). The on-chain block is linked to the off-chain
    counterpart via a hash function in the family of cryptographic functions called
    Secure Hash Algorithms. As illustrated in Figure 9, the hash function transforms
    the off-chain data record that captures the transaction details24 of a service
    transaction into a hash string before securely embedding it into the corresponding
    block of Hyperledger. This decoupling enhances the data security as follows: (a)
    as the hash code is placed on the blockchain, it possesses an immutable characteristic–
    any minor 1-bit change results in a wholly distinct hash code, effectively shielding
    the off-chain log from unauthorized alterations; (b) unlike on-chain blocks that
    are accessible to all peers in the same blockchain channel, transaction details
    stored in an off-chain record shall be restricted to authorized peers thanks to
    an off-chain access control layer. FIGURE 9. Placing the transaction log in an
    off-chain database and having this log entry wired to the corresponding on-chain
    block using a hash function. Show All SECTION VI. Scenario-Based Evaluation (ii):
    Case of the Automobile Manufacturing Industry In this section, we discuss the
    usefulness of PenChain for the automotive industry (Subsection VI-A) and demonstrate
    its usability by elaborating an exemplary workflow (Subsection VI-B). A. Usefulness
    of PenChain for the automobiles manufacturing industry An automotive parts supplier
    is a firm that supplies different automotive components, parts, and systems to
    vehicle manufacturers. Typically, these suppliers specialize in the production
    of certain components or systems, including engines, gearboxes, braking systems,
    steering systems, electrical components, and more. Automobile manufacturers are
    highly dependent on their suppliers to provide high-quality parts and components
    that satisfy their precise design and performance specifications. They collaborate
    closely with their suppliers to guarantee that the components are supplied on
    time, adhere to stringent quality control requirements, and are cost-effective.
    Typically, the relationship between automakers and their suppliers is long-term,
    and both sides collaborate to enhance their products and services. To stay competitive
    in the automotive sector, suppliers must be able to adapt to shifting consumer
    expectations and industry trends. Overall, the job of an auto parts supplier is
    important to the success of an automaker. Without dependable and high-quality
    parts suppliers, automakers would struggle to construct safe, efficient, and cost-effective
    vehicles. The key SLAs between an automobile parts supplier and the manufacturer
    typically include the following: Quality standards: The supplier must provide
    high-quality parts that meet the manufacturer’s quality standards, and the manufacturer
    may specify particular quality control processes that the supplier must follow.
    The SLA may also include requirements for testing and inspecting automotive parts
    before delivery. Compatible parts of the same or higher quality could be sourced
    from the supplier’s competitors should the parts originally shipped to the manufacturer
    fall short of the quality thresholds contractually defined in the SLA. The supplier
    will face serious consequences when they run out of options to overcome unacceptably
    low-quality parts. Delivery time: The supplier must deliver the parts to the manufacturer
    within the specified time frame, which may include deadlines for each shipment
    and overall delivery times for the entire order. Some of these deadlines might
    be relaxed to give the supplier another chance if it missed the deadline due to
    unexpected circumstances. Failure to respect an extended deadline leads to a heavy
    deduction in the payable amount for those parts. Order accuracy: The supplier
    must ensure that the parts ordered by the manufacturer are accurate in terms of
    quantity, specifications, and other requirements. The SLA may specify penalties
    for errors or inaccuracies in orders. Communication: The supplier must maintain
    open communication with the manufacturer to provide regular updates on the status
    of the order, including any potential delays or issues that may arise. Cost: The
    supplier must provide competitive pricing for the parts and related services,
    such as shipping and handling. The SLA may include provisions for pricing adjustments
    based on changes in the market or changes in the manufacturer’s requirements.
    Intellectual property: The supplier must respect the manufacturer’s intellectual
    property rights and maintain the confidentiality of any proprietary information
    or trade secrets. There are no viable reparation actions to avert a breach of
    this SLA– heavy penalties will be applied, e.g. an irreversible termination of
    the partnership. These SLAs help ensure that the automobile parts supplier and
    the manufacturer have a mutually beneficial relationship that promotes the high-quality,
    timely and cost-effective delivery of automotive components. By establishing clear
    expectations and requirements, both parties can work effectively together to achieve
    their goals. Blockchain technology has the potential to provide significant benefits
    for the relationship between automobile parts suppliers and manufacturers. Here
    are some potential use cases for blockchains in this context. Supply chain management:
    A blockchain can provide an immutable and transparent ledger for tracking the
    entire automotive component supply chain, from raw materials to final products.
    This can help increase visibility and accountability in the supply chain, as well
    as improve traceability and reduce the risk of counterfeiting or fraud. Quality
    control: A blockchain can be used to record and verify quality control data for
    each automotive component produced by the supplier. This can help ensure that
    the manufacturer receives high-quality parts that meet their specifications and
    standards. Payment and settlement: A blockchain can provide a secure and efficient
    platform for managing payments and settlements between the supplier and the manufacturer.
    By using smart contracts, payments can be automatically triggered and settled
    based on predefined conditions and criteria, reducing the need for intermediaries
    and minimizing the risk of errors or disputes. Intellectual property management:
    A blockchain can help protect the intellectual property rights of both the supplier
    and the manufacturer by providing a secure and transparent platform for managing
    and verifying ownership and usage rights. Blockchains can help improve the efficiency,
    transparency, and security of the relationship between automobile parts suppliers
    and manufacturers. By leveraging the unique features of blockchain technology,
    these stakeholders can work together more effectively to create high-quality,
    cost-effective automotive components that meet the needs of consumers. B. Exemplary
    Utilization of PenChain in an Automobile Manufacturing Workflow Suppose Automobiles–X
    is a manufacturer of automobiles that sources its parts from various suppliers.
    One of its key suppliers, XYZ parts, provides them with engine components that
    are critical to the production of their cars. To ensure the quality of the parts
    and the shipment standards of suppliers Automobiles-X has two SLAs: a manufacturer
    SLA and a shipment SLA. Under the SLAs, XYZ Parts must ensure that the engine
    components they supply meet the quality standards and shipment standards, as mentioned
    above, set by Automobiles-X. To verify the quality of the parts and shipment,
    standard Automobiles-X conducts regular inspections and tests of the components
    upon receipt. If the parts fail to meet the quality and shipment standards outlined
    in the SLAs after having tried all available repair actions, Automobiles-X finally
    fires a penalty consequently. For example, if the parts are found to have defects,
    the automobile manufacturer can deduct a percentage of the payment for those parts
    or impose fines on the supplier. We formally express the penalty rule as follows:
    Deduction_Amount = item − cost×( Percentage − Deduction)+( Time − Delay×( item
    − cost−( percentage − of − item − Figure 10 shows the overall workflow of the
    automotive industry scenario. We unlock the potential of blockchain technologies
    in the automobile industry sector, as pointed out earlier. In accordance with
    the general architecture of PenChain, the blockchain is utilized in multiple steps
    of the automobile manufacturing scenario. A detailed description of the steps
    is given as follows: At the start, manufacturers put their demand into the service
    level requirement, also called the manufacturer quality standard or SLA. The requested
    service requirement contract is posted to the blockchain as a manufacturing requirement
    contract. The requested message is forwarded through the communication channel
    to the supplier nodes. The supplier agent receives the request. If the supplier
    agent accepts the request, then the supplier agent forwards the request to the
    shipping unit in order to generate a shipment contract for the manufacturer node.
    Shipment units generate the contract for shipment. The shipment contract has been
    stored on the blockchain for verification purposes. The supplier’s agent sent
    the shipment contract to the manufacturer. The Supplier nodes receive a confirmation
    token from the manufacturer Supplier nodes forward the confirmation token to the
    Shipment Unit After receiving the confirmation token from the supplier’s shipment
    unit, send the item to the manufacturer. The manufacturer nodes verify the item’s
    quality and shipment contract by fetching the contracts from the blockchain in
    order to apply penalties to the supplier nodes. FIGURE 10. Workflow of the automobile
    manufacturing industry scenario for PenChain. Show All SECTION VII. Future Directions
    In the future, we will investigate ways of automatically transforming the textual
    description of penalty rules into deontic logic. The antecedents and the consequent
    expressed for a penalty rule suggest what API call modules that programmatically
    support the compensation workflow shall be specified, developed and deployed on
    the service provider’s side. While the chaincode that implements the compensation
    workflow remains unchanged should a penalty rule be revised, the corresponding
    external API call modules should be reprogrammed and redeployed. Work is currently
    underway to devise a tool proposal that allows registered service providers to
    edit their penalty rules with text suggestions, enabling PenChain to generate
    the APIs of the needed compensation modules hosted on the provider’s side. Integration
    of digitized SLAs with online payment services closes the loop to full-fledged
    automatized service provisioning. In this study, we did not investigate the realization
    of payment services, as the focus of this study was on digitized SLAs. Following
    the Web3 vision, payment services become subject to disintermediation, compared
    with Subsection II-D. To handle payments according to the Web3 paradigm, we currently
    investigate the integration of PenChain into the Alphabill platform that we have
    recently suggested [14]. Alphabill is a platform for universal asset tokenization,
    transfer and exchange as a global medium of exchange. Users of Alphabill can launch
    new so-called blockchain partitions. Each of the Alphabill partitions implements
    an individual token and its corresponding transaction system. The Alphabill platform
    provides the necessary technological fabrics that ensure governance, certification,
    and consistency with uncapped scalability [14]. In particular, the platform has
    inbuilt concepts to realize multi-asset swap transactions, which are also the
    key to ultra-scalable decentralized payment services. SECTION VIII. Conclusion
    Service delivery stays in the mainstream of today’s information systems facing
    increasingly higher expectations of trust in service quality, and flexible ways
    to resolve disputes that may arise during a service transaction. The scale of
    service provisioning and the diversity of service offerings in various business
    domains necessitate a digital service discovery in which the digitized SLAs and
    the service provider’s rating are both considered as ranking criteria for sorting
    the search results of service offerings. The ability to distinguish functionally
    similar services is vital to implement a novel service lookup mechanism in this
    digital service discovery. The digitized SLAs, which capture the mutual agreements
    between the service participants and might incorporate penalty rules– if securely
    saved by a trusted distributed ledger, manifest how reputable and reliable a provider
    has been from the service consumer’s perspective. Scholarly work in this realm
    continues to search for novel service registries and search techniques to trustfully
    handle an ever-growing number of service offerings. As innovative business and
    service models receive a boost from the recent advancement of distributed ledger
    technologies, we now look into blockchain-empowered trust mechanisms for service
    provisioning. In this line of work, we investigate the automatic enforcement of
    dynamic SLAs, which incorporate not only constraints on the service quality, but
    also human-mediated factors such as the penalty. We address the following three
    research questions: (i) In what formal or ground logic should penalty rules be
    expressed? (ii) How to digitize penalty-aware SLAs to enable an enforcement mechanism
    and the computation of an objective unbiased reputation in service provisioning?
    (iii) How to gear up ledger capabilities and blockchain’s smart contracts for
    enforcing the human-in-the-loop penalty rules during a service transaction? This
    article describes the conceptualization, design, engineering, and analytical considerations
    of PenChain– an SLA-driven service lookup platform that extensively utilizes blockchain
    technology. PenChain programmatically enforces penalty-aware SLAs and automatically
    assesses service providers’ reputations. We present that the blockchain-empowered
    enforcement mechanism and the automated assessment of customer’s satisfaction
    proposed in PenChain are key to an impartial and trustworthy evaluation of the
    SLAs in two use cases. We come to the conclusion that PenChain needs to be tailored
    or geared up for a specific service domain but the proposed service lookup and
    enforcement mechanism remain cross-domain. The rest of this Section is dedicated
    to an open discussion on the shortcomings of our platform for SLA-minded service
    provisioning. Shortcomings. We chew over the disadvantages of our proposal, which
    interestingly stem from the first two elements of the triplet in the formal definition
    we propose for the SLAs, namely the penalty rules and the satisfaction. We will,
    however, not delve into the third element of this triplet, namely the costs, simply
    because payment-related topics are not within the scope of our work. While the
    penalty-enforcing chaincode in PenChain looks generic and seems to follow the
    write-once-run-anywhere feature that was once made popular in the era of virtual
    machines, it still relies on off-chain software components to carry out necessary
    compensation actions. Knowing that the off-chain components are supposedly written
    and maintained by the service providers, we implicitly assume that the providers
    are honest and will not intentionally take false compensation actions. In another
    word, our entire programmatic enforcement is exposed to their will. Although this
    assumption looks safe when executing fully digitized and verifiable compensation
    (e.g., discount applied to the e-payment), it is difficult to confirm human-in-the-loop
    compensation that is mediated by an off-chain software component. We advocate
    the use of an automatic assessment to objectively determine the satisfaction level
    in an SLA. As depicted in the overall architecture (see Figure 1), Assessment
    Unit is an off-chain unit that assesses the outcome of every service transaction
    based on the service execution log accumulated in System Log. This design looks
    promisingly open and seems to work across industry sectors and service domains
    because, in principle, we can engineer Assessment Unit in accordance with the
    specific domain knowledge. Although this engineering choice proves effective in
    domains such as the car rental industry and data-as-a-service business models,
    the assessment is notoriously unattainable programmatically in domains where anthropomorphic
    entities are heavily involved (e.g., tourism). ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author Trung-Viet

    Precision Agriculture (PA) [1], designed to improve profitability and/or minimize
    environmental impact in the medium and long term [2], provides a localized management
    of crops and the means to study soil characteristics, crop behavior, phytosanitary,
    among others, of each portion of the fields. Awareness of soil and crop variability
    started in the 1970 s and 1980 s, when companies such as CENEX, FARMERS Central
    Union Exchange Inc. and Control Data Corporation, of Minnesota-USA, established
    the first concept of soil and plant variability and its benefits by management
    for zones instead of the entire planted area. Agricultural engineering refers
    to the use of sensors and Global Positioning System (GPS) in agricultural machines
    for mapping and application of inputs with varied doses. Massey Ferguson, 1982,
    was the first to produce a commercial result with a grain productivity mapping
    system. In the 1990 s, John Deere, Case, AGCO and New Holland developed PA, which
    is now widely used in vineyards in Chile [3]. In 1982, the performance monitor
    was developed. 1984 marks the positioning system. In 1985/96 the variable dose
    technology appears. In 1991 the first performance monitoring system was sold in
    Europe. In 1996 performance monitoring models are in the market e.g. Field Star,
    Green Star, among others. EIP-AGRI [4], European Union, proposes seven points
    to be resolved to incorporate PA in Europe. In 2009, in Latin America, Argentina
    [2] achieved that 30% of producers use PA in wheat, corn, sugarcane and tobacco.
    Mexico [5], currently uses PA for greater efficiency and yield of large-scale
    crops. Europe and the USA investigated how to increase production performance
    in the scope of projects FIspace [6], SmartAgrifood [7], Finish [8], Fractals
    [9], Speedupeurope [10], based on ICTs through of the Internet of Things (IoT).
    There are commercial architectures such as IBM Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Google
    Cloud Platform, Libelium and open source-based architectures such as Kaa [11],
    OpenAG Initiative [12] that allow rapid deployment of IoT solutions. Currently,
    there are many IoT implementations in agriculture as described in [13] that propose
    a cloud-based IoT solution, also in [14] they show that Big Data and the concept
    of decentralized cloud operation will help farmers operate more efficiently and
    more securely and finally [15] explore the use of ultra-low power microcontroller
    as sensor hardware. Actually, there is a great interest in using artificial intelligence
    technologies applied to agriculture [16] combining recent advances in Deep Learning
    (DL) and Internet of Things (IoT) [17] in the direction that has been worked in
    this research. Hence, our objective is to design, develop and integrate into a
    single system called QuinuasmartApp with some features already identified for
    IoT-based solutions, cloud computing applications and artificial intelligence
    models developed until now. Section 2 describes the QuinuaSmartApp project. Section
    3 shows the sensor network implemented. Section 4 raises the cloud infrastructure
    used and finally in Sect. 5 we show the conclusions of this article. 2 QuinuaSmartApp
    QuinuaSmartApp (see Fig. 1) proposes to automate crop management in an intelligent,
    remote and real-time way, to obtain information on known and not yet known factors
    determining the productivity of organic quinoa implemented in the peasant community
    of San Lorenzo, Jauja, Peru. An IoT network of wireless sensors is deployed in
    the field of quinoa cultivation to collect information on the soil and the environment
    through monitoring stations on different parameters such as temperature, conductivity
    and soil moisture and meteorological information such as temperature, radiation
    , wind speed, pressure, etc. These stations connect to the Internet through a
    gateway that uses the mobile network. Drones equipped with Lidar, Multispectral
    and visible spectrum cameras are also used, which allow knowing parameters such
    as crop growth, planting density and NDVI of the crop field. The collected data
    is sent to a database located in the Google GCP Internet cloud. Two applications
    have been developed, a Web application and a mobile application for accessing
    data both at the management level and at the technical and/or scientific level.
    At the management level, the system allows the registration and notification of
    alerts and messages from the farmer to the engineer responsible for the crop field,
    facilitating preventive and/or corrective actions in time to prevent or reduce
    the harmful manifestation of pests, phytopathogens and external abiotic factors.
    The system also makes it possible to have a unique historical record of the crop
    field similar to the one a person has in their clinical history where data such
    as the type of crop that has been carried out, on what date, what types of pesticides
    have been used, what type of incidents have occurred, etc. The data recorded and/or
    obtained by the sensor devices have made it possible to model the water demand
    of the quinoa crop, which allows an optimal use of the water resource. At the
    climate projection level, the system allows viewing the 50-year climate prediction
    of the region where the crop field is located so that the farmer can carry out
    adequate planting planning. Finally, the system implements a marketplace functionality,
    where the farmer offers his products for sale from the moment they are planted
    and a company can register its purchase requirements. The system allows real-time
    historical statistics and visual projection reports that facilitate decision making
    in the field of cultivation. At a scientific level, the data recorded in the system
    have allowed feeding models such as Aquacrop [18], which allows forecasting the
    yield of the quinoa crop to achieve a natural and sustainable organic crop over
    time. Quinuasmartapp articulates the information flow of the different types of
    information, both management and operational information, whether technical and/or
    scientific, using the cyber-subsidiarity model [19] in order to achieve a sustainable
    system. Fig. 1. QuinuaSmartApp system overview. Full size image 3 IoT Network
    It’s constructed a low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) to monitor quinoa cultivation
    in real-time. This network is comprised of three types of IoT stations, as detailed
    below: a soil station, a weather station, and a gateway station. 3.1 Soil Station
    The soil station (Fig. 2) is built up using two different kinds of Decagon devices,
    the GS1 and GS3 devices [20], which will be detailed below. GS1 Devices. It contains
    a single sensor that determines volumetric water content (VWC) by measuring the
    dielectric constant of the medium using capacitance and frequency domain technology.
    The 70 MHz frequency minimizes salinity and textural effects, making the GS1 accurate
    in almost any soil or soilless medium. It arrives with generic calibrations for
    mineral soils and soilless media included in its operator manual. This sensor
    obtains its measurement in analog mode. Therefore, we use the conversion equation
    included in the datasheet: $$\\begin{aligned} \\theta = 4.94 \\cdot 10^{-4} \\text
    {mV}- 0.554 \\end{aligned}$$ (1) where \\(\\theta \\) represents the volumetric
    water content and mV represents the sensor’s output when it is excited between
    3 and 15. Fig. 2. Soil station. Full size image GS3 Devices. The Decagon GS3 sensor
    is an accurate tool for monitoring electrical conductivity, volumetric water content,
    and temperature in soil and soilless substrates. The GS3 determines volumetric
    water content (VWC) by measuring the dielectric constant \\(\\epsilon \\) of the
    medium using capacitance/frequency-domain technology. Decagon digital sensors
    have a 1-wire serial interface for communicating sensor measurements. The sensor
    supports two different protocols: SDI-12 and DDI-Serial. Both interfaces are documented
    in their datasheet. Each protocol has advantages and implementation challenges.
    There are differences in voltage levels, logic levels, and signal timing for each
    protocol. The SDI-12 protocol is used in this project and it is a standard protocol
    for interfacing sensors to data loggers and data acquisition equipment. Multiple
    sensors with unique addresses can share a common 3-wire bus (power, ground, and
    data). Two-way communication between the sensor and logger is possible by sharing
    the data line for transmit and receive as defined by the standard sensor measurements
    triggered by protocol command. Figure 3 depicts the data flux captured by the
    GS1/GS3 devices in the soil station. Fig. 3. The stream of data from the GS1/GS3
    devices in the Soil station. Full size image 3.2 Gateway Station Using the Zegbee
    protocol, this station (Fig. 4) acts as a gateway for the soil and weather stations.
    A USB cable and a SparkFun XBee Explorer USB are used to connect the Raspberry
    Pi Zero W to the XBee coordinator module. It also contains a 4G modem that functions
    as user equipment (UE) for mobile network connectivity. The gateway is based on
    a low-power single-board computer Raspberry Pi Model Zero W with a 1 GHz ARM processor
    on the CPU motherboard. Additionally, it has one USB port, one HDMI port, 512
    MB RAM, one micro SD storage socket, and forty GPIO interface ports. It is compatible
    with Raspbian, the Debian-based Linux distribution used in this project. The Raspberry
    Pi connects to a 4G modem through Wi-Fi (802.11n) to access the Google Cloud Platform
    (GCP). MQTT is the message protocol used to connect to GCP. Finally, we put an
    SQLite database in the Raspberry with the purpose of duplicating the data acquired
    from soil and weather stations while limiting Raspberry’s memory space in the
    event of an internet outage. Fig. 4. Gateway communication station components
    Full size image 3.3 Wheather Station This node (Fig. 5) collects data from the
    climate sensors connected to an Arduino Mega 2560 pro mini. This data is sent
    to a Raspberry Pi Zero W through a serial connection and then processed by the
    gateway program similar to the communications station node (Fig. 6). The sensors
    used in the station are: Weather Meters. These sensors of ARGENT Data Systems
    allow the measurement of climatic variables such as wind speed, wind direction
    and rainfall. The wind vane reports wind direction as a voltage which is produced
    by the combination of eight resistors inside the sensor. The vane’s magnet may
    close two switches at once, allowing up to sixteen possible positions to be indicated.
    The cup-type anemometer measures wind speed by simply closing a switch in each
    rotation. A wind speed of 2.4011 KPH produces one switch closure per second. Finally,
    the rain gauge is a self-emptying bucket-type rain gauge which activates a momentary
    button closure for each 0.2794 mm of rain that is collected. Fig. 5. Weather station
    Full size image Wattmeter. This sensor is a module that measures the voltage,
    current and power of an embedded system with a high-resolution, high-precision
    and maximum relative error of ±0.2%. It is used for power consumption and battery
    life evaluation. BME280. This sensor is an environmental sensor of high precision
    and small size that integrates an onboard temperature sensor, humidity sensor
    and barometer. Environmental Sensor has based on BoSCH MEMS sensor (Micro-Electro-Mechanical
    System) and provides both SPI and I2C interfaces. The temperature measuring range
    is \\(-40^\\circ \\)C to \\(+85\\,^\\circ \\)C, resolution of \\(0.1\\,^\\circ
    \\)C and deviation of \\(\\pm 0.5\\,^\\circ \\)C. The humidity measuring range
    is 0 to 100% RH, resolution of 0.1% RH and deviation of ±2% RH. The pressure measuring
    range is 300 to 1100 hPa. Davis 6450. The Solar Radiation Sensor, or solar pyranometer,
    measures global radiation, the sum at the point of measurement of both the direct
    and diffuse components of solar irradiance. Detects solar radiation at wavelengths
    of 300 to 1100 nm. The resolution is 1 W/m2 and the range is from 0 to 1800 W/m2.
    Fig. 6. Weather station components Full size image 3.4 Drone Cameras Integration
    The drones allow the acquisition of multispectral images, which in turn enables
    the determination of the NDVI index of the cultivation field. In addition, LIDAR
    images facilitate the identification of crops’ growth, as well as high-resolution
    images that allow the estimation of sowing density. LIDAR Camera Integration.
    Integration of a LiDAR VLP16 Puck Lite sensor was achieved in the Matrice 600
    PRO drone from the DJI brand. The integration process consists of the stage of
    acquisition of position/orientation data from the drone and the point cloud of
    the LiDAR sensor in real-time. For this purpose, an ODROID minicomputer was used
    to execute a program in Robot Operating System (ROS) that communicates with said
    elements using the DJI And Velodyne SDK. For the mechanical integration of the
    electronic components in the drone, a structure was designed and printed using
    3D printing technology. Finally, the data processing stage obtained after scanning
    the fields is carried out using a program written in Python language. The 3D information
    from the field allows specialists to track the size of the crop throughout the
    growing stage. The results obtained are evaluated based on a comparison with a
    point cloud generated from images obtained from a DJI Phantom 4 drone with an
    RGB camera. The georeferenced point cloud generation process can be seen in Fig.
    7. Fig. 7. Georeferenced point cloud generation process Full size image Multispectral
    Camera Integration. Integration of a multispectral camera model ADCmicro of the
    Tetracam brand was achieved in the drone model Matrice 600 PRO of the DJI brand.
    The integration process consists of the stage of acquisition of position data
    from a Tetracam GPS and the multispectral camera in real-time powered by an 11.1V
    battery. For the mechanical integration of the electronic components in the drone,
    a structure was designed and printed using 3D printing technology. Finally, the
    data processing stage obtained was carried out after capturing the images of the
    crop fields using the PixelWrech2 program to process each image and then generating
    the mosaic with the Pix4DMapper program. The information of the NDVI index enables
    the analysis and location of places in the field with little vigor of the crop
    that requires some action by the specialist. In addition, the images obtained
    by a DJI Phantom 4 drone were used as support for the analysis of the results.
    The georeferenced orthomosaic generation process can be seen in Fig. 8. The images
    obtained by the multispectral camera are processed using an algorithm based on
    deep learning to perform crop and weed segmentation [21]. Fig. 8. NDVI orthomosaic

    IoT, mobile and web applications and modules in order to support the flow of information
    from sensors to the end-user application through the cloud-based platform. The
    IoT module has two components on the ground (the program for retrieving the environmental
    data, and the program to send the information to the Google Cloud Platform - GCP),
    and a component on the cloud, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The first program collaborates
    with the second one sending the data in a JSON format. This program has credentials
    to publish the data to IoT Core which is the service for communication with small
    devices like the stations, and it sends the telemetry events through the publishing
    and subscribing service (Cloud Pub/Sub). The last component is a cloud function
    that is automatically triggered when a new event arrives and stores the sensor
    data to a NoSQL database called Cloud Datastore. Fig. 9. GCP architecture of QuinuasmartApp
    Full size image The web module has two web applications (frontend and backend)
    and a web service. The end-user accesses the server web apps through a browser
    that retrieves the client web app as depicted in the “web and mobile applications”
    figure. This client web app gets the data from the backend server web app and
    the web service in GCP. The backend and frontend use an app engine service for
    each one and the web service uses a cloud function. Both GCP services obtain the
    data from Datastore, Cloud SQL and Cloud Storage. Datastore saves sensor data,
    Cloud SQL stores master and configuration data like the name for a station, sensors,
    etc., and Cloud Storage hosts images for icons, logos, etc. The farmer and the
    researcher use web applications through the frontend client web app. The admin
    uses the backend server web app through the browser that renders the HTML contents
    and necessary related elements. These web and mobile applications are represented
    in Fig. 10. The web module has two web applications (frontend and backend) and
    a web service. The frontend is used by the researcher who monitors the sensor
    data. There are 4 main options: issues, activity history, monitoring (Fig. 10a),
    and predictions. Fig. 10. Monitoring screens Full size image The backend is used
    by the admin in order to set the configuration data like sensor and station names,
    etc. Admin panel has the following main options: access, IoT and agriculture.
    In the access option, the admin user configures users, roles, and groups. In IoT:
    magnitude, stations, sensors (Fig. 11), and gateways. In agriculture, access is
    provided for external consultants to: plant species, plant varieties, plant afflictions;
    while administrators can manage fields, crops, intentions of crops, crop issues,
    crop activity history, and crop reports. Fig. 11. Sensor configuration screen
    from the backend web application Full size image The mobile module is used by
    the farmer who is responsible for working in the field and uses the mobile application
    on a handheld device with internet connectivity. As a farmer, he registers its
    fields, crops, issues and farming activities. He can monitor the current condition
    of the soil through the sensors through the data displayed in graphical reports
    (Fig. 10b). 5 Climate Projection With the intention to facilitate the evaluation
    of the impact of weather on the productivity of quinoa crops, two components have
    been devised and integrated into the system: Climate change projection and Water
    demand projection of quinoa crops. 5.1 Climate Change Projection This component
    estimate climate change projection simulated by the climatic models used in phase
    5 by the intercomparison of coupled models (CMP5) [22]. The models provide local
    climate projections for this area, generating a first future climate database
    for the region, as a decision-making tool for farmers and other users of the basin
    (Fig. 12). The climatic projections show a significant warming from 2,0\\(^\\circ
    \\) of temperature for the RCP2.6 scenario to 3,5\\(^\\circ \\) of temperature
    for the RCP8.5 scenario expected in the entire evaluated area of the Jauja valley
    for the next fifty years, together with a decrease in precipitation. Fig. 12.
    Climate change projection shown for the mobile application Full size image 5.2
    Water Demand Projection This component focuses on the utilization of water resources
    in agricultural activities related to Quinoa production in Peru’s central region
    (Jauja - Junn). The goal is to optimize production processes and crops to maximize
    quinoa production using machine learning, specifically the development of an artificial
    neural network model that allows to establish approximate predictions of reference
    evapo-transpiration, to estimate the water footprint or water resource required
    for quinua crops, in order to promote responsible and optimal use of this resource,
    which is likely to be scarce in the future. This goal is primarily realized by
    the selection of input variables important to the neural network model, which
    were gathered from various data sources resulting from the construction of the
    IoT network in the cultivation area. The relationship between the predictor variables
    and their respective variable responses was statistically analyzed using the methodology
    of minimum partial squares (PLS), and thus the model’s prescindible variables
    were selected, so that the artificial neuronal network model could be trained.
    Finally, after ongoing optimization of the artificial neural network model, the
    final structure is formed, as well as the model accuracy measurement, using statistical
    error and adjustment measures that allow to predict the water requirement of the
    investigated field of production. 6 Conclusions In this article, we show how the
    QuinuasmartApp system has been designed and implemented to monitor in real time
    the cultivation of quinoa in the peasant community of San Lorenzo, Jauja, Junin
    in the Peruvian Andes. At the hardware level, a wireless IoT network of environmental
    monitoring stations, soil moisture monitoring stations and gateway communication
    stations that connect to the mobile network have been implemented and integrated.
    The crop field monitoring system is complemented by data obtained by drones equipped
    with multispectral, visible and Lidar cameras. At the software level, a web application
    and a software application in the Internet cloud have been implemented that allow
    the recording and visualization of the data acquired in the system in real time.
    A marketplace module has been implemented that allows farmers to offer their products
    as well as allows companies to publish the demand for agricultural products. Finally,
    with the data obtained, we create and integrate automatic learning methods into
    the platform to analyze the water demand of the quinoa crop that allow optimizing
    the use of water. Climate change forecast models have also been implemented as
    useful tools for farmers in planning their crops. A cyber-subsidiarity model has
    been followed in order to achieve a sustainable system. References Khanna, A.,

    Today farmers around the world are gradually embracing Smart farming assisted

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    as per the following structure: The problem with traditional agriculture is introduced
    in section (1), along with how smart agriculture uses cutting-edge technology
    through 5G connection to tackle the problem, and the classification of various
    farming processes from pre-harvesting through post-harvesting. The section (2)
    discusses the IoT-based existing works on various pre-harvesting farming processes.
    The section (3) provides information on the IoT-based existing works in the harvesting
    process. The section (4) provides information on several existing works for the
    post-harvesting process. The modern metaheuristic technique for creating intelligent
    farm systems is covered in section (5). The section (6) analyses the current and
    future communication technologies used for smart agriculture up to this point.
    The section (7) provides information on the existing dataset that can be used
    in solving smart agriculture problems. Section (8) discuss the problem exist in
    the existing IoT based system on various pre to post harvesting subsystem, section
    (9) contributes the recommendation based on existing problem for developing pre
    to post harvesting subsystem, section (10) a comparison of the proposed 5G based
    smart agriculture framework with existing smart agriculture framework is discussed
    and in last section (11) overall summary of the proposed survey has been discussed.
    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. DHRS subsystem classification. A wireless
    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown
    in the graph Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. Data consumption analysis (GB) used by IoT devices year
    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used
    in smart agriculture. Communication Technologies Frequency Bands Data Rate Range

    problem in CYP, SSL, SIR, DDAN, PCN, WDT, and CWM operations. Existing public
    dataset has been reviewed for several farming operations (Lu and Young, 2020)
    including SSL, DDAN, WDT, CWM, etc., and classified this dataset based on the
    specific problem that can be solved using the IoT based computer vision algorithm
    for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Including some existing external datasets
    created by various authors can be found in Table 3. This collection includes many
    plant-leaf diseases that affect fruits, vegetables, and seeds. For instance, tomatoes,
    brinjal, potatoes, guava, wheat, cotton, apples, oranges, and so forth. Table
    3. Analysis of dataset that can be used for developing smart agriculture based
    subsystem. References Details (Rauf and Lali, 2021) This dataset of healthy and
    unhealthy guava fruits and leaves can be used to solve plant disease-related issues
    using computer vision techniques. The illness categories in this image dataset
    are Dot, Canker, Mummification, and Rust. Pakistan is the source of the images.
    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res

    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.

    surveys information. Table 6. Comparative analysis of proposed survey from existing

    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

    Unmanned Ground Vehicles (robots) developed by the research team. These can replace
    sensors deployed in the Wireless Sensor Net (WSN). 1 Introduction Feed the population
    and regenerate the planet: The conditions necessary to implement this commonly
    used slogan were not met 10–15 years ago. We did not have the data or information
    that could have simultaneously enabled us to maintain yields, feed the growing
    population, maintain unchanged profits, increase biodiversity, meet other sustainability
    requirements more effectively, and regenerate arable land. The artificial intelligence-based
    PhD thesis conducted at our department in 2006 also concluded that it is essential
    to increase the size of databases if we want to better understand and enhance
    natural and agro-ecological systems and their interconnections (Mike-Hegedűs,
    2006). EU expectations: Below we present the EU directives in detail with the
    aim of highlighting the complexity of the issue. It also becomes apparent that
    EU authorities do not consider the introduction of modern monitoring and control
    systems, as there is no mention of their advantages in the various documents.
    Objectives of organic farming: Producing food by using natural ingredients and
    processes is the goal of organic farming. Accordingly, organic farming generally
    has a minimal effect on the environment since it promotes the following: conservation
    of biodiversity, preservation of regional ecological balances, responsible use
    of energy and natural resources, improvement of soil fertility, and protection
    of water quality. Furthermore, organic farming regulations require that producers
    meet the unique behavioural demands of their animals and promote a high quality
    of animal welfare. Organic farming after 2022: Examples of changes made under
    the new organic rules include: strengthening the control system, which will help
    to further increase consumer confidence in the EU organics system; new producer
    regulations that will facilitate small farmers'' transition to organic production;
    new rules on imported organics to ensure that all organic products sold in the
    EU are of the same standard; a greater range of products can be marketed as organic
    (ULR1). A green deal: While this is the ultimate objective, the EU has set a halfway
    target for 2030, when it hopes to reduce emissions by 55% from 1990 levels. Even
    while the primary goal of the Green Deal is to reduce global warming and meet
    climate targets, putting it into practice will have numerous positive effects
    on the European continent, “[t]his, too, is a decisive point: economic growth,
    jobs, and better prospects for the next generation if Europe manages to lead the
    way in ‘green’ technologies.” Energetic aspects: The Fit for 55 packages, in instance,
    aims to generate 40% of Europe''s energy from renewable sources by 2030. Aspects
    related to agriculture: the program includes goals such implementing labels that
    emphasize the level of sustainability of products, cutting the usage of fertilizer
    and pesticides by 20% and 25%, respectively, by 2030. Environmental protection
    aspects: Lastly, the Zero Pollution Action Plan, which aims to eliminate all causes
    of air, water, and soil pollution by 2050, is also a part of the Green Deal. Regulations
    outside the EU: Naturally, the EU also needs to consider general expectations
    and requirements. Global social, economic, and environmental transformation are
    included in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (Sustainable Development
    Goals, or SDGs), which was adopted by all United Nations member states in 2015
    (Fetting, 2020; Neményi et al., 2022). Holt et al. (2016) draw attention to the
    fact that the regulations regarding food raw material production may contradict
    the interests of the food industry within various EU rules. The contradictions
    pertain to organic farming. By using life cycle assessment (LCA), it was found
    that while conventional cultivation performed better per unit of mass (28.10%
    lower total environmental footprint compared to organic cultivation), organic
    eggplant cultivation demonstrated better environmental performance per unit area
    (24.15% lower total environmental footprint compared to conventional cultivation).
    Due to the usage of chemical pesticides and fertilizers, the conventional system
    got higher scores in the intermediate impact categories of eutrophication (up
    to 37.12%) and ecotoxicity (up to 83.00%). This illustrates the requirement for
    life cycle assessment (LCA) that takes local environmental effects into consideration
    (Foteinis et al., 2021). We obtain similar results in animal breeding as well.
    The ecological footprint of conventionally produced milk is smaller per kilogram
    of mass compared to that of organic milk (Bos et al., 2007). The following table
    illustrates the principles and practices of regenerative agriculture (Giller et
    al., 2021; Tan and Kuebbing, 2023) (Table 1). Table 1. List of regenerative agricultural
    practices, their principles and importance for restoration of soil health and

    implementation methods of the principles and practices indicated in the table
    are not extensively discussed in various studies. It must be stated that the EU''s
    ideas about transitioning to regenerative farming raise numerous scientific and
    practical problems (Giller et al., 2021; EASAC, 2022). It is important to emphasize
    that regenerative farming primarily focuses on enhancing biodiversity and restoring
    soil conditions. Strengthening trust in scientific results and professional experiences.
    Ecological intelligence. According to the authors'' opinion, one of the main prerequisites
    for the widespread adoption of environmentally friendly practices is the establishment
    of an ecocentric mind-set. What is ecocentric intelligence? EI consists of four
    pillars: 1. Individuals have the appropriate knowledge to assess whether their
    actions meet the criteria of sustainable development. 2. Individuals can judge
    how their actions impact global changes beyond local effects. 3. Individuals can
    evaluate social (political) ideas, projects, and express their opinions to decision-makers
    while aiming for cooperation. 4. Individuals strive to participate in events,
    organizations, and programs where they can expand their experiences and discuss
    their opinions and experiences related to sustainable ecological development.
    However, it is also true that the general acceptance of this mind-set should be
    supported by education (from kindergarten to university), various short-term and
    long-term social efforts, legislation, etc. 2 The interconnection between general
    and agro sustainability The harmony of the pillars of social and agrarian sustainability
    implies the coordination of multiple complex systems. A commonly accepted definition
    for social sustainability is the unity of the pillars of social development, economic
    growth, and environmental protection. This integration needs to be harmonized
    with the pillars of agricultural sustainability: Genetics (related to cultivated
    genomes), Environment (covering production units such as fields, gardens, barns,
    and the food industry, as well as their surroundings), and Sustainable Management
    (Hatfield and Walthall, 2015), as depicted in Fig. 1. As evident, the environment
    and nature conservation play a crucial role here. Any significant change in any
    other pillar, whether positive or negative, typically manifests in the form of
    environmental changes. The question is what kinds of changes are occurring, how
    these changes can be detected or indexed, and how the changes in indexes can be
    monitored (Fig. 2). VIEW FULL SIZE Fig. 1. The general (left) and agricultural

    slide 3 Sustainable biodiversity indices (indicators) Ecosystem functions and
    services present significant challenges to monitoring and control systems (Purcell,
    2018). Herzog et al. (2013) developed a toolkit consisting of 23 indicators, which
    were tested in 15 European and African regions. The indicator groups were as follows:
    Three Genetic Diversity Indicators, four Species Diversity Indicators, eight Habitat
    Diversity Indicators, and eight Farm Management Indicators. IoT applications have
    emerged. It is worth mentioning the Providence IoT system widely used in the Amazon
    rainforests, which can be adapted for monitoring EU Green Deal expectations (Nay,
    2020). Soil monitoring: The impact of human interventions on the soil can be tracked
    through monitoring changes in the Soil Degradation Rate (SDR) parameter. This
    parameter is based on integration of Soil Degradation Rate (SDR), Soil Fertility
    Index (SFI), Soil Quality Index (SQI), and Soil Resilience Rate (SRR). The interrelationships
    and conditions of soil parameters (available phosphorus, potassium, and nitrogen,
    EC, pH, Sp, ESP, CEC, OC, SAR, and CaCO3) were demonstrated using geo-statistics.
    Geostatistical mapping of spatial soil variability could lead to precision agriculture
    applications (AE Abdel Rahman et al., 2022). Seven soil functions have been used
    in Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soils, and 8 Soil threats according to the
    Towards a Thematic Strategy for Soils (Jónsson et al., 2016). The integration
    of proximal: UGV (Unmanned Ground Vehicle), UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle), and
    satellite soil monitoring offers significant possibilities (Sheffield and Morse-McNabb,
    2015). 4 Paradigm changes in agriculture. The third green revolution The first
    green revolution was pioneered by Norman Borlaug (Mohanta, 2009). Its essence
    lay in significantly increasing yields through the application of cutting-edge
    chemicals, fertilizers, propagating materials, and machinery, emphasizing technological
    discipline. In the early 1990s, the advent of satellite positioning systems enabled
    the “greening” of the revolution with the emergence of precision technologies].
    In 1998, Tilman highlighted the necessity of the greening of the green revolution,
    emphasizing the introduction of environmentally friendly agricultural technologies
    and referring to modern precision technologies. We can trace the second green
    revolution back to the 1990s (Tilman, 1998). The definition of precision farming
    (PA) according to ISPA (International Society for Precision Agriculture) is: “Precision
    Agriculture is a management strategy that gathers, processes and analyses temporal,
    spatial and individual data and combines it with other information to support
    management decisions according to estimated variability for improved resource
    use efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability and sustainability of agricultural
    production.” The essence of precision technologies is to divide the arable land
    into management zones, which are considered homogenous in terms of soil chemical,
    physical, and biological (microbiological) characteristics, and to determine inputs
    and treatments in a site-specific manner. These management zones can be as small
    as a few hundred square meters, but we can also refer to this system as a “per
    plant” platform. 5 Precision agriculture integrated with IoT: the Mosonmagyaróvár
    Agro IoT system Since the 2015s, we can speak of the third Green Revolution, which
    marks the beginning of the integration of IoT and Precision Agriculture (PA).
    The IERC (IoT European Research Cluster) definition states that IoT is: “A dynamic
    global network infrastructure with self-configuring capabilities based on standard
    and interoperable communication protocols where physical and virtual ‘things’
    have identities, physical attributes, and virtual personalities and use intelligent
    interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated into the information network.” Smart
    is a clever system with adaptability. Its implementation requires the processing
    of digitized databases and Big Data, and it is based on artificial intelligence,
    while also taking advantage of cloud computing. The literature sources ITU and
    FAO (2021) and Nyéki et al. (2020) summarize the IoT developments at the Albert
    Kázmér Agricultural Faculty of the Széchenyi István University. 6 General structure
    of IoTs Mobile (robot UGV) small-smart data logging system development. The stable
    sensor network exchange for dynamic monitoring and control. According to Wang
    et al.’s (2019) literature, in addition to the measuring stations already indicated,
    we are developing a mobile measuring unit, the data of which complements the current
    data. The robot is a rubber-footed machine with two DC motors that is fixed to
    a metal frame. A Raspberry Pi 4 microcomputer has been installed in place of the
    original Raspberry Pi 3 control. It is protected from external influences by a
    specially designed cover panel that also contains connectors and other extra electronic
    parts. The robot is based on a three-axis servomotor arm with a servomotor-driven
    level sampling device at its end. Additionally, it is equipped with an RGB camera
    that has servomotors that allow it to be positioned along two axes. The device
    can move autonomously between the crop''s rows due to an ultrasonic distance sensor
    and a lidar sensor for orientation. It also collects information from the environment,
    such as global radiation, ambient temperature and humidity, soil surface temperature,
    and soil properties (temperature, moisture content, EC, pH, NPK). In the analysis
    of camera images, artificial intelligence based on a neural network is able to
    detect changes in plant parts and signal this to the robot operator. The robot''s
    control software is written in the Python programming language. It allows the
    user to have complete control and optimization of the machine. It is possible
    to operate the device via both wired (LAN) and wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth) connections
    (Fig. 3 (a, b), Figs 4 and 5) (Ambrus et al., 2022). The data logger robot is
    not only suitable for data collection and processing but also for control tasks,
    collaborating, for example, with advanced cameras (hyperspectral imaging). With
    this capability, early detection of microbiological infections can be achieved
    (Bauriegel et al., 2011). The above research can contribute to harmonizing the
    Lab and the Field measuring results (Perkel, 2017). VIEW FULL SIZE Fig. 3. (a,

    7 Conclusions We have limited information about the condition for the sustainable
    coexistence of natural and agricultural ecosystems. The integrated IoT in Precision
    Agriculture (PA) with small-smart robot data loggers and controllers provides
    increasing transparency in space and time concerning the food chain and its surrounding
    environment. This Farm to Fork system not only benefits consumers but also provides
    valuable information for researchers and managers in improving production processes.
    Without the small-smart data loggers and controllers working together, such databases
    would not be available to us. The system, including sensors on drones and satellite
    data, can continuously expand, accommodating a wider range of biodiversity and
    soil sustainability indicators. Through AI-based analyses, the size of these databases
    can be significantly increased (Nyéki A et al., 2022; Nyéki A et al., 2021; Nyéki
    A and Neményi, 2022). The third Green Revolution enables the broader emergence
    of ecological intelligence (Goleman, 2010). Conflict of interest The first author,

    2.4 GHz WIFI technology, it was possible to reach a radius of 600 m between the
    station and the communication tower, but it is expected that with LoraWan, this
    range could be 10 km or more Background Brazil is one of the main grain producers
    in the world, being the top country by soybean production and third-largest corn
    producer in the 2019/2020 growing season, only behind China and the USA. In 2020,
    Brazil had an area of soybean and corn cultivation of approximately 36.9 and 18.5
    million hectares, respectively, equivalent to 124.84 and 102.5 million tons of
    grains [1]. As a result, agriculture has been consolidated as the main economic
    pillar of the State of Paraná in the last decade. Soybean and corn are important
    protein sources in animal feed production, being indispensable for the chicken
    and swine production chains. The soybean planted area in the State of Paraná reached
    approximately 5.56 million hectares in the 2020/2021 growing season, with an estimated
    production of 20.5 million tons. Also, the State of Paraná reached record production
    in the 2019/2020 growing season, with a value of 20.8 million tons, representing
    about 17% of the Brazilian production [2]. Corn production in the 2019/2020 growing
    season reached about 15.2 million tons, and the cultivated area increased by 17%
    from 2010 to 2020, which is due to the second crop, as the first crop has been
    undergoing constant reductions [3]. Food production is expected to increase by
    around 70% by 2050 to meet the demand for food needs due to population growth,
    considering the extensive use of natural resources in agriculture, such as water,
    for future sustainability [4]. Therefore, there is a need for the successful development
    of efficient management practices and coherent use of resources, with the prediction
    of possible climate impacts being imperative, making real-time monitoring of climate
    and soil necessary [5]. Maintaining consolidated family farming in the countryside
    is essential for agri-food development. Technology assists in this process, but,
    on the other hand, there is the obstacle of the high cost of new technologies.
    The challenge is to make these tools accessible to medium and small farmers, even
    considering that connectivity in the field is the main obstacle in remote areas.
    There is also a high investment in equipment and sensors. [6] observed that climate
    variables have a significant economic effect on wheat, corn, and rice yield. The
    authors found that moisture is beneficial to the three crops, with a 1% increase
    in the mean moisture during the growth stage increasing rice, wheat, and corn
    yield by 0.75, 0.96, and 0.61%, respectively. Thus, the concept of Smart Farm
    arises. It is a system composed of sensors that monitor climate, soil, plant,
    and machine variables, powered by solar energy and transmitting data in real-time
    to the Internet, and is considered a smart farm technology for farmers [7]. The
    use of smart farms is an innovative approach that aims to increase yield and quality
    of agricultural products, increase the quality of life of farmers, reduce the
    need for labor, pesticides, and fertilizers, and making possible to check the
    environment of crop and livestock life promptly, anytime and anywhere, based on
    accurate data on crop growth and environmental information [8]. Smart farms are
    characterized by a device network (sensors) connected to the internet. This concept
    is called the Internet of Things (IoT) and refers to the interconnection of physical
    objects (e.g., vehicles, buildings, embedded technology, and sensors) with the
    internet, allowing for device management. IoT technologies enable various devices
    for data collection, transmission, and storage, which can be analyzed and used
    in decision-making when combined with algorithms to support user control activities
    [4,8]. Climate change has been a threat to the agricultural sector in many countries
    due to its irreversible impacts on global agri-food production systems and ecosystems
    [9]. Therefore, the constant monitoring of temperature, air humidity, solar radiation,
    wind speed, and soil moisture in the cultivated fields is necessary. One of the
    ways to improve these concepts is to encourage the use of technologies associated
    with precision agriculture (PA). The three previous industrial revolutions profoundly
    transformed the agricultural industry from native to mechanized agriculture and
    the recent PA (Fig. 1). The industrial agriculture paradigm significantly improves
    yield, but a series of challenges have gradually emerged, which have worsened
    in recent years. Industry 4.0 is expected to reshape the agricultural sector and
    promote the fourth agricultural revolution, agriculture 4.0, or digital agriculture
    (DA) [10]. Among many of its branches, agriculture 4.0 uses sensors and equipment
    capable of monitoring in real-time climate and water conditions at all stages
    of a plant in a management zone (microclimate), from planting to harvesting, calculating
    the degree-days, evapotranspiration, and generating data and information that
    allow the producer to manage the crop in a localized way and avoid water deficit
    and pesticide application if possible. Download : Download high-res image (502KB)

    revolutions. Source: [10]. The availability of a wireless sensor network installed
    in the smart farm has led to obtaining a wide range of data (Big Data), resulting
    in the need for investments in a data management system (appropriate platform),
    storage, processing, visualization of information, and interaction of the data
    with the user [11]. After analysis, the collected information enables decision-making
    in real-time, besides predicting future needs, such as the need for water and
    irrigation systems [12]. Another aspect of climate monitoring is predicting the
    occurrence of pests and diseases and the development of management strategies
    [13]. The possibility of developing approaches that assist in decision making
    by the producer with the use of early warning systems or decision support systems
    has driven the development of monitoring systems through stations that enable
    the provision of early information about risks to crops related to seasonal factors,
    such as droughts and dry spells or even pests and disease vectors [14]. Temperature,
    precipitation, and humidity, among other climate factors, influence the occurrence
    of diseases and pests in crops, thus being crucial to an increase in the economic
    performance of this environment [15]. For instance, wheat is affected by various
    diseases worldwide, with pathogens being directly affected by climate conditions.
    Drought and high temperatures aggravate the interactions between wheat and its
    pathogens [13]. Global climate change is the current main challenge in intelligent
    monitoring of agrometeorological variables, as they have been changing the behavior
    of temperature distributions and precipitation distributions and variability during
    the seasons, making climate observation data insufficient for meteorological forecasts,
    as the climate has been behaving in a non-stationary manner, showing the need
    for monitoring and identifying local climate behavior patterns [16]. DA uses PA
    technology, smart networks, and data management tools. The objective of DA is
    to use all available information and knowledge to enable the automation of sustainable
    processes in agriculture. DA has achieved considerable development over the past
    two decades due to the availability of cheaper and more powerful sensors, actuators
    and microprocessors, high bandwidth cellular communication, cloud communication,
    and Big Data. Therefore, the flow of information comes from the used agricultural
    equipment and new services being offered with new algorithms, which transform
    data into valuable intelligence [17]. In this new DA paradigm, large amounts of
    data are made available, and the challenge is to add value to them with the insertion
    of data portals and work platforms. In data portals, end consumers can view their
    data without having to enter them manually. On the other hand, platforms allow
    consumers to transform data into new and more robust information. Thus, the passage
    from Agriculture 3.0, characterized by the use of PA, to Agriculture 4.0, as an
    evolution from PA to DA, requires the availability of specific portals and platforms.
    Therefore, Brazil needs to be aware of this technological evolution and make available
    free web platforms for integrating data, software, procedures, and methodologies
    for PA. The AgDataBox web platform (ADB) [18] is one of these technologies focused
    on DA. It is a platform that provides free computational tools for farmers, researchers,
    and service providers, mainly addressing PA practices. This platform integrates
    data, software, procedures, and methodologies to enable the growth of agricultural
    management in Brazil through free technologies. Fog Computing is a highly virtualized
    platform that provides computing, processing, storage, and communication services
    between end devices and the Cloud. Processing, storage, and communication resources
    are similar features in both Cloud and Fog. However, Fog acts at the edge of the
    network, close to the devices, helping to make decisions in real-time (seconds
    to minutes) or even in a few days, thus performing the temporary storage of data,
    unlike the Cloud, which has the permanent storage of data for months and years,
    which are the bases for service applications that help in decision making, such
    as Business Intelligence (BI) [19]. However, this definition implies some characteristics
    that make Fog a non-trivial extension of the Cloud, as [19] presented. Therefore,
    this study''s objective was to construct a Smart Farm computational architecture
    from the development of agrometeorological stations and assembly of connectivity
    infrastructure and local server for receiving, storing, and sending data to the
    ADB-IoT (AgDataBox-IoT) application of the ADB platform. Method details Web platform
    AgDataBox The AgDataBox (ADB) web platform (Fig. 2) has an Application Programming
    Interface (API), which consists of a set of resources accessible through the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for transferring requests and response messages expressed
    in JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. The ADB-API allows the interoperability
    of several applications in which data and processing routines are centralized.
    The following applications that consume ADB-API resources are under development:
    (1) ADB-Mobile; (2) ADB-Map; (3) ADB-Admin; (4) ADB-IoT [20,21]. Download : Download

    architecture design. AgDataBox-IoT (ADB-IOT) This module aims to develop networks
    of interconnected sensors for plant climate and water monitoring. The objective
    is to provide a software framework for collecting data from a sensor network installed
    in an agricultural area. These data are then made available in the Big Data of
    ADB-IoT. Computational architecture A computational architecture was built for
    the development of the ADB-IoT application, including hardware and software, which
    can be divided into four layers: (i) Data acquisition layer (Agrometeorological
    Stations – AgDataBox-IoT), (ii) Communication and transmission layer between the
    stations and the Data server, (iii) Data server, and (iv) API (Application Programming
    Interface)/AgDataBox for the data access (Fig. 4). These layers were developed
    independently to allow interoperability with other solutions/technologies in each
    layer (Fig. 3). Download : Download high-res image (394KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Hardware and software development layer scheme. The communication
    between the stations and the local server is performed through the MQTT (Message
    Queuing Telemetry Transport) protocol, connected through an Access Point TP-Link
    TL-WA721N installed at the height of 10 m in a communication tower located on
    the farm. The communication between the local server and server (http://adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br:3004)
    is carried out through the REST (Representational State Transfer) client/server
    architecture by sending the data in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format.
    Agrometeorogical station Architecture of scalar sensor node The agrometeorological
    station is composed of five main parts (Fig. 3): (i) processing, sensor data acquisition,
    and data transmission unit; (ii) analog-to-digital data conversion (ADC) module,
    which connects up to four analog sensors; (iii) I2C module, which allows data
    acquisition from up to four sensors with I2C output; (iv) One-Wire module, which
    allows data acquisition from the sensors and has a One-Wire output; and (v) MicroSD
    card module, which stores the collected data, being incorporated into the project
    for data security in case of lack of communication with the server. The station
    is powered by a DC source or solar battery system, supporting voltage between
    3.3 V up to 28 V (Fig. 4). Download : Download high-res image (597KB) Download

    station. Processing and communication unit The System on Chip ESP32 model ESP32-WROOM-32
    was used in the Processing and Communication Unit, consisting of a low-cost, low-power
    system with Wi-Fi (802.11 b/g/n/e/I 802.11n @ 2.4 GHz up to 150 Mbit/s) and Bluetooth
    (v4.2 BR/EDR Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). SoC ESP32 features a 240 MHz Tensilica
    Xtensa LX6 dual-core processor, Hall sensor, SD card interface, Ethernet, high
    SPI speed, UART, I2S, and I2C (Espressif). Wi-Fi 802.11 2.4 GHz was used for data
    transmission through the MQTT protocol. Analog interface The environmental parameters
    collected by the sensors, especially those of soil moisture and some meteorological
    ones, are analog, operating in the voltage range of 0–3.3 V. The ADS1115, which
    has four analog channels with 16-bit precision and a data rate from 8 Hz to 860
    Hz, was used for data acquisition from analog sensors. After conversion, the digitized
    data are made available through the I2C communication interface. I2C interface
    ESP32 already has the I2C interface natively, which allows the use of sensors
    and other devices that communicate through the I2C interface. The developed project
    foresees the connection of up to four I2C devices. One-wire interface Some sensors,
    such as the DS18B20, which measures temperature, communicate through a One-Wire
    interface, which has only two wires for its communication. Each device has a unique
    address, and the technology allows the connection of several devices/sensors on
    the same wire. Three DS18B20 sensors are being used in the project to measure
    soil temperature at different depths. Power unit The agrometeorological station
    is powered by a solar battery that can vary between 5 V and 28 V. Considering
    that SoC ESP32 operates at 3.3 V, the DC-DC voltage regulator LM2596–3.3 V was
    used to develop the power supply module, which allows a voltage input of up to
    40 V and an output of 3.3 V. Extra digital interfaces Four digital interfaces
    were incorporated into the project to allow the connection of other sensors or
    devices. Twenty PCB (Printed Circuit Board) units of the Agrometeorological Station
    were developed and produced (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (781KB)

    connection slot The climate conditions, especially air temperature, that occur
    throughout the crop cycle directly influenced the cultivar development, being
    possible to estimate when the crop development stages will occur when analyzing
    these events [22,23]. Climate variations such as relative humidity, air and soil
    temperature, rainfall, solar radiation, and photoperiod define the duration of
    the phenological phases of a crop, varying the number of days of the crop between
    regions, years, and sowing dates. The most important climate element to predict
    crop phenological events is the temperature, as long as there is no water deficit
    [24]. Several parameters were measured to monitor the microclimate of each management
    zone (Table 2). Table 2. Measured parameters (every minute) and used sensors.

    height of 10 m in a communication tower located on the farm owner''s house was
    used for the connection between the agrometeorological stations, WIFI Access Point
    (AP), AgDataBox-IoT local server, and the Internet. The communication between
    the local server and the server (http://adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br:3004) is carried
    out using the REST (Representational State Transfer) client/server architecture,
    sending the data in a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format. The longest distance
    between the Access Point and the station is approximately 500 m. The network topology
    is shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (702KB) Download : Download

    Considering that the availability of the Internet in rural areas can be a limiting
    factor for sending data to the ADB-IoT server, located in the data center of the
    Itaipu Technological Park (ITP), we decided to use computational resources close
    to IoT sensors for local data storage and pre-processing (ADB-IoT Local Server).
    It decreases the dependence on Internet connection as the local server stores
    the data locally and transmits it to the ADB-IoT server when it has an Internet
    link. This local server solution ensures greater reliability in data collection,
    allowing for further analysis for decision-making. However, edge devices cannot
    handle multiple IoT applications competing for their limited resources, which
    would result in resource contention and increase processing latency. Fog Computing
    (Fig. 7) integrates devices present at the edge of the network and Cloud resources,
    helping to overcome these limitations [25]. Download : Download high-res image

    source: adapted from Stojmenovic and Wen [26]. A Raspberry Pi 3 model B was used
    to develop the AgDataBox-IoT Local Server. It is a microcomputer the size of a
    credit card, which has a Cortex-A53 64-bit processor, with 4 cores, clock of 1.2
    GHz, 1GB RAM, and 802.11n wireless standard already built-in. The Raspberry Pi
    was responsible for providing pre-processing, storage, and communication close
    to the devices, that is, locally, acting as an MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport) broker, being used the Mosca broker (MQTT) and implemented in Node.js.
    The MySQL database configured on the Raspberry Pi was used to store the data locally.
    The MQTT protocol was used through a wireless network for communication between
    the stations and the broker. It was chosen because it is a light and flexible
    protocol, with low energy consumption, besides being prominent in several IoT
    applications. Two APIs were developed for the server also in Node.js, both working
    in the cloud (adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br). The first one is for receiving data aiming
    to provide communication, in addition to processing and storing the information
    coming from the fog, and the other to manipulate the information from the agrometeorological
    stations, their sensors, and readings of these sensors, besides making all this
    information available to the user. For this, a Database was defined with the following
    Entity-Relationship model (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (338KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Flowchart of the entity-relationship
    database model. The sending of data from the stations is carried out through port
    3000 and REST/JSON protocol, in which the sensor data and acquisition date and
    time are sent. The API includes the date and time the data was received. Thus,
    the delay between receiving data from the stations and the time for storage on
    the server can be evaluated. Also, it is possible to monitor if there was a drop
    in the farm''s internet connection and the time required for data recovery/synchronism.
    API (Application programming interface)/agdatabox An API was developed as a form
    of integration with the AgDataBox platform, especially the AgDataBox-Admin module,
    operating on port 3001, allowing the register of new stations, sensors, and access
    to data stored on the AgDataBox-IoT Server (adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br). The methods
    above allow accessing the data stored on the smartfarm.unioeste-foz.br server
    to consult the mean, maximum, and minimum temperature of station 25 on November
    8, 2020, for example. The command and result are shown in Chart 1. Chart 1. Route
    and result for one-day temperature summary access. http://adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br:3002/estacoes/25/tipo_sensores/1/resumo_dia?&data=2020–11–08

    were carried out in an electronic spreadsheet. The data were tabulated in ten-day
    periods. Subsequently, a descriptive analysis of the data collected from agrometeorological
    stations was carried out. The parameters mean, standard deviation and coefficient
    of variation were calculated for the 10 stations installed in the area and each
    delimited management zone. Study area Eleven agrometeorological stations (Fig.
    9) were installed in a 17.9-ha area located in the municipality of Céu Azul-PR,
    with central coordinates of 25°07′08.50″ S and 53°50′10.51″ W. The soil in the
    region is classified as a typic Dystroferric Red Latosol [27], and the field has
    been cultivated under a no-tillage system for at least 15 years, with commercial
    soybean, corn, and wheat crops are grown in succession. The region has a subtropical
    climate (Cfa), with a mean temperature in the coldest month below 18 °C (mesothermal)
    and a mean temperature in the hottest month above 22 °C, in addition to hot summers,
    infrequent frosts, and a tendency for rain concentration in the summer months,
    but with no defined dry season. Download : Download high-res image (724KB) Download

    The location determined for each station''s installation (Fig. 10) was determined
    using the AgDataBox application – Sensor from the ADB platform Bazzi et al. [28]
    through elevation data. The Fuzzy C-Means algorithm allowed determining the ideal
    locations for at least two stations in each of the four zones. The division into
    four management zones was found in Schenatto et al. [29], using altitude (m) and
    soil penetration resistance 0–0.1 m (MPa). Download : Download high-res image

    station architecture Fig. 11 shows the architectures of the agrometeorological
    stations developed throughout the project. An advance was observed in the construction
    of stations between 2018 and 2020, as the station installed in 2018 had a simpler
    architecture (Fig. 11a). An electronic board for data collection was developed
    based on the existing Squitter rain gauge and using the Wemos mini d1 module,
    which has an Espressif ESP8266 System on Chip (SoC). However, despite meeting
    the requirements for the collection of climate data, it presented reading problems
    during field tests, especially in the reading of rainfall, as the rain gauge was
    installed at the top of the station, which was influenced by the wind, resulting
    in erroneous readings when wind gusts occurred, besides and poor contact at the
    sensor connectors. Improvements were made in the second version of the electronic
    design, which was developed in 2019 (Fig. 11b), with changes in the connector
    model to ensure better reliability and reduce failures in sensor readings. It
    was also installed a rain gauge on an exclusive basis, resulting in a more reliable
    reading, as the wind gust less influences it. However, similarly to the 2018 version,
    its installation in the field required a team of at least 2–3 people and the use
    of stakes. Finally, several improvements were made in the 2020 version (Fig. 11c),
    with the replacement of SoC ESP8266 by a higher- processing-capacity SoC ESP32,
    the development of a new electronic project (Fig. 7) using the components in SMD
    (Surface Mounted Device) format, making the project more reliable and professional
    (product), the use of more compact solar panel and batteries, the ability to install
    several sensors (Table 2), and the mechanical design, which allows its installation
    by a single person without the need to install stakes in the station. Download

    Table 3 shows the count, sum, and mean data acquired by the stations from June
    2019 to December 2020. It evidences one of the significant problems when working
    with data measured in agrometeorological stations, which consists of the data
    incompleteness due to equipment failure in case of an automated system or adverse
    conditions, which may damage the station [30]. Table 3. Overall characteristics

    of 575 days of analysis had no data acquisition by any of the stations. Moreover,
    station 20 obtained data collection for 547 days. Considering that the stations
    did not always stop working simultaneously, the number of days without information
    was even smaller. Using more than one station in close regions minimizes this
    data loss effect and provides data with greater consistency, ensuring continuous
    data collection, without acquisition failures due to station failure, disregarding
    external factors such as power outages or the fall of stations due to gales. Some
    of the stations had a lower total of days with data, showing failures in data
    collection. In this sense, station 27 presented 340 days with data, possibly due
    to problems. Fig. 12 shows some of the events that interfered with the total number
    of days with data from some stations. Download : Download high-res image (883KB)

    processes, and stores them in the local database (MySQL). Then, after storing
    the data locally, the ADB-IoT local server connects via REST protocol to the ADB-IoT
    server through an API developed for this purpose, sending the data to the server
    after performing the authentication and verification that the data had already
    been sent and deleting them from the local database after receiving the confirmation
    of success. This process is repeated every time the local server receives some

    being implemented in a compatible format as a sample grid layer in AgDataBox-Map,
    facilitating the use of climate data in the delineation of Management Zones. An
    API was developed to integrate with the ADB platform, especially the ADB-Admin
    application, operating on port 3002, registering new stations and sensors, and
    accessing data stored on the ADB-IoT server (adb-iot.unioestefoz.br:3002). AgDataBox-IOT-API
    (ADB-IOT-API) The API located at http://adb-iot.unioeste-foz.br:3002/[+rota] allows
    the interoperability between systems; that is, any application or web service
    can access the data from stations, allowing the integration of climate data by
    other platforms or applications. The authentication module, which will guarantee
    that only authorized users will access the API, is in the final phase of implementation.
    This API allows the data collected from the stations and the calculations/methods
    implemented from the data to be consulted. Station data analysis The relative
    air humidity is an essential parameter in agriculture, as it assists in determining
    predictions of pest and disease infestation. In general, periods of high relative
    humidity favor disease development [31]. In addition, this measurement helps to
    determine the appropriate time for pesticide application, such as the ideal relative
    humidity condition above 60% for the spraying operation [32]. The ten-day measurements
    mean for all stations installed in the area (Fig. 17) presented relative air humidity
    values ranging from 70 to 90%. The coefficient of variation (CV) showed low variability
    in the data collected by the stations, with a maximum of 2%, but most of the observed
    data presented CV values below 1%. The standard deviation bars show small distances,
    indicating a slight deviation of the values relative to the mean, demonstrating
    that the measurements were efficient. However, the data that presented higher
    CV values are observed at the beginning of the measurement cycle (third ten-day
    period), probably due to the improvement carried out in the stations during the
    tests. Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download : Download full-size

    (Fig. 18) was also measured and evaluated, with values ranging from 16 to 24 °C.
    The CV for this parameter is below 3.5% throughout the measurement period, with
    most data showing CV below 1.5%. The highest CV values are observed at the beginning
    of the measurement cycle (sixth ten-day period), as observed for the relative
    humidity measurements. Download : Download high-res image (186KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 18. Statistical parameters of agrometeorological stations
    regarding average temperature. Temperature is one of the main factors influencing
    crop development, and its association with relative air humidity has a combined
    effect; that is, humidity helps the crop retain water content, but high temperatures
    make this process difficult [33]. Moreover, knowing the temperature at the time
    of pesticide application is crucial for success in reaching the target. Temperatures
    above 30 °C can induce plants to stress, making pesticide absorption and translocation
    difficult, while temperatures lower than 10 °C also lead to losses regarding application
    efficiency [32]. Station data analysis by management zone Management zones (MZs)
    are delimited sub-areas within a field, allowing for uniform individual management.
    They are based on spatial studies of soil and plant variables and used for fertilizer
    application, soil management, and irrigation on a localized scale after their
    establishment [34,35]. Moreover, MZs can be influenced by several factors [35],
    making the spatial study of climate conditions necessary to test their degree
    of influence on other variables and verify their variability in a given plot.

    mean temperature by management zone (MZ). The mean relative humidity values of
    MZs show similar behavior to the curves, evidencing a low variability in the area.
    Furthermore, only MZ1 presented a CV value close to 4%. It is due to a data collection
    failure in one of the stations in the third ten-day period. The other MZs showed
    CV values lower than 2%, indicating good data uniformity. The mean temperature
    curve of each MZ had similar characteristics, indicating a little spatial variability
    in the area, as observed for relative humidity (Fig. 21). The standard deviation
    bars on the graphs show that the measurements are generally close to the mean.
    The CV values presented from the seventh ten-day period are lower than 1.5%, indicating
    higher stability in the measurements from this period. This behavior is due to
    data collection failures in the initial measurement cycle. This effect indicates
    that the installation of several agrometeorological stations did not present significant
    variability, demonstrating the possibility of monitoring the area with only one
    station. However, the area has a relatively small extension (15 ha) and does not
    have a steep slope, with the mean elevation of MZ1 being 633 m (altitude), which
    is the lowest portion of the area, with 647 m referring to MZ4. Download : Download

    and future work The computational architecture developed, and the low-cost stations
    made it possible to acquire, transmit, store and process data without significant
    losses, except in sporadic events of severe weather events. The sensors used,
    for the most part, already reading their data through the I2C digital interface,
    showed outstanding durability and accuracy in the readings since none of them
    had defects during the project, and one of the factors that contributed was the
    self-calibration capacity of these sensors, which are of the state-of-the-art,
    reducing the need for laboratory calibration. The installed stations allowed the
    collection of data with low CV, indicating the accuracy of the temperature sensors
    used, and in the 15 ha experiment area, there was no significant difference in
    temperature between the Management Zones. However, in the first ten days, they
    presented the highest CV values, which decreased over time, showing the improvement
    of the stations. The AgDataBox-IoT module needs new adjustments for the data filtering
    to facilitate the use of data by the user. It is necessary to add filters regarding
    the date, the data analysis period (ten-day periods, for example), and the amount
    of data collected daily. It is suggested that the integration of the AgDataBox-IoT
    and AgDataBox-MAP modules enables data analysis from both platforms without the
    need for download and upload, besides allowing downloading files in shapefile
    format. Studying data communication alternatives between stations and the local
    server, such as Lorawan, would allow broader coverage. For example, using a 2.4
    GHz WIFI technology, it was possible to reach a radius of 600 m between the station
    and the communication tower, but it is expected that with LoraWan, this range
    could be 10 km or more. Ethics statements The method discussed in this scientific
    article did not involve studies with humans, animals, or the use of platform data.

    use 1. Introduction Interconnected devices are now becoming even more popular
    to simplify and enhance various applications in the context of Industry 4.0. Some
    major examples of smart interconnected devices utilization are smart cities, smart
    industry, and smart agriculture applications. In these applications, a set of
    devices collecting and processing data communicate with each other to fulfill
    the purposes of each application. For instance, in a smart city ecosystem, the
    smart infrastructure equipment interacts with the corresponding sensors on smart
    vehicles to improve the autonomous vehicle driving experience and safety. All
    the above applications are enabled by technologies such as the Internet of things
    (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence (AI). The solution proposed
    in this work combines the preceding technologies with particular emphasis on smart
    agriculture applications. Smart agriculture is the process of incorporating smart
    technologies and interconnected devices into agriculture, in order to improve
    the production yield both in terms of quality and in terms of quantity, by utilizing
    data collected from sensors and smart devices deployed on the field. Some common
    examples of smart agriculture practices are smart irrigation systems, crop monitoring
    systems, and plant disease prevention mechanisms, among others [1]. An example
    of a smart agriculture application is the utilization of sensors along with the
    technologies of the Internet of things and machine learning for agricultural produce
    growth monitoring and plant disease forecasting purposes [2]. In essence, the
    benefits of applying smart agriculture techniques are multiple, with farmers saving
    valuable time and resources while consumers have real-time access to quality agricultural
    products. One fundamental technology supporting smart agriculture is the Internet
    of things. In the concept of the Internet of things, every device possible, beyond
    personal computers, has computational capabilities along with internet connectivity
    [3]. These IoT devices might be sensors and smart appliances in a smart home or
    in a smart city environment. The concept of the IoT can be applied in a plethora
    of use cases such as smart industry, smart cities, and smart agriculture [3].
    This results in real-time monitoring and minimized human intervention on various
    tasks via data acquisition, process automation, and device control over long distances.
    The Internet of multimedia things (IoMT) [4] represents an evolutionary step beyond
    traditional IoT by integrating various sensors and devices capable of collecting
    and processing multimodal information, such as audio, video, and sensor data.
    The IoMT expands the horizons of data collection and process automation by enabling
    devices to not only capture traditional data like temperature and humidity but
    also engage with rich multimedia content. This advancement allows for a deeper
    understanding of the environment, enabling applications in areas like smart cities,
    healthcare, industrial automation, and agriculture. The ability of the IoMT to
    harness and process diverse data types offers a powerful foundation for informed
    decision-making and innovative solutions in an increasingly connected and multimedia-rich
    world. An important chapter in the IoT research is the utilization of wireless
    sensor networks (WSNs). A wireless sensor network is a key component for many
    IoT applications and consists of a group of sensor devices measuring local environmental
    conditions and acting as nodes. These sensor devices are deployed over a large
    field either randomly or following a predefined topology and they forward their
    sensor readings to the gateway node of the network for further data processing.
    Each sensor node device is equipped with a microcontroller unit (MCU) along with
    a wireless communication module for data transmission in the network, and various
    sensors are used for local conditions’ monitoring [5]. Wireless sensor networks
    are utilized in various applications such as smart energy grids, environmental
    monitoring, and smart cities [6]. For the support of the communication between
    the nodes on a wireless sensor network, different wireless technologies are used
    depending on the application. On the one hand, short-range wireless technologies
    such as Wi-Fi and ZigBee support the deployment of a wireless sensor network on
    a smaller scale with a maximum wireless range of 100 m [7]. For example, a short-range
    wireless sensor network can be deployed on a smart industry facility. On the other
    hand, long-range wireless technologies such as LoRa, NB-IoT, or other LPWAN technologies
    support wireless communication over long distances with low energy consumption.
    On a long-range wireless sensor network, the distance between two nodes can reach
    up to a few kilometers [7]. These long-range wireless communications are utilized
    in applications such as precision agriculture, in which battery-powered devices
    are deployed over large agricultural fields, and therefore, as we present a smart
    agriculture use-case, this work focuses on large-scale LoRa wireless sensor networks
    covering long distances. On a wireless sensor network, data are forwarded in packets
    or messages between the nodes of the network in order to reach the gateway node.
    For efficient data forwarding achievement, a routing protocol must be implemented
    on the wireless sensor network [8]. For data routing purposes in the wireless
    sensor network model proposed in this work, the Chord protocol for peer-to-peer
    (P2P) systems [9,10,11] was selected. Chord is a distributed hash table (DHT),
    in which any hashed key belongs to a fixed circular hash space with m-bit addresses
    and 2 𝑚 maximum keys [9,10]. This hash space contains nodes and keys, with the
    basic Chord property dictating that each key is mapped on its successor node on
    the ring [9]. Each node on the network is only aware of its successor and predecessor
    node along with a set of a few other nodes on the network, also known as “fingers”
    [9]. Chord is a self-stabilizing model that supports node joins and departures
    on the network while maintaining stability and operation [9], making it ideal
    on a wireless sensor network use case in which nodes are powered by batteries
    and may leave the network if a battery runs out. A very important operation of
    Chord is the support of lookup queries. On the execution of a lookup query, Chord
    retrieves efficiently the corresponding node that holds the requested key by forwarding
    the query to the other nodes of the network. The Lookup query on the Chord protocol
    can be resolved in logarithmic computational complexity. In this work, the initial
    methodology of the WiCHORD protocol from [12], which is an adaptation of the Chord
    protocol from [9] for P2P LoRa wireless sensor networks, is extended in detail
    in order to implement an overlay for wireless sensor networks. These sensor networks
    are suitable to be deployed in precision agriculture applications, where the benefits
    of WiCHORD such as its energy efficiency, network stability, and sensor node lookup
    query efficiency can be utilized due to the nature of such applications. Additionally,
    a representative case study of the utilization of the proposed extended WiCHORD
    protocol for wireless sensor networks in a precision agriculture ecosystem is
    presented. This case study is an applications ecosystem by the name “VineLink
    Monitoring” that can utilize the proposed WiCHORD overlay in agriculture. The
    application ecosystem includes the implementation and deployment of a LoRa wireless
    sensor network, suitable for the WiCHORD protocol overlay, over a vineyard field
    located in Central Greece, which monitors the environmental conditions of the
    vineyard using the onboard sensors in real time. Then, the recorded data are stored
    in a database on the cloud to be presented to the user via a dedicated Web dashboard
    application. Finally, the recorded sensor data consisting of value pairs of vineyard
    temperature and humidity are used to train some machine learning models capable
    of predicting the occurrence and incubation period of the grape downy mildew plant
    disease that is quite common in vineyards. The contributions of this work are
    the following. First, this work extends and implements a P2P distributed overlay
    for wireless sensor networks from [12], based on the Chord protocol from [9],
    which ensures the stability of the wireless sensor network when sensor node devices
    join or leave the network. Also, the proposed protocol from [12] extended in this
    work can perform efficient lookup queries to locate a given sensor node device
    within the sensor network. Due to the decentralized nature of the proposed solution,
    it is considered that the execution of the join, leave, and lookup operations
    of the WiCHORD protocol from [12] on a wireless sensor network only uses a small
    subset of the total network nodes, and therefore, it is deemed that the energy
    consumption of the devices on the wireless sensor network is significantly reduced,
    which is important since the sensor devices of the network rely mostly on batteries
    for power. Apart from the reduction in the energy consumption on the wireless
    sensor network, the lookup operation of the WiCHORD protocol from [12] lets the
    user efficiently query a given sensor node device by its unique MAC address and
    retrieve the current sensor data and status of this sensor node device. In essence,
    the aim of this work is to extend the methodology of [12] and verify its efficiency
    via simulation. The structure of the remainder of this work is as follows. Initially,
    in Section 2, a literature review on the fields of the Internet of things, big
    data systems, and smart agriculture systems is performed. Next, in Section 3,
    the proposed methodology of an enhanced adaptation of the Chord P2P protocol on
    wireless sensor networks using LoRa technology is presented. In Section 4, a representative
    case study of utilizing the proposed Chord-based wireless sensor network on a
    precision agriculture application in vineyards is shown. Section 5 presents simulation
    results regarding the performance of the proposed Chord-based WSN model. Section
    6 presents the discussion regarding this work. Finally, in Section 7, concluding
    remarks and future directions of this work are given. 2. Background and Related
    Work This section presents a comprehensive literature review of the sources explored
    during the research conducted within the context of this study. The main focus
    of this study is to investigate the innovative applications and infrastructures
    in agriculture, specifically emphasizing the integration of the Internet of things,
    peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, and machine learning (ML) techniques. To provide a
    comprehensive analysis, the bibliographic references are organized into subcategories
    that connect with the key knowledge domains related to the conjunction of agriculture,
    IoT, P2P systems, and ML progression. 2.1. Peer-to-Peer Systems and Internet of
    Things In exploring the domain of peer-to-peer (P2P) systems, a detailed literature
    review was undertaken, beginning with themes of a general nature that pertained
    to P2P systems such as distributed hash tables (DHTs) and extending to the incorporation
    of P2P systems in the context of IoT. To elaborate, as previously described, a
    P2P network is characterized by a network topology where all participating nodes,
    or peers, share equivalent responsibilities and collaborate by sharing computational
    resources [13]. Several widely used applications of P2P systems include the implementation
    of routing protocols to facilitate content discovery and sharing across nodes,
    as well as the application of load-balancing strategies to distribute workload
    equitably among participating nodes [14,15]. In the context of P2P applications
    involving content sharing, the concept of routing becomes crucial. Routing pertains
    to the process whereby a search query must be reliably addressed with respect
    to the node that hosts the requested data [14]. Following this, the principle
    of load balancing involves the fair assignment of stored objects across the nodes
    of a P2P system, as mentioned in [15]. A particularly noteworthy subclass of P2P
    systems encompasses distributed hash tables (DHTs) [16]. Unlike conventional hash
    tables, DHTs function by storing keys across nodes within a dynamic network. The
    dynamic nature of distributed hash tables (DHTs) permits nodes to seamlessly join
    or leave the network anytime, ensuring stability, while also facilitating key
    lookup queries distributed among the nodes [15]. Examples of widely implemented
    DHT structures include but are not limited to Chord, Pastry, Kademlia, CAN, and
    Tapestry [16]. This work focuses primarily on the distributed hash table known
    as Chord [9], where a modified and advanced version has been developed for wireless
    sensor networks, as discussed in [12]. However, in addition to Chord, various
    significant DHT algorithms were also considered. For example, Pastry [17] operates
    similarly to Chord in its mapping of keys to nearby nodes and in its requirement
    for each node to only be aware of a subset of the other nodes in the network.
    Contrarily, Kademlia [18] differentiates itself from Chord in its method of calculating
    the distance between two nodes in the network by using the binary XOR operation
    [16]. The adaptation of distributed hash tables from peer-to-peer systems to applications
    within the Internet of things, such as wireless sensor networks (WSNs), presents
    a topic of considerable interest, particularly in serving purposes such as routing
    messages among sensor nodes [19]. At this point, various efforts have been made,
    with a particular focus on the Chord protocol for distributed hash tables being
    applied in wireless sensor networks. The inaugural application of a sensor network
    utilizing the Chord protocol, as introduced in [20], involves a scheme where sensor
    nodes are grouped into clusters based on physical location, with the cluster head
    selected by the other nodes in the cluster based on energy levels. In the application
    of Chord within this sensor network, as described in [20], the cluster nodes act
    as keys, with the cluster heads operating within Chord’s circular hashing space.
    This results in a streamlined routing of messages from the individual sensor nodes,
    via the cluster heads, directly to the base station, serving as the final destination.
    A similar approach by the same authors as [20], considering the energy levels
    of sensor nodes, is presented in [21]. This approach reiterates the relevance
    of energy efficiency, further highlighting the potential for the utilization of
    distributed hash tables, and the Chord protocol specifically, within wireless
    sensor networks. In [22], an innovative application of the Chord protocol is introduced,
    designed to facilitate the connection between a sensor network and the Internet
    for executing search queries. This method effectively leverages Chord’s inherent
    properties while simultaneously adopting a two-tiered hierarchy within the sensor
    network, organizing nodes into primary and secondary tiers, to optimize the routing
    of search queries across the network. The study conducted by the researchers in
    [23] takes inspiration from the Chord protocol to design an ingenious peer-to-peer
    routing scheme. This novel mechanism introduces significant enhancements in terms
    of data management operations. It not only supports traditional functions such
    as updating and deleting data within the sensor network but also ushers in a fresh
    perspective by suggesting an organizational structure for the sensor network based
    on the nodes’ physical positions. This location-based organization of nodes potentially
    facilitates more efficient communication, data sharing, and network management,
    promising a significant step forward in the domain of sensor networks. Expanding
    on the varied utilization of the Chord protocol, ref. [24] presents a novel application
    in the realm of sensor networks, spatial positioning of objects, and edge computing.
    The conceptualized system utilizes sensor networks to precisely determine the
    geographical location of various objects, while edge computing provides the computational
    energy required for rapid, localized data processing. Following a similar trajectory,
    ref. [25] introduces an effective utilization of peer-to-peer systems for wireless
    sensor networks. This approach encompasses the facilitation of data exchange—both
    transmission and reception—amongst the network nodes. The introduction of this
    system represents an essential progress in wireless sensor network communication,
    as it promotes efficiency and robustness while ensuring seamless data exchange.
    These innovations, as proposed by [24,25], signify the potential and versatility
    of the Chord protocol in various applications, contributing meaningfully to the
    evolving landscape of IoT technologies. The application of distributed hash tables
    in wireless sensor networks has been a popular solution for data routing, especially
    in the context of IoT environments. However, these systems represent only a facet
    of the wide array of possible applications of peer-to-peer (P2P) technologies
    within wireless sensor networks. The energy efficiency concern within these networks,
    for example, is addressed by a methodology proposed in [26]. This approach enables
    a node within the sensor network to locate and delegate a query to other nodes
    possessing higher energy levels, especially when the querying node’s energy state
    is nearing depletion. Thus, this method aids in preserving the sustainability
    of the network’s energy resources, which is paramount for the longevity and efficiency
    of sensor networks. Importantly, the foundation of this energy management method
    owes its conception to the methodologies detailed in [27], demonstrating the interconnected
    evolution of P2P solutions within sensor networks. Ultimately, peer-to-peer systems
    have a significant potential and can be utilized in a wide range of ways, especially
    in the context of Internet-of-things applications. As a case in point, ref. [28]
    proposes the development of an IoT application that exploits peer-to-peer systems.
    This not only demonstrates the utility of such systems but also opens a promising
    avenue for future exploration in this dynamic area. 2.2. Machine Learning Techniques
    in Precision Agriculture and Agricultural Sector The integration of machine learning
    (ML) techniques into the agricultural sector heralds a transformative era marked
    by precision and resilience. The combination provides an effective strategy for
    addressing some of agriculture’s most complex problems, such as the hazards of
    climate change, the increasing population, and the continuing difficulty of guaranteeing
    global food security. One key area where ML finds substantial application is precision
    agriculture (PA), a sophisticated approach that employs ML algorithms to scrutinize
    extensive and varied datasets derived from disparate sources such as satellite
    images, soil sensors, weather forecast systems, and drone technology. This data
    analysis underpins evidence-based decision-making, empowering agriculturists to
    streamline resource distribution, magnify crop yields, and minimize detrimental
    environmental impacts. For example, ML can provide accurate crop yield predictions
    and early warnings for potential pest invasions or disease outbreaks, facilitating
    preventive measures and reducing potential losses. Moreover, within the realm
    of resilient agriculture, ML plays a crucial role in forecasting the impact of
    climate fluctuations on agricultural output. These predictive insights serve as
    the basis for the creation of adaptive farming practices and the cultivation of
    resilient crop species, fostering an agricultural system robust enough to withstand
    the unpredictable nature of climatic shifts. Therefore, the interplay between
    ML techniques and agriculture presents a profound opportunity to significantly
    improve the effectiveness and resilience of global agricultural systems, becoming
    an indispensable component of sustainable agricultural development. One of its
    noteworthy applications is precision agriculture (PA), where ML algorithms diligently
    analyze a diverse range of data derived from a multitude of sources such as satellite
    imagery, soil sensors, weather forecasting systems, and drones. By processing
    this vast corpus of data, ML enables informed decision-making in agriculture,
    promoting the effective use of resources, amplifying crop yields, and reducing
    environmental footprint. Furthermore, it facilitates the prediction of crop yields
    with a remarkable accuracy and provides early warnings for potential pest invasions
    or disease outbreaks, which allows for preemptive actions and the mitigation of
    potential losses [29]. Similarly, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have become
    an indispensable tool for precision agriculture. Their ability to gather real-time
    data has proved beneficial for various agricultural tasks such as spraying, monitoring,
    yield estimation, and weed detection [30]. While their usage has been extensive
    in outdoor farming, opportunities for their application in controlled environments
    such as greenhouses remain largely untapped. The advent of advanced wireless sensor
    network (WSN) technologies, such as LoRaWAN, has opened up new horizons for precision
    agriculture in greenhouses by providing sustainable solutions for resource management
    and yield quality enhancement [31]. For instance, Goel et al. highlight the significance
    of precision agriculture, demonstrating how machine learning algorithms can automate
    farmers’ expertise to enhance field management and increase crop yield [32]. This
    method involves data collection from various instruments such as sensors, drones,
    and other advanced devices, followed by the integration of diverse ML algorithms
    for informed decision-making. With these innovations, farmers can monitor their
    fields in real time, quickly detect weeds and insects, schedule watering more
    efficiently, and much more. By optimizing resources and increasing productivity,
    precision agriculture is instrumental in helping farmers meet the growing global
    demand for food. In this domain, machine learning offers solutions for crop and
    soil management, weather prediction, efficient water use, and even postharvest
    procedures. Also, another example of machine learning and data mining techniques
    utilization in a greenhouse is shown in [33]. Edge intelligence and TinyML, underscored
    by recent studies [34,35,36], emerge as essential technological improvements with
    the potential to significantly reshape precision agriculture, increasing its efficiency
    and productivity. By processing data locally, edge computing systems not only
    enhance the reliability of complex communication protocols but also encourage
    further improvements in precision agriculture methodologies. This integrative
    approach to data processing and analysis ultimately uplifts the precision agriculture
    paradigm [34]. The combination of AIoT with modern technologies, notably smart
    sensors, and cloud computation, represents a paradigm shift towards improved agricultural
    techniques [37]. AgriFusion, as detailed in [38], is an illustrative architectural
    framework that incorporates the combination of IoT and emergent technologies based
    on a comprehensive survey of precision agriculture. Furthermore, unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAVs) are essential to collecting detailed field imagery, with edge
    intelligence providing a prompt data analysis [39]. In addition, TinyML’s ability
    to incorporate AI within sensors provides solutions for energy conservation while
    addressing common privacy, security, and latency issues, as well as reducing the
    sensor’s battery consumption [40]. These kinds of implementations also serve security
    purposes, as demonstrated by their capacity to identify animals near farmland
    [41]. In essence, using edge intelligence together with TinyML can lead to better
    food production, make farming practices more efficient, and support a more sustainable
    agricultural industry. While the integration of AIoT and TinyML offers foundational
    improvements to agricultural processes, there are also specialized advancements
    in machine learning that further refine precision agriculture techniques. Adding
    another layer of sophistication, novel techniques like “LettuceTrack”, a state-of-the-art
    multiple-object tracking (MOT) method, have been developed. This method has the
    ability to simultaneously detect and track individual plants, aiding the precise
    application of liquid fertilizer and pesticide through agricultural robots. It
    effectively reduces the quantity of chemicals sprayed, presenting a more economical
    and environmentally friendly solution compared to conventional indiscriminate
    spraying methods [42]. Such innovative ML applications underscore its potential
    in shaping a more resilient and efficient agricultural sector. 2.3. Applications
    of Machine Learning Algorithms in Agriculture The use of machine learning techniques
    and algorithms in various sectors has seen a remarkable surge, largely due to
    their potential to extract insightful knowledge from data. The unique demands
    of the problem at hand and the anticipated outcome drive the selection of the
    technique, such as regression, clustering, and classification, among others [43,44].
    This recognition of machine learning’s diverse array of techniques and algorithms
    is a pivotal stepping stone in comprehending its profound role and transformative
    potential in the field of agricultural technology. Various machine learning algorithms
    have gained widespread application in the agricultural sector, with each algorithm
    demonstrating unique functionalities while providing notable contributions. This
    extensive collection encompasses decision tree models, such as the random forest,
    extending to complex neural networks that emulate human cognitive functionalities.
    These pioneering algorithms have played a pivotal role in effecting a transformative
    overhaul of agricultural practices, thereby facilitating marked enhancements in
    productivity and operational outcomes. The adaptability of machine learning techniques
    is demonstrated by a particular adaptation of the well-known k-nearest neighbors
    (k-NN) algorithm. Traditionally, k-NN is employed for categorizing data within
    a dataset based on the relative distances among different samples within the set.
    In a distinctive approach [45], the conventional k-NN model is aptly customized
    to accommodate multidimensional data, thus broadening its applicability to cater
    to more complex data structures. This ability to adjust and adapt to varied data
    structures underscores the versatility of machine learning as a potent tool for
    data analysis and interpretation. The random forest algorithm, a preeminent decision
    tree model, has been harnessed extensively within the agricultural sector, particularly
    in the areas of crop yield prediction and plant disease detection. This ensemble
    learning methodology constructs a multitude of decision trees during the training
    phase, culminating in a prediction that reflects either the mode of the classes
    (classification) or the mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees [46].
    A distinct asset of the random forest algorithm is its proficiency in decoding
    intricate patterns hidden within complex, multivariate agricultural datasets,
    thereby enabling accurate predictions of pivotal outcomes such as crop yield or
    disease manifestation [46]. This aptitude equips random forest with the capacity
    to provide an unparalleled degree of precision and predictive power in the domains
    of agricultural planning and disease control. Further empirical evidence corroborates
    the robust applicability and remarkable versatility of the random forest algorithm
    within the agricultural landscape. Distinct studies bear testament to this assertion.
    In a similar scope, Wu’s study showcased the dexterity of this algorithm by successfully
    extracting and mapping diverse forest types in Northern China utilizing an array
    of multisource data [47]. Notably, a study by Kumar et al. utilized random forest
    for the ambitious task of predicting soil fertility. The results not only graded
    soil for crop recommendation but also signaled a paradigm shift towards data-driven,
    predictive agriculture [48]. 2.4. Smart Agriculture Applications for Vineyards
    and Wineries: Types, Operations, and Benefits The integration of smart agriculture
    applications is increasingly becoming essential for winery operations, offering
    a range of operational benefits. Such tools provide valuable insights into real-time
    environmental factors like vine health and soil moisture. As a result, wineries
    can make more accurate decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and harvest
    timings [49]. Furthermore, precise resource management, encompassing the optimized
    use of water, fertilizers, and pesticides is possible, leading to a reduction
    in waste and an increase in yield [50]. Recent studies highlight the transformative
    role of smart agriculture in the winery sector. Tardáguila’s research et al. delve
    into the use of sensing technologies combined with artificial intelligence, illustrating
    their potential in optimizing grape cultivation and refining wine production processes
    [51]. Sarri et al. introduce precision agriculture methods, suggesting they can
    be crucial in enhancing wine farm management [52]. Building on this, Oreški et
    al. highlight the avenue of employing machine learning techniques, especially
    in predicting wine quality [53]. Furthermore, Vela et al.’s study underscore the
    significance of conducting energy audits in wineries [54]. They propose that there
    are opportunities for energy conservation, notably through the adoption of efficient
    chillers and the integration of adjustable-speed pumps [54]. Applying the capabilities
    of the use of precision agriculture vineyard and winery-specific intelligent agriculture
    techniques improves production quality and efficiency in operation. This transformation
    depends extensively on the Internet of things, automation, image analysis, artificial
    intelligence, and robotics [55,56,57]. Expanding our knowledge of the various
    applications, we can cite the following: Vineyard health insights: IoT sensors
    strategically deployed provide in-depth insights into the health and vitality
    of vineyard produce. This detailed information aids producers in optimizing various
    phases of production, resulting in more effective and targeted vineyard treatments
    [55]. Environmental parameter analytics: Cost-effective IoT devices collect crucial
    environmental data points, such as temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. This
    information is subsequently incorporated into complex algorithmic models designed
    to predict and prevent potential agricultural diseases [58]. Automated vineyard
    navigation: Autonomous navigation of robots in vineyards poses unique challenges
    due to the need to avoid damaging grapes. A newly proposed algorithm addresses
    this challenge by leveraging Lidar sensor data and not relying on GPS. The algorithm
    enables safe robot navigation in vineyards by deftly handling dynamic obstacles,
    such as moving people, and ensuring that the robot’s positions remain smooth without
    sudden stops or sharp turns. Tests in both simulations and actual vineyards have
    confirmed its efficiency, suggesting its potential for smooth integration into
    vineyard robots [59]. Machine learning and computer vision can also be combined
    to enable autonomous navigation of vineyards using only camera sensors. This method
    is valuable for vineyards, orchards, and other agricultural settings [60]. In
    addition, a vision-based autonomous navigation system was developed for agricultural
    robots to navigate in trellised cropping systems, such as vineyards. The framework
    consists of three main components: environment perception, robot localization,
    and path planning [61]. Real-time water status monitoring: Utilizing a LoRaWAN
    IoT framework, vineyards can now obtain real-time information and measurements
    on plant hydration levels. This technology promises more precise crop management
    and practical use of water resources, leading to more sustainable agriculture
    [62]. All in all, smart agriculture systems and their methodology is deemed as
    a tool that will, among other effects, increase the effectiveness of the local
    administrations for protection, conservation, and sound use of water resources
    and at the same time will improve operational reliability and safety of water
    supply systems, especially in touristic areas, thus leading to a more sustainable
    use of water resources [63]. In addition, Alves de Melo et al. present an innovative
    and automated solar-powered soil moisture sensor designed to optimize water management
    in agriculture [64]. The study offers a detailed overview of the sensor’s design,
    construction, and its impressive data-gathering capacities. The authors highlight
    the numerous advantages of this cutting-edge technology, notably its potential
    to enhance irrigation efficiency and minimize water wastage. Yet, they also openly
    address the potential challenges and constraints of integrating this solution
    across varied agricultural landscapes. The research essentially acts as a key
    element in soil moisture monitoring technology, highlighting its critical importance
    for enhancing sustainable water management in agriculture. Also, Bertocco et al.
    introduce an advanced methodology for measuring volumetric water content (VWC)
    in soil, utilizing RSSI-based augmented sensors combined with machine learning
    algorithms [65]. Analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 27,000 data points, which
    comprises readings from affordable sensors, RSSI measurements via the LoRaWAN
    gateway, and standard VWC values, the authors highlight the method’s adaptability
    and effectiveness across different soil compositions. By emphasizing the technique’s
    potential for improved accuracy, the study showcases its importance as a significant
    step forward in agriculture and environmental monitoring within the IoUT landscape.
    Efficient aerial spraying routes: Precision agriculture is an emerging field that
    aims to increase the efficiency and productivity of agriculture while minimizing
    the use of resources such as water and pesticides. One area of focus in precision
    agriculture is the development of autonomous pesticide-spraying robots, which
    can reduce the exposure of farmers and farm workers to harmful pesticide chemicals
    [66,67,68]. In addition to the development of autonomous pesticide spraying robots,
    another way to improve the efficiency and productivity of agriculture is to use
    the traveling salesman problem (TSP) and Theta algorithm to create unique trajectories
    for unmanned aerial systems (UAS). These paths ensure a precise aerial distribution
    of plant protection products (PPP) in vineyards, leading to better quality control,
    financial efficiency, and reduced environmental impact [69]. The widespread utilization
    of these smart agricultural tools provides vineyards and wineries with a plethora
    of benefits. Additionally, there is a notable increase in yield, productivity,
    and sustainability. Moreover, the integration of technology alongside traditional
    agricultural techniques reduces costs and reduces dependency on manual labor.
    Furthermore, this incorporation promises a more environmentally friendly approach,
    minimizing resource waste and encouraging ecofriendly practices. This sustainable
    approach not only increases the economic viability of vineyards but also ensures
    their longevity, ensuring future generations of consistent, high-quality wine
    production. Plant Diseases in Vineyards Vineyards are complex ecosystems that
    are home to a diverse range of species. This delicate balance can be disrupted
    by a variety of diseases that affect the grapevine, most of which are caused by
    pathogenic fungi. These diseases significantly diminish the quality and quantity
    of the grape yield, which can have a negative impact on wine production and the
    overall health of the vineyard. Vineyards face the challenge of numerous plant
    diseases that can significantly harm the health of grapevines and reduce harvest
    yields. Among these, downy mildew and powdery mildew are notably prevalent. Downy
    mildew results in leaf wilting and shedding, compromising the plant’s photosynthetic
    capacity and, consequently, sugar production. On the other hand, powdery mildew
    manifests as a white film on the leaves, obstructing sunlight and impeding photosynthesis.
    Beyond their direct effects, these diseases can render grapevines more vulnerable
    to other infestations and disorders. The effects of plant diseases go beyond the
    visible damage. They can cascade to impact the quality of the produce, even if
    the produce appears healthy. For example, downy mildew can cause leaf loss, which
    reduces sunlight exposure and can lead to reduced sugar content in grapes, affecting
    the wine’s overall quality. Vineyard sustainability and productivity over the
    long term depend on a detailed knowledge of plant diseases and how to manage them.
    Researchers are constantly developing new and more effective methods for preventing
    and controlling plant diseases in vineyards, such as using resistant varieties,
    cultural practices, and biological control agents. The adoption of such informed
    strategies is crucial to ensuring the long-term sustainability and productivity
    of vineyards worldwide. Vineyard owners can potentially protect their crops and
    ensure a healthy and productive harvest for years to come by taking steps to prevent
    and control plant diseases. Vineyards around the world are constantly under threat
    from a range of plant diseases, which have been the research topic of a plethora
    of academic studies. Table 1 provides an overview of common diseases affecting
    vineyards, which are caused by factors such as temperature, humidity, rainfall,
    etc., that can be monitored using corresponding data acquired from sensors deployed
    on the field. This study can serve as a crucial resource for vineyard farmers
    and researchers aiming to deepen their understanding and devise effective countermeasures
    against these harmful diseases. Notably, our study primarily focuses on the prevention
    of grape downy mildew (GDM). This disease in particular is detected and identified
    using our advanced sensor networks. Specifically, since grape downy mildew is
    influenced by the local temperature and humidity of the affected vine, these environmental
    conditions can be monitored using our implemented sensor networks and the disease
    can be predicted utilizing machine learning techniques. The prediction of grape
    downy mildew using our implemented sensor networks for this study is presented
    in detail in Section 4 of this work. Table 1. Common diseases affecting vineyards,
    affected by local environmental conditions. 2.5. State-of-the-Art Comparison In
    the context of the Internet of things and smart agriculture, a series of studies
    have systematically investigated the fusion of the Internet of things (IoT) with
    wireless sensor networks (WSN), revealing advancements in how agricultural resources
    are managed and decisions are made. The collective body of work transitions from
    basic communication protocols to complex systems specifically designed for agricultural
    needs. Notably, the Chord protocol features prominently, with its deployment in
    peer-to-peer (P2P) networks improving the robustness and effectiveness of data
    sharing in the context of agriculture. Table 2 offers a clear comparison of different
    studies, showing the key areas of focus, the technologies used, and the use of
    Chord-based protocols in smart agriculture systems. This overview highlights the
    growing use of IoT and WSN technologies, especially the role of Chord-based designs
    in making smart agriculture more efficient and scalable. Table 2. SOTA comparison
    of research studies with emphasis on WSN technologies and Chord-based applications.
    3. Proposed Methodology In this section, the proposed extensions to the methodology
    of the WiCHORD Protocol from [12], which acts as a Wireless sensor network overlay,
    is presented along with a use-case scenario to apply this protocol on P2P LoRa
    wireless sensor networks utilized in smart agriculture applications. First, a
    brief introduction is given to the WiCHORD Protocol as originally proposed in
    [12] along with the ideal model of wireless sensor networks for this overlay solution
    in precision agriculture. Then, the context of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
    between the sensor node devices on a sensor network running the WiCHORD Protocol
    is defined. Next, the benefits of optimizing the WiCHORD Protocol from [12] for
    WSNs is discussed. Finally, a representative use-case scenario for efficient node
    lookup on a sensor network is proposed. Before diving into the concept of the
    WiCHORD protocol, let us first explain the fundamental elements of WSNs and in
    particular sensor nodes and gateway nodes. Definition 1. Sensor node: A sensor
    node, often simply referred to as a node, is a small electronic device within
    a WSN that performs the primary function of collecting data from the environment.
    Each sensor node is typically equipped with one or more sensors, a microcontroller
    processing unit (MCU), memory, a power source, and a wireless communication component.
    These nodes are responsible for capturing specific parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, or other environmental indicators. They process this
    information and then transmit it to a base station or gateway node for further
    processing, analysis, or remote access. Definition 2. Gateway node: A base station
    or gateway node acts as a bridge between the sensor nodes and a larger network,
    such as a local area network (LAN) or the Internet. It gathers the data transmitted
    by the sensor nodes and then relays this information to a central system for storage,
    analysis, or real-time monitoring. Gateway nodes often have more robust processing
    capabilities, higher power sources, and broader communication technologies than
    individual sensor nodes. They serve as the communication endpoint for sensor nodes
    that may not have the ability to directly connect to the broader network. In the
    operation of WSNs within smart agriculture, sensor nodes are dispersed throughout
    the agricultural field to monitor various conditions affecting crop growth. The
    gateway node collects the data from all sensor nodes and can either store them
    for local decision-making or send it to a remote server or cloud service, where
    advanced analytics can be performed, often involving machine learning algorithms
    for predictive analysis and decision support. 3.1. Introduction to the WiCHORD
    Protocol The WiCHORD protocol as initially proposed in [12], is a modified version
    of the Chord protocol from [9], adapted for efficient data routing and stability
    on a P2P wireless sensor network. The key motivations of applying this Chord-based
    protocol on a wireless sensor network to act as a network overlay are the following:
    First of all, Chord ensures the overall stability of a network when various nodes
    join or leave the network. This is useful on a sensor network paradigm in which
    node devices run on batteries and may disconnect from the network if their battery
    gets low [12]. Additionally, Chord supports lookup queries with a logarithmic
    computational complexity, and this can be exploited for a requested sensor node
    to be located efficiently within the sensor network [12], but this also results
    in achieving an overall energy efficiency on the network since only very few subsets
    of nodes are involved in resolving the lookup query. On top of that, since each
    sensor node is aware of only a few other nodes on the sensor network running the
    proposed Chord overlay, only a few node IDs are stored in the node’s memory resulting
    in a higher storage efficiency which is crucial for sensor node devices with limited
    memory capacity. In the next subsections, the ideal architecture for a wireless
    sensor network model suitable for the WiCHORD protocol to run on top of is described.
    Also, the WiCHORD protocol, as initially proposed in [12], is introduced in an
    algorithmic manner. 3.1.1. Ideal Sensor Network Model The wireless sensor network
    model which is ideal for WiCHORD to run as an overlay on top of has the following
    structure. First of all, the wireless sensor network is comprised of simple sensor
    nodes and gateway or base station sensor nodes [12]. Each simple sensor node device
    consists of a microcontroller unit (MCU) chip such as the ESP32 from Espressif
    Systems along with various sensors to monitor the local environment, a LoRa transceiver
    module for data packet exchange among the other nodes on the network over long-range
    distances, and a battery for power. After collecting data from the onboard sensors,
    the simple sensor node device forwards these data in packets towards the gateway
    sensor node of the network, as stated in [12] and in the corresponding above-mentioned
    definition. The gateway sensor node of the network has a similar architecture
    and functionality to those of the simple sensor node, with additional internet
    access in order to relay all the received sensor data to the user over the internet.
    Also, the gateway node enables the user to manage the sensor network and run queries
    via the WiCHORD protocol on the sensor network, as stated in [12] and in the corresponding
    above-mentioned definition. By design, each time only one of the available gateway
    nodes acts as the gateway node of the WiCHORD sensor network, and in case this
    node device fails, another gateway node from those available can be elected to
    replace it. All the remaining gateway node devices that are not elected to run
    as the base station of the sensor network are running as simple sensor node devices
    [12]. For a wireless sensor network running WiCHORD, the total number of running
    simple sensor node devices must be located within the LoRa wireless communication
    range, in order to be able to exchange data packets between themselves [12]. The
    proposed ideal wireless sensor network model for the WiCHORD protocol to act as
    an overlay on top of is shown in Figure 1, as described above. Figure 1. The architecture
    of the ideal WSN model for the WiCHORD protocol. (Inspired from [12]). 3.1.2.
    Brief Description of the WiCHORD Protocol The WiCHORD protocol as it was originally
    proposed in [12] is an adaptation of the Chord protocol for P2P systems that was
    proposed in [9], and therefore some modifications were performed in the structure
    and operations of the original Chord, in order to bring Chord-like functionality
    to a wireless sensor network. First of all, the WiCHORD Protocol has the same
    ring-shaped fixed hash space with m-bit addresses and 2 𝑚 total hash keys as Chord,
    but the difference is that WiCHORD stores only nodes on the hash space and no
    keys, because it is utilized as a routing protocol for locating nodes within wireless
    sensor networks [12]. Each node on the hash space of the WiCHORD protocol represents
    a sensor node device in the physical world, the unique identifier (node ID) of
    this node in the hash space is obtained by hashing the unique MAC Address of this
    node device with the SHA-1 algorithm, and this node only maintains contact with
    𝑂(𝑚) other nodes from the network, which are also known as “fingers” and stored
    within the node’s finger table [12]. On top of that, WiCHORD follows the basic
    principle of Chord from [9], which indicates a hash key to be mapped on the next
    available node on the ring hash space [12]. The structure of a WiCHORD network,
    which is similar to the structure of the original Chord, is shown in Figure 2,
    presenting an example network with the finger table of one node, with 𝑚=7 bits.
    Figure 2. WiCHORD structure and finger table example with 𝑚=7 bits; figure inspired
    from [12]. Regarding the operations of the WiCHORD Protocol, in comparison to
    the original Chord, the following alterations were made to adjust it in order
    to be suitable for a wireless sensor network use-case scenario. According to [12],
    the lookup query functionality of WiCHORD retrieves the corresponding node for
    a requested key in the same way as the original Chord. However, the only valid
    input for a lookup query in WiCHORD is the MAC address of another node within
    the network, for data routing and communication between the nodes on the sensor
    network [12]. Additionally, the functionality of the “Join” operation on WiCHORD
    updates a few other nodes on the network that will be affected by the new node
    addition, with a logarithmic complexity similar to Chord, while in contrast to
    the original Chord, no new keys are transferred to the new node due to the absence
    of keys on the WiCHORD’s hash space [12]. On the other hand, for sensor node withdrawal
    cases, a new “Leave” operation has been implemented on WiCHORD to update the contact
    lists of the affected nodes with a logarithmic complexity in the same way as the
    “Join” operation functions [12]. In addition, for new WiCHORD sensor network’s
    build purposes, a new “Build” operation has been implemented in WiCHORD, which
    calls the “Join” operation for each new node requesting to join the network [12].
    3.2. Machine-to-Machine Communication Context on the WiCHORD Protocol A fundamental
    requirement of the WiCHORD protocol functionality is the concept of internode
    communication on a wireless sensor network in the physical world. In order to
    support the different node cooperation and data exchange within the WiCHORD overlay
    on a wireless sensor network, along with the distinctive operations that this
    protocol supports, a framework of sensor node communication with data packets
    and messages has to be defined and implemented. This falls into the concept of
    machine-to-machine communication (M2M), in which different machines communicate
    with each other without any human interference [84,85]. The concept of machine-to-machine
    communication is ideal for a wireless sensor network environment, in which many
    sensor node devices exchange data packets utilizing wireless communication technologies.
    Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication in the WiCHORD protocol applied on a wireless
    sensor network falls into two major categories. On the one hand, each sensor node
    device collects data from its onboard sensors and relays them to the gateway node
    of the network in order for them to be accessible to the end user over the Internet
    via a cloud computing solution. On the other hand, all the sensor node devices
    on the network communicate to execute all the different operations that the WiCHORD
    protocol includes. For instance, each sensor node relays its sensor readings to
    the gateway node periodically. At the same time, in order to resolve a lookup
    query for a requested sensor node on a WiCHORD wireless sensor network, the query
    message originating from the gateway sensor node is forwarded to the corresponding
    nodes within the WiCHORD network overlay until it reaches the requested node,
    and this node returns its sensor readings to the gateway. This process involves
    more than one sensor node that needs to communicate with other nodes and exchange
    different types of messages. Also, the topology of the wireless sensor network
    is crucial for successful node device communication. Therefore, in the following
    subsections, the required context of machine-to-machine (M2M) communication and
    the network topology of a wireless sensor network running WiCHORD are defined.
    3.2.1. WiCHORD Messages and Their Importance WiCHORD messages are a core component
    of the WiCHORD protocol, serving as the primary means of communication within
    the network. These messages are essential for several reasons: Data transmission:
    WiCHORD messages carry sensor data collected by individual nodes to the gateway
    node. This information can include various environmental readings crucial for
    smart agriculture decision-making. Network health: The protocol uses messages
    to monitor the health and connectivity of the network. Nodes periodically send
    status updates, ensuring the network is functioning optimally, and that data paths
    are clear. Scalability and maintenance: Messages allow the network to scale dynamically.
    When new nodes are added or removed, messages help update the network’s topology,
    ensuring efficient data routing. Within the protocol, WiCHORD messages function
    to maintain the network’s distributed structure, enabling each node to discover
    and communicate with other nodes using a distributed hash table (DHT), which is
    part of the Chord protocol architecture. Each message contains information about
    the sender node, the intended recipient, query operation directives, and the data
    payload. This structure facilitates the key operations of the protocol, such as
    node join/leave, lookup services, and data retrieval, ensuring the protocol’s
    efficiency and reliability in smart agriculture applications. 3.2.2. WiCHORD Data
    Packets Architecture The sensor node devices on a WiCHORD wireless sensor network
    are utilizing LoRa wireless communication to communicate with each other. This
    means that they exchange LoRa packets for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication
    purposes. Therefore, the WiCHORD data packets exchanged between the sensor nodes
    on a wireless sensor network running the WiCHORD protocol overlay are nested within
    the payload of a LoRa packet. The maximum quantity of data that a LoRa packet
    can carry within its payload is 256 bytes, depending on the spreading factor,
    the coding rate, and the bandwidth [86]. Consequently, the different types and
    the structure of a WiCHORD LoRa packet are defined for proper internode communication
    on the sensor network carrying out the operations supported by the WiCHORD protocol
    overlay. All the different WiCHORD packet types are summarized in Table 3. Table
    3. Summary of the different WiCHORD packet types. The major different cases in
    which WiCHORD LoRa packets are exchanged between the sensor nodes during the operation
    of a WiCHORD wireless sensor network are the following. First, when a sensor node
    has to relay its gathered sensor data back to the gateway sensor node, a “Sensor
    Data Relay” packet is sent from this sensor node towards the gateway node. This
    packet contains the hashed node IDs on the WiCHORD hash space of the sender and
    receiver sensor nodes alongside a payload of the sensor readings. In case a sensor
    node device is intended to join or leave the wireless sensor network, a subset
    of pre-existing sensor network nodes on the WiCHORD overlay have to be updated.
    Therefore, a “Node Join Request” or “Node Leave Request” packet is sent from that
    sensor node towards the gateway sensor node, in order for the request to be processed
    and the WiCHORD network to be updated. This packet contains the unique node ID
    of the node that sent it alongside the unique identifier of the sensor network
    that it belongs to. Also, when a sensor node joins or leaves the network, packets
    with messages to update the successor/predecessor node pointers and finger table
    are sent from that node toward all the other nodes of the network, but only the
    nodes that are affected by this procedure respond to that message and update their
    contact lists. This is because Chord, on which WiCHORD is based, updates only
    𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁) other nodes when a new node joins the network of N total nodes [9]. Additionally,
    the “Leave” operation introduced in the WiCHORD protocol has a similar functionality
    to the “Join” operation of the original Chord protocol, and thus also updates
    only 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁) other nodes [12]. A very important operation of the WiCHORD protocol
    is the sensor node lookup query, in which a sensor node is located within the
    wireless sensor network via the WiCHORD protocol overlay, and its sensor readings
    are relayed back to the node that executed the query, given the unique MAC address
    of the requested sensor node. To perform the sensor node lookup query, the gateway
    sensor node sends a “Lookup Request” WiCHORD packet, which is forwarded between
    some of the nodes of the network until it reaches the requested destination node.
    This packet contains the unique node IDs of the sender and the receiver node along
    with the node ID of the requested destination node and other useful information
    as payload. The receiver node ID for the lookup query packet is the ID of each
    intermediate sensor node to which this packet is forwarded before it reaches the
    destination. The structure of a WiCHORD data packet consists of some important
    attributes such as the query type, the unique node ID of the sender and the receiver
    sensor node, and the payload of the packet. The sender and receiver node IDs have
    a size of m bits each, with m being the maximum number of bits for a key on the
    WiCHORD hash space. The useful payload varies between the different packet types.
    For example, the payload of a “Sensor Data Relay” WiCHORD packet contains the
    sensor readings of the sensor node that sent this packet. The WiCHORD protocol
    overlay is suitable for LoRa wireless sensor networks, and therefore, the WiCHORD
    packets are contained within the payload of a LoRa packet. By design, each WiCHORD
    packet is a string of text encoded in JSON format, with all the packet attributes
    as key–value pairs. The architecture of a WiCHORD packet is shown in Figure 3.
    Figure 3. WiCHORD packet architecture. 3.2.3. WiCHORD Wireless Sensor Network
    Hybrid Topology As stated above, a wireless sensor network with the WiCHORD protocol
    overlay has a hybrid functionality either with a direct relay of sensor readings
    from a node towards the gateway or by running WiCHORD queries on the network.
    As a result, the topology of a wireless sensor network based on the WiCHORD protocol
    is hybrid as well. On the one hand, when a sensor node sends its sensor data readings
    to the gateway sensor node of the LoRa wireless sensor network, the network topology
    follows the “star” network topology, in which all the simple sensor nodes send
    data packets to a single gateway node of the network [87,88]. On the other hand,
    when running WiCHORD queries, the network topology follows the “ring” network
    topology from the WiCHORD protocol, which is based on the Chord protocol from
    [9]. This topology is virtual and completely detached from the physical topology
    of the network in the real world. This is because the nodes are organized on a
    circular hash space based on their unique node IDs. For example, if two nodes
    are adjacent in the WiCHORD hash space, they may not be in proximity to the physical
    network. An example of the hybrid network topology on a wireless sensor network
    running the WiCHORD protocol is shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. WiCHORD hybrid topology
    in the case of sensor data relay and while running a WiCHORD lookup query. 3.3.
    WiCHORD Optimization and Benefits for Wireless Sensor Networks The adaptation
    of the Chord protocol on a wireless sensor network application can bring a variety
    of benefits. Some notable benefits are, among others, the stability of the network
    in continuous sensor node connections and disconnections, the total network energy
    efficiency while running the WiCHORD queries, and the balanced distribution of
    keys in the nodes of the network. In the following subsections, the benefits of
    energy efficiency and balanced key distribution are investigated. 3.3.1. Energy
    Efficiency on a WiCHORD WSN The energy efficiency in the wireless sensor network
    is important since the sensor node devices rely on batteries for power. The energy
    consumption of the WiCHORD protocol is influenced by the total number of sensor
    node devices that participate in the resolution of a join, leave, or lookup query.
    Each individual node consumes a constant amount of energy while it participates
    in a query resolution process. Specifically, in the case of a sensor node device
    joining or leaving the network, a subset of other sensor node devices have to
    update their contact details to maintain the stability of the sensor network.
    This leads to energy consumption since the sensor node device has to use its own
    MCU to process this join or leave operation. Also, in the case of a sensor node
    lookup query, the sensor node devices involved in resolving the query have to
    forward the lookup message to some of the other nodes of the network, until the
    destination sensor node device is reached. This message-forwarding communication
    is performed using the sensor node device’s LoRa wireless communication module
    and therefore energy is consumed. By the design of the Chord protocol from [9],
    in which the WiCHORD overlay is based on, only a subset of nodes are involved
    when running a query. The energy efficiency of the “Join”, “Leave”, and “Lookup”
    operations of WiCHORD on a wireless sensor network using LoRa is discussed in
    this subsection. When a new sensor node device intends to join a WiCHORD wireless
    sensor network, the join operation of the WiCHORD is executed. Since the join
    operation of the WiCHORD protocol is based on the corresponding join operation
    of the original Chord that was described in [9], in each join query, only a subset
    of the total nodes in the network is involved in order to execute the query and
    update the nodes’ contact details to point to the new node. According to the original
    Chord from [9], each time a join query is performed, 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁) total nodes update
    their list of contacts to include the new node, with N being the total number
    of nodes in the network. The same applies to the WiCHORD protocol as described
    in [12], because it is an adaptation of Chord for wireless sensor networks. In
    case a sensor node device about to leave the network due to insufficient battery,
    the “Leave” operation was introduced in the WiCHORD as described in [12]. Since
    the leave operation of the WiCHORD updates the affected nodes in a similar way
    to the join operation described above, 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁) total nodes are updated in order
    to remove the leaving node from their contact lists, in a sensor network of N
    total nodes. As shown in [12], when performing a lookup query to locate a requested
    sensor node on a LoRa wireless sensor network running the WiCHORD overlay, a subset
    of 𝑂(𝑙𝑜𝑔𝑁) nodes are involved to forward the query to the requested node. This
    is a consequence of the logarithmic complexity of the lookup operation on the
    original Chord protocol as stated in [9]. As a result, the energy consumption
    of join, leave, and lookup queries has a logarithmic variation over the total
    number of nodes in the network, since the number of involved nodes in such queries
    is a logarithmic function of the total nodes in the network. This leads to a reduction
    in the total network energy consumption since only a smaller subset of sensor
    node devices participate in the join, leave, and lookup operations, in comparison
    to a simple LoRa wireless sensor network, in which the total number of sensor
    node devices would have to participate in resolving a query. 3.3.2. Storage Efficiency
    on WiCHORD Sensor Node Devices On a wireless sensor network application, sensor
    node devices are based on microcontroller units (MCU) that have a limited amount
    of onboard memory. In a simple sensor network scenario without the WiCHORD protocol
    overlay, all the nodes would have to maintain contact lists containing all the
    node details of the network, in order to support exact match queries for specific
    nodes of the network. Therefore, when scaling up a wireless sensor network by
    adding more node devices in the network, the memory of each node would be exceeded.
    Since the WiCHORD protocol, which is based on the Chord protocol from [9], stores
    only a few node IDs on each node of the network, as described in [12] and in Figure
    2, it can be more efficient in terms of storage efficiency in the onboard memory
    of each node in the network. In the sensor network overlay of this solution, each
    node stores 𝑂(𝑚) IDs of other nodes in the network as stated in [9,12], with m
    being the maximum number of bits for the keys that belong to the WiCHORD hash
    space. 3.4. Proposed Use-Case Example of the WiCHORD Protocol In this subsection,
    an example use-case scenario of WiCHORD protocol utilization on a wireless sensor
    network is presented. First of all, an already deployed LoRa wireless sensor network
    suitable for the WiCHORD protocol is assumed with some pre-existing sensor nodes
    already joined in the WiCHORD network. Also, it is assumed that this instance
    of WiCHORD wireless sensor network is connected with a cloud computing infrastructure
    from which the end user manages this sensor network. In this use-case scenario,
    a sensor node lookup query is performed via WiCHORD in order to locate a sensor
    node within the sensor network. First of all, the user who performs the query
    provides the unique MAC Address of the requested sensor node. Then, the gateway
    node of the network receives the lookup query over the Internet and forwards the
    corresponding WiCHORD lookup packet to the nodes of the WiCHORD wireless sensor
    network, utilizing the routing algorithm of the Chord protocol from [9] that WiCHORD
    also uses. When the Lookup message reaches the requested sensor node, this sensor
    node forwards its most recent sensor readings back to the gateway node directly
    via LoRa as described in [12]. This use-case scenario is presented in Figure 5.
    Figure 5. WiCHORD lookup query example on a LoRa WSN. 4. Case Study In this section
    of this work, a case study for the above proposed WiCHORD protocol overlay for
    sensor networks on an applications ecosystem for smart agriculture is presented.
    This applications ecosystem consists of various applications that work together
    in order to achieve precision agriculture purposes. The different applications
    of this ecosystem are, among others, a LoRa wireless sensor network suitable for
    the WiCHORD protocol optimized for a vineyard environment, a cloud computing infrastructure
    as a service (IaaS) that works as a backend as a service (BaaS) provided by Google
    Firebase, some machine learning (ML) models that predict plant diseases on vineyards,
    and a Web dashboard for wireless sensor network management. This application ecosystem
    was named “VineLink Monitoring” and was deployed and tested for the purposes of
    this study in one vineyard with a total area of 0.4 hectares, situated on the
    slopes of the “Vardousia” mountain range, near the village of “Koniakos” in the
    region of “Phocis” in Central Greece, during the Spring and Summer of 2022. A
    satellite view of the vineyard on which this application was tested, along with
    the map of the implemented and deployed sensor network on that vineyard is presented
    in Figure 6. See more details in Appendix A.1. Figure 6. Map view of the wireless
    sensor network deployment on the vineyard in Koniakos village, Phocis region,
    Central Greece. All these different applications that compile this precision agriculture
    ecosystem are briefly presented in the following subsections. 4.1. VineLink Monitoring
    The VineLink Monitoring case study provides a tangible example of the WiCHORD
    protocol being applied in sensor networks for a vineyard monitoring scenario that
    was performed on the above-mentioned farm situated near the village of “Koniakos”,
    in the “Phocis” region of Central Greece (Figure 6), demonstrating real-world
    benefits and operational effectiveness. The real-world benefits are: VineLink
    Monitoring enables precision viticulture, allowing vintners to understand and
    respond to the microvariations within their vineyards. This system optimizes resource
    usage—water, nutrients, and treatments are applied judiciously, leading to significant
    savings and environmental benefits. The monitoring system excels in early pest
    and disease detection, which is crucial in maintaining vine health and reducing
    crop loss. It also streamlines operations, as the automated data collection frees
    up labor from in-person vineyard monitoring for other essential agricultural activities
    and provides the farmers with a real-time overview of their field. The operational
    functionality elements are: In the field, VineLink Monitoring deploys a network
    of sensor nodes strategically placed around the vineyard, based on the ideal model
    of sensor network for the WiCHORD protocol as described on Section 3. These sensors
    gather critical data points, including climatic conditions and soil moisture levels.
    The gateway node aggregates these data and communicates them efficiently via the
    WiCHORD protocol, ensuring prompt and reliable data delivery to the central management
    system. The resultant analysis leads to informed decisions, optimizing vineyard
    practices such as irrigation timing, targeted fertilization, and effective plant
    disease treatments. Through VineLink Monitoring, vineyards have witnessed improved
    grape quality and yield consistency. The system has proven its value in enhancing
    sustainability and economic viability, showcasing how advanced IoT applications
    like WiCHORD can revolutionize traditional agricultural practices. 4.2. Wireless
    Sensor Network In order to collect useful metrics regarding plant disease forecasting
    in a vineyard environment for this precision agriculture application, a wireless
    sensor network based on the LoRa wireless communication technology was built.
    In this wireless sensor network, the WiCHORD protocol, proposed initially in [12]
    and also described in Section 3 of this work, was applied as an overlay, and all
    the node devices in the network were assigned with a unique node ID resulting
    from SHA-1 hashing on the node’s unique MAC Address. This wireless sensor network
    was comprised of some simple sensor nodes and one gateway node. Each sensor node
    consisted of an ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU) with a LoRa wireless communication
    module embedded on the LILYGO TTGO T-Beam LoRa MCU board, connected with some
    sensors for local conditions’ monitoring. The sensors on each sensor node monitored
    the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture of the local environment in which
    this sensor node was deployed. To monitor these local conditions, the DHT22 temperature
    and humidity sensor was integrated into the sensor node devices, while for the
    soil moisture, the sensor node device used a simple off-the-shelf capacitive soil
    moisture sensor. Every sensor node device relayed its sensor readings as WiCHORD
    LoRa packets to the gateway node of the network periodically. To connect this
    wireless sensor network with the other applications of the smart agriculture ecosystem,
    the gateway node utilized an API provided by the Google Firebase platform, in
    order to post the received sensor readings to the application’s database that
    was hosted in Firebase. The vineyard on which this network was deployed is divided
    into regions, and each sensor node device was assigned to one specific region.
    The map of the deployment of this WSN on the vineyard is shown in Figure 6, while
    the architecture of this LoRa wireless sensor network and how it is connected
    with the rest of the ecosystem is presented in Figure 7. A picture of the implemented
    sensor node device for this case study, as it was deployed on the vineyard, is
    presented in Figure 8. The inner workings of this device are shown in Figure 9.
    Figure 7. The wireless sensor network architecture, as a part of this case study.
    Figure 8. The implemented sensor node device deployed on the vineyard. Figure
    9. The inner workings of the implemented sensor node device. 4.3. Applications’
    Cloud Infrastructure The backend infrastructure of this application ecosystem
    was built using cloud computing technologies provided by the Google Firebase platform.
    Google Firebase is a backend as a service (BaaS) providing services such as databases,
    user authentication, and web hosting for such applications. This precision agriculture
    ecosystem utilized a NoSQL document database provided by Firebase, in order to
    store the received data from the sensor nodes on a JSON format in real time. Also,
    the Web dashboard application of this ecosystem was hosted on Firebase Hosting
    and the user authentication in all of the components of this ecosystem was managed
    by Firebase Authentication. 4.4. Plant Disease Forecasting with Machine Learning
    Techniques Using Sensor Data The sensor data collected from the above-mentioned
    LoRa wireless sensor network were utilized in order to train some machine learning
    (ML) models for plant disease forecasting in vineyards. One of the very common
    plant diseases in vineyards, which is mentioned also in Table 1, is grape downy
    mildew (GDM), which affects grapes in a negative way and causes damage to the
    quality and the quantity of the vineyard agricultural produce. Some of the major
    factors affecting GDM are the local temperature and humidity along with the rainfall
    in the area of the affected vine [70,71,72,73]. Therefore, the above-mentioned
    wireless sensor network (Figure 6, Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9) measured the
    local temperature and humidity of the vines, using the DHT22 temperature and humidity
    sensor (Figure 9), and these data were used to train the machine learning models
    that were implemented. In this project, the data used to train the following machine
    learning models were collected from the aforementioned vineyard in Koniakos in
    Central Greece, which is shown in Figure 6, during the Spring and Summer of 2022.
    The implemented machine learning models predicted the susceptibility and incubation
    period of grape downy mildew in the affected vine. Specifically, these machine
    learning models were trained using the dataset collected by the above-mentioned
    wireless sensor network. This dataset contained the value pairs of local temperature
    and humidity for each region of the vineyard as features along with the corresponding
    labels of grape downy mildew susceptibility (positive/negative) and incubation
    period (in days) for these value pairs. These labels were assigned for these pairs
    manually by combining the specifications of the grape downy mildew found in the
    related agricultural literature [70,71,72,73]. Table 4 shows how susceptibility
    and incubation period of the GDM plant disease varied depending on the local temperature
    and humidity of the affected vine plant. Therefore, the temperature and humidity
    features on the dataset were distributed into the various GDM susceptibility and
    incubation classes, by following the specification presented on Table 4. In brief,
    70% of this dataset was used for the training of the implemented machine learning
    models, and the rest, 30% of the dataset, was used to evaluate the prediction
    accuracy of these models. Table 4. Temperature and Humidity factors affecting
    GDM plant disease. Table compiled with data combined from [70,71,72,73]. To forecast
    grape downy mildew susceptibility which is a binary classification task, a set
    of well-known classifier models, including a decision tree, a random forest, and
    a Gaussian naïve Bayes, were implemented with their default parameters and trained
    with the above-mentioned sensor network dataset, using the Scikit-Learn module
    [89] in the Python programming language. Also, to forecast the incubation period
    of grape downy mildew plant disease which is a multiclass classification task,
    a set of classifiers, including a decision tree, a random forest, and a Gaussian
    naïve Bayes, was selected to be trained using default parameters and the sensor
    network dataset, with Scikit-Learn [89]. The prediction accuracy of the above
    models was evaluated using the accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores, by
    making predictions about the susceptibility and incubation period of GDM using
    the test dataset’s temperature and humidity input value pairs, with promising
    combined results. In particular, for both the cases of grape downy mildew susceptibility
    (positive/negative) and incubation (in days), the initial datasets had less than
    100,000 tuples of data, and the label classes were separated well without overlapping.
    This means that the decision process for this dataset was simple, following the
    agricultural rules regarding the conditions affecting the grape downy mildew plant
    disease. This resulted in very high accuracy scores of more than 99% for the decision
    tree and random forest models in both cases, while the naïve Bayes model scored
    an accuracy of 89% in the case of grape downy mildew susceptibility and an accuracy
    of about 99% for the case of grape downy mildew incubation. In contrast to the
    naïve Bayes, decision tree may be prone to the problem of overfitting, while naïve
    Bayes may also perform better and avoid overfitting with well-separated datasets
    like the one in this project. The combined evaluated scores are shown in Table
    5. Table 5. Combined machine learning classification models evaluation scores.
    To integrate these machine learning models with the broader application ecosystem,
    an API using the Flask web framework was implemented. This API received temperature
    and humidity data pairs via HTTP requests and returned the machine learning predictions
    from the above-mentioned models. 4.5. Applications’ Web Dashboard The Web dashboard
    implemented as part of this smart agriculture application informed the end user
    about the collected data from the wireless sensor network along with the corresponding
    predictions from the above-mentioned machine learning models. This Web dashboard
    application was developed using the React.JS framework in the JavaScript programming
    language, and the Bootstrap 5 CSS framework for the application’s user interface.
    The connection with the Google Firebase backend was established using the Firebase
    Web SDK provided by Google. 5. Results To verify the efficiency of the proposed
    WiCHORD protocol overlay for wireless sensor networks, a simulator application
    was developed and some simulation experiments were carried out. First of all,
    using the Python 3 programming language, the Jupyter Notebook programming environment
    and libraries such as Pandas [90] and Matplotlib [91], the simulator application
    that was developed to initially evaluate the WiCHORD Protocol from [12] was extended
    in order to evaluate some of the WiCHORD functionalities discussed in this work.
    See more details about the simulator development in Appendix A.2. In the following
    subsections, the balanced distribution of node IDs in the network nodes, along
    with the total energy efficiency in the network nodes that the WiCHORD achieved,
    was evaluated by performing the corresponding simulation experiments. 5.1. Sensor
    Node Storage Efficiency Evaluation As was mentioned in the methodology section
    of this work, the WiCHORD protocol overlay maintains contact lists in the nodes
    of the network for routing purposes. These contact lists are stored within the
    memory of the nodes, which has limited capacity, and each node stores only a few
    other node IDs in its contact list, as the WiCHORD protocol dictates in [12].
    Therefore, if the sensor network scales up in terms of total nodes population,
    it is important that each node stores only a subset of node IDs in its memory.
    In this experiment, the average number of node IDs (contacts) that were stored
    within the memory of the nodes was calculated over the total number of nodes on
    a WiCHORD sensor network. Specifically, in each iteration of this experiment,
    random instances of WiCHORD networks of N total nodes were created, with 𝑁∈[10,1000]
    incremented by 10 in each experiment iteration. Then, in each iteration of the
    experiment, the average number of unique node IDs stored in the finger table and
    the predecessor pointer of each node was calculated for all the nodes of the network.
    Finally, the combined results of this experiment with the average number of stored
    contacts in the node’s memory per total number of nodes in the network are shown
    in Figure 10, where as the number of total network node scales up, the average
    number of contacts for each node is a small subset of the total nodes in the network.
    Figure 10. Storage efficiency simulation results. 5.2. WiCHORD Operations’ Energy
    Efficiency Evaluation Energy efficiency is crucial in a wireless sensor network
    application in which sensor node devices rely on batteries for power. One of the
    key motivations for the implementation of the WiCHORD protocol was the fact that
    WiCHORD “Join”, “Leave”, and “Lookup” operations have a logarithmic complexity,
    and thus in each operation, only a few of the total nodes of the network are involved.
    When a node is involved in a “Join” or “Leave” operation, it usually has to exchange
    messages with the other nodes in the network, in order to update its contact list
    by including or removing another sensor node. Also, when a node of the network
    is participating in a “Lookup” query, it basically has to forward the lookup message
    to the other nodes of the network until the destination node is reached, or if
    this node is the destination node, then this node has to respond with its sensor
    data to the node that performed the lookup query. In these cases, some of the
    nodes on the sensor network running WiCHORD, are using their onboard LoRa module
    in order to communicate with the other nodes of the network to resolve the corresponding
    query and this results in energy consumption from the wireless communication along
    with the MCU of the sensor node device not being idle. Assuming that each “Join”,
    “Leave”, and “Lookup” operation running on the WiCHORD network involving one node
    during its execution has a constant energy consumption 𝑐 𝑗𝑜𝑖𝑛 , 𝑐 𝑙𝑒𝑎𝑣𝑒 , and
    𝑐 𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑘𝑢𝑝 , respectively, in the following experiments, the average number of involved
    nodes per total nodes on the network was calculated, and thus the energy consumption
    of these operations could be calculated as the product of the total involved nodes
    times the corresponding constant for each operation. For the join operation of
    the WiCHORD protocol, the following experiment was conducted: The average number
    of involved nodes on a join query per total network nodes was calculated. Specifically,
    for random simulated instances of WiCHORD sensor networks comprised of N total
    nodes, with 𝑁∈[10,300] incremented by 10 in each step, a number of n node join
    queries were performed by adding a new node with a random MAC address on the network
    and calculating the number of unique nodes involved in this query. Each time these
    queries were performed, the WiCHORD network instance was initialized to keep the
    total number of nodes the same for all experiments. For each step of N, a total
    of 𝑛=30 simulation experiments were performed, and the average total of nodes
    involved in a join query per total network nodes was calculated for this value
    of N. The combined results of the join operation evaluation are presented in Figure
    11. Results from this experiment indicate that in the case of a new sensor node
    joining the network, only a few other sensor nodes were involved in resolving
    that request, and therefore, less energy was consumed in the sensor network, in
    comparison to a network-flooding scenario in which all the network nodes have
    to update their contact lists. Figure 11. WiCHORD join operation simulation results.
    Similar to the above-mentioned experiment for the evaluation of the WiCHORD join
    operation, a simulation experiment to evaluate the efficiency of the leave operation
    of WiCHORD was conducted. This experiment was conducted with the same parameters
    as the previous one with the only difference being that in each step, a number
    of leave queries were resolved by selecting a random node of the network to be
    removed, in order to measure the average number of total nodes updated when a
    pre-existing node left the network. The combined results from the evaluation of
    the leave operation are shown in Figure 12. Figure 12. WiCHORD leave operation
    simulation results. To evaluate the lookup operation of WiCHORD in terms of energy
    efficiency, the average number of nodes participating in resolving a lookup query
    per total network nodes was measured in the following experiment. For random WiCHORD
    sensor network instances with a total number of nodes in the range [10,1000] incremented
    by 10 in each step, 10 random lookup queries were performed for each value of
    total network nodes, the same way as the lookup-query path-length evaluation experiment
    from [12], to calculate the average number of involved nodes per total network
    nodes. The total number of nodes involved in a lookup query was calculated by
    counting the intermediate sensor nodes that the query was forwarded ti, the destination
    node, and the origin node. The combined results of the lookup operation evaluation
    are presented in Figure 13. These results indicate that in a lookup query, the
    number of involved nodes verified the logarithmic complexity of the WiCHORD Lookup
    operation, and thus, energy was saved in the sensor network by involving fewer
    nodes to resolve a query, in comparison to a network-flooding case in which all
    the sensor nodes would receive the lookup query and then would have to relay their
    sensor readings back to the gateway node of the sensor network. Figure 13. WiCHORD
    lookup operation simulation results. 5.3. Combined Results Implication and Discussion
    The above-obtained results from the simulation of the WiCHORD protocol overlay
    for wireless sensor networks are summarized as follows. The WiCHORD protocol is
    an overlay that runs on top of wireless sensor networks and utilizes the structure
    of a distributed hash table to efficiently manage the sensor node contact lists
    stored within the memory of the sensor node devices and the total energy consumption
    of a sensor network during the sensor node join, leave, and lookup queries, in
    comparison with a simple wireless sensor network without an overlay protocol.
    In a simple wireless sensor network, all the sensor nodes within the network have
    to maintain contact lists containing the total number of sensor node identifiers
    and have to update their contact lists when a node joins or leaves the network,
    and all the sensor nodes have to participate when a sensor node lookup query floods
    the network. Therefore, by applying the WiCHORD protocol overlay to a wireless
    sensor network, the above simulation results indicate that each node device maintains
    only a few sensor node identifiers as contacts. Also, only a logarithmic subset
    of the total sensor network nodes has to participate in the case of a sensor node’s
    join, leave, and lookup query. This means that less energy is consumed in the
    whole sensor network when these queries are performed since fewer sensor node
    devices are active during these query operations. 6. Discussion The WiCHORD protocol,
    stemming from the foundation work of the Chord protocol, presents an evolutionary
    and innovative approach to wireless sensor networks. The resulting inner working
    design considers the unique challenges and requirements of WSNs, ensuring efficiency
    and scalability without compromising the integrity of the system. Generally, the
    following aspects can be discussed: Distinct node-centric approach: One of the
    main aspects of WiCHORD is its internal design focused on the nodes rather than
    the keys, as in the Chord protocol. By representing each sensor node device in
    the physical world within the hash space, WiCHORD enables a self-alignment with
    the nature of WSNs where the device location and communication path are crucial.
    Therefore, the resulting reduction in system complexity, which is derived from
    having only nodes and no keys in the hash space, transforms the system into a
    less resource-intensive mechanism, leading to a valuable protocol for WSNs that
    can operate under resource constraints. Effective lookup mechanism: The lookup
    operation within WiCHORD, although inspired by Chord, is particularly tailored
    to WSNs. By relying on the MAC address for data routing, WiCHORD effectively breaks
    down the narrow space in the search domain, ensuring an efficient communication
    among nodes. This approach is particularly beneficial for WSNs, which often face
    high data traffic, ensuring a reduced latency in the network. Enhanced join/leave
    operations: The adaptability of WiCHORD is self-evident in its join and leave
    operations. The functions not only accommodate the dynamic nature of WSNs, where
    nodes might frequently join or leave the network, but also maintain the integrity
    of the network with a logarithmic complexity. Moreover, the omission of key transfers
    in the join operation serves to further streamline the process, reducing potential
    bottlenecks in the overall system. As per the results, the following concluding
    aspects could be discussed: Storage efficiency: We simulated how many keys a node
    contained in the network, as LoRa is limited in memory and all nodes could not
    save all keys as this would fill up the memory. WiCHORD, as it only knows the
    successor and the predecessor, results in a reduction of 𝑙𝑜𝑔(𝑛) in the neighboring
    nodes, for the unique keys. Energy efficiency: we performed a simulation to check
    the average nodes involved as per the total number of nodes in the network for
    various numbers of simulation nodes. Join operation: Streamlined process: by avoiding
    the transfer of keys when a new node joins, WiCHORD minimizes unnecessary data
    transmissions, which would otherwise consume more energy. Logarithmic complexity:
    The join operation’s logarithmic nature means that as the network grows, only
    a logarithmic number of messages are needed for a node to join. This reduces the
    total number of message transmissions, conserving energy. Selective node updating:
    Rather than broadcasting or updating the entire network when a new node joins,
    only a subset of nodes (those affected by the new node) are updated. This targeted
    approach conserves energy by reducing unnecessary communication. Leave Operation:
    Targeted node update: Similar to the join operation, when a node leaves the network,
    only affected nodes need to be updated. By limiting the number of nodes involved
    in the process, energy consumption due to communication is minimized. Avoidance
    of global network reorganization: Instead of reorganizing or recalculating the
    entire network structure when a node leaves, the leave operation’s efficient design
    ensures minimal disturbances. This helps in preventing widespread data transmissions,
    saving energy. Lookup operation: MAC address dependency: Relying solely on the
    MAC address for data routing not only simplifies the lookup process but also reduces
    the chances of redundant or unnecessary data transmissions. Efficient data routing
    conserves energy by ensuring that messages take the shortest and most direct path
    to their destination. Reduced latency: A well-optimized lookup operation ensures
    that data reach their destination faster. Quicker data transmission means radios
    are active for shorter durations, leading to energy conservation. Minimized traffic:
    by refining the search domain to the MAC address and utilizing the efficient principles
    derived from the Chord protocol, the lookup operation minimizes network traffic,
    reducing energy consumption from frequent data transmissions. 7. Conclusions and
    Future Directions This study demonstrated the effectiveness of the WiCHORD protocol
    in enhancing the operational efficiency of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in
    smart agriculture, particularly through advanced machine learning techniques and
    improved sensor node operations. The deployment of machine learning models for
    grape downy mildew (GDM) forecasting in vineyards showcased a remarkable predictive
    accuracy. Our models, utilizing sensor data for local temperature and humidity,
    achieved accuracy scores above 99% for decision tree and random forest classifiers.
    This significant level of precision illustrates the potential of integrating IoT
    technologies with data-driven agricultural practices. In terms of storage efficiency,
    the WiCHORD protocol proved effective in managing sensor node resources. The experimental
    results showed that the average number of node IDs stored in sensor nodes remained
    low, even as the network scaled up. This efficiency is critical in maintaining
    the viability and performance of large-scale sensor networks, particularly where
    node devices have limited memory capacity. Furthermore, our evaluations of the
    WiCHORD protocol’s energy efficiency during key operations—namely, node join,
    leave, and lookup processes—confirmed its energy-saving benefits. The protocol’s
    design, which involved only a subset of nodes in each operation, significantly
    reduced the overall energy consumption compared to scenarios where all nodes participated.
    This aspect is crucial in extending the operational life of battery-powered sensor
    nodes, a key factor for sustainable smart agriculture applications. However, challenges
    remain, particularly in adapting the protocol to the unpredictable and varied
    conditions of agricultural environments. Future work should focus on further optimizing
    the WiCHORD protocol for complicated environmental conditions and exploring ways
    to enhance its energy efficiency. Additionally, reinforcing the security measures
    in data transmission within WSNs will be a crucial aspect of ongoing research.
    Looking ahead, the WiCHORD protocol’s adaptability in varied agricultural environments
    will be a key area of development. Its ability to integrate with complex sensor
    types and data sources is crucial for meeting the specific needs of different
    crops and farming conditions. Future enhancements should focus on incorporating
    adaptive algorithms for more personalized agricultural interventions, aligning
    with the objectives of precision agriculture. These developments are essential
    for achieving higher crop yields, environmental sustainability, and economic benefits
    in the evolving landscape of smart farming. Additionally, regarding the prediction
    of plant diseases in vineyards for the VineLink Monitoring case study, further
    directions of this work include the implementation, training, and evaluation of
    machine learning models. This includes the incorporation of a field report on
    the status of GDM plant disease development on the vines as a feature, in alignment
    with the weather data from the sensors deployed on the field. The plant disease
    prediction with machine learning trained with sensor data can be extended to other
    vineyard plant diseases in vineyards as well. In conclusion, the WiCHORD protocol
    presents a robust framework for smart agriculture, combining the benefits of machine
    learning for disease prediction with an efficient sensor network management. Continuous
    improvements in these areas will create a foundation for more resilient, efficient,
    and sustainable agricultural practices, utilizing the power of IoT and advanced
    data analytics. Author Contributions C.-P.B., A.K., C.K., I.K., and S.S. conceived

  description: 'Precision Agriculture (PA) promises to meet the future demands for
    food, feed, fiber, and fuel while keeping their production sustainable and environmentally
    friendly. PA relies heavily on sensing technologies to inform site-specific decision
    supports for planting, irrigation, fertilization, spraying, and harvesting. Traditional
    point-based sensors enjoy small data sizes but are limited in their capacity to
    measure plant and canopy parameters. On the other hand, imaging sensors can be
    powerful in measuring a wide range of these parameters, especially when coupled
    with Artificial Intelligence. The challenge, however, is the lack of computing,
    electric power, and connectivity infrastructure in agricultural fields, preventing
    the full utilization of imaging sensors. This paper reported AICropCAM, a field-deployable
    imaging framework that integrated edge image processing, Internet of Things (IoT),
    and LoRaWAN for low-power, long-range communication. The core component of AICropCAM
    is a stack of four Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) models running sequentially:
    CropClassiNet for crop type classification, CanopySegNet for canopy cover quantification,
    PlantCountNet for plant and weed counting, and InsectNet for insect identification.
    These DCNN models were trained and tested with >43,000 field crop images collected
    offline. AICropCAM was embodied on a distributed wireless sensor network with
    its sensor node consisting of an RGB camera for image acquisition, a Raspberry
    Pi 4B single-board computer for edge image processing, and an Arduino MKR1310
    for LoRa communication and power management. Our testing showed that the time
    to run the DCNN models ranged from 0.20 s for InsectNet to 20.20 s for CanopySegNet,
    and power consumption ranged from 3.68 W for InsectNet to 5.83 W for CanopySegNet.
    The classification model CropClassiNet reported 94.5 % accuracy, and the segmentation
    model CanopySegNet reported 92.83 % accuracy. The two object detection models
    PlantCountNet and InsectNet reported mean average precision of 0.69 and 0.02 for
    the test images. Predictions from the DCNN models were transmitted to the ThingSpeak
    IoT platform for visualization and analytics. We concluded that AICropCAM successfully
    implemented image processing on the edge, drastically reduced the amount of data
    being transmitted, and could satisfy the real-time need for decision-making in
    PA. AICropCAM can be deployed on moving platforms such as center pivots or drones
    to increase its spatial coverage and resolution to support crop monitoring and
    field operations.'

    The demands for food, feed, fiber, and fuel increase rapidly due to the fast expansion
    of the global population, income growth, technological advancement, and transport
    and logistics improvements (van Dijk et al., 2021). Precision agriculture (PA),
    which seeks to apply the right amount of inputs (fertilizers, irrigation water,
    pesticides, and other chemicals) in the right location at the right time, is essential
    to meet the requirements of future global food production, as well as environmental
    sustainability and climate resilience. PA is predicated on accurate sensor measurements,
    timely and sound decision-making, and automated actuators. The backbone of PA
    is the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that automates data collection, data
    analytics, data presentation, control, and efficient data communication (Chamara
    et al., 2022). Imaging sensors or digital cameras are essential for PA as they
    can capture more information than traditional scalar or vector sensors. Images
    can capture crop phenology for precise decision-making (Taylor and Browning, 2022,
    Tian et al., 2020). Cyclic events such as vegetative growth, flowering, leaf count
    and color change, maturation, and senescence are studied in crop phenology, which
    is essential to PA as it determines the management inputs required by crops. Moreover,
    images have rich information on the scene that allows for pest pressure evaluation.
    At present, a limited number of sensors are available for pest identification
    and pest pressure estimation. Among them, imaging sensors provide the most promising
    solution. Conventional (handcrafted feature extraction) and Artificial Intelligence
    (AI)-based image processing are the two branches of image processing. Traditional
    approaches extract image features defined by shape, texture, and color (Anubha
    et al., 2019, Yuan et al., 2019). The AI-based methods use Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) to extract features from images (Luis et al., 2020). CNN models
    with multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and learning are considered
    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNN) (LeCun et al., 1998). Conventional imaging
    platforms in PA store images locally using onboard storage memories. Post processing
    refers to the processing of images stored at the central data storage in batches
    at a later time to extract useful information (Aasen et al., 2020). Imaging platforms
    that can access the internet through a stable connection with high bandwidth can
    automatically upload images to Cloud data storage. The vast majority of farmlands
    worldwide are in rural and remote areas with poor access to electric power and
    internet connectivity. This represents a big challenge for camera systems deployed
    in rural farmlands for high-speed image processing, data transmission, and low-latency
    decision-making (Richardson, 2019). Post-processing of crop images has been used
    for the estimation of leaf area index (Aasen et al., 2020), growth rate (Sakamoto
    et al., 2012), leaf chlorophyll and nitrogen content (Wang et al., 2014), fruit
    counts (Wang et al., 2014), and plant height (Sritarapipat et al., 2014). Further
    post-image processing allows for the assessment of biotic stress, such as pest
    density (Barbedo, 2014; Park et al., 2007) and weed pressure (Wang et al., 2019),
    as well as abiotic stress, such as nutrient deficiency (Ghorai et al., 2021).
    Richardson (2019) suggested that deep learning-based methods have the potential
    to facilitate the extraction of more sophisticated phenological data from both
    new and previously archived camera imagery compared to conventional image processing.
    Semantic segmentation-based canopy coverage (CC) estimation (Chamara et al., 2021;
    Liang et al., 2023), image classification-based crop identification (Anubha et
    al., 2019), disease identification (Sharma et al., 2020), growth stage prediction
    (Yasrab et al., 2021) and object detection-based plant feature identification
    (A. Wang et al., 2019) are examples of DCNN applications in agriculture. Conventional
    image processing requires less computational power and less energy, but they are
    limited in adaption to new scenarios, while deep learning requires high computational
    power and consumes more energy. DCNN models require large memory due to the large
    number of parameters these models hold. Therefore, it is not easy to implement
    these models practically in embedded systems that have less memory and computation
    power. These models also require a large amount of data to train to predict with
    high accuracy. Therefore, it is resource intensive. Edge image processing is the
    image processing done on image-capturing devices. The main advantage of edge image
    computing is that it lowers the high throughput data transmission requirement
    over a wireless IoT-enabled imaging network (Cao et al., 2020). Wang et al. (2022a)
    demonstrated the capability of identifying potted flowers with precision above
    89 % in real-time in a Jetson TX 2 computing module based on a DCNN algorithm.
    These authors suggested that a cloud-edge collaborative framework could achieve
    real-time and automatic learning for the DCNN model they have developed. Wang
    et al. (2022b) proposed a real-time weed detection model run on Jetson AGX Xavier
    for field robots. The authors proved it was possible to do real-time weed detection
    with a precision above 90 % yet required expensive hardware. Wang et al. (2022a)
    reviewed Raspberry Pi single-board computer-based real-time image processing applications.
    They concluded that Raspberry Pi (Datasheet Raspberry Pi Model B, 2019) is a cost-effective
    edge computing unit that could potentially be used as an edge image processing
    unit, and the capability of integrating it with IoT was also discussed. Zualkernan
    et al. (2022) demonstrated an edge image processing platform for the classification
    of animals and transmitting the identified animal and time of identification via
    LoRa for a camera trap. Past literature on IoT and image processing applications
    in agriculture has highlighted a research gap in edge image processing with IoT-enabled
    crop monitoring cameras. In-field crop cameras are expected to make real-time
    crop management decisions based on real-time image processing; however, poor internet
    connectivity in agricultural fields severely limits their capability. To address
    this gap, we have developed a novel imaging platform named AICropCAM that extracts
    plant and crop canopy level parameters through DCNN and uploads them to the Cloud
    via low-power, low-throughput communication protocols. We also demonstrated AICropCAM
    on an IoT-enable wireless sensor network in corn and soybean fields. A technology
    that addresses image processing at the lowest level (edge) and transmits only
    useful information can revolutionize real-time decision-making in PA. Therefore,
    the main objective of this paper is to demonstrate AICropCAM to perform edge image
    processing and low-throughput, low-power, and long-range data transmission through
    IoT technology. In this novel AICropCAM platform, multiple DCNN image processing
    algorithms run in series to extract plant-level and canopy-level features in an
    embedded system. Image classification, object detection with classification, and
    image segmentation are the three major applications of DCNN image processing,
    and all three are included in AICropCAM to demonstrate the capabilities of DCNN
    for image processing in PA. AICropCAM has trained models for canopy segmentation,
    crop classification, plant growth stage identification, plant counting, weed counting,
    and plant type identification. All the protocols that transmit data from AICropCAM
    to the Cloud were custom designed. AICropCAM sends the generated data to a cloud
    platform for logging, visualization, and analysis. Furthermore, this paper explains
    the DCNN model training process, model performance, and test results. We reported
    the model training comprehensively because it was essential for AICropCAM development.
    2. Materials and methods Essential activities in this research were data/image
    collection and preprocessing, hardware design for AICropCAM, software design for
    data transmission between the edge and the Cloud, deep learning model design,
    and model training and optimization (Fig. 1). AICropCAM was implemented in a corn
    and soybean field at the field phenotyping facility in Mead, Nebraska, USA (Bai
    et al., 2019). We demonstrated the training of the following DCNNs: CropClassiNet
    for classifying images based on image quality and crop type, CanopySegNet for
    segmenting crop canopy from the background, PlantCountNet for classifying and
    counting soybean and weed plants, and InsectNet for identifying insects and counting
    them. Download : Download high-res image (412KB) Download : Download full-size

    Image collection for DCNN model training occurred in four growing seasons using
    three different types of cameras: (i) commercially available Meidas SL122 trail
    cameras in 2019 (Meidas Trail Cameras, 2022), (ii) OV5642 imaging sensors with
    ArduCAM camera shields in 2020, and (iii) Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 with Raspberry
    Pi Zero in 2021 and 2022 (Chamara, 2021). All the cameras were mounted on the
    bars horizontally extended and fixed on stationary poles erected vertically in
    the fields, as shown in Fig. 2A. The distance between the crop canopy and the
    cameras was maintained between 0.5 and 1.5 m throughout the growing seasons. Images
    used for training the InsectNet were also captured with smartphones as we could
    not collect enough images with insects from the three types of cameras mentioned
    above. Download : Download high-res image (338KB) Download : Download full-size

    learning model training were utilized: (1) folder labeling for the image classification
    models, (2) pixel-level annotation for the semantic segmentation model, and (3)
    bounding boxes for object detection models. Images belonging to the same class
    were grouped into a single folder, and five distinct classes (or folders) were
    created: rejected, corn, soybean, grass, and night. Separating the crop canopy
    from the soil was done with pixel-level annotation and semantic segmentation.
    Bounding boxes, the smallest rectangle around an object, were drawn for corn plants,
    soybean plants, weed plants, and insects. Table 1 explains each type of annotation
    used in the model training. Table 1. Annotation criteria used to generate labels
    from the images to train and test the four deep convolutional neural network models
    in AICropCAM. Labeling Type Class Description Image classification (CropClassiNet)
    Rejected Images were labeled as rejected due to multiple reasons: blurred images
    caused by water droplets on the lens; the cameras turned away from the targeted
    crop; crops growing up to the camera blocking the view or capturing only a few
    leaves; people present in the images; lens covered with different stuff; and the
    camera was not installed in the field. Corn Images entirely covered by corn plants
    at different growth stages. Soybean Images entirely covered by soybean plants
    at different growth stages. Grass/Weed Images only comprise grass/weed plants
    at different growth stages. Night Images captured under low lighting conditions.
    Most of the cameras were not programmed to stop collecting images under low light.
    Crop canopy and background (CanopySegNet) Canopy Pixel labeling was done on the
    crop canopy. We used assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB
    image labeler. Background Pixel labeling was done on the crop canopy. We used
    assisted freehand tool and the superpixel option in the MATLAB image labeler.
    Plant-type (PlantCountNet) Weed Weed present in the image was labeled using bounding
    boxes. It was challenging to locate the weed after the corn or soybean canopy
    was closed. Soybean Soybean plants present in the image were labeled using bounding
    boxes. Insects (InsectNet) Insects During the labeling process, without distinguishing
    insects based on their type, all the insects present in the images were labeled
    using bounding boxes. Image preprocessing is necessary for DCNN model training
    and real-time edge image processing. Differences in the input layer size in different
    DCNN models demand that images be resized before passing through the model for
    training or prediction purposes. High-resolution images improve accuracy but require
    more computational power. For specific applications, labeled datasets were only
    limitedly available. Therefore, image augmentation techniques were used to increase
    the number of image data sets, including scaling, flipping, cropping, rotation,
    color transformation, PCA color augmentation, and noise rejection (Paymode and
    Malode, 2022). Multiple augmentation techniques were used for each model, as detailed
    in Table 2. Additionally, Table 2 provides the numbers of images in training,
    validation, and testing for the four DCNN models. Table 2. DCNN model image allocation

    for the DCNN models but to demonstrate the concept of implementing edge image
    processing and transmitting the results to the Cloud for decision-making. Therefore,
    we selected a limited number of images for CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet, and InsectNet,
    which were sufficient to train models with a reasonable degree of accuracy. 2.2.
    DCNN model architecture selection, training, evaluation, and deployment on the
    edge device The steps to select model architecture/model backbone weights and
    image input sizes to train the best model for CropClassiNet, CanopySegNet, PlantCountNet,
    and InsectNet are summarized in Fig. 3. Unlike many DCNN applications that prioritize
    higher accuracy, our application focused on finding the balance between accuracy
    and model deployability on the edge device. Download : Download high-res image

    during the training and testing by attempting different model architectures, model
    backdone weights, and input image sizes. For example, in the development of CropSegNet
    (Segmentation), we selected DeepLabv3+ (Firdaus-Nawi et al., 2018) with weights
    initialized from pre-trained networks of ResNet18 (He et al., 2016), ResNet50,
    Xception, InceptionresnetV2, and MobileNetV2. The input image sizes tested were
    512 × 512 × 3 and 256 × 256 × 3, and training options were kept constant to find
    the best-performing networks, which should also be deployable to Raspberry Pi
    4B. This process identified DeepLabv3 + with ResNet50 as the most suitable model
    for CropSegNet, with an input image size of 512 × 512 × 3. Table 3 summarizes
    the hyperparameter values and training options for the final DCNN models deployed

    used for the classification models CropClassiNet and CropSegNet, whereas IoU and
    mAP (Mean Average Precision) were used for PlantCountNet and InsectNet. Jaccard
    index gives the proportion of correctly predicted labels to the total number of
    labels. Model training was performed on an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 Ti Mobile processor,
    a dedicated mid-range graphics card with 4 GB GDDR6 memory on a Dell XPS 15 9500
    Laptop. The laptop had an Intel Core i7-10750H 10th Gen processor,16 GB DDR4 RAM,
    and 1 TB SSD hard disk. 2.3. Hardware and software of AICropCAM The IoT data transmission
    and edge image processing hardware comprised the following major components: a
    Raspberry Pi 4B single-board computer, an Arduino MKR1310 development board, an
    Arduino MKR Relay Proto Shield, and a Dragino OLG02 outdoor dual channels LoRa
    Gateway (Fig. 4). The 12 V 8Ah battery powered the Raspberry Pi 4B, controlled
    through the relay shield managed by the Arduino MKR1310. A 3.7 V lithium polymer
    battery powered the Arduino MKR1310 board. There are two advantages of having
    a separate Arduino board. First, the Arduino board consumes less power than the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module. It can be switched on and off according to user requirements.
    Second, it allows uninterrupted communication between the edge node and the Cloud
    with low power. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Hardware overview of AICropCAM and data flow. AICropCAM
    required programming on two hardware platforms. Arduino was programmed using C++
    in Arduino’s Integrated Development Environment. Raspberry Pi imaging and image
    processing program was developed in MATLAB and deployed onto the Raspberry Pi
    4B using the MATLAB Coder and MATLAB Compiler. A python program was designed to
    read the saved data in the Raspberry Pi 4B and serially communicate to the Arduino
    MKR1310. The primary functions of the MRK1310 program were to (1) turn on the
    Raspberry Pi 4B module based on the user-defined time intervals, (2) get the processed
    data, including the results of DCNN model predictions, through serial communication
    from the Raspberry Pi 4B, and (3) transmit the data to the ThingSpeak Cloud channel
    through the LoRa gateway. All the DCNN models were trained using the MATLAB deep
    learning toolbox. In the edge deployment, a MATLAB program runs multiple models
    logically depending on the prediction result of the previous model estimation,
    as shown in Fig. 5. MATLAB coder generated the C and C++ code derived from the
    program we developed to run on the Raspberry Pi. MATLAB Compiler generated the
    standalone application on the Raspberry Pi (The MathWorks, 2022). Download : Download

    image processing and data generation flow chart. Table 4 lists the parameters
    generated by the models in AICropCAM. The abbreviations in Table 4 are fields
    holding data in the program to reduce the complexity of system development and
    maintain a common standard among different platforms. Fig. 6 shows the data generation
    from images. According to Fig. 6, the size of the images were around 2 MB before
    being fed into the image processing pipeline. The output message contains the
    crop type (CT), plant count (PC), weed count (WC), canopy coverage (CC), and pest
    count (PstC). The resulting message is typically less than 100 bytes. This represents
    a substantial reduction of memory size with the output being 0.00005 times the
    size of the original image. Consequently, this message can be transmitted in a
    single message via LoRa as the maximum LoRa packet size is around 256 bytes. Table

    full-size image Fig. 6. Examples of message generation and data size reduction
    for LoRa transmission. 2.4. Data transmission, visualization, and storage The
    data generated after image processing were saved on the Raspberry Pi 4B SD card,
    allowing access to the data remotely or through manual retrieval during field
    visits. Two options for transmitting the collected data to the ThingSpeak IoT
    platform are available. Firstly, the data can be uploaded directly from the Raspberry
    Pi 4B if internet connectivity is available for growers with Wi-Fi access. Secondly,
    the Raspberry Pi 4B transmits the recently acquired data to the Arduino MKR1310.
    The Arduino MKR1310 decodes the data received from the Raspberry Pi 4B and forwards
    it to the ThingSpeak. The second method is for low-rate, long-range communication
    beyond the limit of Wi-Fi. A single message receivable to the ThingSpeak server
    includes data for eight fields. In our demonstration, a single message was enough
    to transmit the data generated. Fields 1 and 2 are reserved for geographic coordinates
    (namely, latitude and longitude) to represent the device''s location. The third
    field was for camera orientation. Image quality/crop type, plant count, weed count,
    insect count, and crop canopy coverage were allocated from fields four to eight.
    ThingSpeak supports eight channels per gateway. If additional data is generated
    in the future, we have to create new channels to accommodate them. However, only
    data in a single channel can be passed through a single message. The Arduino-LoRa
    library was used to prepare the LoRa messages forwarded to the gateway (Mistry,
    2016). The message generated from the Arduino MKR1310 includes the device identification
    number and the data with the field number. Once the gateway receives this message,
    it adds the target client ID (generated by ThingSpeak when defining a device),
    host address (mqtt://mqtt3.thingspeak.com), server port number, username and password,
    channel ID, and the data in each field according to the Message Queuing Telemetry
    Transport (MQTT) protocol. Username and password ensure that only authorized devices
    can transmit data to the ThingSpeak platform. ThingSpeak provides two ways to
    interact with its platform, REST (Representative State Transfer) and MQTT protocols.
    The advantages of using MQTT over REST protocol are that it supports ThingSpeak
    data publishing, including immediate and minimum power consumption and data transmission
    over limited bandwidth, which encouraged us to select the MQTT protocol in our
    demonstration. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. DCNN model performance CropClassiNet
    had a test accuracy of 91.26 %, a Jaccard Index of 0.77, and an F1-score of 0.91;
    the confusion matrix is given in Fig. 7. The highest precision is for the “grass”
    class (100 %), and the lowest is for “soybean” (92.0 %). The highest recall is
    for the “corn” class (99.9 %), and the lowest is for “grass” (67.1 %). The primary
    goal of CropClassiNet is to determine the quality of new images and direct them
    for subsequent processing (Fig. 5). This step has never been executed in an image-based
    crop monitoring platform before. Further, CropClassiNet can eliminate erroneous
    images when humans are present in the camera’s field of view or when the camera
    is misaligned due to external factors. AICropCAM can send maintenance requests
    through IoT analytics if rejected images are continuously generated. Download

    achieved a global accuracy of 0.93, a weighted IoU of 0.87, and a mean BF score
    of 0.73. Fig. 8 shows an example of an original soybean image and the corresponding
    segmentation result by CanopySegNet, which estimated CC to be 18.72 %. Season-long,
    time-series images can be fed into CanopySegNet to generate diurnal and seasonal

    and seasonal variations of canopy coverage as computed by CropSegNet. According
    to Fig. 9, canopy coverage percentage variation is low during the daytime and
    reaches zero at night. This verifies the need to eliminate low-light images before
    segmenting. As shown in Fig. 5, it is possible to eliminate the generation of
    false values when the camera captures images under low light conditions by halting
    the process of running CanopySegNet. There are three diurnal variation series
    on 6/8/2021, 6/26/2021, and 7/12/2021 in Fig. 9. The CC increased from 8 % to
    95 % between 6/8/2021 to 7/12/2021. The seasonal trend showed that the CC reached
    a maximum around 7/8/2021. These results suggest that the proposed stacked models
    can track the daily and seasonal CC variation and eliminate the effect of lighting
    conditions on false value generation. Table 5. Performance of PlantCountNet and
    InsectNet on the test image set (Root mean square error (RMSE)/Final validation

    of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet is given in Table 5. Fig. 10(A) and 10(B) show
    the result obtained by PlantCountNet for a soybean image at an early vegetative
    stage (V3). Meanwhile Fig. 10(C) and 10(D) shows the result at a reproductive
    stage (R1). It can be seen that, at V3 stage, the model outputs matched the labels
    of soybean and weed plants well, indicating a level of high accuracy. Download

    result of PlantCountNet for soybean and weed counting: Manually annotated vs.
    model-predicted bounding boxes at V3 growth stage (A and B); manually annotated
    vs. model-predicted bounding boxes at R1 growth stage (C and D). The size of insects
    is very small compared to the size of images (Fig. 11), which is the main reason
    for the low mAP for InsectNet (Table 5). Increasing input image resolution beyond
    480 × 480 × 3 is impractical as it exceeds the memory limitation to load models
    into Raspberry Pi 4B. A potential solution could be to increase the resolution
    of the region of interest by splitting the original image while keeping the resolution
    the same. Also, we suggest using the approach recommended by Tetila et al., 2020a,
    Tetila et al., 2020b in the future on Raspberry Pi model 4B. As technology advances,
    we expect the memory capacities will increase for edge computing units. At the
    same time, the state-of-the-art object detection algorithms will improve the accuracy
    for small object detection. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    labels. 3.2. Power consumption for Raspberry Pi 4B Since edge cameras in farmlands
    have limited access to electric power, information on their power consumption
    is essential for designing IoT devices and systems. AICropCAM is designed to be
    energized by solar power. It runs on a rechargeable battery when there is no solar
    power. We monitored the maximum energy consumption of each task performed by AICropCAM,
    and the result is presented in Table 6. Four main strategies are available for
    the power management of IoT edge devices: Selecting power-efficient hardware,
    maintaining low power modes, dynamic power management, and cloud-based management.
    Raspberry Pi 4B is an affordable power-efficient single-board computer suitable
    for our application, but it does not naturally support low-power modes. Therefore,
    we introduced the Arduino MKR1310 LoRa module for the Raspberry Pi 4B dynamic
    power management. Furthermore, this Arduino module allows us to perform cloud-based
    central management independently. Table 6. Electrical power consumption of the
    Raspberry Pi 4B and the Arduino MKR1310 during edge image processing. Device Activity

    <0.01A LoRa transmission <0.01A For our measurements, we used a Raspberry Pi 4B
    with 8 GB of RAM, connected to an HDMI monitor, a USB keyboard, and a USB mouse,
    and ran a MathWorks® Raspbian image (file used to boot the Raspberry Pi 4B). The
    Raspberry Pi 4B was operated at room temperature and connected to a wireless LAN
    access point and a laptop via an Ethernet cable. The electric current consumption
    for running each DCNN model was recorded during the test. CropClassiNet had the
    highest current consumption, while the PlantCountNet and InsectNet models had
    the lowest. As for LoRa transmission, we could not measure its current consumption
    because the lowest value our instrument could measure was 0.01A. Based on the
    manufacturer''s specifications, the Arduino MKR1310 consumes 104 uA at 5 V. The
    average time to run the DCNN models is essential to estimate the energy consumed
    for each prediction. These parameters listed in Table 7 provide essential guidelines
    for designing IoT sensor nodes with suitable batteries and power sources. We also
    noticed that typically the first prediction of a model took the longest time,
    but the rest take a considerably shorter time to predict. Table 7. Time duration

    320 × 320 × 3 0.20 3.68 Semantic segmentation was the most power-demanding activity,
    while insect detection was the least. Changing the order of the image processing
    models and adding new models or dropping existing models is possible during regular
    operation. It enables dynamic power management within the Raspberry Pi module.
    The main advantage of AICropCAM is that it implements a stack of four DCNN-based
    image processing models with multiple objectives. To the best of our knowledge,
    this is the first time such a system has been developed for a field crop monitoring
    camera. AICropCAM has applications such as setting up smart in-field or greenhouse
    IoT camera networks with edge computing capability, monitoring crops by attaching
    them to sprinkler irrigation systems (pivots and linear moves), or collecting
    crop information through ground or aerial mobile robots. The relatively short
    time to run each DCNN model makes the system suitable for real-time applications,
    including variable rate irrigation, fertilization, and spraying. For example,
    a pivot irrigated multi-cropping system with AICropCAM can automate irrigation
    or fertigation transition between different crops or crops at different growth
    stages by automatically providing the crop type or growth stage information to
    the irrigation controller. Additionally, existing herbicide or pesticide sprayers
    can get the feedback of the PlantCountNet and InsectNet in the AICropCAM for precision
    spraying. 4. Conclusion and future perspectives This paper outlines the essential
    components of constructing a functional edge image processing framework for real-time
    crop monitoring. From a software standpoint, CropClassiNet can categorize captured
    images according to image quality and detect the presence of specific crop types
    for further processing. CanopySegNet can further quantify the degree of canopy
    coverage; PlantCountNet can count the number of plants and weeds in the image;
    and finally, InsectNet can count the number of insects in the image. These four
    DCNN models, when implemented on edge devices, can extract an array of important
    crop and canopy parameters from field images and enable real-time, low-latency
    decision making and applications. Deep learning-based image processing on the
    edge has excellent potential in PA. Applications of AICropCAM are not limited
    to image classification, segmentation, plant counting, or weed counting. Potential
    future applications include insect classification and crop damage estimation,
    weed classification and pressure estimation, fruit identification and yield estimation,
    decision on replanting (Whigham et al., 2000), and disease identification and
    disease damage estimation in real time using actual field images collected by
    AICropCAM. AICropCAM shows excellent potential in enhancing crop management through
    crop monitoring. However, the current demonstration requires significant improvements
    on both hardware and software fronts. Customized circuitry and modular design
    are required to put AICropCAM in commercial farm applications. The full potential
    of the AICropCAM can be achieved by putting this camera on a moving platform like
    a center pivot with a GPS receiver to generate spatiotemporal data. Crop classification
    must include more crop types, and segmentation models need training data from
    other crop types. The DCNN models for weed and insect identification require the
    capability to identify different weed types, their growth stage, different insect
    types, and their growth stages to generate effective pest control decisions. Additionally,
    improving the models’ accuracy in image classification, segmentation, and object
    detection is crucial. It can be achieved by increasing the number of training
    image data sets. We also planned to expand the research for multiple edge architecture
    evaluation. Architectures such as a high-performance edge computer that accepts
    images from multiple edge devices through short-range, high-speed communication
    (e.g., Wi-Fi) and can run more accurate deep learning models with higher numbers
    of parameters, might be a better solution for the primary objectives addressed
    in this paper. We aim to expand the AICropCAM applications to other crops beyond
    corn and soybean. By making these improvements, AICropCAM will become a more effective
    tool for crop management, potentially revolutionizing how we grow and manage crops.

    Introduction The deployment of new technological solutions in the agricultural
    sector aims to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) [1] and the welfare
    of animals [2]. With this objective, the Food and Agricultural Organization [3]
    and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) [4] arise to promote
    research [5], investment and sustainability in agriculture. Since 2015, the number
    of people suffering from hunger has increased, reaching a percentage of almost
    9% of the world’s population [6]. If the current trend continues, the Zero Hunger
    Goal [7] will not be achieved by 2030. Targets 2.3 and 2.a of the Zero Hunger
    goal aim to double agricultural productivity and increase agricultural research.
    To achieve this, precision agriculture solutions can offer increased productivity
    and sustainable food production. Precision agriculture provides a link between
    the farmer and technology. IoT systems are one of the main approaches to automate,
    monitor, and improve the performance of agricultural activities. However, despite
    the multitude of devices deployed in agricultural scenarios, bringing the understanding
    of technological solutions closer to farmers and agricultural specialists remains
    a challenge. Technological solutions in agriculture must focus on understandable
    communication with the user, in this case, the farmer or the specialist. To do
    this, it is necessary to understand the way the professional or farm manager usually
    works and acts, trying to respond to the questions and tasks performed in a scenario
    that does not have high-technology or IoT solutions. Knowing the usual way of
    working will make the inclusion of intelligent and precision solutions more harmonious.
    The aim is to facilitate and improve routine tasks with as little impact as possible
    and without the need for technical training on the part of the user. IoT solutions
    in agriculture are described by constant measurement of land, crop, or livestock
    characteristics depending on the use case. In turn, automation and monitoring
    solutions are fed by the data captured by the devices deployed in the field. Therefore,
    the representation or collection of data stored in repositories is one of the
    key elements in communication with the farmer. Data management systems must be
    able to answer the questions the farmer asks. For example, When should I harvest
    the fodder to feed the livestock? When should I bale the harvested crop? In essence,
    such questions can be disaggregated according to three main dimensions: (i) temporal,
    (ii) spatial, and (iii) semantic. In turn, the data extracted through the decomposition
    of the queries posed by the farmer serve as input for Machine Learning models
    or Decision Support Systems (DSS), offering a much more useful and interpretable
    answer for the farmer. In this article, an innovative spatio-temporal semantic
    data management framework is proposed for the resolution of the queries raised
    above. In addition, a solution for the preparation and transformation between
    agricultural data models is presented to ensure the interoperability of the system
    without dependence on the native data model. Finally, a use case is presented
    in which the system feeds a Machine Learning model to answer certain predictive
    questions in the field of harvesting or cultivation of fodder legumes for livestock
    feed. The proposal presented in this paper has been developed in the framework
    of a European precision agriculture research project. The data set exposed for
    the system validation is made up of real data generated by static and mobile sensors
    and devices in an agricultural scenario. The system is designed for the management
    of large semantic spatio-temporal datasets, generated by sensors and devices deployed
    in agricultural scenarios. However, the system is easily adaptable to other IoT
    domains, with easy adaptability due to the nature of the agents involved. Agricultural
    scenarios present certain limitations, such as low computational capabilities
    and limited resources of certain sensors or connectivity problems in some farms.
    Some services, solutions, or devices operate with native data models, which makes
    their incorporation into other architectures difficult. This article describes
    a proposal that solves these problems through a distributed architecture and a
    component that guarantees service interoperability. In Related work, some of the
    most innovative solutions in precision agriculture are presented, exposing the
    importance of sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and data science. In addition,
    data management solutions for precision agriculture exposed in the literature
    are presented, and how the proposal offers a substantial and innovative improvement
    of current solutions. Spatio-Temporal Semantic Data Management System (STSDaMaS)
    presents the STSDaMaS proposal, detailing the architecture and functionalities
    offered by the framework. Achieving interoperability, use case with the AFarCloud
    Data Model presents the solution adopted to ensure the interoperability of the
    STSDaMaS framework with data models from other platforms, projects, or solutions.
    For interoperability validation, the native data model of the AFarCloud smart
    agriculture platform is presented, and data preparation, adaptation, and transformation
    are exposed. System validation: Applying Neural Network for fodder legume harvesting
    and bailing prediction describes the validation of the proposed spatio-temporal
    semantic data management framework through a use case to feed a machine learning
    model. Conclusion presents the conclusions of the proposal. Finally, Future work
    evaluates the limitations of the study and summarizes ongoing research to address
    them. Related work Automation of tasks in the application domain of precision
    agriculture is closely linked to the constant monitoring of the condition of crops
    and livestock. As such, IoT solutions offer a perfect symbiosis with the application
    domain. In the literature, several reviews of IoT solutions for process automation
    in precision agriculture are found [8]. The first and most characteristic phase
    of IoT implementations is the collection of data by devices deployed in the field.
    Therefore, data characterization is a key element for subsequent processing and
    implementation of solutions. Data captured by precision agriculture devices offer
    information related to three main dimensions (i) semantics [9], (ii) spatial,
    and (iii) temporal. This type of data description is provided by semantic models
    of linked data [10]. Field data management in precision agriculture has been linked
    to the use of Geographic Information Systems (GIS). This set of tools allows for
    the storage, analysis, manipulation, and mapping of any type of georeferenced
    information. For Precision Agriculture applications, a specific GIS system called
    Field-Level Geographic Information System (FIS) [11] was developed. However, this
    system was developed for older operating systems, such as Windows 3.1 , 95, and
    98. The updated version is the Farm Management Information System (FMIS). According
    to Burlacu et al. [12] FMIS supports farmers in various areas, from operational
    planning, implementation, and documentation, to evaluation of the work done in
    the field. However, FMIS does not consider the temporal dimension and its application
    to scenarios that require real-time operation is limited. Precision agriculture
    presents an environment rich in spatio-temporal data. The open-source GeoFIS software,
    designed to cover the entire process, from spatial data to spatial information
    and decision-making, is presented in [13]. GeoFIS has been evaluated through three
    case studies involving different types of crops, and the ability of its embedded
    algorithms to address the needs of farmers, advisors, and spatial analysts in
    precision agriculture is examined. The main limitation of GeoFIS lies in the lack
    of characterization and management of the temporal and semantic information of
    the data. With the increasing deployment of sensors and static and mobile devices
    for monitoring and automating tasks in all sectors, the most current literature
    gathers a prodigious amount of research on the efficient management of large amounts
    of spatio-temporal data. Ruiyuan Li et al. present JUST[14], a data management
    system that can efficiently store and manage large amounts of spatio-temporal
    data. It uses a combination of Apache HBase, GeoMesa, and Apache Spark and includes
    two indexing techniques and a compression mechanism to improve query efficiency.
    It also supports easy-to-use SQL-like queries and allows for both new data insertions
    and updates to existing data without requiring index reconstruction. Experimental
    results show that JUST has strong query performance and scalability compared to
    other distributed spatio-temporal data management systems. However, JUST has certain
    limitations regarding the semantic characterization of the data and the inference
    or treatment of relationships between entities. In addition, interoperability
    with other data models is a pending work that limits its application to other
    domains. As the number of mobile devices and IoT terminals connected to the Internet
    increases, large amounts of spatio-temporal data are generated. To store and compute
    these data locally and share them effectively, data owners often store them on
    cloud servers. Yongjiun Ren et al. present BSMD [15], a blockchain-based secure
    storage mechanism that uses an on-chain and off-chain cooperative storage model
    to overcome the limited storage capacity of the blockchain. This novel mechanism
    is capable of storing large amounts of spatio-temporal data securely. However,
    the implementation of bloackchain-based mechanisms to guarantee data integrity
    and security requires high computational capabilities and makes real-time operations
    impossible. Real-time management of large data sets is becoming increasingly necessary
    in various sectors. In [16], Atsushi Isomura et al. present the Axispot technology,
    applied to obstacle detection and lane-specific congestion in the automotive domain.
    The article describes the need to store and query data captured by numerous moving
    objects. Axispot presents an improvement in the capability to search and aggregate
    spatial data by reducing the complexity of polygonal shape lines and the number
    of vertices to cope with the needs of a near real-time operating environment.
    However, the study does not consider the dimension of height or altitude, which
    is considered for future developments. The development of exposed technology is
    related to the automotive world and the high computational capabilities of the
    agents involved, so its adaptability to other sectors is reduced. The application
    of spatio-temporal semantic data management systems in precision agriculture still
    has a long way to go in terms of research and improvement. However, in the literature,
    there are already some systems, such as SEMAP, presented by Henning Deeken et
    al. [17], mainly developed for spatio-semantic management for robot planning,
    which later on [18, 19], was successfully applied to the precision farming domain.
    The SEMAP framework is characterized by a powerful spatial description of the
    agents and the environment; offering 2D and 3D representations. However, this
    complex characterization is not necessary for most use cases in agriculture. Moreover,
    as the authors argue in the article, the temporal dimension is a missing piece
    in the system. Thus, this article proposes a data management framework that prioritizes
    temporal-spatial and semantic characterization, decreasing the complexity of the
    spatial dimension; aiming to offer a novel and more complete solution. In the
    last decade, advances in Web 2.0 technology have improved the accessibility of
    data across the cloud, with increasing amounts of Linked Open Data, Linked Open
    Statistical Data, and Open Government Data available for sharing. However, the
    availability and accessibility of data for production analytics in agriculture
    are currently limited and rarely include attributes for spatio-temporal analytics.
    Irya Wisnubhadra et al. [20] propose the development of a spatio-temporal data
    warehouse with an integration process using a service-oriented architecture and
    open data sources to address this problem and improve decision-making in agricultural
    production analytics. The storage approach provided in this article is geared
    towards agricultural production analysis, presenting a low temporal precision
    (aggregations or daily results). The query response time (even longer than 12
    s) and the exposed data model complicate its adaptability for sensor networks
    and scenarios with real-time query requirements. Due to information management
    systems and their post-processing and querying capabilities, raw data captured
    by various devices are injected as input for Machine Learning (ML) models, Decision
    Support Systems (DSS), or monitoring, among others. Due to the utility and success
    of machine learning model application, this paper presents the implementation
    of a neural network in precision agriculture, for the validation of the proposed
    data management framework. Several studies on the application of ML in IoT for
    precision agriculture are found in the literature [21,22,23]. Due to the number
    of tasks in the agricultural sector, this article focuses mainly on crop management.
    Crop management tasks can be divided into three main groups (i) pre-harvest, (ii)
    harvest, and (iii) post-harvest (see Fig. 1). In [24] a review of ML applications
    is presented in each of the areas. Fig. 1 Stages in crop management Full size
    image One of the most interesting applications in crop management is the cultivation
    of fodder legumes for livestock feed. These crops form a link between two of the
    most important areas of the agricultural sector, crops, and livestock management.
    The literature exposes the interest in the area, with studies such as [25] providing
    a review of the welfare of dairy cows in pasture or confinement. The importance
    of diet and therefore the quality of forage offered as feed to cattle for its
    yield and meat quality is defined in [26]. The determination of the quality of
    fodder is not immediate and depends on many factors [27]. Some of the most important
    factors in crop yield can be predicted with ML models thanks to solutions such
    as the one presented by Johann et al. for soil moisture in [28] or soil temperature
    by Behnaz Nahvi et al. in [29]. There are more modern solutions, such as the one
    presented by Vamseekrishna et al. in [30]. Once the soil characteristics and main
    factors affecting the fodder crop have been studied, the farmer’s main concern
    will be to estimate the productivity or yield of the crop itself. Jeevan Nagendra
    Kumar et al. present a use of the ML application for the prediction of crop performance
    in [31]. This paper proposes a novel spatio-temporal semantic interoperable data
    management framework that allows the exploitation of big data, applied to an agricultural
    scenario. The system proposed in this paper allows the resolution of complex queries
    thanks to a distributed repository between time-series oriented databases and
    knowledge bases or triple stores. Due to a distributed architecture, the system
    offers real-time operation performance by deploying part of the architecture at
    the edge. Due to the proposed design, the system can adapt to environments with
    limited computational or network resources. Furthermore, the proposed framework
    includes a solution to ensure the interoperability of the service through integration
    with other data models available in the application domain. In Table 1, a comparison
    is presented between the most relevant proposals related to our work, based on
    the key features that our proposal presents: (i) Big spatiotemporal (ST) data
    management, (ii) architecture distributed between edge and cloud, (iii) service
    interoperability, (iv) scalability, (v) specific application and design for agriculture,
    and (vi) adaptable to other domains. Table 1 A comparative between the most relevant
    related proposals Full size table Spatio-temporal semantic data management system
    (STSDaMaS) Precision agriculture presents constantly evolving scenarios. Observations
    captured by devices deployed on the farm are characterized by three dimensions:
    (i) temporal evolution of conditions; observations are associated with a time
    stamp. (ii) Spatial geopositioning stamp; with static or dynamic nature, depending
    on the type of device that captures the measurement. (iii) Semantic characterization
    of the data and its relationships with other devices and the environment. Precision
    agriculture data can be characterized by their spatio-temporal semantic nature.
    In this way, it is possible to answer queries such as: What has been the evolution
    of soil temperature and moisture in a given plot over the last week? Usual queries
    have an equivalent characterization. The design of a system capable of managing
    spatio-temporal semantic data in precision agriculture faces several problems:
    1. Implement a repository capable of managing a large volume of historical data
    with high performance. 2. Design a query system that allows data retrieval under
    spatial, temporal, semantic constraints, or combinations thereof. 3. Offer interoperability
    with other services through the transformation of input and output data. This
    paper proposes a spatio-temporal semantic data management system that solves these
    problems, considering the importance of data retrieval for future monitoring,
    decision-making, and automation of agricultural processes. Data management architecture
    The STSDaMaS framework is designed for the collection and management of agricultural
    data from the spatio-temporal semantic environment. The agricultural domain model
    must be able to describe the temporal evolution of the observations captured by
    a device and provide its geopositioning and associated semantic information. For
    mobile devices, such as robots, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), or autonomous
    or semi-autonomous vehicles, a spatial evolution linked to the temporal axis is
    presented. In addition, the semantic description presents a classification of
    devices, sensors, observations, and even the environment, as well as their relationships.
    According to the characterization of data in the agricultural domain, it is essential
    to differentiate between temporal and spatial information and semantic information.
    Regarding the type of database for the implementation of the repository, semantic
    databases or triple-stores (for RDF graphs) allow storing and managing individuals
    and their relationships, adding a powerful semantic description of data. However,
    their performance decreases with the management of a large-volume dataset. Non-relational
    databases allow the management of a large volume of heterogeneous data with higher
    performance. However, they do not support inference operations or more complex
    semantic descriptions and relationships between objects and the environment. It
    is proposed to distribute the repository internally between knowledge and non-relational
    databases. The different types of database engines prioritize the management of
    data characterized by a specific dimension (spatial, temporal, or semantic). In
    precision agriculture, the data have a strong characterization under the three
    defined dimensions, so it is reasonable to distribute the management framework
    to ensure maximum performance. The proposal consists of the use of a NoSQL Time-Series
    oriented Database (TSDB) to increase performance in the management of spatio-temporal
    data and the use of a Triple-Store to ensure the management of the semantic information.
    This distributed architecture allows increasing performance and speeding up queries
    in the Big Data environment, without losing the benefits of semantic description.
    To link the objects represented in both databases, unique element identifiers
    (UIDs) are used. Figure 2 shows the architecture of the proposed spatio-temporal
    semantic data management system (STSDaMaS). Fig. 2 Spatio-temporal semantic data
    management system (STSDaMaS) Full size image Semantic repository: triple store
    The semantic repository implemented in the STSDaMaS framework is responsible for
    the management of semantic information associated with observations, devices,
    and the environment or terrain in which agents are deployed. Relationships between
    agents provide powerful information for decision-support solutions and even for
    identifying relevant information in the detection of anomalies or specific situations
    on the farm. The semantic repository includes a rule engine, which enables the
    inference of new individuals and rule-based reasoning about the triples stored
    in the repository. An example of a use case favored by this type of implementation
    can be found in agricultural diversification. Thanks to information on the terrain
    and conditions of a given crop, specific reasoning can be performed to determine
    the viability and yield of a new crop. For the testing and evaluation of the system
    proposed in this article, the Jena Rules [32] engine is used. The rules are defined
    in a file with the specific syntax of Jena Rules. However, other rule-based languages
    such as SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) [33], RIF (Rule Interchange Format)
    [34], N3 (Notation 3) [35], or RuleML [36], among others, could be used for the
    definition of rules. To identify a given individual in the knowledge base, the
    property http://purl.org/ dc/terms/identifier is used, allowing the association
    with its spatio-temporal information. To link the semantic container with the
    spatio-temporal information associated with a given sensor or device, the sosa:madeBySensor
    property is used. The content associated with the property sosa:madeBySensor reveals
    information about the type of device, the service offered, the provider, the name
    of the device, and the identifier of the TSDB in which the associated spatio-temporal
    information is stored. STSDaMaS internally uses this type of property to make
    associations between semantic information and the spatio-temporal evolution described
    by the primitive. Space-time repository: time-series oriented database (TSDB)
    Spatio-temporal characterization of data provides powerful information to observe
    the evolution of conditions associated with a given crop or terrain. In applications
    such as livestock farming, it makes it possible to track livestock and study their
    behavior under certain climatic or environmental conditions on the farm. Therefore,
    spatio-temporal information of data is a key element to increase agricultural
    performance and implement solutions for decision-making or automation. As spatio-temporal
    data management is one of the main elements in the proposal and to ensure the
    most efficient performance, some of its weaknesses and strengths must be analyzed
    and understood. There is a multitude of time-series oriented databases. Modern
    TSDBs include Prometheus, InfluxDB, TimescaleDB, PostgreSQL, and Cassandra. To
    maximize the performance of TSDBs, special attention must be paid to (i) data
    modeling, (ii) data structuring in tables, and (iii) Write-ahead logging (WAL).
    In terms of data modeling. TSDBs use the timestamp of the data as an index for
    indexing, so there is high performance when planning and retrieving data through
    temporal queries. However, the addition of filters as clauses in queries can increase
    planning and execution delays. To maintain high performance, careful modeling
    of the data is required. First of all, the types of attribute described in the
    data can be defined as “Tags” or “Fields”. ’Tags’ will be stored in the server
    memory until they disappear from the current shard. Footnote 1 In contrast, the
    information of attributes defined as ’Fields’ will be stored directly on disk.
    Therefore, queries whose filters include attributes defined as tags will perform
    better than those oriented to the search of attributes stored on disk. Because
    STSDaMaS uses the TSDB engine for data gathering concerning their spatio-temporal
    characterization, it is understandable to think that spatial information attributes
    have to be defined as “Tags”. However, the spatial marking of a datum represents
    an attribute of large variability and, therefore, high cardinality. That is, it
    can present a multitude of values in the repository. This causes high usage of
    the host server’s RAM resources, even blocking the system. The definition of tags
    should be limited to attributes with low-variability information and high frequency
    of use in the query predicate. In the proposal, only attributes with information
    related to the following are defined as tags: device identifier, service, scenario,
    device type, and provider. Three main sources of delay can be identified in data
    collection: (1) the planning of data gathering; (2) the execution of the plan
    and concurrent attack of processing threads to the different tables in which data
    reside; (3) serialization of data for delivery as a response to the query. These
    three sources of delay can be reduced by correct structuring of tables for data
    storage according to the nature of the data. Table 2 proposes the high-level structure
    of the measurement tables for an agricultural scenario. Table 2 Repository structure
    in tables Full size table Write-Ahead Logging is an important element in a time-series
    oriented database architecture, but it can limit performance in a near real-time
    scenario for querying the latest data injected into the TSDB. The WAL is a temporary
    cache for recently injected points (writes). To reduce the frequency with which
    permanent disk storage files are accessed, the TSDBs engine stores new points
    in the WAL and groups them in batches until their total size or age triggers a
    flush into permanent storage. WAL is also used as protection against the loss
    of recently added data on power loss. However, the WAL storage format is not easily
    queryable. For this reason, the proposed system includes a small relational database
    (SQL), which allows to speed up the collection of the last injected measurements.
    The SQL database will only store the last measurement obtained by each sensor,
    and its use can be of great utility because it can be deployed directly on the
    edge to increase system performance in certain scenarios. Space-time repository:
    relational database (SQL) The implementation of a small relational database on
    top of the STSDaMaS repository reduces the delays introduced when querying the
    latest data injected into the system using the WAL, and querying repositories
    with large volumes of data. But its introduction is even more interesting because
    of the distribution capacity it gives to the architecture. Precision agriculture
    presents several scenarios in which data gathering with strong semantic characterization
    is not necessary but prioritizes the updating of values or measurements in real-time.
    Solutions, such as the inclusion of actuators in response to anomalous responses
    captured by sensors (such as in fire cases) or livestock grazing using drones,
    require real-time interaction. In other cases, the farm scenario has low networking
    capabilities or resources to deploy a system like STSDaMaS directly at the edge
    or in the fog. However, it can perform a data update on the system deployed in
    the cloud, still losing real-time operation. However, the introduction of a relational
    database in the STSDaMaS framework allows this part of the architecture to be
    deployed directly at the edge, enabling real-time response to queries of less
    semantic complexity, but requiring real-time performance. In this way, batching
    of measurements can be performed at the edge and automatically sent to the cloud
    where the rest of the system is located when connection and conditions permit.
    Equations 1, 2, and 3 describe the response times for a given query to the component
    deployed on the edge (Eq. 1) or in the cloud (Eq. 2). Note that the query processing
    times at the edge will be lower since the query target is a relational database
    with a low amount of data, achieving real-time performance. However, if the query
    is more complex or its predicate aims at extracting historical information, it
    will be necessary to redirect the query to the STSDaMaS query engine located in
    the cloud. (1) (2) (3) Due to this versatility, the proposed system can be adapted
    to numerous farming scenarios even with different requirements or needs. Query
    system and data retrieval STSDaMaS is designed for the resolution of semantic
    queries whose subject varies in temporal and spatial character. Due to the distribution
    of the query system in knowledge and oriented to time series repositories, it
    offers high-performance retribution, whose response provides a powerful description
    of the environment, devices, and evolution present in the indicated context. STSDaMaS
    processes the data query operation according to the following sequence of high-level
    actions: (1) Through a data query interface, the semantic predicate of the query
    is extracted from the request, attacking a triple-store knowledge database (see
    a simple example of an SPARQL query in Listing 1). (2) Through a unique identifier
    (UID) of the observations or devices involved, spatio-temporal information is
    extracted from the non-relational time-series-oriented database. This allows for
    a fast and lightweight collection of the desired historical or current data. (3)
    Finally, the data are aggregated for delivery as a response to the query. Listing
    1 SPARQL query Full size image To illustrate the high-level operation of querying
    data through the system, a practical example is presented. For the query “What
    are the soil conditions at the Ylivieska farm in the last hour?”: (i) The system
    extracts the semantic predicate, collecting from the knowledge database all those
    sensors that perform measurements on soil conditions and that are associated with
    the farm with the identifier “Ylivieska”. (ii) Through the UIDs of the sensors
    or observations associated with the farm and providing soil measurements, the
    NoSQL database is accessed. Filtering by UIDs, the observations captured in the
    established time window are extracted, together with the geopositioning in the
    case of static devices or the different spatial marks in the case of mobile devices.
    (iii) The system will carry out the data aggregation, offering, as a response
    to the request, the farm object with all the associated soil-type devices and
    the observations captured in the indicated time window, together with their spatial
    mark (latitude and longitude or geohash). The process is depicted in Fig. 3. Fig.
    3 High-level query processing by STSDaMaS Full size image STSDaMaS framework not
    only extracts a complete semantic description of the data and their relationships;
    it also avoids querying a time-series oriented repository with a large volume
    of data directly. Instead, it is pre-filtered by selecting the identifiers of
    those observations or devices to be queried. This approach helps to collect a
    complete, understandable, and semantically rich response, avoiding the long delays
    produced when querying directly on historical databases. The greater the volume
    of data to be extracted, the greater the efficiency shown by the framework with
    respect to conventional solutions consisting only of a homogeneous repository.
    The framework includes a system for managing continuous queries against the historical
    repository (scheduled queries). Such queries can be configured to perform operations
    such as the calculation of average values at set time intervals or the detection
    of anomalous observations (e.g. out-of-range measurements, or geopositioning modification
    of a static device). For monitoring, as input for training Machine Learning (ML)
    models, for statistical analysis, and other types of solution, it will be necessary
    to extract data over a multitude of time points. However, as input for graphical
    analysis applications or as feedback to the farmer, in most cases, it will be
    sufficient to obtain certain aggregations of the data. For example, average, minimum,
    and maximum values, or other simple aggregations, over the observations queried.
    The continuous query management system allows the establishment of rules or aggregation
    functions within the historical repository of the system. In this way, operations
    such as the calculation of average, maximum, or minimum values are carried out
    on a scheduled basis, reducing delays in data collection due to the steady availability
    of these values. STSDaMaS data model—Agricultural Information Model (AIM) The
    STSDaMaS framework is proposed in the context of the H2020-DEMETER project (Building
    an Interoperable, Data-Driven, Innovative, and Sustainable European Agri-Food
    Sector) [37]. The DEMETER goal is to lead the digital transformation of Europe’s
    agri-food sector through the rapid adoption of advanced IoT technologies, data
    science, and smart agriculture, contributing to long-term viability and sustainability.
    It aims to empower farmers and agricultural cooperatives to (i) use their existing
    machinery and platforms by enabling knowledge extraction for improved decision-making
    and (ii) facilitate the evolution of their devices and platforms, targeting their
    investments where needed. The STSDaMaS input and output data model is modeled
    according to the Agricultural Information Model (AIM) [38], developed in the DEMETER
    project. The AIM model is based on the SOSA (Sensor, Observation, Sample, and
    Actuator) and SSN (Semantic Sensor Network) ontologies, which aim to model sensors,
    actuators, devices, and observations (measurements captured by sensors). AIM focuses
    on the semantic characterization of the data, providing detailed information about
    the observations captured by the sensors and their relationships with other agents
    in the field. The input and output data of the platform are described by the AIM
    model using the JSON Linked Data (JSON-LD) syntax for the Resource Description
    Framework (RDF). An example of the modeling of observations captured by environmental
    sensors is presented in Listing 2. Listing 2 AIM JsonLD representation of an observation
    Full size image Achieving interoperability, use case with the AFarCloud Data Model
    An IoT scenario is characterized by the collection of information from devices
    deployed in the field. However, in most use cases, devices have low resource capabilities
    and low computational power, which limits the management and production of data
    under complex and extensive syntax. Therefore, the semantic characterization offered
    by a data model such as AIM can be a limitation for some of the devices or sensors.
    However, the STSDaMaS proposal includes a solution to ensure interoperability
    with services, thanks to a component called Interoperability through Data Integration
    (IDI). The ISO/IEC 21823-1:2019 standard [39] outlines five levels of interoperability:
    Transport interoperability involves establishing a communication infrastructure
    to exchange data over different transport protocols or networks without loss or
    corruption of data. It also manages data quality of service (QoS) requirements,
    such as delivery, timeliness, ordering, durability, lifespan, and fault tolerance.
    Syntactic Interoperability is the ability of different IoT systems to exchange
    data using a common data format or syntax. This ensures that the data are correctly
    interpreted and processed by the receiving system, without ensuring that the meaning
    of the information is correctly understood. Semantic Interoperability aims to
    ensure that all entities attribute the same meaning to the information exchanged
    by using metadata and shared information models (ontologies). Behavioral Interoperability
    aligns and integrates business processes to achieve the expected result of information
    exchange. Legal or Policy Interoperability ensures that organizations operating
    under different legal frameworks, policies, and strategies can exchange information
    and collaborate effectively. This includes issues such as data privacy, security,
    and ownership, as well as compliance with industry standards and regulations.
    Due to the lack of standards, one of the most common problems in data management
    systems for precision agriculture lies in the interoperability between models
    or semantic Interoperability. Agricultural data management systems, as presented
    in the literature, are designed to ingest and retrieve data against the native
    model of the system. Such proposals force changes to the core of the system to
    adapt it to work with other data models. Some proposals focus on acquiring interoperability
    between heterogeneous agents or devices [40] or even propose environments for
    semantic interoperability through specific trait ontologies [41]. The IDI component
    aims to facilitate access to the functionalities offered by STSDaMaS, ensuring
    interoperability with different services through its data models. Thanks to this
    approach, the system remains stable, without the need for core variations to ensure
    data management and spatio-temporal semantic query resolution. To illustrate the
    proposal, the native data model on the AFarCloud platform and how STSDaMaS can
    offer data query management for AFarCloud services through the IDI component are
    presented (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Interoperability with different platform services through
    IDI Full size image The AFarCloud (Aggregate FARming in the CLOUD) ECSEL JU project
    [42] presents a distributed platform capable of offering the integration and cooperation
    of cyber-physical agriculture systems to increase efficiency, productivity, food
    quality, and animal welfare and reduce costs in agricultural labor. Focused on
    near real-time data exchange, it offers services for mission management, task
    automation, decision support, or even data processing and analysis, among others.
    Due to this approach, AFarCloud data offer strong temporal and spatial characterization,
    working with a JSON syntax for data exchange and communication between components.
    The AFarCloud repositories comprise three main data sets: 1. Description of observations
    captured by devices or sensors in the field. 2. Measurements collected by collars
    installed on the neck of livestock. 3. State vectors of UAVs, autonomous and semi-autonomous
    vehicles. Table 3 presents the information provided by the three data sets defined
    in the repositories of the AFarCloud platform. In addition, the structuring of
    attributes in the aforementioned Tags and Fields, for the storage of data in the
    TSDB is included. The set of JSON schemas that define the AFarCloud model is collected
    in [43]. Table 3 Data model for datasets 1, 2, and 3 Full size table Thanks to
    the IDI component, the query service of the proposed framework can be integrated
    to feed the services or algorithms of the AFarCloud platform. Figure 5 shows the
    diagram of the IDI component for data translation from an STSDaMaS query response
    to the AFarCloud data model. Fig. 5 Interoperability through Data Integration
    (IDI). AFarCloud Use Case Full size image To guarantee interoperability with the
    services offered by the AFarCloud platform, data preparation and transformation
    must be carried out from the output of the query interface of the STSDaMaS framework
    to the input of AFarCloud services. This process guarantees the interoperability
    of the STSDaMaS service for use in solutions offered by other frameworks. In IDI,
    the mapping between the equivalent classes of each ontology is established through
    an RDF graph. Table 4 shows the mapping between the properties of an observation
    captured by a sensor between both models. Certain additional rules are established
    through a properties file, such as the conversion between timestamps in date format
    to epoch format or the reformulation of certain fields according to certain patterns
    set by the target model for translation. Table 4 RDF mapping graph Full size table
    Once the mapping rules have been established, the response to the query delivered
    by the STSDaMas platform is connected to the IDI enabler for the preparation and
    translation of the data into JSON syntax of the AFarCloud model. In this way,
    the AIM output (Listing 3) is translated into the AFarCloud model (Listing 4)
    as input for the services offered by the AFarCloud platform. Listing 3 Interoperability
    through Data Integration (IDI). AFarCloud Use Case Full size image Listing 4 Interoperability
    through Data Integration (IDI). AFarCloud Use Case Full size image The IDI component
    operates as a wrapper for the STSDaMaS framework, allowing data input and output
    to be used for the understanding and coupling of other services. STSDaMaS Interoperability
    validation To validate the interoperability of the STSDaMaS service through the
    IDI component, an asset tracking and monitoring application has been developed.
    This application uses the queries offered by the STSDaMaS interface to represent
    the temporal evolution of observations associated with geolocated devices. However,
    it cannot understand and process the data modeled using AIM. The application will
    represent the data only when the query response message is valid against the JSON
    schemas defined in the AFarCloud model. To take advantage of the power of spatio-temporal
    semantic data management offered by the proposed system, the repositories should
    be nourished with data from observations, sensors, and devices, providing relevant
    information for each of the defined dimensions. For this experimental case, queries
    will be performed whose predicate describes the observations associated with environmental
    and soil measurements, such as temperature and humidity. For this purpose, it
    will be filtered by the type of service offered. Additionally, the search is limited
    to sensors installed on mobile devices, including information on batteries and
    other properties. Correct representation and monitoring of the temporal and geopositioning
    evolution of devices and associated measurements are offered through the exploitation
    of the time-series oriented repository. To build the scenario, real data were
    extracted from the AFarCloud project repositories and submitted to STSDaMaS via
    IDI for “translation” and subsequent injection into the repositories. To provide
    visualization of the evolution of the data in its temporal dimension, injection
    is performed continuously throughout the experimentation. The monitoring application
    is connected to the query interface offered by the STSDaMaS framework through
    the IDI component, which offers a response to queries according to the AFarCloud
    data model. The information provided by the monitoring application is represented
    in Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Monitoring application that displays updated data through STS-DaMaS
    Full size image Thanks to the query interface offered by STSDaMaS, the developed
    graphical application can represent historical and updated data in a near real-time
    environment. The application is especially useful for the representation of routes
    described by assets (see Fig. 7a) or even livestock (see Fig. 7a), through a purely
    user-oriented interface. Fig. 7 Representation of assets and cow tracking Full
    size image These asset monitoring applications provide added value to users, allowing
    them to check the current status or historical values captured by their devices
    in a simple and effective way. Even livestock behavior can be studied to improve
    animal welfare and optimize production. However, the potential of STSDaMaS lies
    in the possibility of performing more complex data management, providing answers
    to user-oriented queries, facilitating decision-making, or nurturing learning
    models. “System validation: applying neural network for fodder legume harvesting
    and bailing prediction” section presents the validation of the system against
    the need for more elaborate queries for a specific use case: increase in yield
    in forage crops. System validation: applying neural network for fodder legume
    harvesting and bailing prediction The main agricultural sectors include livestock
    farming and agriculture. However, in many scenarios, the dividing line between
    the two activities is practically non-existent. An example is the cultivation
    of crops for livestock feed. High crop quality and optimal harvesting and drying
    directly impact the quality of livestock, whether for meat or milk. There is an
    extensive list of supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms [44,45,46,47].
    Due to the temporal nature offered by the agricultural data and the data management
    offered by the proposed framework, the use of neural networks has been chosen
    for the evaluation and validation of the proposal as a “feeder” for training and
    prediction. In this chapter, the purpose of this article is to apply the data
    management framework proposed in the article to train and feed an MLP (Multi-Layer
    Perceptron) feedforward neural network to predict the optimal moment for harvesting,
    ensuring optimal drying of the forage legume crop for baling. An MLP neural network
    has been chosen based on its performance for prediction or forecasting solutions
    due to its multi-layer architecture. By ensuring optimal conditions for the harvest
    and drying of the forage, the quality of the product increases greatly, eliminating
    toxins and the loss of nutrients. The application of the system for feeding neural
    networks is proposed to predict the optimal mowing time for the fodder legume
    crop alfalfa. Alfalfa is a protein source and is characterized as one of the best
    forage crops for livestock feed. However, the optimal harvest time and the drying
    time to reduce moisture before packing are key factors in the quality of the harvested
    fodder and, therefore, in the development of livestock for meat or dairy. Thanks
    to the system proposed in this article, the extraction of historical information
    for neural network training is made possible, as well as a query system for the
    prediction of observations such as temperature and humidity, which are key for
    the determination of optimal times for mowing and drying of the fodder crop. To
    evaluate the STSDaMaS framework, the experiment focuses on forecasting the ideal
    harvest time of the fodder legume. After mowing, the desiccation stage begins.
    Natural desiccation of green forages occurs effectively at temperatures above
    15 °C, with relative humidity in the atmosphere below 70%. The most favorable
    conditions are offered with temperatures above 25 °C and relative humidity below
    60%. The objective of fodder drying is to reach a maximum moisture between 18
    and 20%, as once packed it is difficult to dry it later. A higher moisture level
    in the forage, between 20 and 35%, favors the microbial development of fungi,
    so that, among others, the loss of digestible nutrients, energy, and the possible
    production of harmful toxins to the animal will critically deteriorate the quality
    of the product. The drying process is a critical step to ensure maximum forage
    quality. However, the most common technique to determine the drying time by the
    farmer is to wait during a 24–48 h time window until harvest. This technique is
    not very precise. Other solutions include the use of sensors to constantly monitor
    product moisture. However, the moisture margin for optimal forage quality is very
    narrow, requiring constant monitoring costs and high availability for the farmer
    to carry out the baling at the right time. Mowing forage without adequate weather
    conditions will make the drying process impossible. Accurate forecasting of temperature
    and moisture conditions can ensure an effective forage drying process and provide
    the farmer with a valuable decision-support solution. To solve the forage mowing
    and drying process and to validate the STSDaMaS framework, a neural network is
    developed to predict the exact moment when the optimal conditions for mowing will
    occur. The neural network will be fed through the STSDaMaS query interface for
    training, validation, and production status. For the development of this experiment,
    the following tasks are performed: 1. Nourish STSDaMaS repositories with real
    data captured by moisture and temperature sensors in a forage crop. 2. Design
    and development of an MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) feedforward neural network.
    3. Neural network training through the STSDaMaS query interface. 4. Evaluation
    of the prediction provided by the neural network. The model presented for the
    validation of STSDaMaS offers the service of temperature and humidity prediction
    based on historical data. However, the development of an accurate weather prediction
    model is a complex task due to the variability and susceptibility to sudden changes
    in the weather. Therefore, as a test evaluation of the system proposed in the
    article, the model focuses on prediction based on historical data to provide decision
    support to the farmer or user. STSDaMaS repository nourishment Due to the large
    amount of data collected by hundreds of devices and sensors deployed in more than
    10 scenarios across Europe, the AFarCLoud repositories are used as a data source.
    As discussed in “Achieving interoperability, use case with the AFarCloud Data
    Model” section, the data from the AFarCloud repositories are structured and formatted
    according to their model, so their injection into the STSDaMaS repositories requires
    the IDI component, which is responsible for providing the interoperability of
    the service. Once the data are prepared and integrated with the AIM model used
    by STSDaMaS, they are written to the repositories through the injection interface.
    To ensure that the assessment scenario is as close as possible to a real environment,
    all data contained in one of the AFarCloud scenarios, located in the surroundings
    of Gamleby, Sweden, are uploaded. Comprising real observations captured by a multitude
    of sensors between 2020 and 2021. In turn, several active sensors provide service
    to STSDaMaS to keep humidity and temperature data in the crop up-to-date. In this
    way, the observations collected between 2020 and 2021 will be used to train the
    neural network and verify the forecast offered. The updated data will serve as
    input for the temperature and humidity forecast in the coming days. Neural network
    design and development STSDaMaS will provide the data set to train the neural
    network developed for the experiment through query interfaces. The first step
    in developing a suitable neural network for the prediction of humidity and temperature
    is the correct characterization of the data set. The prediction is oriented to
    time-series forecasting, so it must be taken into account that the data set is
    time-dependent (this breaks the requirement of linear regression that its observations
    be independent) and has some kind of stationarity (or tendency, for instance,
    according to the time of day, month, or time of year). For this environment, a
    simple FeedForward Footnote 2 neural network architecture is used, with 7 inputs,
    a hidden layer of 7 neurons, and an output of a single neuron. Based on the available
    data set, the frequency of measurement of agricultural devices and sensors, and
    the evolution trend throughout the day, the 7/7/1 architecture has been chosen
    due to the number of days of the week. It is intended to forecast humidity and
    temperature on the next consecutive day, displacing the input for the prediction
    of the following days. The hyperbolic tangent activation function is chosen since
    the values will be normalized between and 1. The Adam optimizer and the loss metric
    Mean Absolute Error are configured. To calculate the accuracy, the Mean Squared
    Error is used, since the prediction will be a continuous value and not a discrete
    one. Neural network training and validation A total of 8,430,118 observations
    captured by static and mobile devices are available in the repository, together
    with the semantic description of the devices and the farm or crop with which they
    are associated. This data set comprises observations from sensors, observations
    from sensors embedded in collars fitted to the neck of livestock, and state vectors
    from vehicles or UAVs. The values associated with temperature and atmospheric
    humidity for the forage crop comprise a total of 511,738 time points. For neural
    network training, consecutive queries are made to the STSDaMaS Data Query interface
    to extract the timestamps and values of humidity and temperature captured for
    the forage crop. For neural network training, it has been decided to collect the
    humidity observations in sets of 7 consecutive days and forecast the humidity
    values on the eighth day. Therefore, requests to the STSDaMaS query interface
    will extract the samples for 8 consecutive days, starting January 1, 2020, until
    September 1, 2022 (the rest of the data, until January 1, 2022, will be used for
    validation). To train the network with backpropagation [48], the time series provided
    by the output of the STSDaMaS query interface must be converted into a “supervised
    type problem”. In Fig. 8 the values obtained after 40 EPOCHS in model training,
    directly fed by the STSDaMaS query interface, are shown. Fig. 8 Training parameters
    Full size image Once the model has been trained, it is validated with the samples
    that have not been used in the training set. For the validation of the humidity
    prediction, the samples captured between 1 September 2021 and 1 January 2022 are
    available, obtaining the following graph as a result of the validation (see Fig.
    9). The measurements shown in green correspond to the actual value obtained from
    the sensors, and the measurements shown in red correspond to the values provided
    by the model. Fig. 9 Moisture prediction by the neural network fed from STSDaMaS
    Full size image The process is repeated for the temperature data, performing sequential
    queries through the STSDaMaS query interface, and training the model. Finally,
    the remaining set of temperature samples from the training set is used for model
    validation. Figure 10 shows the result of the validation of the temperature forecast
    between 1 September 2021 and 1 January 2022. The values represented in green correspond
    to the actual measurement, and the values represented in red correspond to the
    prediction provided by the model. Fig. 10 Temperature prediction using the neural
    network fed by STSDaMaS Full size image Humidity and temperature forecasting for
    predicting forage desiccation Once the neural network has been trained and validated,
    it is time to evaluate its response in the production environment. Given the following
    case: A certain crop has developed correctly and the user or farmer wants to know
    the optimal time for harvesting, ensuring that the atmospheric humidity and temperature
    conditions are correct for the drying of the fodder and its subsequent packaging.
    For this purpose, the neural network is fed through the STSDaMaS query interface
    to forecast the evolution of humidity and temperature in the following days. To
    provide a useful forecast for the farmer, historical data are queried for the
    previous 30 days and the evolution of humidity and temperature for the next 7
    days is predicted. If the average humidity and temperature values are in the right
    range for effective forage drying, harvesting will be recommended, and the ideal
    day and time to start will be indicated. Figure 11 shows the evolution of humidity
    Fig. (11a) and temperature Fig. (11b) for September. For the forecast offered
    by the neural network, the average humidity Fig. (11c) and temperature Fig. (11d)
    for the first week of October are shown. Fig. 11 Evolution of temperature and
    humidity provided by STSDaMaS and forecast provided by NN Full size image The
    forecast provided by the neural network determines that the first week of October
    presents optimal conditions for the forage drying stage. It is recommended that
    the mowing be performed from 11:00 A.M. on the first day of October to take advantage
    of the temporary window of optimal weather conditions. In turn, through the STSDaMaS
    query system, the current observations captured by the field devices will be represented
    in a near real-time environment, providing up-to-date information. Through the
    set of forage moisture observations, the neural network can be trained and validated
    to predict the exact moment for the baling of the forage, ensuring optimal forage
    quality conditions. However, the objective of this experiment is to validate the
    STSDaMaS framework, the data management offered, and the interoperability offered
    by its service; therefore, the implementation and improvement of decision support
    systems or monitoring or automation applications, among others, will be the target
    of future developments and research. The work carried out for the validation of
    the model aims to show the effectiveness and applicability of the proposal to
    feed prediction models that support decision-making. However, the accuracy obtained
    in the development of the neural network presented in this article could be optimized
    through some changes in its development: (i) Development of a new model taking
    the time stamp as a new input variable. (ii) Using the time stamp as an additional
    variable but using it with Embeddings. Temperature and humidity vary according
    to the year, month, and time of day at which the measurement is taken. Therefore,
    adding the time stamp as an input variable to the model can substantially improve
    the accuracy of the forecast, reducing the number of data needed for training.
    Through the STSDaMaS query interface, the evolution of atmospheric humidity presented
    for the first week of August 2020 and 2021 Fig. (12a) and the temperatures presented
    for the last week of July 2020 and 2021 Fig. (12b) are shown, demonstrating a
    clear similarity in their evolution. Fig. 12 Comparisons of humidity and temperature
    between 2020 and 2021 (output provided by the STSDaMaS query interface) Full size
    image Thanks to the neural network developed, the STSDaMaS framework has been
    validated as a spatio-temporal semantic data management system. The framework
    can provide service for machine learning models, decision-making algorithms, and
    monitoring agents and crop conditions. In turn, the development of the IDI component
    provides the service interoperability necessary for its inclusion in other precision
    agriculture solutions. The STSDaMaS framework could be of high utility in other
    application environments such as Industry 4.0, but for this, both its model, query
    functions, and repository structure must be adapted. Conclusion The authors of
    this article propose an innovative framework that, after describing the spatio-temporal
    semantic character of the data collected in the precision agriculture domain,
    offers the service of advanced data management and querying. The core of the STSDaMaS
    framework focuses on repository distribution in a knowledge base and time-series
    oriented database. Due to the repository distribution, STSDaMaS offers high performance
    in query resolution and complete data description. The distributed architecture
    of the repository offers: (A) Resolution of temporal and/or spatial queries through
    access to a historical database. (B) Resolution of semantic queries, through SPARQL
    on a triple-store, allowing the extraction of information and semantic description
    of data, as well as its relations with other individuals. (C) Resolution of complex
    queries through the relationships between the knowledge database and the historical
    database employing devices and their captured observation UIDs. STSDaMaS proposal
    constitutes a spatio-temporal semantic data management system that offers service
    interoperability through semantic interoperability. This innovative approach is
    particularly important in view of the European data strategy [49], which aims
    to make Europe a leader in the data-driven society. To guarantee the interoperability
    of the service offered by the proposed framework, the Interoperability through
    Data Integration component is described. The proposal has been validated by demonstrating
    the interoperability between the STSDaMaS framework, which works with DEMETER’s
    AIM data model, and the AFarCloud platform and its data model. In this way, projects
    such as DEMETER, which does not have a management system or native repositories,
    can include data ingestion and query services. In turn, it guarantees interoperability
    to increase the number of solutions available within the project framework, as
    shown by guaranteeing interoperability with the AFarCloud platform. The data preparation
    and transformation between the AIM and AFarCloud data model allow solutions such
    as decision-making or machine learning models fed by data in the AFarCloud framework,
    to be integrated with DEMETER through the STSDaMaS, increasing the number of available
    solutions. The article presents a specific use case for the validation of the
    proposal as input for machine learning models. It describes the complexity and
    importance of the task of mowing and desiccating legume fodder crops and the possibility
    of making a forecast for its correct development. A neural network is developed
    and fed through STSDaMaS for training and validation. An accurate weather forecast
    is provided for the recommendation of forage mowing, ensuring effective drying.
    The management of these crops is essential to ensure the quality of livestock
    feed, which includes a direct impact on animal welfare and the quality of beef
    or dairy products. The proposal presented in this article has been developed in
    the framework of the European DEMETER project, in collaboration with and expansion
    of the research and development carried out in the European AFarCloud project.
    This scenario allows for experimentation and validation of the proposal against
    a real scenario and data. The novel data management framework proposed in this
    article gathers the needs exposed in the precision agriculture framework, the
    literature, and the needs of specialists, engineers, farmers, or agricultural
    administrators themselves. The proposal has been applied as an spatio-temporal
    semantic data manager with service interoperability, enabling the annexation of
    AFarCloud project solutions in the DEMETER architecture. Future work The design
    and implementation of the STSDaMaS system focus on the application domain of precision
    agriculture. In this state, its adaptability to other application domains such
    as Smart Industry, Smart Cities, or Smart healthcare would imply modifications
    or extensions to the native data model of the system or the adaptability of some
    of its query or data injection functions. However, precision agriculture presents
    a scenario with common characteristics to those of other domains versed in sensor
    networks. Our current line of research focuses on extending the proposal to ensure
    its adaptability to other application domains of the Internet of Things framework.
    The temperature and humidity prediction model developed for the validation of
    the proposed system offers a valuable solution to the farmer or user. Once the
    proposal has been validated, the resilience of the model to abrupt changes in
    weather conditions could be improved. To increase prediction accuracy against
    sudden changes in climatic conditions, the inclusion of other data sources outside
    of the specific assessment scenario should be considered. Data provided by weather
    stations or data captured by devices deployed in neighboring scenarios offer the
    ability to anticipate abrupt changes in current conditions. The evaluation of
    observations such as precipitation amounts or wind speed and direction is currently
    under study. Notes A shard is a horizontal partition of data in a database or
    search engine. Each shard remains in a separate instance of the database server,
    to spread the load. Also denominated MLP for Multi-Layered Perceptron. References

    Agriculture is critical to global food security and economic development. Precision
    farming using machine learning (ML) and the Internet of Things (IoT) is a promising
    approach to increasing crop productivity and optimizing resource use. This paper
    presents an integrated crop and fertilizer recommendation system aimed at optimizing
    agricultural practices in Rwanda. The system is built on two predictive models:
    a machine learning model for crop recommendations and a rule-based fertilization
    recommendation model. The crop recommendation system is based on a neural network
    model trained on a dataset of major Rwandan crops and their key growth parameters
    such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium levels, and soil pH. The fertilizer recommendation
    system uses a rule-based approach to provide personalized fertilizer recommendations
    based on pre-compiled tables. The proposed prediction model achieves 97% accuracy.
    The study makes a significant contribution to the field of precision agriculture
    by providing decision support tools that combine artificial intelligence and domain
    knowledge. Keywords: precision agriculture; Internet of Things; artificial intelligence;
    crop recommendation; fertilizer recommendation 1. Introduction Agriculture is
    a vital part of the global economy, providing food, fibe, and other essential
    products for human consumption [1]. However, the agricultural sector faces significant
    challenges in meeting the growing demand for food as the global population increases,
    climatic conditions change, and the significant concern subjected to the critical
    role of soil and fertilizers in achieving optimal crop yields and maintaining
    soil health [2]. It is well known that the right soil type and precise applicability
    of fertilizers are critical factors that can significantly enhance crop growth
    and overall agricultural sustainability. However, the conventional agricultural
    system has long been plagued by a shortfall in intelligent recommendations; as
    such, systems are often based on general guidelines, historical knowledge, and
    limited experimentation [3]. The traditional systems do not consider the specific
    needs of individual crops and fields, which often leads to the inefficient allocation
    of resources, increased costs for farmers, and sub-optimal environmental outcomes
    [4]. In light of these challenges, the agricultural sector stands at the threshold
    of transformation. There is an urgent need to revolutionize farming practices.
    Precision agriculture (PA), a subset of smart agriculture, is a promising solution
    to these challenges, as it can help improve agricultural practices’ efficiency
    and sustainability [5]. PA involves using advanced technology and data-driven
    techniques to optimize agricultural practices [6,7]. Key components of precision
    agriculture often include the use of sensors, GPS (global positioning system)
    technology, drones, and data analytics [8,9]. This transition towards a more effective,
    data-driven, and user-friendly approach is essential to improve farming operations’
    efficiency, productivity, and sustainability by making more precise and informed
    decisions based on real-time data [10]. In particular, this shift is made possible
    by the advent of Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation Systems (CFRS), which harness
    the power of technology such as the Internet of Things (IoT), data analytics,
    and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to provide specialized guidance to farmers [11,12].
    Such system holds promising scope to optimize soil and fertilizer interactions,
    increase agricultural productivity, and promote sustainable practices. Moreover,
    CFRS can empower farmers with valuable insights, reduce uncertainties, and mitigate
    the risks associated with traditional farming methods. In the modern era, the
    integration of IoT and AI in agriculture has witnessed significant growth in recent
    years [13,14]. IoT is reshaping how we collect, process, and utilize data in real
    time through a network of interconnected sensors and devices embedded in the agricultural
    landscape. IoT-based systems are deployed to collect real-time sensory data on
    various factors affecting crop growth, such as temperature, humidity, soil pH,
    and nutrient levels [15]. This wealth of real-time data and AI analytics forms
    the foundation upon which the CFRS operates to make informed decisions on crop
    selection and fertilizer application. The study aimed to bridge the gap between
    the physical and digital realms by integrating IoT technology with AI into modern
    agriculture. The proposed CFRS reported in this paper not only facilitates the
    recommendation of suitable crops to specific agricultural land but also offers
    fertilizer recommendations based on the soil condition for the crops during both
    pre-sowing (before plantation) and post-sowing until the crop reaches maturity.
    With such a comprehensive perspective, the proposed CFRS (Crop and Fertilizer
    Recommendation Systems) holds significant potential for addressing the challenges
    faced by smallholder farmers and for countries subject to food insecurity such
    as Rwanda due to low productivity, declining soil organic matter, and adverse
    topography. Rwanda has been heavily involved in promoting crop intensification
    programs to increase the agricultural productivity of high-value food crops and
    achieve food security and self-sufficiency [16]. However, smallholder farmers,
    who play a vital role in the agricultural sector, face challenges that limit their
    crop productivity. These challenges include sub-humid conditions that cause frequent
    crop failures, the prevalence of acidic soils, declines in soil organic matter
    due to high population density, and the country’s topography that makes agricultural
    systems vulnerable [17]. A study by NISR found that agriculture employs nearly
    72% of Rwandans and contributes nearly 33% to the country’s GDP [18]. This mismatch
    between labor force participation and GDP contribution shows how serious the problems
    in the agricultural sector are. Moreover, the socioeconomic impacts are severe,
    with persistent poverty and alarming malnutrition rates, especially among children.
    Therefore, by addressing both crop and fertilizer recommendations in an integrated
    way, the proposed CFRS has a transformative impact. It can potentially revolutionize
    the current agriculture system in Rwanda by optimizing the selection of suitable
    crops on particular farming land, in-creasing crop yields, reducing fertilizer
    waste, and promoting sustainable practices. Although several studies reported
    in the literature focus on developing sustainable agriculture systems in the Rwandan
    context, many of these approaches utilize data analysis machine learning (ML)
    techniques and deep learning models to build predictive models addressing various
    challenges to crop production [19,20,21]. It has been identified that most of
    the existing works are subjected to predicting yields of different crops, assessing
    the soil quality, reviewing agricultural crop policies and single crop recommendations,
    and understanding the impact of climate anomalies on crops. However, the scope
    of the existing works reported in the literature is often narrowly defined, either
    addressing a single aspect of farming or not integrating crucial components of
    fertilizer suggestion and soil conditions. This isolation often results in a lack
    of comprehensive insights, limiting the existing approaches’ real-world applicability
    and accuracy. The subsequent section highlights this research manuscript’s prime
    aim and core contribution. 1.1. Contributions of the Study The prime aim of this
    study is to help farmers choose the best crops to grow and the right amount of
    fertilizer to use. The study develops a comprehensive model that integrates CFRS
    holistically, considering various relevant factors to provide more precise and
    specialized recommendations to farmers. The key contributions of this study are
    highlighted as follows: Data Processing and Profiling: Comprehensive data on Rwanda’s
    major crops have been collated and analyzed, focusing on structured content and
    data integrity. Correlation Analysis: The study examines how inter-variable correlation
    can enhance predictive modeling, leading to better decision-making. Crop Recommendation:
    The study implements a neural network model to recommend crops. This model has
    been thoroughly trained and tested and is more effective than other prominent
    ML models. Fertilizer Recommendation: The modeling of fertilizer recommendation
    adopts a simple logical function that supports the foundational understanding
    that each soil and crop combination has specific nutrient requirements. The predetermined
    rules grounded in real agricultural practices were adopted, allowing farmers to
    understand the why behind a recommendation, fostering trust and encouraging adoption.
    Practical Application with IoT: Real-world testing was conducted with IoT sensors,
    where proposed CFRS is applied to collect data to offer actionable insights. The
    study also presents a conceptual architecture for deploying the proposed CFRS
    on a cloud server to provide real-time, effective, and data-driven agricultural
    recommendations, including monitoring soil conditions and nutrient dynamics over
    time. By combining IoT and AI to framing practices, this paper offers a solution
    to the rising global food demand facing challenges, such as population growth
    and changing climate condition: an advanced system that not only suggests which
    crops to grow but also offers the right fertilizer to use based on various data
    inputs. The novelty of the proposed work stems from multiple factors. Firstly,
    the proposed system is more comprehensive than existing approaches, which often
    restrict recommendations to one or two crops. It caters to various crops predominantly
    cultivated in Rwanda and considers soil conditions at various crop growth stages
    to recommend the proper fertilizer application. Secondly, the proposed system
    also includes effective data processing and profiling to ensure the completeness
    and reliability of the data used for recommendation modeling. The proposed schemes
    are designed to be lightweight, ensuring rapid and cost-effective computations.
    1.2. Outline of the Study The remaining part of the proposed manuscript is organized
    as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses the related work, demonstrating the current
    research status and differentiating the proposed work from the existing one. Further,
    Section 3 elaborates on a system design following the implementation procedures
    adopted in each module of the proposed CFRS. Next, Section 4 discusses the performance
    metrics adopted in the experimental process, result analysis, and performance
    discussion. This section also presents the use case scenario of the proposed system
    concerning real-world deployment scenarios. Finally, Section 5 concludes the work
    and core findings reported in this paper. 2. Related Works The application of
    precision agriculture has been the focus of extensive research and development
    efforts, with scholars across the globe developing various strategies and technologies
    to optimize farming practices. This section reviews the research works done in
    the context of soil quality prediction, crop recommendation, and fertilizer recommendation.
    The researchers in Rivera and Bonilla [22] trained neural network and generalized
    linear model (GLM) models on a dataset of soil samples from different regions
    with varying properties such as texture, organic matter content, and pH to predict
    soil quality. The experimental results showed that the neural network model outperformed
    the GLM model regarding prediction accuracy. The study provides two models that
    can be used to predict aggregate stability when direct measurements are unavailable,
    which can help improve the comprehensiveness of soil surveys. Suchithra and Pai
    [23] utilized extreme learning machines (ELM) to optimize agriculture practices
    through soil testing and classification. By analyzing soil test report values,
    village-wise soil fertility indices for essential nutrients are categorized. The
    Gaussian radial basis function emerges as the top performer, with over 80% accuracy
    in most classifications. The presented approach can reduce fertilizer waste, enhance
    profitability, and improve soil health and environmental quality for sustainable
    agriculture in India. In [24], Chambers showed that the type of ML model used
    can affect the accuracy of soil property predictions and that local farms tend
    to have more accurate predictions than farms in different locations. Principal
    component analysis (PCA) with 50 components was found to be beneficial. Wu et
    al. [25] showed that the Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model can
    effectively estimate soil nutrients for Dacrydium pectinatum communities in China.
    The GRNN model, along with the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and support vector machine
    (SVM) model, is utilized to assess soil nutrient content and quality grades. The
    work of Rose et al. [26] emphasized the significance of ML classifiers and statistical
    approaches in predicting soil fertility and regulating ecosystems with reduced
    human intervention. In [27], Rajamanickam used Decision trees, KNN, and SVM algorithms
    to predict soil fertility based on macro- and micronutrient data, achieving 99%
    accuracy with the decision tree algorithm. In [28], Rajamanickam and Mani addressed
    the impact of climate anomalies on crops and environmental challenges on agriculture
    practices. The authors have proposed a probabilistic neural network for the soil
    fertility prediction approach, providing higher accuracy and reduced processing
    time. Katarya et al. [29] discuss various artificial intelligence (AI) techniques
    for improving crop yields in agriculture. These techniques are based on the paradigm
    of precision agriculture (PA), specifically crop recommender systems. The specific
    approaches discussed include K-nearest neighbor (KNN), similarity-based classifiers,
    ensemble learning, and neural networks. The authors introduce a model that considers
    external factors such as meteorological data, temperature, and soil profile to
    recommend optimal crops for cultivation. This can lead to improved yields and
    more efficient use of resources. Klerkx et al. [30] provided a comprehensive overview
    of the emerging field of digital agriculture, covering a wide range of sub-fields,
    including the adoption of digital technologies on farms, the impact of digitalization
    on farmer identity and skills, ethics in digital agriculture, the effects of digitalization
    on agricultural knowledge and innovation systems, and the economics of digital
    agriculture. The study maps the contributions of 17 special issue articles to
    these clusters. It offers insights into the links between digital agriculture
    and farm diversity, new economic and institutional arrangements, and the governance
    of digital agriculture. Shadrin et al. [31] developed a low-power embedded system
    with AI capabilities for continuous analysis of plant leaf growth. The system
    uses a GPU to run a recurrent neural network (LSTM) on board, enabling autonomous
    operation for 180 days on a standard Li-ion battery. This study opens up new possibilities
    for intelligent monitoring in agriculture, and the authors have shared the Tomato
    Growth dataset with the research community. Kumar et al. [32] investigate how
    wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in precision agriculture to improve
    crop yields and quality. They highlight a variety of WSN applications, such as
    pest and disease control, animal tracking, and crop strength assessment, which
    have the potential to significantly boost crop production. Talaviya et al. [33]
    discuss the importance of AI in addressing agricultural challenges posed by rising
    population and food demand. They review AI applications in agriculture, including
    irrigation, weeding, and spraying using sensors, robots, and drones, with a focus
    on soil moisture sensing, automated weeding techniques, and drone applications
    for spraying and crop monitoring. Kamilaris et al. [34] introduce a smart farming
    framework that uses IoT platforms to process diverse sensor data streams in real
    time. The Agri-IoT framework supports reasoning across heterogeneous data streams,
    enabling seamless integration of sensors, services, processes, farmers, and online
    information sources. It provides a comprehensive and adaptable solution for the
    agri-food industry, bridging the gap between external factors and the food supply
    chain. Rekha et al. [35] develop an IoT framework to help farmers improve their
    farming methods and increase crop yields. The framework uses wireless sensor networks
    to collect data and a decision support system to provide farmers with personalized
    advice on irrigation, fertilization, and other practices. The advice is delivered
    in the farmers’ regional language through an Android app, making it easy for them
    to follow and improve their farming practices, which can lead to increased income.
    Rehman et al. [36] propose a smart farming approach that uses real-time sensor
    data and machine learning to improve agricultural practices. By integrating these
    two technologies, their approach enhances precision agriculture and overcomes
    the limitations of traditional smart farming methods. Priya et al. [37] suggested
    using deep learning algorithms to predict the best crops to grow based on factors
    such as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, pH, soil type, and land type. This
    crop recommendation system helps farmers make informed decisions to improve productivity,
    especially in the face of changing weather patterns. Biradar et al. [38] highlight
    the potential of IoT and data mining to develop intelligent systems for more efficient
    water management in agriculture. Sensor networks can provide a cost-effective
    way to monitor and control water use, leading to improved crop yields and food
    security. Akhter et al. [10] demonstrate how IoT, WSN, data analytics, and machine
    learning can be used to revolutionize apple disease prediction in apple orchards.
    They also explore the challenges of implementing these technologies in traditional
    farming practices. Ref. [39] studied how IoT can revolutionize traditional irrigation
    scheduling on a flood-irrigated subtropical lemon farm. They also explore the
    challenges of implementing these technologies in traditional farming practices.
    Gupta et al. [40] show that using the right algorithms on sensor data can recommend
    the best crops to grow, leading to higher yields and better-quality produce. Vi-vekanandhan
    et al. [41] introduce an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) technique
    for analyzing agricultural plant growth based on soil, water level, temperature,
    and moisture conditions.Their smart irrigation system is effective in monitoring
    and improving crop growth. Hence, it can be seen that there is much research work
    presented on PA applications and ML-based predictive modeling to benefit agriculture
    systems. However, each method is associated with its own advantages, and they
    have limitations too. It has also been analyzed that very little work is done
    in the context of Rwanda’s agricultural system. The literature is rich with studies
    on various ML applications in smart agriculture. However, such approaches are
    subjected to theoretical discussion, not implementations. The theoretical discussions
    are valuable, and validation of these models in real-world agricultural settings
    is essential to assess their feasibility and effectiveness. The potential of integrating
    the IoT and AI in agriculture has been explored in previous research. However,
    in isolation, most of these studies either focus on crop or fertilizer recommendations.
    It has also been noticed that the existing studies lack details about the data
    source system implementations, even if they do not specify the features used and
    on what basis they selected a particular learning model. All these gaps are addressed
    by the proposed system discussed in the next section. 3. Materials and Methods
    The development of the proposed recommendation models is carried out using python
    programming language in Anaconda distribution installed on windows 10 machine.
    Five-pin soil transmitter (Type485) sensors from (Shandong Renke Control Technology
    Co., Ltd., Jinan City, China), were used to collect data across agricultural fields.
    This section presents the design of the proposed CFRS as a support system for
    precision agriculture and sustainable farming practices. Building a robust and
    efficient CFRS for Rwanda’s agricultural system requires a suitable dataset that
    includes crop information, soil properties, and nutrients. However, no standard
    dataset for building CFRS in the Rwandan context is available. The first steps
    in building the proposed CFRS system are to collect and prepare the dataset. This
    study has developed a sophisticated data modeling and feature extraction approach
    to effectively train the learning model for crop recommendation based on current
    soil attributes. Figure 1 shows the schematic architecture of the proposed system,
    which includes various computing modules such as dataset collection and selection,
    data profiling, data preprocessing, neural network-driven crop recommendation,
    and decision logic implementation for fertilizer recommendation. Figure 1. Schematic
    architecture of the proposed CRFS workflow. The proposed system architecture,
    shown in Figure 1, involves a highly synchronized approach to data analytics and
    computational intelligence. The top layer of the system design is responsible
    for collecting data from different sources. These data are then analyzed and mapped
    to construct a final crop dataset in the next layer. Exploratory data analysis
    and correlation analysis are then performed to understand the nature of the data
    and obtain significant insights into which preprocessing techniques to apply to
    ensure the dataset’s completeness. This process is crucial for ensuring the dataset’s
    quality, making it suitable for training the learning model for crop recommendation.
    The study used the common practice of splitting the dataset into training and
    testing sets in an 80:20 ratio. The neural network model was configured and optimized
    for the specific problem and input data. The trained model was then validated
    on the testing dataset, which consisted of different soil attributes. The next
    part of the proposed system integrates a rule-based fertilizer recommendation
    system. This phase first performs soil profiling using the preprocessed dataset
    from the crop recommendation system and builds a lookup table based on scientific
    evidence and expert knowledge. The proposed system is based on the ideology that
    while many tasks can benefit from the predictive capabilities of machine learning,
    there is undeniable value in domain-specific, expert-driven rules. The proposed
    rule-based fertilizer recommendation system is based on the principle that each
    soil and crop combination has specific nutrient requirements. It is transparent
    and easy to understand, as it is based on established knowledge in agriculture.
    This allows farmers to understand the reasoning behind the recommendations, which
    can build trust and lead to improved crop yields and more sustainable farming
    practices. The system also includes a feedback loop mechanism to help update and
    improve the rules and recommendations over time. The proposed study discusses
    the conceptual architecture of the system and underscores its real-world applicability
    and feasibility for deployment in a cloud environment. 3.1. Data Processing and
    Profiling In order to ensure the effectiveness of the crop recommendation system,
    diverse data are collected, including information on soil properties, nutrient
    levels, and crop performance from various agricultural regions. The data collection
    phase of the proposed system involved compiling crop datasets from various sources,
    primarily the crop recommendation dataset and soil fertility data obtained from
    Kaggle [42,43], and soil nutrient balance (NPK) dataset of Rwanda obtained from
    [44]. Combining data from different sources is difficult because the data can
    be in different formats and sizes. This study uses a sophisticated data modeling
    process called data profiling to harmonize and integrate the data to address this
    challenge. First, the system selects the major crops cultivated in Rwanda, such
    as maize, potatoes, beans, tomatoes, coffee, cassava, sweet potatoes, sorghum,
    onion, kidney beans, and banana. The selection criteria are based on familiarity
    with Rwanda’s agricultural system, sustainability concerns, and empirical evidence
    from previous studies [45,46]. This process results in a comprehensive crop data
    collection relevant to the study objectives. Data profiling is the process of
    examining a dataset to understand its structure, content, and quality. The first
    step in this process is to review the columns of the dataset. In this case, the
    dataset included columns for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature,
    humidity, pH, rainfall, and a label column. These columns represent essential
    factors that affect crop growth. Next, the study selected the columns that are
    relevant to the study, which are N, P, K, pH, and major crop. Focusing on these
    variables simplified the dataset while retaining the most critical information.
    Finally, the study filtered the dataset to include only rows corresponding to
    the significant crops of interest. To prevent bias, the data frame was randomly
    shuffled. The data frame index was reset to maintain data integrity. Finally,
    a new data frame was created with only the selected variables. Algorithm 1 shows
    how data profiling was used to clean and streamline the dataset after preprocessing.
    This helped to identify the key features in the data and ensure that the analysis
    focused on the variables that were most relevant to the study objectives. Algorithm

    and rectify outliers in 𝒟 ′  10. Remove duplicates in 𝑑𝑓 (ensures completeness
    of the dataset) End 3.2. Preprocessing Preprocessing is a critical step in data-driven
    predictive modeling because the quality of the data and the useful information
    that can be extracted from them directly affects the model’s ability to learn
    the underlying patterns in the training data. This phase of the proposed system
    involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) and correlational analysis. EDA is a
    process of analyzing datasets to identify their main characteristics, often using
    visual methods. Under EDA, the study calculates descriptive statistics such as
    mean, median, mode, minimum, maximum, range, quartiles, variance, and standard
    deviation to understand the relationships between the variables. Table 1 shows
    different crops’ average NPK (kg/ha) and pH requirements. The average NPK requirements
    for bananas are 100.19 kg of nitrogen, 80.89 kg of phosphorus, and 50.04 kg of
    potassium per hectare. The average pH of soil where bananas are grown is 6.07,
    considered moderately acidic. Similarly, beans require an average of 75.09 kg
    of nitrogen, 25.32 kg of phosphorus, and 34.73 kg of potassium per hectare. The
    average pH for growing beans is 5.89, considered highly acidic. Cassava requires
    an average of 74.77 kg of nitrogen, 34.92 kg of phosphorus, and 59.79 kg of potassium
    per hectare. The average pH of cassava fields is 5.92, which is also highly acidic.
    Similar interpretations can be made for other crops to understand their fertilizer
    requirements and soil suitability for more efficient crop production. Table 1.
    A sample visualization of crops with mean values. Figure 2 provides a comparative
    analysis of different crops based on their nitrogen requirements in Kg/ha. The
    analysis demonstrates that the crop Maize requires the most nitrogen, followed
    by onion and sorghum. Kidney beans require the least nitrogen. Bananas have a
    wide range of nitrogen needs, appearing in the highest and lowest categories.
    Similarly, Figure 3 gives a comparative analysis of different crops based on their
    phosphorus requirements in Kg/ha. Figure 2. Analysis regarding most and least
    nitrogen-requiring crops. Figure 3. Analysis concerning most and least phosphorus-requiring
    crops. The insight from Figure 3 exhibits that bananas require the most phosphorus,
    followed by maize and kidney beans. Beans and coffee require relatively less phosphorus.
    Onions have diverse phosphorus requirements, ranking in the highest categories.
    A closer analysis of Figure 4 reveals that onions, followed by cassava and potatoes,
    require the most potassium, while kidney beans, maize, and sorghum require little
    potassium. This analysis emphasizes the varied nutrient profiles of different
    crops across categories. Figure 4. Analysis for most and least potassium-requiring
    crops. The analysis shown in Figure 5 offers a holistic view of the data’s distribution
    and relationships between different data points color-coded based on different
    crops under major crops. In this visualization, the diagonal part shows frequent
    distribution of the data points. In contrast, the scatter representation of the
    data points showcases the distinction among the different crops concerning different
    nutrient requirements. It can be seen that nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are
    correlated; it seems that crops that need high amounts of N may also require high
    amounts of P. Figure 5. Pair-wise relationship visualization. A closer analysis
    of the above-mentioned Figure 5 also reveals that specific data points are densely
    packed, indicating that such crops have similar requirements for those paired
    nutrients. Moreover, a few data points are also found that lie far away from others,
    which can be potentially an outlier, which, if not addressed, may introduce ambiguity
    in predictive learning. To eliminate the outliers, the proposed study uses the
    standard score method, which measures how many standard deviations an element
    is from the mean. About 99.7% of the data in a normal distribution fall within
    three standard deviations from the mean. Therefore, a score greater than three
    is used as an indicator of an outlier. Mathematically, the outlier score (S) for
    a data point x is computed as follows: 𝑆= 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 , (1) where x is the data point,
    𝜇 refers to the mean value of the dataset, and 𝜎 denotes the standard deviation
    of the dataset. So, if the value of S of a data point falls outside a predefined
    threshold, the data point is tagged as an outlier. Figure 6 presents a correlation
    heatmap to gain insight into correlation among different data points. Figure 6.
    Correlation analysis. Figure 6 shows a correlation plot of different crop nutrients
    and factors. The values in the plot range from −1 to 1, where −1 indicates a strong
    negative correlation, 1 indicates a strong positive correlation, and 0 indicates
    no correlation. Nitrogen (N) has a strong positive correlation with phosphorus
    (P), meaning crops that need much nitrogen also need much phosphorus. This correlation
    is 0.77, which is considered high. Nitrogen’s correlations with other elements
    and factors are weaker. For example, it has a weak positive correlation with potassium
    (K) at 0.15 and a similar trend with pH at 0.04. This analysis shows a slight
    but positive relationship between nitrogen and potassium and between nitrogen
    and pH. The major crop type has a moderate positive correlation with nitrogen
    (N) levels, with a coefficient of 0.52. This shows a medium-strength relationship
    between the crop type and the amount of N it needs. Phosphorus (P) has weaker
    positive correlations with potassium (K) and pH, with correlation coefficients
    of 0.13 and 0.01, respectively. This examination suggests a slight but positive
    relationship exists between P and K and between P and pH. The overall analysis
    shows that the amount of N a crop needs is most strongly correlated with the amount
    of P it needs. It is also correlated with the crop type but to a lesser extent.
    The correlations between N and other elements and factors are even weaker. 3.3.
    Crop Recommendation System The machine learning model applied in the proposed
    study offers the potential to learn intricate patterns and relationships between
    multiple variables, making it an effective tool for crop recommendations. This
    model has the ability to map a high-dimensional input space to outputs and adaptively
    learn from the data. The proposed study built a neural network and trained it
    on the prepared crop dataset to recommend suitable crops. 3.3.1. Data Attributes
    It is well recognized in agronomic studies that many environmental and geographical
    factors, such as humidity, temperature, rainfall, altitude, soil type, and more,
    can significantly impact crop growth, yield, and health. These factors, individually
    or in tandem, play a role in determining the suitability of a specific crop in
    a given geographical region. In the proposed study, the study has considered the
    learning model around the essential soil nutrients N (nitrogen), P (phosphorus),
    K (potassium), and soil quality represented by pH. These are foundational factors
    that majorly influence crop recommendations and are consistent indicators across
    various datasets. The major crop type serves as the output of our model. While
    it would be ideal to incorporate all influential environmental and geographical
    parameters for a holistic recommendation, the proposed study is focused primarily
    on the soil’s health, nutrients, and quality. The reasons being: Data Availability
    & Consistency: Our dataset is a compilation from various sources, with the majority
    being oriented towards N, P, K, pH, and crops. Some datasets did encompass parameters
    such as rainfall and temperature, but to maintain consistency and avoid introducing
    data biases, it was essential to have uniform features across all data points.
    Complexity in Data Collection for Other Factors: Gathering a comprehensive dataset
    that includes all geographical and climatic factors is a herculean task. It requires
    expert interventions, prolonged data curation processes, and introduces the risk
    of human errors. Interrelation with pH: The soil’s pH, which measures its acidity
    or alkalinity, can act as a proxy for some environmental factors. For instance,
    consistent rainfall can influence soil pH; likewise, soil pH can reflect certain
    climatic conditions such as humidity and temperature. By considering pH, the model
    indirectly captures some of the environmental conditions’ impacts on the soil.
    3.3.2. Model Training The machine learning model for crop recommendations was
    trained using a supervised learning approach. Initially, we preprocessed the data
    to handle any missing values, outliers, and to normalize the features. The dataset
    consists of approximately 10,440 samples, which were then split into a training
    and testing set considering a split ratio of 70:30, where 80 percent of data,
    i.e., 8352 samples, are kept for training and the remaining 20%, i.e., 2088 samples,
    are kept for testing the trained model. The study also considers a validation
    set, which is 10% of the training dataset, to ensure that the model is not overfitting
    or underperforming during its training. Therefore, training data consists of 7308
    data samples and four predictors (N, P, K, pH) and a single response variable
    named major_crop. Given the complexity and nonlinear relationships between soil
    attributes and crop types, the study employed a neural network, a subset of machine
    learning models, that are adept at capturing intricate patterns and dependencies
    in the data. The employed neural network architecture consists of three layers:
    an input layer, two hidden layers, and an output layer, as shown in Figure 7.
    Figure 7. Neural network architecture used in the proposed study. The input layer
    serves as a placeholder for input data to the model. The study experimented with
    multiple architectures, adjusting the number of hidden layers and nodes within
    each layer to optimize performance. Based on the empirical analysis, the study
    found the consideration of two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, respectively.
    The output layer contains nodes corresponding to the number of unique crop types
    in the dataset. The activation function used here is typically the SoftMax function,
    which provides a probability distribution over the potential crop types. The model
    was trained using backpropagation, a standard method for training neural networks.
    This involves iteratively adjusting the model weights to minimize the difference
    between the predicted output and the actual target values. The training process
    of the neural network is discussed in Algorithm 2. Algorithm 2 Neural Network

    ReLU derivative Update learnable parameters W and b using Adam optimizer with
    learning rate 𝛼  7. Validate the model using testing dataset End The input layer
    has ‘n’ neurons, corresponding to the number of predictors. Mathematically, this
    can be represented as 𝑋∈ ℝ 𝑛 being the input vector, where 𝑋= [𝑁,𝑃,𝐾,𝑝𝐻] 𝑇 . The
    first hidden layer has 64 neurons, such that 𝑊 1 ∈ ℝ 64𝑥𝑛 is the weight matrix
    connecting the input layer to the first hidden layer, and 𝑏 1 ∈ ℝ 64𝑥𝑛 is the
    bias vector for the first hidden layer. The weighted sum 𝑍 1 ∈ ℝ 64𝑥𝑛 of the first
    hidden layer is 𝑊 1 𝑋+ 𝑏 1 . The ReLU activation function is applied element-wise
    to the weighted sum, 𝐴 1 =𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈( 𝑍 1 ) , where 𝐴 1 ∈ ℝ 64𝑥𝑛 . The second hidden
    layer has 32 neurons, such that 𝑊 2 ∈ ℝ 32𝑥𝑛 is the weight matrix connecting the
    first hidden layer to the second hidden layer, and 𝑏 2 ∈ ℝ 32𝑥𝑛 is the bias vector
    for the second hidden layer. The weighted sum 𝑍 2 ∈ ℝ 32𝑥𝑛 of the second hidden
    layer is 𝑊 2 𝐴 1 + 𝑏 2 . The ReLU activation function is applied element-wise
    to the weighted sum 𝐴 2 =𝑅𝑒𝐿𝑈( 𝑍 2 ) , where 𝐴 2 ∈ ℝ 32 . The next output layer
    has k neurons, representing the number of unique crop classes, such that 𝑊 𝑜 ∈
    ℝ 𝑘 is the weight matrix connecting the second hidden layer to the output layer,
    and 𝑏 𝑜 ∈ ℝ 𝑘 is the bias vector for the output layer. The weighted sum 𝑍 𝑜 ∈
    ℝ 𝑘 of the output layer can be calculated, 𝑍 𝑜 = 𝑊 𝑜 𝐴 2 + 𝑏 𝑜 . Here, the softmax
    activation function is applied to the weighted sum to obtain the final output
    probabilities for each class. The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer with
    a learning rate of 0.0001. The loss function employed is the sparse categorical
    cross-entropy. The model is trained using the fit( ) method, which takes in the
    training data. The training data are split into a training subset and a validation
    subset. In this case, 20% of the training data are used for validation during
    training. The model is trained for 200 epochs. The training dataset is divided
    into batches, and in each iteration, the model updates its weights and biases
    based on the gradients calculated from a batch of size 64. The weight and bias
    updates are performed using the backpropagation algorithm and the Adam optimizer.
    The algorithm is responsible for training the neural network optimally for crop
    recommendation by learning latent attributes and complex patterns of the data
    points from the training dataset. 3.4. Fertilizer Recommendation System A fertilizer
    recommendation system is a specialized tool aimed at aiding farmers in making
    informed decisions about the suitable amounts of fertilizers to use for their
    crops. This system aims to increase agricultural productivity while minimizing
    adverse environmental impacts. Many farmers might not have a comprehensive understanding
    of their soil’s current nutrient levels. Without soil testing, it is challenging
    to know which nutrients are deficient, which are abundant, and which are at optimum
    levels. The cost of professional soil testing is prohibitive for many small-scale
    farmers, especially in developing countries. Even where affordable tests are available,
    the infrastructure to understand and act on the results might be lacking. This
    study proposes a rule-based fertilizer recommendation system to guide farmers
    on the most beneficial types and amounts of fertilizers for specific crops. The
    system’s foundation is rooted in the well-established scientific principles of
    soil chemistry and plant biology. Recognizing that different crops have varied
    nutrient requirements and that these needs are influenced by soil pH, the system
    seeks to bridge the knowledge gap by providing specific fertilizer recommendations
    based on these factors. The fertilizer recommendation system considers various
    parameters such as soil quality determined based on pH level, crop type, and specific
    nutrient requirements of each crop. By analyzing these factors, the system provides
    recommendations for the optimal amounts of N, P, and K, the primary nutrients
    needed by crops. It is to be noted that soil pH is a crucial parameter because
    it affects the solubility of nutrients, which has a high impact on plant growth.
    A pH of 7 is considered neutral, while anything below 7 is acidic and anything
    above is alkaline. The soil’s pH can influence the crop’s health, yield, and disease
    resistance. Different crops prefer different pH ranges. The study first builds
    a lookup table for determining soil qualities using their pH measure, as shown
    in Table 2. Table 2. Soil quality based on different pH value [27,29]. The proposed
    system considers the values of pH and associated quality indicator as the primary
    input source to the rule-based system, in which a set of logical conditions are
    established. The study further focuses on the building reference database consisting
    of recommended ranges of fertilizer (N, P, K) and suitable pH for different crops.
    A sample visualization of recommended fertilizers and pH for the crops under consideration
    is shown in Table 3. Table 3. Ideal nutrient levels and pH ranges for effective
    crop cultivation. Table 3 provides the data needed to build fertilizer recommendations.
    The first step is to conduct a comprehensive soil analysis. Different crop types
    have different nutrient needs, so it is essential to understand each crop’s specific
    N-P-K requirements at different growth stages. Using expert knowledge and proven
    scientific data, the system establishes rules to ensure reliable recommendations.
    The system then cross-references the user’s input with fertilizer data to determine
    if the soil pH falls within the acceptable range for the chosen crop. If the soil
    pH is within the acceptable range, the system recommends the optimal amounts of
    N, P, and K based on the nutrient needs specified in the fertilizer table. If
    the soil pH is not within the acceptable range, the system advises the user to
    adjust the soil pH and suggests potential soil amendments. The system also offers
    alternative crops that could thrive in the existing soil pH range, along with
    the N, P, and K fertilizer recommendations for those crops. This approach allows
    the system to make precise and comprehensive fertilizer recommendations without
    requiring the explicit training of a predictive model on a dataset. The rationale
    behind this method is the universal nature of the recommended nutrient values
    for each crop type, thus providing a straightforward measure of the required fertilizer
    based on the difference between the current and recommended N, P, and K values.
    The utility of this rule-based approach lies in its ability to provide transparency
    and personalized fertilizer recommendations. The proposed system can also reduce
    farmers’ costs by precluding the overuse or underuse of fertilizers. An additional
    environmental advantage of this system is its potential to minimize the detrimental
    impact of excessive fertilizer usage, such as water pollution caused by fertilizer
    runoff. Finally, the system equips farmers with the information needed to make
    informed decisions about crop rotation based on soil’s pH suitability for various
    crops. The system starts by receiving user inputs on the crop type and the soil’s
    pH value. It then cross-references this with a precompiled fertilizer table containing
    the ideal pH ranges and nutrient (N, P, K) requirements for various crops. Depending
    on the pH level input, the system first classifies the soil into categories ranging
    from “Strongly acidic” to “Very strongly alkaline”. It then checks if the input
    pH falls within the appropriate range for the chosen crop. If the pH level is
    suitable, the system provides fertilizer recommendations specific to the crop,
    considering the nutrient needs from the fertilizer table. The recommendations
    regarding the required amounts of N, P, and K are given. If the soil pH is not
    right for the chosen crop, the system will tell you how to adjust it to the correct
    range. It will also suggest ways to improve the pH using soil amendments. In addition,
    the system will list alternative crops that could grow well in the current soil
    pH range. It will also provide N, P, and K fertilizer recommendations for each
    of these crops. 4. Result and Discussion The development of the proposed recommendation
    models is carried out using python programming language in Anaconda distribution
    installed on windows 10 machine.This section presents the performance analysis
    of the proposed predictive model for crop recommendation. The accuracy of the
    predictions was assessed using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall,
    F1-score, and the ROC curve. These metrics provide a comprehensive view of the
    model’s performance, ensuring that the recommendations it provides are both precise
    and reliable. The performance metric accuracy is the proportion of the total number
    of predictions that were correct. It is given as follows: 𝐴𝑐𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑦= 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁 𝑇𝑃+𝑇𝑁+𝐹𝑃+𝐹𝑁
    (2) where TP denotes True Positives, TN is the True Negative, FP is False Positives,
    and FN refers to False Negatives. Precision is the proportion of positive identifications
    that were actually correct. It is computed as follows: 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑃 . (3)
    Recall (or Sensitivity) is the ability of a model to find all the relevant cases
    within a dataset. The recall is given by: 𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙= 𝑇𝑃 𝑇𝑃+𝐹𝑁 . (4) F1 Score is the
    harmonic mean of precision and recall, aiming to find a balance between both.
    The formula for computing F1 Score is given as follows: 𝐹1𝑆𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑒=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 (5) 4.1. Training Performance Analysis The training phase of
    a machine learning model is crucial because it determines how well the model learns
    the patterns in the training data. The training accuracy is a measure of how well
    the model can predict the labels of the training data. If a model has poor training
    accuracy, it indicates that there may be problems with the dataset, the model
    architecture, or the hyperparameters. Training accuracy is also an important metric
    for ensuring that the model generalizes well, meaning that it can make accurate
    predictions on new data that it has not seen before. This is because a model with
    high training accuracy following high validation accuracy has learned the underlying
    patterns in the data, not just the specific examples in the training set. Figure
    8 shows the training performance of a neural network over 200 epochs. Figure 8.
    Training and validation curve. From Figure 8, the training accuracy reaches up
    to 99%, indicating that the model has learned the underlying patterns in the training
    data very well. However, it is worth noting that a training accuracy of 100% is
    not always desirable, as it can lead to overfitting, where the model becomes too
    specific to the training data and performs poorly on unseen data. Therefore, the
    study considers validation of the model during the training processes. It can
    be seen that the validation accuracy reaches up to 95%, which is slightly lower
    than the training accuracy. This can be due to the fact that the model may have
    overfit to the training data or that the validation set may have some variability
    that the model could not capture. However, a validation accuracy of 95% is still
    a good level of accuracy, indicating that the model can generalize well to new,
    unseen data. Overall, the high training and validation accuracy suggest that the
    model is a good fit for the data and has the potential to make accurate predictions.
    4.2. Model Performance on Test Data This section evaluates the performance of
    the model on the test dataset for crop recommendations. The metrics considered
    for this analysis are precision, recall, and F1-score across different crop classes
    and overall accuracy, as shown in Table 4. The support column indicates the sample
    size for each class, offering context to the reported statistical outcomes. Table
    4. Performance analysis of the proposed model. As shown in Table 4, for class
    0, the model correctly predicted this class with 100% precision, meaning that
    every time the model predicted class 0, it was correct. The re-call of 80% indicates
    that the model was able to identify 80% of the actual instances of class 0 in
    the data. The F1-score, which is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, is
    0.89. There were 25 instances of class 0 in the test set. Additionally, the model
    performed very well on Class 1, with a precision and recall of 1.00 and 0.98,
    respectively. This means that the model correctly identified 98% of the Class
    1 instances, and none of the predictions were false positives. The F1-score of
    0.99 for Class 1 indicates a strong balance between precision and recall. The
    model’s performance on Class 2 was slightly lower, with a precision of 0.90 and
    recall of 0.95. This means that the model correctly identified 95% of the Class
    2 instances, but there were some false positives. The F1-score of 0.93 for Class
    2 still indicates a good balance between precision and recall. The model performed
    perfectly on Classes 3, 4, and 6, achieving a precision, recall, and F1-score
    of 1.00 for all three classes. However, it is important to note that these classes
    were very underrepresented in the dataset, with only 20 instances for Class 3,
    4 instances for Class 4, and 1 instance for Class 6. This means that the model’s
    perfect performance on these classes may be due to their simpler nature or distinctive
    features, which made them easier to distinguish. Class 5 was also well-represented
    in the dataset, with 557 instances. The model performed very well on this class,
    with a precision and recall of 0.99. This means that the model correctly identified
    99% of Class 5 instances and made very few false positives. Class 7 was the only
    class where the model’s performance was not as good. The model had a precision
    of 0.84 and recall of 0.74, meaning that it correctly identified 74% of Class
    7 instances and made 16% false positives. The F1-score of 0.78 indicates that
    there was a moderate balance between precision and recall for this class. Class
    8 was the largest class in the dataset, with 543 instances. The model performed
    very well on this class, with a precision, recall, and F1-score of 0.99. This
    means that the model correctly identified 99% of Class 8 instances and made very
    few false positives. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) score is a widely
    used metric to evaluate the performance of classification models.Based on the
    outcome statistics shown in Figure 9, the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
    score, which measures a trade-off be-tween the True Positive Rate (sensitivity)
    and False Positive Rate (specificity). The ROC score ranges from 0 to 1, where
    a score of 1 denotes a perfect classifier, and a score of 0.5 indicates a model
    that is no better than random chance. Figure 9. Analysis of ROC curve; (a) ROC
    plot; (b) Magnified view of overlapping ROC regions. The study also considers
    a comparison of the performance of the proposed neural network model with other
    different supervised classifiers as crucial in determining its suitability for
    specific tasks. A comparative analysis was conducted in Figure 10 to assess the
    proficiency of the proposed neural network and three other different models, namely,
    SVM (Support Vector Machines), Decision Tree, and XGBoost. The evaluation considered
    three vital metrics—weight precision, recall, and F1-Score—to gauge the performance
    nuances of each model. Based on the outcome analysis, the proposed neural network
    model outperformed all other models, including SVM, Decision Tree, and XGBoost,
    in a comparative evaluation. The neural network achieved a precision of 99.18%,
    while XGBoost came in second with a precision of 97.36%. The Decision Tree performed
    similarly to XGBoost, with a precision of 97.36%. SVM performed the worst, with
    a precision of 93.93%. This analysis shows that the neural network model is exceptionally
    capable of accurately identifying correct classifications. The proposed neural
    network model has a high recall of 98.66%, which means that it can accurately
    identify a large portion of the actual positive examples in the dataset. XGBoost
    is also effective, but its recall is slightly lower at 97.03%. Figure 10. Comparative
    analysis with different predictive models. The F1-score, which measures the balance
    between precision and recall, is even higher for the neural network model at 98.98%.
    XGBoost is a close second with 97.17%, followed by the Decision Tree with 96.87%.
    Based on the comprehensive evaluation, the proposed neural network model distinctly
    outperforms the other models. Its consistently high scores across all metrics
    not only underline its accuracy in predictions but also its capacity to maintain
    a balance between precision and recall. 4.3. Real-World Testing This section discusses
    how we deployed and tested our crop recommendation system in real time and the
    results we obtained when using it with live data. The most important part of evaluating
    our system is the data it uses. For this study, we collected data from a set of
    IoT sensors (Five-pin soil transmitter (Type485) sensors, Shandong Renke Control
    Technology Co. Ltd., Jinan City, Shandong Province, China), that we strategically
    deployed across agricultural fields, as shown in Figure 11. The solar panels capture
    sunlight, convert it to electricity, and then tranfer that electricity to a battery.
    The battery powers a printed circuit board (PCB), which provides electrical connection
    and mechanical support to the electrical components of a circuit (sensor, GSM,
    microcontroller). The transmitter steel needle (sensor) was inserted horizontally
    into the soil in a pit that was dug with a diameter of >20 cm vertically to detect
    soil properties, which are transmitted to the cloud using GSM sim 900,and a microcontroller
    was integrated into a system to manage the device function. Figure 11. Visual
    depiction of IoT sensor setup; (a) sensors, battery and solar; (b) sensor assembled;
    (c) sensor deployed in cropland. Figure 11a shows a visual representation of the
    IoT soil sensor, battery, and solar as a power source. Figure 11b shows sensors
    were meticulously positioned within croplands, silently working to gather valuable
    agronomic data. Figure 11c showcases an IoT sensor, equipped with solar panels,
    ready for data collection. The IoT sensors measure N, P, and K in parts per million
    (ppm), which is a common unit used in soil testing. In this case, ppm represents
    absolute concentrations, not percentages. Therefore, the study converted the raw
    data from the IoT sensors from ppm to kg/ha before feeding it to the trained model
    for the proposed crop recommendation system. The conversion between the two depends
    on the depth of soil sampled and its bulk density. To convert from ppm to kg/ha,
    the study followed the standard convention that 1 ppm is equivalent to 1 mg/kg.
    So, if we had a reading of 50 ppm N, that means there are 50 mg of nitrogen per
    kg of soil. Hence, in a hectare, we have 50 mg/kg × 2,600,000 kg = 130,000,000
    mg of nitrogen, which is 130 kg of nitrogen. The study converted all of the data
    collected by the IoT sensor node in real time from ppm to kg/ha in this manner.
    The transformed data were then fed to the trained model for the proposed crop
    recommendation system. The results of the study were promising, justifying the
    scope of the proposed work. This suggests that the proposed crop recommendation
    system can be used to accurately recommend crops for farmers based on the real-time
    data collected from IoT sensors. 4.4. Scope and Limitations The proposed crop
    recommendation and rule-based fertilizer system holds immense promise, with a
    wide scope and diverse applicability. By soil data attributes and machine learning
    algorithms, it considers N, P, K, and soil quality pH, which are crucial for crop
    growth based on soil conditions. A balanced pH ensures optimal nutrient uptake,
    promoting healthy crop growth. By ensuring that these core parameters are in their
    ideal ranges, a significant portion of crop health following fertilizer recommendation
    yield optimization is addressed. By factoring in these vital soil attributes,
    the system ensures a tailored approach to crop cultivation, rooted in the specific
    conditions and needs of the soil. By focusing on these four key parameters, the
    study reduces the complexities often associated with integrating multiple environmental
    factors. While environmental factors such as rainfall and temperature can vary
    significantly across regions and seasons, the importance of N, P, K, and pH remains
    consistent for crop growth globally. This gives the proposed system a universal
    applicability, making it relevant across diverse geographical areas. However,
    despite the advantages of proposed system, it has limitations too when considering
    the implementation at a large scale in the agriculture sector. The potential challenges
    and limitations are highlighted as follows. Data Generalization: The system is
    based on specific soil properties, such as N, P, K, and pH. However, when scaled
    up, these properties can vary widely across different regions, which could limit
    the accuracy of the recommendations. Additionally, it is difficult to create a
    comprehensive dataset that includes all possible soil, crop, environmental, and
    geographic conditions. Inaccuracies can also arise from inconsistent or incomplete
    data. Exclusion of Environmental Factors: The model does not consider factors
    such as rainfall, humidity, and temperature. While N, P, K, and pH are important,
    the absence of these environmental variables may not provide a complete view of
    what is needed for all regions. Infrastructure Challenges: Large-scale implementation
    may require extensive infrastructure, including IoT sensors, data transmission
    systems, and more. Maintenance and Updation: The model will need to be updated
    regularly as soil conditions, crop varieties, and farming practices change. This
    will be challenging on a large scale. Economic Implications: While the system
    might reduce some costs, the initial setup, training, and maintenance can be economically
    taxing for small-scale farmers or in regions with limited funding. Rule-Based
    Fertilization Challenges: For rule-based fertilization recommendation models,
    the fixed set of rules might not adapt quickly to changing conditions. It can
    also become complex to update the rules for too many crops. If there are too many
    rules, it can potentially lead to contradictions. 4.5. Use Case Scenario and Conceptual
    Architecture of IoT Farm Figure 12 shows sensors that are deployed in cropland
    to monitor and collect detailed data on soil nutrient levels (nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium), as well as other important parameters. The IoT gateway connects
    the sensors to the cloud and securely and quickly transfers the data to a cloud
    database. This robust and scalable storage solution archives the collected data.
    Being cloud-based, it ensures that the data are accessible, redundant, and secure.
    The proposed system is deployed over the cloud and leverages the power of machine
    learning to analyze the real-time data using predictive algorithms to generate
    two key outputs: crop recommendations and fertilizer recommendations. The user
    can access both the real-time monitoring data and the generated recommendations
    through a tailored interface, enabling informed decision-making. Therefore, the
    proposed system’s conceptual architecture showcases an end-to-end solution, from
    data collection in croplands to actionable insights delivered to the user. This
    synergy ensures that farmers are equipped with the best tools and information
    to drive productivity and sustainability in their work. Figure 12. A schematic
    illustration of an IoT-assisted agriculture farm. 5. Conclusions This study has
    introduced a novel crop and fertilizer recommendation system (CFRS) that is personalized
    specifically for Rwanda’s agricultural landscape. The system uses machine learning
    and data analysis to give farmers insights that can help them make informed decisions
    about crop selection and fertilizer use. In rigorous comparative analyses, the
    neural network outperformed other popular machine learning models, demonstrating
    its precision, balance, and proficiency. The system has the potential to improve
    crop yield and quality, while also promoting cost-effective agricultural practices
    and reducing environmental impact. However, the system is not without its limitations.
    It needs to consider more environmental and geographical factors, and the data
    modeling and feature extraction process needs to be refined and expanded. Future
    work will focus on incorporating additional environmental and geographical factors,
    such as rainfall, temperature, humidity, and altitude, into the system. The study
    will also adopt more sophisticated deep learning algorithms and collaborate with
    environmental scientists, agronomists, and technologists to develop a more comprehensive,
    adaptive, and impactful system. Author Contributions Methodology, C.M. and A.V.;

    of an efficient recommendation model for fruit cultivation in soil medium by analyzing
    the soil nutrient contents and the existing climatic conditions. The most suitable
    fruit plant corresponding to the existing conditions and soil type is recommended
    for an enhanced yield of the plant. Three climatic parameters, i.e., temperature,
    humidity, and rainfall; along with four soil-based parameters, i.e., pH, N content,
    P content, and K content are considered as the required growing condition for
    eleven varieties of fruits. To ensure enhanced accuracy, a hundred entries for
    each fruit type is entered in the dataset. The created dataset is then divided
    in the proportion of 7:3 as training data: testing data and Light Gradient Boosting
    Machine (Light GBM) model is applied to the created dataset. The correlation of

    2022 Recommendation System for Improvement in Post Harvesting of Horticulture
    Crops Chapter © 2018 Farmright – A Crop Recommendation System Chapter © 2022 1
    Introduction Agriculture is one of the leading application areas of urban life
    which is undergoing advances at an exponential pace. Most of the losses in agriculture
    occur due to incorrect crop selection on the available soil. Thus, the use of
    agriculture sensors, the IoT, machine learning, and deep learning in the advancement
    of smart farming and precision agriculture is gaining much importance [1,2,3].
    Owing to the enormous capability of machine learning to learn and analyze the
    features of the soil in cultivatable land, numerous applications can be witnessed
    in several dimensions [4, 5]. Identification of the most suitable crop on the
    available land, by taking into consideration the various nutrient contents of
    the soil and the environmental conditions prevalent, is a persistent challenge,
    which when addressed, would prove to be one of the most beneficial ways to enhance
    crop production [7]. This fact has led to an extensive background study on the
    existing recommendation systems and an urge to work further in this direction
    to serve a greater purpose [8]. The pomological industry contributes to a major
    portion of the economy, earned from overseas business of any nation. The proposed
    model ensures maximum fruit growth by analyzing and recommending the most suitable
    fruit that can be cultivated in the existing soil type. This in turn, leads to
    better and enhanced fruit yield. The fruit export of any nation is directly affected
    by the improved fruit yield, this way the proposed model contributes to improving
    the profitability of the pomology industry and boosting national economies. The
    biggest challenge faced in cultivating fruits using vertical farming methods is
    the size of the fully grown fruit trees. Fruit trees are mostly woody, i.e., they
    have woody stem and are big trees that essentially need soil as the cultivation
    medium for it to bear fruits properly, and perennial in nature, i.e., these trees
    take more than two years to grow fully and bear fruits. Vertical farming methods
    are soilless cultivation methods where a substitute substrate is used instead
    of soil and the nutrients are provided using nutrient infused water. The grow
    tubes or trays are generally placed one above the other to ensure maximum possible
    yield in limited space. Due to these factors, herbaceous plants are the ones that
    can be grown in the best way using vertical farming methods and very few fruits
    grow in vertical farming method. Precision agriculture can be implemented in the
    field of pomology by making the field smart. Sensor equipped fields can monitor
    the real time ongoings in the field and the nutrition, moisture, etc. can be precisely
    made available to the plants according to the situation. The different types of
    learning methods for machine learning are supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
    learning. Any machine-learning model uses two phases of the process of extracting
    knowledge using machine-learning training and testing [9]. The training process
    is the process of training the model by considering the hypothesis function whereas
    the testing process is the process following the training process wherein the
    model is tested on the rest of the dataset and the accuracy is calculated. Along
    with all these, various classification techniques are available for use in machine
    learning [10,11,12]. Many researchers have worked on this issue and provided many
    solutions to help farmers in this regard, but the novelty of this research lies
    in the fact that an ensemble technique is used in machine learning to provide
    a more accurate result of the fruit recommendation system [13]. The authors, in
    this research work, have focused majorly on fruits. A dataset is created that
    consists of various parameters on which the nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium,
    temperature, humidity, rainfall, and pH requirements of various fruits have been
    collected. A hundred entries have been created in the dataset against each fruit.
    The traditional method of cultivation practices the modification of soil nutrient
    contents according to the requirements of the crop. The authors in this work have
    taken the reverse approach to enhance the cultivation output. The analysis of
    soil health in terms of nutrient contents, pH level, temperature, rainfall, and
    humidity are done to recommend the crop would thrive the most in the available
    soil and weather conditions. This type of autonomous recommendation system for
    fruits helps in getting yield more than the estimated yield [14]. The best and
    the most systematic approach to solving any type of real-time problem is machine
    learning. It is one of the most effective methods that utilizes historically recorded
    data to extract veiled information through functions to address the queries that
    may arise in the future [15]. The fact that nearly the entire agricultural land
    suitable for agricultural production is under cultivation, leads to an increasing
    need to meet the demands of food and fodder by increasing the yield of the cultivated
    produce per unit area of the crop. Pomology or fruticulture is one of the most
    emerging categories of agriculture that benefits the economy of many nations around
    the world. The authors of [16] state that, the better the cultivation of fruits,
    the stronger the economic benefits of the nation will be. Various drawbacks and
    uncertainties of cultivation in soil have led to the concept of vertical farming.
    Smart agriculture not only inculcates smart monitoring and controlling plant growth
    in various controlled environment agricultural setups using IoTs but also analysis
    of soil properties to decide and determine the best-suited crop for the type of
    soil available [17,18,19]. The aspect of smart agriculture in fruit cultivation
    in substrate medium holds great significance to the practitioners of traditional
    pomologists. This enhances the ease of proficient as well as amateur pomologists
    to come up with a more profitable yield in all aspects. The information offered
    by the current advances in smart fruticulture can be turned into profitable decisions
    by smartly analyzing the soil properties and its nutrient content along with the
    existing climatic conditions and thereby deciding the fruit to be cultivated [20].
    The required technical awareness, the hardware components, cloud computing, internet
    connectivity, and most importantly the multiplied energy consumption in vertical
    farming methods render it difficult for a traditional farmer to shift towards
    vertical farming methods [21]. Significant development has been noticed in the
    use of machine learning in various industries and research areas. Thus, the development
    of a machine learning system, for the betterment of the fruticulture sector, is
    the need of the hour [22, 23]. The gaps identified from the existing literature
    can be enlisted as: the identification of best suited nutrient-enriched soil,
    and climatic condition for a particular fruit tree, identification of the best
    machine learning algorithm for fruit recommendation process and the key parameters
    affecting the recommendation process, analyzing the advantages of Light GBM over
    other algorithms, knowing the combination of soil nutritional and climatic requirements
    for each fruit, and knowledge about the flexibility, scalability, and dynamic
    nature of the recommendation model used. These gaps are addressed in the due course
    of this research article. To formulate some research questions to be analyzed
    and answered after the process of the research work, the identified research questions
    are as stated: RQ1 Which nutrient-enriched soil is best suited for a particular
    fruit? RQ2 Which climatic condition is best suited for a particular fruit? RQ3
    Which machine learning algorithm is the best for fruit recommendation? RQ4 What
    are the advantages of a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (Light GBM) based over
    other tree-based algorithms? RQ5 What are the key parameters affecting the efficient
    recommendation for fruticulture? RQ6 What are the combinations of nutrient and
    climatic requirements for each fruit? RQ7 Analyze the flexibility, scalability,
    and dynamic nature of the proposed recommendation system. The authors of this
    research work have created a database for various fruits. The database consists
    of various fields like Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), temperature,
    humidity, pH, rainfall, and the corresponding crop. 100 entries have been taken
    for each of the crops in the database. The crops in the fruits considered are
    raspberry, papaya, orange, apple, muskmelon, watermelon, grapes, mango, banana,
    and pomegranate. The fruit nutrient requirements and their respective growing
    conditions are obtained from Kaggle database. The nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    contents of soil is determined using soil NPK sensor. The other factors like temperature,
    and humidity are checked using temperature sensor, pH is checked using pH meter,
    and rainfall is checked manually. These sensor values are sent to the cloud for
    analysis and the recommendations are made accordingly. Soil fertility can highly
    be assessed through a systematic assessment using this device by determining its
    fertility. This is a robust, high quality, rust and corrosion resistant sensor
    that can be buried in the soil for a prolonged period. The sensor also has a high
    accuracy, very low power consumption and lowest latency which makes it even more
    reliable. A system for checking and analyzing the soil type and its nutrient contents
    has been proposed in this research work. A fruit recommender system then checks
    the soil for its type and nutrient contents and subsequently recommends the best
    fruit that can be grown in that soil in the prevalent climatic conditions. This
    will prove to be a great help in minimizing fruit waste and providing the maximum
    possible quality yield of fruit using substrate cultivation methods. The end user
    will have to additionally summarize, analyze, and then identify the recommended
    fruit that is suggested by the recommendation system and act accordingly. Light
    GBM is different from the other tree-based algorithms in the way it propagates.
    Light GBM grows the tree vertically or leaf-wise, whereas the other ones propagate
    level-wise or horizontally. The leaf with the maximum delta loss is considered
    for propagation and of this characteristic, the leaf-wise propagating algorithm
    can reduce loss better than the other ones. The other advantages that Light GBM
    has over the other tree-based algorithms are: Higher efficiency – Light GBM is
    found to perform with higher efficiency than the other tree-based algorithms,
    like XGBoost. Faster training speed – The training speed of the ML model is one
    of the major aspects determining the efficiency and selecting factor for any ML
    algorithm. Light GBM has a very fast training speed as compared to other ML algorithms
    which makes it better and more efficient than the other ML models. Better accuracy–Light
    GBM is found to be more accurate than other existing ML models. Lesser memory
    consumption–Optimized consumption of memory is another deciding factor for the
    selection of Light GBM over other ML models. Scalable–The Light GBM is scalable
    to a greater extent than other ML models. Figure 1 is a depiction of the process
    of the proposed recommendation system. In the entire process of the pomological
    recommendation system, the initial phase is of collecting the parameters to form
    the dataset. The parameters include pH, nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P), potassium
    (K), and the average rainfall, temperature, and humidity requirements of each
    fruit. After the collection of data is done, the dataset is created accordingly.
    The next phase is to analyze the prevalent N, P, K, and pH contents of soil, the
    temperature, humidity, and the average rainfall conditions, and subsequently recommend
    the most suitable fruit that can be grown in the given soil and environmental
    conditions. Fig. 1 Proposed pomological recommendation system using Light GBM
    Full size image The major contributions of this work are enlisted as (1) creating
    a model for a recommendation of suitable fruit trees for a given soil type and
    environmental condition. (2) creating a dataset of 11 varieties of fruits with
    100 entries for each fruit against 7 parameters. (3) applying the model to the
    created dataset. (4) split the dataset into training and testing sets in the ratio
    of 7:3. (5) evaluate the model and check for the efficiency of the model. The
    authors implement the generated dataset, particularly on fruits, on the proposed
    Light GBM-based fruit recommendation system. This model takes into consideration
    the suitable soil nutrient contents and the environmental requirements of the
    crop from the dataset fed to it. For a particular soil type and the prevalent
    environmental conditions, the model helps the farmers to identify the best-suited
    fruit that can be grown in the available soil nutrient content and environmental
    conditions. Apart from analyzing the correlation and confusion matrices, the performance
    of the model is also tested using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. This
    research work is organized as follows: Section I covers the introduction to the
    importance of the research domain; Section II encloses the background study of
    the research. Materials and methods are covered in section III, where dataset
    collection and the method used are discussed in detail. The obtained results are
    discussed in section IV and finally, the conclusion and future scope of the work
    is discussed in section V. 2 Background study The authors in [24,25,26] have created
    a neural network in this work wherein static soil information is handled by fully
    connected layers whereas the dynamic information is taken care of by continual
    LSTM layers. The training was done with historical information on the explicit
    design for many soil properties, maximum and minimum temperatures, and precipitation
    against the country level of historical yield labels. The model was tested in
    an exceedingly different set of information and produced comparable results to
    create the use of detailed remote sensing data. The potential information of the
    mining technique used in crop yield production supported the input environmental
    condition parameters. The authors of [27] have hybridized Q-learning with deep
    learning. This way the raw data is mapped exactly with the prediction values.
    A dataset was created by the authors of [28] which consists of images of highly
    consumed and exported Indian fruits. A user-friendly web page is developed in
    [29, 30] which helps in attaining more than 75% accuracy of prediction square
    measures. The work done by the authors of [31] introduces a computationally economical
    and efficient crop recommendation system using a naïve mathematical model. The
    scalability of the system can be proved by the fact that it takes very less time
    to implement on different crops. Time of sowing, plant growth, etc., may be known
    easily from the yield graphs. The best and worst conditions can be known conjointly,
    and smaller farms may also be benefitted from this. In the research work [32],
    the authors deal in data classification for optimized crop recommendation wherein
    the analysis potentialities for the classification of soil are done using various
    algorithms in the data processing. Kasur district in Pakistan is the place to
    carry out the experiment, where the comparative analysis of the algorithms is
    ascertained for various levels of accuracy to determine the effectiveness and
    potency of predictions [33]. A higher understanding of soil categories helps in
    improving productive farming and reduces the dependency on fertilizers. The authors
    of [34,35,36] have used two supervised classification ML formulae, i.e., ID3 and
    KNNR, which help in unveiling the patterns within the knowledge set which consists
    of the average temperature and precipitation of six crops in 10 cities of Bangladesh
    over 12 years, to provide the prediction. An ensemble model to help the farmers
    is proposed by the authors of [6], which uses ANN, Random Forest, SVM, and KNN.
    The authors of [37,38,39] have incorporated a derivation of datasets of soil precipitation
    and properties derived by satellites and data derived from models containing climate
    prediction. Maize and soybeans cultivated in Brazil and USA are the crops taken
    into consideration without using data from the Normalized Different Vegetation
    Index. Crops are considered in [40, 41] and the prediction is done by studying
    a fixed dataset using Supervised ML methods. The authors of [42, 43] use big data
    for the storage, processing, and analysis of data with accuracy, thus being used
    in substrate cultivation and benefiting farmers and thereby enhancing the economic
    growth of the country. The study in [44, 45] entrails an analysis based on the
    case, providing the users with empirical evidence on various data mining algorithms
    to fragment the dataset of agricultural regions based on soil properties. Light
    GBM—a model of decision trees used to classify and apply regression [24, 46,47,48].
    The utility is demonstrated in breeding assisted by selection with a huge dataset
    of maize crops [48,49,50]. The authors of [51] use color slicing and grey level
    occurrence matrix to process and extract features of paddy leaves. Random forest,
    KNN, etc. are used and the RF classifier performed the best way. In [52] the authors
    evaluate the necessary elements for crop recommendation. LGBM showed the best
    performance in terms of several benchmarks. The gaps identified from the extensive
    background study are in terms of fruit cultivation or pomology [53]. No specific
    or dedicated work is seen to be done concerning fruits, although fruit cultivation
    helps in the growth of the economy of any nation. Fruits are mainly cultivated
    in substrate medium, and thus, recommending suitable fruits for a particular type
    of soil in a specific weather condition is more convenient than creating suitable
    conditions for the cultivation of a particular fruit. This work is thus aimed
    at recommending fruits [54] that can thrive in available soil conditions and the
    prevailing weather conditions at a specific point in time. 3 Materials and methods
    The materials needed for this experiment are a complete, reasonably large dataset
    wherein the various entries are made for various fruits concerning their N, P,
    K, and pH values concerning the requirements from the soil, and temperature, humidity,
    and rainfall values for climatic conditions. This dataset is created by studying
    the fruit growth requirements and recording them for matching with the existing
    nutrient content of the soil and the existing climatic conditions. As the climatic
    conditions and soil nutrient content are not possible to change, this recommendation
    system will help the pomologists to cultivate the fruit that will produce the
    fruits that can give the best yield. The method used is a machine learning algorithm
    named Light GBM [55], which takes the CSV dataset with all numeric data values
    as the input and recommends the fruit giving the best growth estimation in the
    existing soil and climatic conditions. 3.1 Dataset collection The authors have
    considered 11 fruits in the dataset namely: raspberry, pomegranate, banana, mango,
    grapes, watermelon, muskmelon, apple, orange, papaya, and coconut. The corresponding
    values for N, P, and K requirements of all the fruits, along with the temperature,
    humidity, rainfall, and pH values are entered into the dataset. A hundred entries
    have been considered for each fruit. The dataset is obtained from the Kaggle source.
    Therefore, in an answer to RQ. 5, it can be stated that the N, P, and K requirements
    of each fruit, along with the corresponding temperature, humidity, rainfall, and
    pH values are the key parameters affecting the efficient recommendation for fruticulture.
    A total of 7 data fields are included in the dataset corresponding to each of
    the 11 fruits considered. The data fields with the various parameters represent
    the ratio of Nitrogen content in the soil in kg/ha, P represents the ratio of
    Phosphorous content in the soil in kg/ha, K represents the ratio of Potassium
    content in the soil in kg/ha, temperature represents the temperature in degree
    Celsius, humidity represents the relative humidity in %, pH represents the pH
    value of the soil, and rainfall represents rainfall in mm. Thus, the dataset was
    collected by studying and analyzing the nutrient requirements of 11 fruit trees.
    A hundred entries are made corresponding to each fruit with an intention of having
    a detailed analysis of the fruit trees. Studies regarding fruit trees and their
    nutritional requirements helped in creating this dataset. 3.2 Methodology Light
    GBM is a framework that uses a gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based
    learning algorithms like decision tree algorithms. This helps in increasing the
    efficiency of the model and reduces memory usage. Two novel techniques that are
    used in Light GBM are Gradient-based One Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature
    Bundling (EFB), which compensates for the limitations of the histogram-based algorithm
    used by Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) frameworks [56]. The Light GBM
    algorithm can be characterized by the techniques of GOSS and EFB. These two together
    enhance the efficiency of the model. It is a proven fact that the smaller the
    instant gradients, smaller is the error and better is the training. Gradient-Based
    One Side Sampling (GOSS) is a novel method of dataset sampling in Light GBM, that
    uses gradients to down sample the instances. It also selects a subset of the data
    to be used while training a Light GBM. GOSS calculates the gain along with highly
    weighing the data points with larger gradients. Those instances contribute more
    to this method whose instances are not used for training. GOSS initially sorts
    the training data by the loss function gradients according to the current model,
    then selects a subset of the data on the basis of the gradients’ magnitudes. Exclusive
    Feature Bundling (EFB) combines sparse or mutually exclusive features to carry
    out feature elimination indirectly and engineering without affecting learners’
    performances. To ensure that non-zero values of all constituent features are never
    considered simultaneously, an offset value is used that is capable of creating
    a set of features by allowing exclusive features to stay in different bins. The
    associations and correlation among the dataset values prove to be an added advantage
    offered to the users as a pattern or a reference for future use. This information
    provided by the recommendation system will also facilitate pomologists to cultivate
    suggested fruit by predicting probabilities of yield. Further, in response to
    RQ. 4, the added advantages of Light GBM over the other tree-based algorithms
    can be mentioned above. The formulae to calculate different performance metrics
    used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model are as follows: $$\\mathrm{Precision}=\\frac{TP}{TP+FP}=
    \\frac{\\mathrm{no}.\\,\\mathrm{ of \\,correctly \\,predicted \\,positive \\,instances}}{\\mathrm{no}.\\,\\mathrm{
    of \\,total \\,positive \\,predictions \\,made}}$$ (1) Precision is the analysis
    of the true positives over the number of total positives that are predicted by
    the machine learning model. The formula for precision is as written in Eq. 1.
    This helps in calculating the rate of positive predictions being positive. $$\\mathrm{Recall\\,
    or\\, Sensitivity}=\\frac{TP}{TP+FN}= \\frac{\\mathrm{no}.\\,\\mathrm{ of\\, correctly
    \\,predicted \\,positive \\,cases}}{\\mathrm{no}.\\,\\mathrm{ of\\, total \\,positive
    \\,cases \\,in \\,the \\,dataset}}$$ (2) Sensitivity or recall is the analysis
    of the TP over the number of actual positive results. The formula to obtain recall
    is shown in Eq. 2. It is used to assess how well the model analyzes the input
    and identifies the actual outcome. $$\\mathrm{F}1 =2*\\frac{precision*recall}{precision+recall}$$
    (3) F1 may also be termed the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It analyzes
    both false positives and false negatives along with performing well on an imbalanced
    dataset. The formula to calculate F1 is shown in Eq. 3. $$\\mathrm{Accuracy} =\\frac{TP+TN}{TP+FP+FN+TN}$$
    (4) The developed recommendation system introduces a model to predict the fruit
    yield using dependencies of soil features, climatic conditions, and the requirement
    of the fruits under consideration. Although there are several existing techniques
    to obtain farming recommendations, the model used in this research enhances the
    crop type and yield by considering the most relevant crop requirements that match
    the available soil parameters. Therefore, in response to RQ. 3, it can be stated
    that Light GBM is the best-suited machine learning algorithm for a recommendation
    of fruits on a particular soil type available and in a particular environmental
    condition. The outcome of this research model can further benefit the agriculturists
    or the end users by helping them decide upon the investment capital and the probable
    benefit, well before the beginning of the sowing process. The scope of predictive
    financial investment and gain analysis can further be expanded to various financial
    institutions to allocate funds or fiscal loans to farmers. Among the other advantages,
    the system is scalable to a large extent. It can be used to recommend a wide variety
    of crops on the given soil. The workflow of the proposed fruit recommender system
    is depicted in Fig. 2. The foremost task is to generate a dataset wherein the
    authors have considered 11 types of fruits. 100 entries of each fruit have been
    considered which have been classified into 7 different parameters. Fig. 2 Workflow
    of the proposed fruit recommendation system Full size image The dataset is further
    analyzed by the recommendation model. Subsequently, the entire process of the
    work can be divided into four segments: 1. Modules, datasets, and datatypes of
    input variables: there are six modules or parameters under which data values for
    each fruit are considered, namely: N, P, K, temperature, humidity, rainfall, and
    pH. The input dataset is a CSV file that contains all the values in the numeric
    type of data. 2. Data preprocessing and cleaning: this involves cleaning the data
    set and removing the outliers to normalize the sample. 3. Technique: Light GBM
    is used as the technique to implement the fruit recommendation system. 4. Split
    dataset into training and test sets: 70% of the dataset is used to train the model
    and 30% of the dataset is used for its testing. 5. Evaluate model performances:
    precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy are the metrics for evaluation of the
    performance of the model. 6. Results: The result shows us which fruit is the most
    suitable for a combination of which type of soil and the existing climatic conditions.
    The recommender system recommends the best-suited fruit to be cultivated in the
    available conditions. 4 Results and discussions This section deals with the analyses
    of the obtained results of this experiment. Initially, the nitrogen, phosphorous,
    and potassium content requirement for each fruit is analyzed for each fruit separately.
    Then the combination of proportions of N, P, and K requirements for each fruit
    is calculated and depicted as a pie chart for easier understanding. A scatter
    plot to show exactly how much each fruit’s requirements are close to each other
    is plotted and the temperature, humidity, and relative rainfall are also plotted
    according to the requirement of each fruit taken into consideration. There may
    also be many fruits that have similar growing conditions, so a table is created
    to find which other fruit can be cultivated in a given N, P, K, contained soil,
    and given environmental conditions. Finally, the correlation and confusion matrices
    are created and analyzed. 4.1 Nitrogen requirement analysis The plot showing the
    nitrogen requirement of the fruit trees under consideration is depicted in Fig.
    3. The graph shows that the fruit that needs the maximum nitrogen among all the
    fruits in the dataset is the pomegranate. Coconut is the fruit that requires the
    least amount of nitrogen. The nitrogen requirement of raspberry lies midway between
    that needed by muskmelon, banana, and watermelon on one end and papaya on the
    other end. Orange, mango, and apple are the fruits that need the least amount
    of nitrogen among all the fruits in the dataset. Fig. 3 Analysis of nitrogen content
    required in the soil concerning each fruit Full size image 4.2 Phosphorous requirement
    analysis Figure 4 shows the plot of the phosphorous requirement of the fruit trees
    taken in the dataset. Pomegranate, along with orange, mango, coconut, and muskmelon
    lie among the fruit trees that require the least phosphorous to grow properly.
    Apple and grapes on the other hand require the maximum phosphorous content in
    the soil among all fruits. Fig. 4 Analysis of phosphorous content required in
    the soil concerning each fruit Full size image 4.3 Potassium requirement analysis
    Figure 5 gives us the graphical representation of potassium requirement in the
    soil for the growing condition of the fruits considered in the dataset. From the
    graph, it can be inferred that muskmelon, banana, watermelon, and papaya are the
    ones that require almost equal quantities of potassium to grow in a soil medium.
    Orange is the fruit that needs the least quantity of potassium whereas the fruits
    that demand the maximum quantity of potassium are apples and grapes. Fig. 5 Analysis
    of potassium content required in the soil concerning each fruit Full size image
    4.4 A precise proportion of N, P, and K needed by each fruit The combined proportions
    of N, P, and K for each fruit are analyzed from the plots of N, P, and K content
    requirements for each fruit. Thus, RQ. 1, can be answered in terms of pie charts
    for each fruit, as shown in Fig. 6. A precise proportion of N, P, and K is needed
    for a particular fruit to grow in the best possible way. This can act as a basis
    for better recommendations of fruits that would suit the best for a certain quality
    of the soil available. Fig. 6 The proportion of N, P, K in kg/ha as needed by
    each fruit: a muskmelon; b banana; c watermelon; d papaya; e pomegranate; f orange;
    g mango; h apple; i raspberry; j grapes; k coconut Full size image 4.5 Fruit growth
    concerning temperature and humidity Figure 7 is a scatterplot obtained by plotting
    each fruit in a graph where the horizontal axis represents the temperature in
    degrees Celsius and the vertical axis represents the percentage of humidity in
    the atmosphere. It can be analyzed that mango needs very less humidity but a relatively
    high temperature, whereas crops like orange and papaya need very humid weather
    but a relatively less temperature. On the other hand, coconut needs high humidity
    as well as high temperature. Fig. 7 Scatterplot of fruits based on temperature
    and humidity Full size image 4.6 Effect of rainfall, temperature, and humidity
    on fruit growth Along with the nutrient content of the soil in the specified proportions,
    the climatic conditions prevalent at that period is another major factor affecting
    the fruit yield in substrate medium. The temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall
    are the climatic conditions that must be analyzed by the recommendation system
    to recommend the correct fruit to the pomologists. In response to RQ. 2, Fig.
    8 shows the bar plots to represent the quantity or proportion of the rainfall,
    temperature, and humidity requirements for the fruit trees to produce the best
    yield, thus showing the climatic conditions required for a particular fruit to
    grow. Fig. 8 Temperature, rainfall, and humidity requirement for fruits Full size
    image Table 1 is created in response to RQ. 6, where the nutrient and climatic
    requirements for each fruit are mentioned. The combination of nutrient content
    and climatic conditions of every fruit is compared with the others to check for
    feasibility of fruticulture in other similar conditions, in response to RQ. 7,
    where it has been found that few of the requirements for the cultivation of one
    fruit may even be suitable for the others. Thus, making the proposed recommendation
    system more dynamic, flexible, and scalable. Table 1 Suitable fruits based on
    soil health and climatic conditions Full size table 4.7 Correlation between different
    features The matrix showing the correlation among all the variables taken into
    consideration in this research work is depicted in Fig. 9. The matrix is used
    to determine the form of correlation and the degree of correlation among different
    variables. The form of correlation may be positive or negative, whereby positive
    correlation means the positive influence of one variable upon the other, and negative
    correlation means the negative influence of one variable upon the other. In this
    matrix, each variable has a complete correlation with itself. Fig. 9 Correlation
    matrix of N, P, K, pH, temperature, rainfall, and humidity requirement for fruits
    Full size image Though none of the variables are dependent on any of the others,
    the correlation of phosphorous and potassium content in the soil seems to be close
    to 1. Nitrogen content is seen to be negatively correlated with potassium, phosphorous,
    and average rainfall and positively correlated with temperature, humidity, and
    pH. Phosphorous content, on the other hand, is negatively correlated with temperature
    and pH apart from nitrogen content and is positively correlated with potassium
    content, humidity, and average rainfall. Potassium content is seen to be negatively
    correlated with Nitrogen content, temperature, pH, and rainfall, but it is positively
    correlated with phosphorous content and humidity. 4.8 Confusion matrix or error
    matrix A matrix of numbers that tells us when the model gets confused. It is a
    systematic way of mapping the predicted values to the original values. This is
    used in the case of supervised learning frameworks and is also helpful in defining
    the performance of the classification algorithm. The confusion matrix obtained
    in this experiment is shown in Fig. 10. A 10 × 10 matrix is obtained which evaluates
    the performance of the fruit recommendation model developed here. It compares
    the actual values against the predicted values by the developed model. Fig. 10
    Confusion matrix Full size image The confusion matrix obtained in this study shows
    that the model is working accurately. All the non-diagonal elements are 0. Running
    this model produces two outcomes: Binary 0–False Binary 1–True The y-axis corresponds
    to the actual values and the x-axis corresponds to the predicted values. There
    are four potential outcomes in a confusion matrix: (1) True positive (TP)–true
    result when the actual observation is positive (2) True negative (TN)–true result
    when the actual observation is negative (3) False positive (FP)–wrong prediction
    when actual observation is positive (4) False negative (FN)–wrong prediction when
    the actual observation is negative 4.9 Performance metrics of the proposed model
    and its accuracy Evaluating the performance of the proposed Light GBM machine
    learning model is one of the important steps while building an effective ML model.
    Different metrics are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model,
    and these metrics are known as performance metrics or evaluation metrics which
    analyze the performance of the model for the given data. In this way, the model''s
    performance can be improved by tuning the hyperparameters. Figure 11 shows the
    interconnectivity of the various classifier predictions and training data to the
    F1 score. As F1-score is dependent upon precision and recall, the connection showing
    the intermediatory stages is also depicted to depict the interrelation. Fig. 11
    A bottom-up approach showing the relation of metrics from raw data to F1 score
    Full size image Table 2 shows the performance metrics of all the fruits in the
    dataset in terms of precision, recall, and f1-score. Table 2 Performance metrics
    Full size table The most used parameter used to judge the machine learning model
    is accuracy. The formula to calculate accuracy is shown in Eq. 4. The accuracy
    of the model is found to be 99%, the macro average is 0.99 and the weighted average
    is 0.99. 5 Conclusions and future scope The fruit recommendation model proposed
    in this experiment is found to be efficient, more dynamic, flexible, and scalable
    which can be useful to the pomologists to identify the best suitable fruit that
    can be cultivated in the available soil and the prevalent environmental conditions.
    The dataset created contains the N, P, K, and pH requirements of the soil and
    the temperature and humidity requirements of the environment, which each fruit
    requires to grow to the fullest. The Light GBM algorithm uses 70 % of the data
    for training and 30 % of the data is used for testing. The available soil and
    environmental conditions are analyzed and checked for correlation to effectively
    recommend one or more fruits that can be grown in the prevalent conditions. Table
    1 shows the alternative fruits that require similar soil and climatic conditions
    that can be recommended by the system to the pomologists to have better qualitative
    and quantitative yields. On the other hand, the correlation and confusion matrix
    show the efficiency of the proposed recommendation model. The precision, recall,
    and F1 score are also calculated to verify the proper working of the proposed
    model. The accuracy of the model is found to be 99%, the macro average is 0.99
    and the weighted average is 0.9. Despite being very useful in positively impacting
    the profitability of the economy, there are various challenges practical implications
    of the proposed model in real world. The soil may erode or its conditions may
    deplete over time, due to several reasons. Thus, continuous monitoring of the
    farm is needed. The dynamic changes in soil and climatic conditions need to be
    considered every time this model is used for recommendation. Failing which, there
    may be a downfall in the yield. The presence of pests and rodents in the soil
    also needs to be monitored continuously. In the future, the model can be worked
    upon on a broader scope to accommodate more crops apart from fruits. It can be
    enhanced in two different aspects. Firstly, it can be expanded to accommodate
    a recommendation of other crops like grains, lentils, and flowering plants. Secondly,
    the scalability and utility of this model can also be extended to determine and
    recommend fertilizers and irrigation needs of crops for more precise yield estimation.
    One way to extend the scalability of the existing model is to accommodate for
    other vegetations like cereals, legumes, and grains. The nutrients, pH, temperature,
    and humidity requirements of the crops can be analyzed and a dataset has to be
    created for all those plants. The prevalent soil and weather conditions can then
    be analyzed for the recommender model to recommend the best suited crop for that
    region. The model can further be scaled to increase its utility to recommend fertilizers
    and irrigation needs of the plants considered. The dataset can be expanded to
    check the nutrient contents of the soil in real time and analyze it with the requirement
    of the plant to recommend fertilizer to be applied as and when needed. References

    Article 30 August 2020 1 Introduction Among major food grains, rice is one of
    the most consumable food grains globally, which is consumed by more than 50% of
    the world’s population [1]. This grain is obtained from paddy crop, which is mainly
    yielded in the Asia–Pacific region of the world, including China and India as
    its major producers [1]. The population of the world is increasing at a rapid
    rate and it is estimated that it will reach a number of around 10 billion by 2050
    [2]. As per the reports of United Nations, approximately 690 million population
    in the world is undernourished in the present scenario and this number will continue
    to grow in near future [3]. So, the food security of the people is a major challenge
    for all countries of the world, which demands an increase in food grain production.
    This can be accomplished by making use of the latest technologies such as internet
    of things and artificial intelligence in the agricultural domain. As far as the
    paddy crop is concerned, its yield is highly affected by several leaf diseases,
    including blast disease, sheath blight, false smut, bacterial stripe disease,
    neck blast, sheath rot and brown spot diseases [4]. Among these diseases, leaf
    blast disease primarily affects the yield of paddy crops by 10–30% annually, and
    may ruin the complete crop up to 100% within 15–20 days under supportive conditions
    [5]. Thus, this disease emerges as a major threat to food security and needs to
    be identified early enough to take precautionary measures for its mitigation.
    In today’s era of emerging technologies, internet of things (IoT), artificial
    intelligence (AI) and cloud or edge computing services play a significant role
    in providing effective solutions in the agricultural domain [6,7,8]. Therefore,
    research community is making tremendous efforts towards the automated detection
    of leaf diseases in various crops, including paddy. Real-time vision-based disease
    detection is the most realistic reinforced way by the state-of-the-art developments
    in the field of computer vision, image processing and pattern recognition empowered
    with machine learning (ML) [9,10,11,12]. The use of these kinds of intelligent
    systems in the agricultural industry can bring substantial improvement in precision
    agriculture. Keeping in view the above concerns, the present work aims to deplete
    the gap between the farmers and the agricultural universities/bodies so that a
    communication platform can be built between them to get knowledge about the health
    status of the crop. The basic idea of this work is to propose an intelligent IoT
    and AI-based precision agriculture framework for the detection of the blast disease
    using a simple and real-time non-intrusive system using a combination of colour
    slicing and grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM) techniques with machine learning.
    The GLCM technique finds the textural features of the plant leaves under observation,
    including contrast, correlation, energy and homogeneity features. These features
    are then fed to ML classifiers such as random forest, decision tree, extreme gradient
    boosting, adaptive boosting, histogram-based gradient boosting and k nearest neighbour
    algorithms. After a thorough analysis of simulation results based on several performance
    matrices, it has been found that the proposed approach of random forest classification
    based on colour slicing and GLCM features is an effective method for accurate
    detection of blast disease-infected leaves among healthy leaves of paddy crop.
    This paper has been organized into several sections, wherein Sect. 1 gives the
    introduction to the significance of precision agriculture for food security, blast
    disease in paddy crops and the contribution of present work to detect it. In addition,
    the research work done by different researchers in the field of detection of blast
    disease in paddy crop has been discussed in Sect. 2. Section 3 illustrates a proposed
    smart agriculture framework enabled by IoT, AI and cloud computing for the desired
    task of blast disease detection. Furthermore, the methodology adopted for the
    implementation of the present approach has been elaborated in Sect. 4. Similarly,
    the results obtained from the simulated analysis of different machine learning
    classifiers based on GLCM and colour slicing features are discussed in Sect. 5.
    Finally, conclusions about the major findings of the present work are presented
    in Sect. 6. 2 Related Work This section discusses the findings of different researchers
    working in the field of automated disease detection in paddy crops using several
    statistical approaches which are empowered with machine learning. In the process
    of identification of blast disease in south Indian rice, Ramesh and Vydeki [13]
    proposed a statistical approach which made use of kNN and artificial neural network
    (ANN) classifiers. This approach extracted mean, standard deviation, GLCM features,
    entropy, skewness and root mean square (RMS) values from healthy and diseased
    leaf images and provided accuracies of 85% and 99% for blast disease detection
    using kNN and ANN respectively. Similarly, Radhakrishnan Sreevallabhadev [14]
    discussed a hybrid approach of convolutional neural network (CNN) based feature
    extraction and support vector machine (SVM) based classification of blast disease
    infected leaves and healthy leaves, which provided an accuracy of 96.8% for this
    task. Furthermore, Sharma et al. [15] presented a deep transfer learning approach
    for detection of several rice diseases including blight, blast and brown spot;
    and obtained an accuracy of 98.9% with a CNN-based architecture Inception ResNet
    v2. In the same concern, Ramesh and Vydeki [16] proposed a deep neural network
    (DNN) and Jaya optimization algorithm-based approach for detection of multiple
    diseases in paddy crop leaves. This approach processed leaf images by converting
    from RGB (red yellow blue) to HSI (Hue Saturation Intensity) domains and then
    extracting GLCM based features through the clustering method. It achieved an accuracy
    of 98.9% for blast-affected leaf images of paddy crops. In continuance of these
    ML approaches for detection of blast diseases, Liang et al. [17] suggested a CNN
    approach for detection of rice blast disease, which provided an accuracy of 95.83%
    to achieve this task. Similarly, Kumar et al. [18] provided a random forest-based
    technique for detection of fungal blast disease in paddy crops. This approach
    processes images by resizing them into 256 × 256 resolution size and transforming
    them into grey scale format. Then, a feature extraction process was implemented
    to extract GLCM, brisks and surf features, which were given to a random forest
    classifier. This technique obtained accurate detection of blast disease affected
    leaves images with an accuracy of 73.12%. In light of the above-mentioned literature
    survey, there exists a need for an automated approach for accurate and real-time
    detection of blast disease of paddy crop. This type of approach should be computationally
    efficient so that it can run with an IoT based framework for real-time usage by
    farmers in paddy crop fields. This framework could be capable enough to acquire
    images using standalone pole-mounted cameras, hand-held or mobile cameras or drone-mounted
    cameras as well. A detailed description of this kind of IoT framework has been
    mentioned in the next section. 3 Proposed Smart Agriculture Framework for Diseased
    Leaves Detection in Paddy Crop This section presents an idea of a futuristic smart
    agriculture framework, which could be deployed for real-time usage for accurate
    detection of disease-infected leaves among healthy leaves of paddy crops in near
    future. This proposed framework makes use of latest state of the art technologies
    such as the internet of things (IoT), cloud computing and services as per Industry
    4.0 standards [8, 19, 20]. This idea of the use of the latest technologies for
    meeting agricultural needs has inspired the present work making the agricultural
    industry a step closer to the intelligent industries of the future [21]. In this
    technological era, most of electronic devices for data acquisition, including
    camera or sensors, can be connected to the internet. The data acquired by these
    sensors/devices can further be utilized for the development of a smart system
    for automated operation in different applications such as healthcare, smart transportation
    or smart agriculture etc. In this context, this paper proposes an algorithm which
    can be used as the backbone of the smart agriculture framework based on the IoT
    platform, cloud computing and machine learning, where farmers can utilize these
    technologies for precision agriculture. Figure 1 gives a generalized overview
    of this whole architecture. Fig. 1 Overview of futuristic smart agriculture framework
    for diseased leaf detection in paddy crop Full size image Detailing the physical
    aspects of this framework, one can use any vision sensor in order to capture the
    images. It may be an ordinary smartphone, a DSLR camera or an IP-based wireless
    camera. All of these devices can be used as edge devices with the help of which
    system takes its input from the farmer (user) end at crop field. The next phase
    is passing the acquired image data to the cloud storage. There are numerous devices
    which can be used for this task. In the case of a smartphone, through 4G/5G cellular
    communication, one can send the data directly to the cloud storage. Moreover,
    data can also be processed and sent with the help of a computer or local server
    connected to internet. These edge devices can be installed at any location where
    there is the access to internet, covering the ambiguity of connectivity issues.
    It should be noticed that a DSLR camera captures quality images with great resolution
    and information details. But all these images cannot be directly processed because
    of high computational/memory requirements. In addition, a wifi enabled camera
    needs an edge device in order to increase reliability. Since the majority of these
    cameras are equipped with Bluetooth or ZigBee connectivity which limits their
    operational range. So an edge device becomes necessary and should be placed near
    the field. Thereafter, the images captured are fed to the cloud storage unit which
    is equipped with the proposed machine learning-based technique. At this stage,
    test images are processed and checked for the presence of blast disease. A decision
    module within the algorithm makes the final decision which is further sent to
    the end user (farmer) and an expert or advisory body as well for the present and
    future use. Though it is an optional aspect, experts can add more information
    for the end user in order to facilitate the farmer working at remote locations.
    In this way, the farmer can seek expert advice by just sending the image of the
    plant leaf through any one of the options available for image capturing. 4 Methods
    and Materials This section outlines the methodology adopted to implement the proposed
    colour slicing and GLCM-based approach for classification of disease-infected
    leaf images among healthy leaf images of paddy crops. The main steps employed
    for the execution of the proposed approach are illustrated by the flowchart mentioned
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Flowchart of methodology adopted for the proposed approach of
    diseased leaf detection Full size image A major issue faced during the research
    was capturing the database images. For this purpose, a NIKON manufactured DSLR
    camera has been used to capture the database images. The specifications of this
    camera are given in Table 1. The present work takes into account a database consisting
    of 10,000 images. This dataset of 10,000 leaf images consists of 5000 images of
    blast diseased and 5000 images of healthy paddy plant leaves. Some other generalized
    paddy field images were also acquired which could be used for the optimization
    of the prototype. The whole dataset images were captured over a period of 3 months
    under controlled conditions for healthy images as well as under a natural environment,
    when blast disease emerges, generally in the month of August and September, in
    Punjab, India. Table 1 Vision/camera sensor details Full size table As already
    mentioned that system works for naturally illuminated images, it is a unique aspect
    of the computation algorithm. The development of this illumination-independent
    prototype included the preprocessing of the images before testing. Throughout
    the crop season, the natural light intensity was observed at different daytimes
    using a luxmeter. It has been observed that the average value of the intensity
    parameter in the HSI format of the captured image, varies proportionately to daylight.
    The same has been observed from the readings and variations in the value of the
    luxmeter. After this observation, the threshold values for processing the image
    (while using colour slicing) were calibrated by the hit and trial method, in accordance
    with the intensity parameter of the image. Table 2 summarises the different values
    of intensity and accordingly adjusted threshold values for processing the image.
    Table 2 Intensity variations and threshold values used in the proposed approach
    Full size table The methodology adopted for the detection of disease can be outlined
    in a few steps. Figure 3 gives the idea of the computation process at the cloud
    machines. As it is a technique developed with the hybridization of colour slicing
    and GLCM, it requires a hefty amount of data. So the very first step is data collection.
    A detail of the data acquisition has already been mentioned in this section. But
    for better acquisition a system patented by P. Stanley and A. Ashok might be used
    in order to remove motion blur and overcome system complexities [22]. Another
    technique proposed by Niazi et al. may also be used to compress the image data.
    It is based on JPEG2000 Interactive protocol, which aims to minimize the data
    bits between the image storage and computation nodes in case of big data analysis
    systems [23]. The whole database was then used to find the necessary details of
    the area of interest to slice the colour of interest and then calculate GLCM parameters.
    The system processes the images acquired with the disease to generate the colour
    cube for the slicing [24]. Fig. 3 Specimen images belonging to disease-affected
    and healthy leaf classes Full size image After pre-processing, the next phase
    is where the proposed method selects a region of interest based on the guidelines,
    provided by Punjab Agriculture University Ludhiana (PAU) [25]. In turn, it provides
    the blast disease-affected portion. The system slices the area of interest using
    the parameters given in Table 3. Table 3 RGB and HSI values used for colour slicing
    Full size table After marking the region of interest, the proposed method designs
    a mask and applies it to the image to be tested. A mathematical expression for
    the same is represented by the following equations. In Eqs. (1), (2) and (3) Rm*n,
    Gm*n and Bm*n are the red, green and blue components and Hm*n, Sm*n and Im*n are
    the Hue, Saturation and Intensity Components of the Image to be tested. First
    Mask in RGB: $$M1_{m*n} = (R1_{m*n} \\times G1_{m*n} \\times B1_{m*n} )$$ (1)
    Second Mask in HSI: $$M2_{m*n} = (H1_{m*n} \\times S1_{m*n} \\times I1_{m*n} )$$
    (2) where $$\\begin{gathered} R1_{m*n} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {1,}

    } \\right\\} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$ And $$\\begin{gathered} H1_{m*n} =
    \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {1,} \\hfill & {\\quad {\\text{for}}\\;0.020

    M_{m*n} = M1_{m*n} \\times M2_{m*n} .$$ (3) The final Image to be used for GLCM
    is \\([F]_{m*n*3}\\),where: $$\\begin{gathered} [F]_{m*n*1} = M_{m*n} \\times
    R_{m*n} \\hfill \\\\ [F]_{m*n*2} = M_{m*n} \\times G_{m*n} \\hfill \\\\ [F]_{m*n*3}
    = M_{m*n} \\times B_{m*n} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered}$$ (4) After the colour
    slicing, the algorithm converts the image into grayscale from the RGB mode for
    the reckoning of the GLCM. The GLCM functions describe the image texture through
    the occurrence of pixel pairs with explicit values in a spatial relationship.
    It forms GLCM and thereafter extraction of the statistical measures from the said
    matrix. Researchers have tested GLCM over the years and evidenced it to be an
    efficient statistical method [26] for extracting textural information from areas
    of interest. According to Haralick [27], a co-occurrence matrix can elaborate
    fourteen features related to the texture. The probability matrix of an image is
    used to calculate GLCM. It is a technique based on the extraction of second-order
    statistics of an image. One can use the third or even higher orders of the textures
    but reckoning time and the interpretation of the methods have always been the
    constraints. The primary GLCM statistics are contrast, correlation, energy, and
    homogeneity. These are associated with the measurement of local variations in
    the grey-level co-occurrence matrix, the joint probability existence of the specific
    pixel pairs, the sum of squared elements in the GLCM (also known as uniformity
    or the angular second moment) and the closeness of the distribution of elements
    in the GLCM to the GLCM diagonal respectively. It not only streamlines the processing
    but also makes the execution at least three folds faster. Thereafter, the GLCM
    parametric values of the test image are calculated. These parameters or features
    of GLCM have also been calculated for the database images conforming to two classes,
    diseased and healthy (with no disease) images. The mentioned second-order statistical
    parameters can be expressed mathematically [28] as given in the following sections.
    4.1 Contrast Contrast stretches an idea about the degree of depth and smoothness
    in a given structure. The higher value of the contrast means a lesser value of
    smoothness. The mathematical expression for the same is given below: $$Contrast
    = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{N} {\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{N} {(i - j)^{2} P(i,j)} }$$
    (5) where i × j is the resolution of the greyscale image being processed and the
    ‘P’ is the GLCM. 4.2 Correlation This parameter describes the resemblance in the
    texture of an image in vertical and horizontal directions as well. In other words,
    one can treat it as the degree of similarity between the consecutive pixels. Mathematically:
    $$Correlation = \\frac{{\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{N} {(i - \\overline{X})} \\sum\\limits_{j
    = 1}^{N} {(j - \\overline{Y})P(i,j)} }}{{\\sigma_{X} \\sigma_{Y} }}$$ (6) where
    \\(\\overline{X} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} i\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j
    = 1}^{N} P(i,j)\\) $$\\begin{aligned} \\overline{Y} & = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i
    = 1}^{N} j\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{N} P(i,j) \\\\ \\sigma_{X}^{2} & =
    \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} (i - \\overline{X} )^{2} \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j
    = 1}^{N} P(i,j) \\\\ \\sigma_{Y}^{2} & = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{N} (i
    - \\overline{Y} )^{2} \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{N} P(i,j) \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$
    (7) 4.3 Energy or Angular Second Moment (ASM) This statistic deals with the regularity
    and uniformity in the entire distribution of texture. For an image with no variations,
    the energy parameter value is one. It gives a sum of squared elements in GLCM.
    Mathematically: $$Energy = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{N} {\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{N}
    {P(i,j)^{2} } }$$ (8) 4.4 Homogeneity The term homogeneity provides the degree
    of closeness of the distribution of elements present in GLCM to the GLCM diagonal.
    The parameter value of Homogeneity for a diagonal GLCM is one. The expression
    for the same is as below: $$Homogeneity = \\sum\\nolimits_{i,j} {\\frac{P(i,j)}{{1
    + |i - j|}}}$$ (9) In the process of execution of the present method, Fig. 3 shows
    the specimen of a blast disease-affected leaf and the healthy leaf of paddy plant
    obtained from the acquired dataset of leaf images. Similarly, Fig. 4 shows the
    R, G, B content along with H, S, I components of the specimen images. In a similar
    manner, Table 4 gives an illustration of specimen leaf images belonging to diseased
    and healthy classes in RGB format along with the detection of disease-affected
    portion of the diseased leaf image using the proposed method. This table also
    shows GLCM features obtained from each of the given images. Fig. 4 R, G, B and
    H, S, I components of specimen image with disease and without disease Full size
    image Table 4 GLCM features of specimen images Full size table After the calculation
    of all these GLCM features from given images of healthy and diseased leaves of
    the acquired dataset, the subsequent phase is the classification of these images
    using machine learning (ML) classifiers. For this task, the obtained GLCM features
    are fed to several ML algorithms for training and testing. The ML algorithms employed
    for this task include random forest, k nearest neighbour (kNN), extreme gradient
    boosting (XGBoost), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), histogram-based gradient boosting
    (HGBoost) and decision tree classifiers. 5 Results and Discussion This section
    discusses the results obtained from the proposed approach for the detection of
    blast disease-infected leaves from the healthy leaves of paddy crop. For this
    task, six machine learning algorithms viz., random forest, kNN, XGBoost, AdaBoost,
    HGBoost and decision tree are taken into consideration. All of these classifiers
    are fed with a feature map of 10,000 samples. Each of these samples contained
    4 GLCM features belonging to diseased and healthy classes. Furthermore, these
    classifiers are trained using a training dataset having 90% samples and tested
    using testing data set containing 10% samples. These samples are chosen from the
    acquired database containing 10,000 images. The performance of these classifiers
    has been analyzed using several performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity,
    specificity, F1 score, false discovery rate (FDR), area under the curve (AUC)
    and their region of convergence (ROC) characteristics. The performance of given
    classifiers for overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and FDR values
    of given classifiers has been depicted in the following Table 5. As per this table,
    maximum accuracy of 99.1% has been achieved by random forest classifier for the
    given task. This classifier also achieves maximum values of other performance
    measures such as overall sensitivity of 99.05%, specificity of 99.05% and F1 score
    of 99.09% along with a minimum value of FDR i.e., 0.86% only. This performance
    makes random forest an effective technique for the classification of diseased
    and healthy leaf images using the proposed colour slicing and GLCM features-based
    approach. As per Table 5, decision tree classifier also provides good classification
    results with an overall accuracy of 98.7%, sensitivity of 98.66%, specificity
    of 98.66%, F1 score of 98.69% and FDR of 1.28%. Furthermore, kNN and HGBoost classifiers
    provide relatively similar classification performance with overall accuracies
    of 88.4% and 88.5% respectively. In addition, XGBoost and AdaBoost classifiers
    have shown low classification performance with accuracies of 73.4% and 68.1% respectively,
    thereby making them unsuitable for the classification of healthy and diseased
    image classes using the proposed approach. Table 5 Performance analysis of machine
    learning classifiers for detection of blast disease infected leaf images among
    healthy leaf images of paddy crop Full size table In addition, this approach has
    also been evaluated using given ML classifiers via class-wise performance analysis
    in terms of sensitivity, specificity, F1 score and FDR values of diseased and
    healthy classes individually. This performance analysis has been visualized in
    Fig. 5. It is evident from Fig. 5 that the random forest classifier provides the
    highest classification performance in terms of sensitivity of 99.63% and 98.46%,
    specificity of 98.46% and 99.63%, F1 score of 99.18% and 99.01% and FDR of 1.27%
    and 0.44% for diseased and healthy leave classes respectively. Furthermore, the
    classification performance of given ML classifiers has also been presented using
    ROC curves and their AUC values, which are depicted in Fig. 6. As shown in this
    figure, the maximum area under curve has been achieved by random forest classifier
    having a value of 0.9996 followed by decision tree (AUC 0.9866), kNN (AUC 0.9607),
    HGBoost (AUC 0.9542), XGBoost (AUC 0.8204) and AdaBoost (AUC 0.7204) respectively.

    F1 score and FDR values for diseased and healthy leaf classes Full size image
    Fig. 6 Performance evaluation of given ML classifiers for binary classification
    of diseased and healthy leaves of paddy crop in terms of ROC curve and AUC values
    Full size image After the thorough analysis of the results of given ML algorithms
    for classification of healthy and diseased leaf images in paddy crops, it is clear
    that random forest classifier provides highest classification performance in terms
    of maximum values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, AUC and minimum
    value of FDR. The confusion matrix plot of random forest classifier for a given
    testing dataset is also illustrated in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 Confusion matrix plot of
    random forest classifier for binary classification of diseased and healthy plant
    leaf images of paddy crop Full size image Finally, it is concluded that the proposed
    colour slicing and GLCM features-based random forest classification approach provides
    effective performance for accurate detection of blast disease-infected leaves
    among healthy leaves of paddy crops. This approach would perform quite efficiently
    in the futuristic internet of things-enabled framework for precision agriculture
    and may facilitate the farmers for accurate identification of diseases in their
    crops so that the remedies can be implemented on time to improve the overall yield
    of the paddy crop. 6 Conclusion and Future Scope The present work proposes an
    IoT-enabled automated framework for the accurate detection of leaf blast disease
    in paddy crops through colour slicing and GLCM features-based machine learning
    approach. For this work, an image dataset of blast disease-affected leaves and
    healthy leaves of paddy crops has been developed by acquiring images throughout
    the crop season. This dataset has been processed through colour slicing and GLCM
    approaches to extract texture features. Then, these features are fed to several
    machine learning classifiers, including random forest, decision tree, AdaBoost,
    XGBoost and Histogram based gradient boosting algorithm. The overall analysis
    of results exhibit that random forest classifier performs better among all given
    classifiers for binary classification of disease-infected and healthy leaves with
    maximum values of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 measure and AUC as 99.10%,
    99.05%, 99.05%,99.09% and 0.9996 respectively and a minimum FDR of 0.86% only.
    Thus, it has been revealed that the proposed approach of colour slicing and GLCM
    features-based random forest classification for futuristic IoT frameworks is an
    appropriate option for the automated detection of blast disease-infected leaves.
    This technique can be used for early detection and handling of blast disease of
    paddy and hence avoiding yield loss. This futuristic approach can be realized
    using several IoT-based modules for image acquisition including computer vision-enabled
    drones; 4G/5G internet connectivity and cloud computing services for precision
    agriculture. Moreover, this technique of image classification could also be employed
    for detection of leaf diseases in other crops as well, which may include wheat,
    potato etc. Data Availability The datasets generated during and/or analysed during
    the current study are not publicly available due to confidentiality issues, but

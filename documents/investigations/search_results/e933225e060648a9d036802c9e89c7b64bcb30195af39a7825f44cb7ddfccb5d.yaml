    optimal PI schedules, which shows 10.846% water and 10.339% cost-saving on our
    selected sites. Overall the proposed model effectively demonstrates that a more
    accurate PI predictive algorithm saves water, improves resource conservation,
    and reduces irrigation costs.

    I. Introduction The root zone soil moisture (RZSM) is an indicator of the vegetation
    drought stress and the crop water demand, which are valuable information for precision
    irrigation (PI) [1], [2]. In-situ sensors installed at root zone-specific depths
    can provide direct field RZSM measurements [3]. However, the vast installation
    of sensors across the field at the subsurface for RZSM measurements is not economically
    viable. Current satellite missions can provide kilometers of distributed horizontal
    spatial details, but only centimeters of vertical (depth) SM information [4],
    [5], [6]. This vertical resolution can only provide knowledge of the surface soil
    moisture (SSM) layer, not the RZSM layer. The limitations in direct RZSM measurements
    from in-situ sensors and satellite missions are predominantly addressed by indirect
    estimation through analytical methods using theoretical or empirical models to
    obtain fine-scale RZSM [7], [8]. These analytical methods use the relationship
    between environmental variables, such as precipitation, temperature, soil, and
    plant characteristics (PTSPc) which determines the RZSM state for indirect estimations
    [9]. However, these in-direct methods require in-situ (e.g. sensor) and ex-situ
    data (e.g. satellite) to improve the model’s location-specific RZSM simulation
    accuracy [10]. Adoption of data-based methods can help remove these location-based
    optimization constraints as they are adaptive to data [11], [12], [13]. Among
    data-based methods, deep learning (DL) is becoming increasingly popular due to
    its deep architectures, which can extract accurate information from big environmental
    data [14], [15]. The application of DL in the realm of RZSM is still in the nascent
    stages [16], [17], [18]. However, RZSM is SSM diffused to lower soil layers [1],
    [19]. Consequently, the more advanced DL-based techniques for detailed SSM information,
    such as perform downscaling (increasing spatial/temporal details) by correlating
    the SSM with auxiliary SSM information available at target location [20], [21],
    [22], [23], can be extended to RZSM. Stream flow, another significant environmental
    parameter, exhibits remarkable similarities with moisture distribution within
    the root zone [24], [25]. Both parameters offer insights into the time-series
    movement of water, albeit within different mediums. Just as auxiliary information-based
    DL models have proven effective in the SSM domain, we can apply similar knowledge
    and methodologies from existing DL research in stream flow to enhance our comprehension
    of RZSM [25]. In instances where RZSM source information (whether in-situ or ex-situ)
    is scarce or unavailable, the environmental variables governing RZSM state can
    serve as valuable auxiliary information for these DL models. The literature suggests
    that employing a sequential DL model would be well-suited for conducting such
    correlation analyses [26], [27]. The transformer neural network (TNN) is the state-of-the-art
    DL model to process sequential data [25], [28]. It is a new cognitive model eschewing
    recurrence implementations in the previous benchmark sequential DL models, such
    as Long short-term memory (LSTM) [29] and Gated recurrent unit (GRU) [30]. LSTM
    and GRU receive the input information indirectly as a set of hidden states passed
    on through multiple cells via series processing. While, TNN can pay attention
    to every single input directly through parallel processing and attention mechanism
    to draw global dependencies between input and output. The attention mechanism
    enhances critical parts of the input while diminishing others so that the network
    can devote more focus to the essential information [31]. The indirect RZSM estimation
    requires data from multiple sensor locations to be perceived simultaneously to
    draw critical information from target prediction. Hence we find TNN more suitable
    for RZSM estimation. Furthermore, the LSTM and GRU-based RZSM works mainly focus
    on estimating RZSM using meteorological variables alone [27], [32]. However, other
    environmental variables also affect the RZSM state and should be considered for
    estimation. Unlike LSTM and GRU, more variables will enhance TNN learning due
    to parallel processing and attention mechanism [33]. Also, existing RZSM works
    aim at future predictions of a target location where ground truth is available
    [27], [32]. However, the main problem in the RZSM domain is the limited information
    on depth at locations without ground truth due to the shortcomings of direct measurement
    by in-situ and satellite devices. Such measurement constraints were addressed
    in the SSM domain using auxiliary variables correlations with the prediction target
    [20], [21], [22], [23]. This correlation approach is extrapolatable to the RZSM
    domain due to similarities with the SSM. In order to extrapolate the correlations
    from sensor location RZSM and auxiliary data for prediction at a site without
    direct measurement, we introduce a hybrid TNN model. We use auxiliary-RZSM variables
    identified in the literature for RZSM estimation: SSM, soil type, surrounding
    RZSM, target distance, plant type, RZSM depth, root type, plant daily water requirement,
    humidity, temperature, rainfall, soil salinity, and soil temperature [1], [9],
    [19], [27], [32]. In the proposed model first, as a high-level input abstraction,
    sensor locations with similar satellite SSM values as the target are selected
    for further analysis. To distinguish the SSM information from different test locations
    for similarity assessment, we use the downscaled 1 km SM from [34]. Next, a dynamic-MLP
    (D-MLP) finds the prominent PTSPc predictor variables from chosen sensor locations
    by determining the relative importance of these variables as a function of the
    neural network synaptic weights. The network assigns higher weights if the variables
    contribute more to the predictions. The selected sensor RZSM and auxiliary variables
    from the sensor and target locations are input to the attention layer of the proposed
    hybrid TNN model for further processing. The attention block first analyses the
    relative relationship between the auxiliary variables at sensor and target locations.
    Next, the model performs a similar relationship analysis between sensor location
    auxiliary variables and RZSM. To achieve these proposed dual relative relationship
    analyses we concatenate an additional attention block to the basic TNN architecture.
    Inside the additional block, we implement a new multi-cross attention mechanism,
    which simultaneously analyses cross relative relationships between features from
    multiple sensor sites with the target. Unlike the conventional attention block,
    which transforms the output using its inputs, this block transforms the input
    using the inputs from the other concatenated block. Such an arrangement helps
    correlate the similarities of RZSM-related environmental changes between target
    and selected sensor locations. Based on these relationships, probabilities were
    generated by the proposed hybrid TNN using the Bayes theorem in an additional
    layer implemented as a preceding layer to the traditional TNN output layer for
    each selected sensor RZSM. Finally, the probabilistic weighted sum of the selected
    RZSM sensors provides the required indirect estimates. A probabilistic weight
    assignment can reduce the uncertainties in multi-source ensembling [35] and can
    enhance the proposed model prediction accuracy as it combines multi-sensor data.
    Based on the hybrid TNN RZSM estimates, we simulated PI schedules for the test
    locations for further evaluation. The proposed hybrid TNN model is compared with
    TNN [25], LSTM [27] and GRU [32] based related works for performance evaluation.
    A comparison of irrigation scheduling with these three models using quantitative
    measurements is conducted for the amount of water saved. These evaluations and
    comparisons will provide new insights for improvements in the RZSM estimation.
    The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows: A novel hybrid
    transformer neural network is designed to create a more discriminative extraction
    of auxiliary-RZSM variables for daily in-direct RZSM estimation. A new deep learning-based
    method is proposed to fuse climate model outputs with satellite and ground-based
    data to aid in PI scheduling without requiring the large-scale installation of
    in-situ sensing stations. A new deep learning-based decision support system for
    PI is developed to reduce irrigation water loss. Proposed method produces highly
    accurate RZSM estimates across multiple root depths and when integrated as part
    of an intelligent PI automation system aids in water and cost-saving irrigation
    schedules compared to state-of-the-art neural network-based approaches. The remaining
    paper is organized as follows: the study area and proposed model are elaborated
    in Section II. The simulation results are shown in Section III. Finally, a conclusion
    is drawn in Section IV. SECTION II. Materials and Methods In this section, we
    introduce a novel hybrid TNN model for indirectly estimating RZSM, with the objective
    of enhancing PI decision-making. To evaluate the proposed model’s performance,
    we will conduct a comparative analysis against hybrid-GRU [27], LSTM-Technique
    [32], and Multi-head TNN [25] within an irrigation framework. Both hybrid-GRU
    [27] and LSTM-Technique [32] predict RZSM using a sequential DL model, incorporating
    multiple auxiliary-RZSM variables as input to make informed irrigation decisions.
    Multi-head TNN [25] is a recent auxiliary variables-based prediction model. These
    comparisons will provide a benchmark for the proposed hybrid TNN-based RZSM estimation
    accuracy when compared to conventional TNN, LSTM, and GRU. Hence, we find these
    works highly valuable for comparison. To facilitate a meaningful comparative analysis,
    the configuration of the comparison models, namely hybrid-GRU, LSTM-Technique,
    and Multi-head TNN, strictly follows the specifications outlined in the respective
    literature [25], [27], and [32]. Additionally, the configuration of our proposed
    model is detailed in Section II-B. To ensure a fair comparison, all competing
    models are provided with the same input variables (detailed in Section II-A) as
    those for the proposed model. However, since these input variables are measured
    in different units (for example: temperature in degrees Celsius, precipitation
    in mm/day, etc.), they are re-scaled into [0, 1] using Min-Max normalization as
    a pre-processing step. This ensures that all input features are treated equally
    in the learning process by all four models. Finally, the Nash Sutcliffe coefficient
    of efficiency (NSE), determination coefficient (R2), and normalized mean bias
    error (NMBE) will be used to compare the performances of the four models. The
    subsequent section describes the study area, dataset, and input variables used
    in this study. A. Study Area and Dataset To test our proposed model we require
    a dataset having multiple RZSM sensing station readings installed over a vast
    spatially distributed area having similarities in the soil-plant-atmosphere domain.
    Hence we use the City of Melbourne (Australia) Soil Sensor Readings (CoMSSR [36])
    dataset. The CoMSSR dataset contains historical readings for RZSM sensors and
    related auxiliary-RZSM variables within parks across the city of Melbourne. The
    units and readings at eight soil depths (0-80 cm) from 78 soil sensors installed
    locations are included within the CoMSSR dataset. The Soil Sensor Locations (SSL)
    dataset can be used to get the locations (latitude and longitude) where soil sensors
    have been deployed across the city. The CoMSSR dataset is joined to the SSL dataset
    [37] using the site-id column. The SSL dataset information can be further used
    to link with the soil type by area maps (STBAM) dataset to get the soil type information
    [38]. The CoMSSR, SSL, and STBAM datasets can be accessed for hourly values from
    the city of Melbourne-open data portal (https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/). The
    model is tested using data from June 2020 to February 2021, while the remaining
    1 year and 2 months of data (preceding June 2020) from the CoMSSR, SSL, and STBAM
    datasets are used for training purposes. The latitude and longitude information
    from the SSL dataset can be used to obtain the weather data from the nearest weather
    station accessible through the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM), Australia (https://www.bom.
    gov.au/). The weather station number from BOM can be used to join with the BOM
    forecast dataset [39]. The SSL dataset is further used to generate the fine resolution
    SSM for the 78 sensor locations. The fine resolution SSM is generated using the
    9 km Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) and 1 km Moderate Resolution Imaging
    Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data, which can be accessed from NASA earthdata
    (https://search.earth data.nasa.gov/search). The sensor locations can be mainly
    classified as dry and wet regions. The Alexandra Gardens and Batman Park are wet
    regions as they are located near the Yarra River. Fawkner Park represents the
    case of a dry location far from any water bodies. Furthermore, these three test
    locations have the most widely available soil types in the world [40]. Hence our
    model is tested at these three locations illustrated in Fig. 2. The proposed model
    is elaborated further. FIGURE 1. The study area map illustrates the distribution
    of 78 soil sensors across the city of Melbourne. The selected prediction sites
    are labeled as 1, 2, and 3: Alexandra Garden (1), Batman Park (2), and Fawkner
    Park (3). At these three locations, Root Zone Soil Moisture (RZSM) levels are
    predicted in-directly by inputting sensor data from all other locations on the
    map into the Hybrid Transformer Neural Network. The model’s estimated RZSM values
    are then validated using RZSM data from the target prediction locations (labeled
    as 1, 2, and 3 on the map). Show All FIGURE 2. The layout of the three test sites:
    (a) Alexandra Garden (5.2 hectares) is located at 37.82037°S 144.971938°E with
    clay loam soil. It has an avenue of oak trees around the garden; (b) Batman Park
    (1.47 hectares) is located at 37.821766°S 144.956348°E with medium to heavily
    textured clay plus some sand. The park consists of sparse maturing eucalyptus
    trees with no understorey or saplings, and (c) Fawkner Park (41 hectares) is located
    at 37.838434°S 144.981016°E with sandy loam soil. The park has elm, oak, and fig
    trees. Show All B. Model Design Fig. 3 illustrates the framework of the proposed
    decision support system for precision irrigation (DSS-PI). The proposed DSS-PI
    is made of three parts: 1) the SSM similarity assessment, 2) the RZSM estimation,
    and 3) the irrigation processor. Each part of the proposed DSS-PI is detailed
    below. FIGURE 3. The framework of the decision support system for precision irrigation
    (DSS-PI). The dynamic information (SMAP, MODIS, and BOM) and static (CoMSSR, SSL,
    and STBAM) information are given as input to the proposed DSS-PI to get RZSM and
    irrigation information. First, the DSS-PI performs SSM similarity assessment using
    SMAP and MODIS data for selecting sensor locations for further analysis. Next,
    the RZSM estimation module outputs RZSM information using CoMSSR, SSL, STBAM,
    and BOM data. Finally, the irrigation processor provides the irrigation information
    using predicted RZSM and BOM rainfall data. Show All 1) SSM Similarity Assessment
    Satellite imagery is made up of pixels and it represents the relative reflected
    light energy recorded for that part of the image. Each pixel represents a square
    area on an image and is a measure of the sensor’s ability to resolve ground objects.
    The reflected energy from a light spectrum will be the same for objects that are
    similar in composition. Currently, satellites can only provide SSM information.
    Since SSM and RZSM are correlated, a similarity assessment of satellite pixels
    can help identify similar pixel-valued sensor sites with the target location without
    a sensor to further derive RZSM information. A minimum of 1 km resolution is required
    to distinguish the SM pixels from the sensor sites in the CoMSSR dataset [36].
    Currently, SMAP provides the highest resolution global daily SM of 9 km. Since
    this resolution is not sufficient for our application we downscale the 9 km SMAP
    SM to 1 km using the 3D-Bi-LSTM model [34] from our previous work. The target
    location 1 km downscaled SM is evaluated to check the overall similarity with
    all the sensor location’s 1 km SM. Based on the SSM similarity sensor locations
    are selected. In order to identify the most important pixels that can contribute
    to the target prediction and reduce the complexity of analysis, we select pixels
    with at least fifty-percent similarity to the target. Next, the selected location
    features are passed on to hybrid TNN for further analysis. 2) RZSM Estimation
    Fig. 4 illustrates the proposed RZSM estimation using the hybrid TNN model. The
    D-MLP network forms the first processing layer of the proposed neural network.
    In the D-MLP the number of neurons is dynamically set at each cycle based on the
    similarity assessment in the current iteration. This design helps to analyze all
    locations with high similarity scores for any selected time rather than limiting
    the analysis to a fixed number of sites. Also, for locations with similar similarity
    scores, the closer in the range locations are given higher weights. This weight
    allocation is because closer regions to the target will have more similar environmental
    conditions. Hence the D-MLP hidden layer weights are further tuned based on the
    range value from the target location. FIGURE 4. Root zone soil moisture estimation
    using the hybrid transformer neural network (hybrid TNN). The hybrid TNN has three
    modules: (1) Prominent feature selection module: from the similar SSM sensor locations,
    the D-MLP (violet box) selects prominent predictor variables from auxiliary-RZSM
    variables. The selected feature name is used to select the same feature from the
    target (white box); (2) Attention module: the selected variables undergo position
    encoding to track the order of the selected variable sequence. The position encoded
    selected features from target and sensor sites are provided to the multi-head
    attention module (brown box). The module finds the relative relationship between
    the selected sensor and target location data. The multi-head environmental inter-similarity
    attention module (light blue box) finds the relative relationship between the
    multi-location RZSM and prominent predictor variables from sensor sites; (3) Bayesian
    ensemble module: performs a Bayesian average of multi-sensor RZSM using the conditional
    probability (green box) generated based on the attention module output to estimate
    target RZSM. Show All The calculation of whether a sensor is close or far in the
    distance (d) is performed using the longitude and latitude of the target point
    and g ∈{1,2,3,…,G} selected sensor locations. The closest regions will have similar
    hydrological cycles compared to the farther located sensors. Hence the D-MLP assigns
    more weight to the decisions made from the information from closer sensor locations
    ( W p > W q ∀ d p < d q ifp≠q ). Once the D-MLP weights are optimized, I auxiliary-RZSM
    information f i g ∈{ f 1 g , f 2 g ,…, f I g } from the g selected similar locations
    are passed on to the D-MLP for finding the prominent auxiliary-RZSM information
    features. The D-MLP determines the relative prominence [41] of the predictor variables
    as, V ij = ∑ k=1 K W ik ∙ W kj , (1) View Source where V ij is the relative importance
    of any input variable f i g with respect to j∈{1,2,…,J} output neuron (for J number
    of output neurons), K is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, W ik is the
    synaptic connection weight between the input neuron i and the hidden neuron k,
    and W kj is the synaptic weight between the hidden neuron k and the output neuron
    j. The D-MLP selects the top-ranked features, denoted as I/2 , from the relevant
    list of I total predictor variables extracted from selected sensor locations,
    and forwards them to the attention module for root zone soil moisture (RZSM) prediction.
    Within the attention module, the multi-head attention component is dedicated to
    capturing dependencies within the input sequence, while the multi-head environmental
    inter-similarity attention component specifically focuses on identifying similarities
    and patterns across different sensor locations, thereby enhancing the model’s
    environmental understanding. The output of the multi-head attention module comprises
    attention weights assigned to each feature in the input sequence, facilitating
    the model’s ability to concentrate on pertinent information while disregarding
    noise or irrelevant data. Similarly, the output of the multi-head environmental
    inter-similarity attention module captures environmental similarities and patterns
    across various sensor locations, aiding the model in comprehending the broader
    environmental context. By assimilating insights from the environmental inter-similarity,
    the model can generalize across diverse sensor locations and adjust its predictions
    based on the broader environmental context. Leveraging the outputs from the attention
    module, the proposed model executes a Bayesian averaging technique [35] on selected
    sensor location moisture data to predict the target RZSM accurately. To calculate
    the probability values to perform the Bayesian average of the RZSM from selected
    sensors, first, the cross attention layer of the hybrid TNN evaluates the percentage
    similarity of features at the target location and selected sensor locations. Let
    f s g ∈{ f 1 g , f 2 g ,…, f S g } be the D-MLP selected prominent features, where
    S=I/2 is the number of chosen features. The f s g is encoded as c s g through
    position encoding [42]. At a g th location, the SM can be expressed as a function
    of s∈{1,2,…,S} prominent auxiliary-RZSM variables c s g , y g (t)= z P g ( ∑ s=1
    S c s g (t))∀t∈{1,2,3,…,T}, (2) View Source where z P g is the mapping function
    for the given hybrid TNN predictor neuron P g . Eq. (2) gives the RZSM at a g
    th sensor location. However, we aim to find the RZSM at location h≠g without sensor.
    Hence we estimate y h (t) through Bayesian average of RZSM from g sensor locations.
    To estimate this, the relative relationship between the independent variable c
    s g (t) at each g th location and c s h (t) at target location ‘h’needs to be
    derived. The proposed hybrid TNN’s inter-similarity attention layer queries how
    related the encoded feature c s h at the target location is to the same features
    at G locations. The relative relationship between c s h and { c s 1 ,…, c s G
    } is { r h→1 ,…, r h→G } . For any location u ∈ g , this can be expressed as,
    r s h→u (t) = e min( c s h (t), c s u (t)) max( c s h (t), c s u (t)) ∑ G g=1
    e min( c s h (t), c s g (t)) max( c s h (t), c s g (t)) ∀s∈{1,…,S}, t∈{1,…,T}.
    (3) View Source The relative relationship in Eq. (3) is used to get the transformed
    input features from g locations ‘ c s g (t) ~ ’ as, c s g (t) ~ = ∑ g=1 G r s
    h→g (t) c s g (t)∀s∈{1,…,S},t∈{1,…,T}. (4) View Source Transforming the RZSM at
    g locations in Eq. (2) using the transformed auxiliary-RZSM variables in Eq. (4)

    where y g (t) ^ is the predicted RZSM. The objective of each hybrid TNN predictor
    neuron, denoted as P g , is to find out the relationship between c s g (t) ~ and
    y g (t) ^ . To ensemble the relative SM at g locations for getting the SM at target
    location, the Bayesian average is used. The ensemble SM prediction, given the
    data c s g (t) ~ , is y en (t) = ∑ g=1 G p( y ^ | P g , c s g ~ )(t)p( P g | c
    s g ~ )(t) y g (t) ∀t∈{1,2,3,…,T}, (6) View Source where y en (t) represent the
    RZSM at the location h≠g for t∈{1,…,T} time instants. y g (t) is the actual RZSM
    measured by the sensors at g locations. p( y ^ | P g , c s g ~ ) is the SM PDF
    based on P g alone, estimated from training data, and p( P g | c s g ~ ) is the
    posterior probability of predictor P g being correct for the given training data,
    c s g (t) ~ . Next, the estimated RZSM ( y en (t) ) is provided to the irrigation
    processor for further processing. 3) Irrigation Processor Fig. 5 illustrate the
    proposed irrigation processor. The irrigation frequency module in the irrigation
    processor decides whether irrigation is required or not based on the water depletion
    tolerance rate ( R(t) ) for each irrigation type. The R(t) value is calculated
    using [43] as follows, R(t)= P wr (t)−( P wr (t)×DT 100 )∀t∈{1,2,3,…,T}, (7) View
    Source where P wr (t) is the daily water requirement of the plant and DT is the
    soil water depletion tolerance by the PI system. The P wr (t) should not drop
    below R(t) to maintain water levels above wilting point. FIGURE 5. The Irrigation
    processor with two main parts: (a) Irrigation frequency assessment module (light
    violent square with dashed black outline) and (b) Irrigation amount assessment
    module (light green square with dashed black outline). The irrigation frequency
    assessment module examines if irrigation is required using hybrid TNN predicted
    RZSM (brown ellipse) and water depletion tolerance (dark blue rectangle) data.
    The irrigation amount assessment module subtracts the water available from BOM
    rainfall data (dark blue square) and hybrid TNN RZSM from plant water requirement
    (green cylinder) data. Show All The DSS used for PI knows the irrigation requirements
    in the farm using Eq. (7) and use this information for controlling an automatic
    irrigation system for precise application of water to plants. The main type of
    irrigation system used for PI is drip irrigation. Ideally, for drip irrigation
    systems, the DT should be in the range of 20 to 25 [43]. The proposed irrigation
    processor decides on when irrigation should occur as follows, ∀ y en (t) ∀ y en
    (t) ≤R(t):Irrigation required >R(t):Irrigation not required. (8) View Source If
    irrigation is required, the amount of water to be given through irrigation is
    evaluated next. The amount of water to be provided through irrigation is calculated
    as A(t)= P wr (t)−( y en (t)+W(t))∀t∈{1,2,3,…,T}, (9) View Source where A(t) is
    the amount of irrigation water, P wr (t) is the daily water requirement of the
    plant, y en (t) is the hybrid TNN estimated RZSM, and W(t) is the estimated water
    available from rainfall for the selected day using [44]. The proposed model is
    tested in Section III. SECTION III. Results and Discussion In this section, simulations
    are performed to evaluate the effectiveness and potentialities of the proposed
    hybrid TNN for RZSM and irrigation predictions at three different test sites in
    Melbourne, (1) Alexandra Gardens, (2) Batman Park, and (3) Fawkner Park. Both
    quantitative and resource conservation efficiency comparisons are conducted with
    the Multi-head TNN [25], LSTM-Technique [32] and Hybrid GRU [27]. A. Quantitative
    Performance Evaluation To demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid TNN, we
    conduct a comparative analysis between predicted and actual values obtained from
    soil sensors at various soil depths across the three test locations. Figures 6
    (a)–(c) depict the percentage change in average predicted soil moisture across
    eight layers relative to the actual values. Positive and negative changes along
    the vertical axis signify over-prediction and under-prediction, respectively.
    Over-predictions of RZSM can lead to inadequate irrigation, while under-predictions
    can result in irrigation flooding by automatic irrigation systems. The visualizations
    in Figures 6 (a)–(c) highlight that the predictions by the hybrid TNN closely
    align with the actual RZSM, outperforming hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32],
    and Multi-head TNN [25]. This suggests a higher level of reliability in the hybrid
    TNN model, which is crucial for preventing both under-irrigation and potential
    irrigation flooding by automatic irrigation systems. Additionally, Table 1 presents
    the training and testing times for the four comparison models. Notably, the proposed
    hybrid TNN demonstrates significantly lower training and testing times compared
    to the other three competing models, indicating reduced time and computational
    complexity. TABLE 1 Time Complexity Comparison of Hybrid TNN, Multi-Head TNN [25],
    Hybrid GRU [27] and LSTM-Technique [32] FIGURE 6. Comparative analysis of percentage
    changes in average predicted soil moisture across eight layers, relative to actual
    values, for Hybrid GRU [27] (blue dotted line with x marker), LSTM-Technique (red
    semicolon line) [32], Multi-head TNN [25] (black dashed line), and Hybrid TNN
    from June 2020 to February 2021 at three locations: (a) Alexandra Gardens, (b)
    Batman Park, and (c) Fawkner Park. Notably, the Hybrid TNN prediction (green line)
    exhibits the least deviation from the actual values. Show All Further quantitative
    measurements are considered to synthesize the model’s performance effectiveness
    over eight months for three stations. Table 2 shows the performance comparison
    of the hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32], Multi-head TNN [25] and hybrid TNN
    across eight different soil layers on the RZSM dataset with the three test locations
    data using Nash Suttcliff coefficient of efficiency (NSE), determination coefficient
    ( R 2 ), normalized mean bias error (NMBE) and Standard deviation (SD). Significantly,
    the proposed hybrid TNN demonstrates superior performance compared to the hybrid
    GRU, LSTM-Technique, and Multi-head TNN. This is highlighted by the hybrid TNN’s
    NSE value, which is closest to 1, indicating a significantly higher relative accuracy
    in predicting RZSM. Specifically, the proposed hybrid TNN has R 2 values closer
    to 1, indicating a highly reliable prediction model. The negative NMBE values
    indicate that all the four models ([25], [32], and proposed hybrid TNN) do not
    overfit the dataset. Lower SD values in Table 2 by the proposed model suggest
    reduced uncertainty compared to the other comparison models. TABLE 2 RZSM Prediction
    Accuracy Comparison of the Proposed Hybrid TNN, Multi-Head TNN [25], Hybrid GRU
    [27], and LSTM-Technique [32] at Eight Soil Layers on the RZSM Dataset With Three
    Test Locations Data Figs. 7 (a)–(c) compares the average root mean square error
    (RMSE) over the active root zone depths from June 2020 to February 2021 at three
    test sites. Lower RMSE implies higher prediction accuracy. Fig. 7 (a) illustrates
    the RZSM prediction error for an oak tree at Alexandra Gardens, Melbourne. The
    oak tree’s active root zone lies in the 0–50 cm layer [45], [46]. Fig. 7 (b) illustrates
    the RZSM prediction error for a eucalyptus tree at Batman Park, Melbourne. Eucalyptus
    trees have shallow roots and grow up to 20–30 cm soil depth [45], [46]. Fig. 7
    (c) illustrates the RZSM prediction error for an oak tree at Fawkner Park, Melbourne.
    In Figs. 7 (a)–(c), the lowest prediction error is indicated by the proposed hybrid
    TNN in all three locations. In addition to the RMSE, the vertical error bars in
    Figs. 7 (a)–(c) illustrate the standard deviation of prediction accuracy by each
    model. The error bars indicate a less standard deviation of prediction for the
    proposed hybrid TNN compared to hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32], and Multi-head
    TNN [25]. FIGURE 7. Comparison of RMSE average over the active root zone depths
    of target tree by the Hybrid GRU [27], the LSTM-Technique [32], Multi-head TNN
    [25], and the proposed hybrid TNN for: (a) Oak Tree (0-50 cm), Alexandra Garden,
    Melbourne, (b) Eucalyptus Tree (0-30 cm), Batman Park, Melbourne, and (c) Oak
    Tree (0-50 cm), Fawkner Park, Melbourne from June 2020 to February 2021. Show
    All The lower RMSE of hybrid TNN also indicates its usability in addressing the
    performance drop in existing PI decision support systems [7] due to the RZSM estimation
    error accumulations than hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32], and Multi-head
    TNN [25]. The resource conservation efficiency evaluation of the hybrid GRU [27],
    LSTM-Technique [32], Multi-head TNN [25] and hybrid TNN-based irrigation schedules
    are conducted further in Section III-B. B. Resource Conservation Efficiency Assessment
    In this section, we present the drip irrigation simulation results of the hybrid
    GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32], Multi-head TNN [25] and proposed hybrid TNN. As
    discussed before drip irrigation is a widely adopted irrigation system for PI.
    The irrigation is simulated from June 2020 to February 2021 for three test locations.
    The water balance, water savings, and cost savings are evaluated for resource
    conservation efficiency performance comparisons between the hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique
    [32], Multi-head TNN [25] and proposed hybrid TNN. Fig. 8 illustrates the water
    balance of the drip irrigation schedules produced using the three RZSM predictions.
    Drip irrigation systems are usually designed to keep root zone moisture close
    to the optimum level by daily moisture evaluation. Irrigation will be applied
    when the root zone water depletes below 20% of the requirement [43]. The daily
    water depletion tolerance for the trees on the three sites is 13.52 mm, 9 mm,
    and 21.03 mm. FIGURE 8. Comparison of irrigation water balance by Hybrid GRU [27]
    (blue semicolon line with x marker), LSTM-Technique [32] (grey dashed line), (3)
    Multi-head TNN [25] (green line) and (4) Hybrid TNN (red line) at (a) Alexandra
    Garden, (b) Batman Park, and (c) Fawkner Park. The hybrid TNN line is closer to
    zero (most optimum irrigation) than the other models. Show All The values are
    calculated by substituting daily water requirement of the tree species from literature
    ([36], [45]) in Eq. (7). All four models, schedule irrigation to meet the plant
    water requirement post subtracting the daily water obtained from rainfall. The
    Melbourne (Olympic Park), BOM, Australia weather station data is used to schedule
    irrigation at Alexandra Gardens and Batman Park for supplementing rainfall water.
    The Hawthorn (Scotch College), BOM, Australia weather station data is used for
    Fawkner Park irrigation. The irrigation water balance by the hybrid GRU [27],
    LSTM-Technique [32], Multi-head TNN [25] and hybrid TNN irrigation scheduling
    systems is shown in Fig. 8 (a)–(c). The proximity of each model’s water balance
    graph to zero indicates higher closeness between predicted and actual irrigation
    amounts. The plant irrigation water requirement at each test site is closely met
    by the hybrid TNN compared to hybrid GRU, LSTM-Technique, and Multi-head TNN.
    Fig. 8 (a)–(c) illustrate that more irrigation water is wasted by hybrid GRU [27],
    LSTM-Technique [32], and Multi-head TNN [25] compared to the proposed hybrid TNN.
    To further quantify the water and cost saved by the proposed hybrid TNN, the irrigation
    water amount by the three competing models is compared for the three test locations.
    All three test locations use recycled water for irrigation. Table 3 shows that
    the proposed hybrid TNN conserved 60,325.04 KL, 58,860.84 KL, and 53,370.09 KL
    of water compared to hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique [32], and Multi-head TNN
    [25] respectively in total over the three test locations. Next, the irrigation
    cost calculation for all the four models is carried out through a comprehensive
    approach involving three main steps. Firstly, the irrigation water cost for each
    model is determined by multiplying the amount of water utilized by the respective
    model with the corresponding water tariff rate (referenced in the footnote of
    Table 4). Secondly, the power consumption associated with pumping irrigation water
    for each model is quantified by multiplying the energy used with the energy tariff
    rate (referenced in the footnote of Table 4). Finally, the total cost for each
    model is derived by summing both the water cost and the energy cost. Overall,
    Table 4 shows that hybrid TNN saved 21,304.11 AUD compared to hybrid GRU [27],
    19,693.49 AUD compared to LSTM-Technique [32] and 16,325.83 AUD compared to Multi-head
    TNN [25] in total cost savings over the three test locations for a duration of
    one year. TABLE 3 Total Comparative Water Savings in Kilolitre (KL) by by Hybrid
    TNN Based Irrigation Against Multi-Head TNN [25], Hybrid GRU [27] and LSTM-Technique
    [32] Across All Three Test Locations During 2020–2021 Using Recycled Water TABLE
    4 Total Comparative Cost Savings in Australian Dollar (AUD) by Hybrid TNN Based
    Irrigation Against Multi-Head TNN [25], Hybrid GRU [27] and LSTM-Technique [32]
    Across All Three Test Locations During 2020–2021 Using Recycled Water The average
    savings by hybrid TNN is 10.846% water and 10.339% cost compared to the comparison
    models. From the results in this section, it can be concluded that the proposed
    hybrid TNN attains a more precise water balance than hybrid GRU [27], LSTM-Technique
    [32], and Multi-head TNN [25], thus reducing water loss and increasing irrigation
    profitability. SECTION IV. Conclusion Irrigation traditionally complements rainfall,
    but a significant portion of rainwater is lost through deep percolation and run-off.
    Theoretical studies emphasize that water beyond the root zone is unusable for
    plants. Therefore, precision irrigation (PI) should focus on the root-zone soil
    moisture (RZSM). This paper introduces a hybrid TNN for RZSM estimation to provide
    decision support for PI. The model incorporates a dynamic MLP (D-MLP) network
    layer to select nearby soil moisture (SM) sensor locations data aligned with the
    target location. This selected data then passes through a proposed dual attention
    block and a Bayesian layer to estimate RZSM, subsequently informing irrigation
    schedules. Performance evaluation demonstrates the superior accuracy of the proposed
    model-based RZSM compared to existing state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore,
    simulation results reveal increased water and cost savings with the proposed hybrid
    TNN-based irrigation compared to the state-of-the-art competing models. Authors

    harvestingNB-IoTSDN 1. Introduction One of the most important pillars of human
    society is agriculture. According to the food and agriculture organization (FAO),
    to cater the needs of growing population, food (FAO, 2009) production need to
    be increased by 70–65 % in 2050. Farmers must put in more effort while using the
    traditional agricultural approach, which also uses resources inefficiently. Several
    issues, including population expansion, climatic circumstances, a shortage of
    resources, etc., occur from this ancient farming approach. The term smart agriculture
    refers to digital farming practices that are used to maximize effectiveness instead
    (Javaid et al., 2022) of capability. This system performs structured and optimal
    input and output analytics through smart technologies, objective-focused analysis,
    planning, and monitoring. As a result of collecting and pooling analytical data
    using advanced sensor, a methodology group is built that is optimized for achieving
    this objective-oriented analysis. For monitoring and managing agricultural operations,
    this cutting-edge technology combines Internet of Things (IoT) networks, devices,
    AI, and big data analytics. Through the use of diverse electronic, biochemical,
    and electrical sensors and actuators, various farming field data can be collected,
    and through this data, different sub-operations of farming applications can be
    developed. Using IoT to monitor crops (Sreekantha and Kavya A.M., 2017), detect
    diseases and pests, predict crop yields, robotics-based harvesting of crops, and
    much more. The creation of a wireless sensor network (WSN) can be accomplished
    using various types of wireless connections, each with a range, bandwidth, and
    topology that varies. A novel kind of wireless network can be built using topologies
    like bus, star, and mesh and a variety of communication technologies including
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, LTE-M, thread, Sigfox, etc. to communicate data from one node
    to another about the farming field. The edge gateway layer where all sensor node
    data are stored and processed for further analysis is connected to this sensor
    network. The data can be communicated to a different distributed network over
    the internet to a cloud server for additional analysis and monitoring at the user
    end by using application protocols like “Hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP),
    “Message queuing telemetry transport protocol” (MQTT), etc. The gateway can be
    utilized as single-board microcontrollers and computers similar the Raspberry
    Pi (Charania and Li, 2020). Digital transformation is the main advancement in
    agricultural development which (Baryshnikova et al., 2022) transforms 1.0 into
    5.0 in the twenty-first century. The key to advancing digital transformation in
    smart agriculture from version 5.0 to version 6.0 is the development of wireless
    communication technology. A number of wireless communication technologies, including
    “Long Range Radio (LoRa)”, Radio frequency module (RFM69)“, ”Narrow Band IoT (NB-IoT)“,
    and ”SigFox“ etc (Hidayat et al., 2020) have been utilised in agriculture. It
    is possible to create a secure smart farm system, also known as a 5G beyond Smart
    agriculture system (Tomaszewski et al., 2022) by fusing several technologies including
    IoT, Edge computing, cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and Blockchain
    (Andreadis et al., 2022, Kasera et al., 2022). The ability to manage and achieves
    a variety of computing workloads and necessities for storage can be encouraged
    by developing a hybrid or dispersed sensor network employing cloud computing and
    edge computing. In this regard, edge computing will be able to regulate jobs that
    demand speed or limitations on connectivity. In addition, cloud computing will
    be able to accommodate operations that demand higher processing capabilities,
    for instance, machine learning (MCLRN), as well as managing enormous volumes of
    data by utilizing load-balancing techniques. From this type of technologies farmers
    will be able to access farming field status remotely and the system will be entirely
    automated through interoperability between machines (Li et al., 2021). Considering
    the research strategy that was used to write this review article is discussed

    Fig. 1 denotes the simplified structure of how the review article is organized.
    Based on pre-, during-, and post-harvesting operations, the various IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture literature has been identified and categorized. After classifying
    and reading the literature, each pre-harvesting, during-harvesting, and post-harvesting
    operations’ existing subsystems have been thoroughly discussed and its weaknesses
    analyzed. This analysis has been accomplished based on the IoT-enabled technologies,
    data set gathering, and approaches that have been used in the past and it also
    includes an overall thorough assessment of the pre-, during-, and post-harvesting
    subsystem''s research gaps. Based on this research gap a modified 5G IoT-based
    smart agriculture framework has been proposed to reduce the shortcomings of the
    existing work. The Pre-harvest to post-harvest activities have been categorized
    in this article to explain the existing work for the smart farming system. The
    classification of pre- to post-harvest activities is presented in the Fig. 2.

    2. Pre-harvesting system (PHRS) Throughout the pre-harvest process, there are
    a number of land preparation (LPR) sub-activities that considerably increase agricultural
    yield. Researchers, scientists, and engineers have made a number of advancements
    in the past to create a smart PHRS using smart agriculture technology (Gaikwad
    et al., 2021), that can choose the crop in advance depending on climate conditions,
    region, area, etc. and prepare the land for production. The sub-areas of PHRS
    that are used when preparing the land for farming are depicted in Fig. 3. Download

    PHRS subsystem classification. 2.1. Crop yield prediction (CYP) IoT-based method
    for yield prediction in which sensor node data is shared with data centers (Gayatri
    et al., 2015) and made available to the sons of the soil. To anticipate agricultural
    yield, supervised MCLRN is carried out utilizing (Kumar et al., 2020) the “Random
    Forest” (RADF) and “Decision tree” (DT) algorithm. In this situation the RADF''s
    accuracy is superior compared to the DT''s. A two-tier MCLRN model called the
    “adaptive k-Nearest Centroid Neighbour Classifier (aKNCN)” and the “Extreme Learning
    Machine algorithm (ELM)” were proposed to predict crop yield. By applying ELM
    to (Gupta and Nahar, 2023) increase performance accuracy, the suggested system
    optimize the weights using a modified version of the Butterfly Optimisation Algorithm
    (mBOA). The creation of an algorithm for predicting crop yield (Bhojani and Bhatt,
    2020) three new activation functions called “DharaSig,” “DharaSigm,” and “SHBSig”
    are employed to enhance the neural network''s performance on agricultural datasets.
    K Closest neighbor procedure is employed to identify the crop that is most acceptable
    (Gajula et al., 2021). For the purpose of forecasting the yield of the sorghum
    crop, (Jayaram and Marad, 2012) a fuzzy inference approach is implemented. A fuzzy
    model''s input tools are physio-morphological features. Due to estimates and ambiguity,
    the model''s performance depends on quantum data. A method for managing massive
    data and predicting crop productivity three different types of (Fan et al., 2015)
    approaches have been employed that is MapReduce weather data for computing large
    datasets; nearest neighbor weather data for comparing distances across like years;
    and, finally, an “Autoregressive moving average” (ARMA) model for forecasting.
    To determine crop yield, a “Support vector machine” (SVM) and DT approach are
    used. While choosing (Reshma et al., 2020) features for a specific location, factors
    like soil type, temperature, humidity, groundwater level, local population, farmers''
    availability, variety of plantations, and variety of farmed land were taken into
    account. Analysis has been conducted based on these traits to determine the optimal
    crop. A mixed MCLRN approach was put forth to estimate agricultural yield. The
    most precise (Anbananthen et al., 2021) MCLRN prediction from two models is combined
    using the stacking generalization model. Cross-validation is used to evaluate
    a hybrid MCLRN model''s performance to that of other MCLRN models for evaluation.
    For the purpose of predicting agricultural yield (Sajja et al., 2021) an MCLRN
    simulation is designed, where crop segments are built up experimentally for the
    training of models using SVM, random forest, and ID3. In which case SVM outperforms
    other methods. The key advantage of the current CYP is that most systems classify
    soil nutrients and geographic data for crop yield prediction using data mining
    techniques like KNN, ID3 and fuzzy inference systems, which produce superior prediction
    outcomes. The geographic information was gathered using a GPS approach that is
    IoT-enabled. The RGB-D camera is utilized as a mobile platform to enhance the
    CYP. Crop quality, data-driven decision-making, cost reduction, and resource optimization
    are all improved by using IoT-enabled data mining approaches. The shortcomings
    of the existing techniques are as follows: prediction based on time series analysis,
    area-wise analysis, soil quality analysis, country-wise analysis, and geospatial
    analysis remain to be explored. There is no hybrid MCLRN algorithm for handling
    huge datasets. Full IoT based system still need to be worked upon. 2.2. Crop selection
    (CSL) Enhancing Agricultural Sustainability through Crowdsensing (Ginige and Sivagnanasundaram,
    2019) a mobile-based agricultural information-sharing system is developed for
    monitoring real-time farming activities (CSL LPR, “seed selection”, “seed sowing”,
    “irrigation, “crop growth”, “fertilizing”, and “harvesting”) with the help of
    a crop calendar marker. IoT-based system for crop selection and monitoring precision
    farming (Bhojwani et al., 2020) various sensors are employed to measure environmental
    variables and interface with the microprocessor. An IoT gateway using ESP8266
    sends the data acquired to a cloud server. On the basis of data collected earlier
    from the cloud server, the existing working model uses K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
    to estimate prospective predictions to be able to make precise decisions about
    what crops to grow in a particular environment. Maximize the crop yield (Kumar
    et al., 2015) for selecting which crops to cultivate over a season the MCLRN method
    predict yield rates based on environmental variables including weather, soil type,
    water density, and crop type. Smart agriculture-based crop selection analysis
    utilising (Tseng et al., 2019) big data a platform is created to track environmental
    elements on a farm and use those environmental factors to evaluate farmers'' agricultural
    practices. The findings suggest that farmers can determine a crop''s suitability
    for their land with greater insight. This is so they can take a look at things
    like soil moisture levels and temperature. The suggested environmental factor
    analysis methodology aids farmers in learning which crops they can produce. In
    order to optimize food production (Udutalapally et al., 2021) an innovative agricultural
    solution is proposed that uses AI and IoT for selecting crops, disease monitoring,
    and automated irrigation systems. The fuzzy MULTIMOORA technology on (Balezentiene
    et al., 2013) language and numerical reasoning is provided as a fuzzy-based system
    for crop selection in Lithuanian climatic conditions. “Johnson''s reduct” classifier
    method is used (Deepa and Ganesan, 2019) to produce classification rules for three
    crops, including rice, “groundnut”, and “sugarcane”, in a decision-based system
    for crop selection. According to present environmental (Bakthavatchalam et al.,
    2022) circumstances a system has been established for precision agriculture that
    uses IoT and classifier-based MCLRN algorithms to recommend the crop for irrigation
    and acquire the highest yield. AI for characterization and forecasting the (Amkor
    and El Barbri, 2023) results of potato samples cultivated with “Nitrogen”, “Phosphorus”,
    “Potassium” (NPK) fertilizers has been suggested in which KNNs are used for classification
    and nonlinear autoregressive models for prediction. Machine learning and artificial
    intelligence advancements for the existing CSL system improve the decision-making
    for planting crops according to climate conditions and location. By using IoT-enabled
    solar power-based crop recommendation systems, energy consumption is reduced.
    Genetic optimization is the most common method for optimizing CSL performance.
    Crop guidance is improved when weather conditions are forecasted through the development
    of a crop calendar-based system. Some of the shortcomings may be as follows: the
    current CSL solution lacks self-sustainability, testing for additional crops,
    security of sensor node data, system optimization, and subsystem integration.
    2.3. Seed selection (SSL) A tillage drip architecture is used for recommending
    seeds for (Indira et al., 2018) planting. Additionally, it discusses how effective
    seed selection based on soil can produce precise results. Seed selection is possible
    in the first phase, automatic watering is covered in the second phase, and plant
    disease diagnosis is covered in the third phase. A computer vision to identify
    (Koklu and Ozkan, 2020) different dry bean seed kinds the user interface was created
    using MATLAB, and 13,611 grains of seven different types of dry beans were photographed.
    The model has undergone 20-fold cross-validation and has been constructed using
    a variety of MCLRN classification methods, including MLP, SVM, KNN, and DT. When
    compared to other classification model results, SVM performance performed better.
    Deep-learning methods for seed classification were proposed in which fourteen
    (Hamid et al., 2022) different types of seeds were gathered and pre-trained using
    “MobileNetV2″ to create a model. The trained model claimed accuracy of 98 % on
    the training set and 95 % on the test set after rigorous experiments, extensive
    pre-processing, and fine-tuning. The advantage of the current SSL system is that
    it chooses the appropriate seeds for individual fields using a computer vision-based
    method based on MCLRN and AI. Water, insecticides, and fertilisers may all be
    used more efficiently by farmers. This has good effects on the environment in
    addition to lowering costs. The existing work lacks a fully automated system and
    limited use of data. Need more research for various types of seed classification
    based on climate condition, geographical region wise, and land wise. 2.4. Seed
    germination (SGM) Proposed and created a smart germination assistance (SGA) system
    for SGM. “Temperature”, “humidity”, “light intensity”, “moisture”, and soil “pH”
    are all factors that (Islam et al., 2019) affect SGM. Using particular sensors,
    the system continuously measures the values of various factors in the surrounding
    environment. Each sensor reading from a different seed is kept and connected to
    an ideal value. Using a low-power embedded system (Shadrin et al., 2019) an AI
    method is proposed that can recognise SGM dynamics without necessitating heavy
    data transfer between nearby nodes. 97 % accuracy is attained with a “convolutional
    neural networks” (CNNs) model for seed recognition. A system based on the IoT
    was proposed to monitor, manage, and (Theparod and Harnsoongnoen, 2022) collect
    data regarding the effects of narrow-band light emitting diodes (LEDs) on sunflower
    nodes. With the help of “narrow-band LEDs” and dynamic germination, it was found
    through research that the germination of sunflower seeds was more successful in
    the red-light zones. IoT-based study is carried out for indoor tomato SGM (Seyar
    and Ahamed, 2023) systems at thresholds. Where transplanted seedlings were grown
    outdoors with a comparison of two irrigation systems using soil water balance
    methods with a long-range LoRa communication system, and the subsurface drip irrigation
    system produced the highest seedling levels of growth based on agronomical parameters
    at a 12 % threshold. A feature of the current SGM system is the usage of a LoRa-based
    data communication system for various modules during the SGM process, such as
    irrigation and seed growing status. For the dynamic seed germination process,
    the usage of IoT-based “narrow-band LEDs” produces better results. The system
    in place uses only one type of seed for testing, and it is not entirely IoT-based.
    As a result, there is a lack of a fully validated testbed system that uses an
    ideal sensor, is self-sustaining, and can be utilised for other crops. The current
    system still has flaws as it does not deal with plant biomass growth, flowering,
    fruits, and other types of crops utilising IoT-based technique and image processing
    algorithm. 2.5. Drought or flood monitoring (DFM) A “WPART” IoT-enabled smart
    farming system is established that uses MCLRN (Rezk et al., 2021) to anticipate
    crop productivity and drought for informed decision-making. The following data
    factors are used to pick features: year, month, rainfall, temperature, air pressure,
    season, crop, “area”, “production”, and productivity. An IoT-based tackle has
    been put up for agricultural drought (Ping, 2014) data transmission and accumulating.
    The outcome shows that the system''s data capture and transmission performance
    is flawless, and it has good application value for gathering and analysing agricultural
    drought data. An MCLRN/IoT-based flood tracking system is portrayed (Rani et al.,
    2020) to gauge the water level in a flood-prone site. The intensity of floods
    is gauged using raindrop and water sensors. An IoT-based dam water monitoring
    alerting system is developed (Ganesh et al., 2022) for calculating how much rain
    fell, one may determine how much water will be released from the dam. The signal
    is analysed and judgements are made using the Arduino UNO. IoT data collection
    in real-time and MCLRN analysis and drought result prediction are two benefits
    of the current DFM. For obtaining and analysing data on agricultural drought,
    the gearbox performance is faultless, and it has strong application value. Absence
    of a long-term analysis based on previously established value and absence of coverage
    based on humidity and rainfall across a vast area were observed. There is lack
    of long-distance data connection methods in remote fields. The absence of dark
    shadow detection in the current technology makes it difficult to detect noisy
    pixels values in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for flooded regions, which can
    lead to erroneous data. 2.6. Soil testing and measurement (STM) The optical transducer
    is used as a detecting sensor. This sensor (Goswami et al., 2020) comprises of
    three LEDs as a light source and an as “Light detector” (LDR) for assessing the
    results of soil tests performed on four distinct types of soils. Each nutrient''s
    threshold values divide its level into three voltage levels: Low, Mid, and High.
    A technique for monitoring soil health utilising four dynamic parameters was developed.
    In which the (Ramson et al., 2021) effectiveness of a network made up of nine
    soil health monitoring units was tested over the course of several weeks in an
    agricultural field site. Soil sensing, wireless range, power consumption, life
    expectancy, and implementation cost were all evaluated. An IoT-powered soil health
    tracking (Sengupta et al., 2021) approach that can manage agricultural parameters
    has been created. The variations in stimuli, including those related to light,
    heat, sound, motion, magnetic fields, etc., are converted into electrical signals
    by a sensor node and then processed and graphically displayed by the Thingspeak
    cloud server. Using cellphones or personal computers, a methodology is proposed
    for sensing (Saikia and Khatoon, 2022) the percentage of wetness of the soil and
    temperature remotely and continuously. Raspberry Pi-based soil nutrient monitoring
    system for tomato plantations is proposed using various soil sensors (Manickam,
    2020) such as PH and Soil NPK sensors for monitoring the soil continuously. The
    present STM''s strongest point is its use of an IoT-enabled method to assess soil
    health. Thanks to the existing technology that farmers can precisely administer
    fertilisers, insecticides, and water based on the soil''s nutrients, PH, and type,
    crop disease is reduced, and crop yields are increased. There are still lack of
    sensor assessment based on a specified period, in-depth data analysis, additional
    parameters for optimising soil testing in various existing activities etc. There
    is a demand for an affordable, universal solution that can be used to all kinds
    of farms. 2.7. Weather prediction & monitoring (WPM) An agro weather station (AWS)
    that is intended for farmers and researchers is (Faid et al., 2021) develop using
    four layers: perception, transmission, presentation, and administration. For various
    end users, it offers frequently data and AI-based insights. IoT-based intelligent
    energy-efficient approaches have been originated for monitoring and managing greenhouse
    interior temperatures. Many (Subahi and Bouazza, 2020) simulations utilizing a
    greenhouse temperature transfer function are run to show the usefulness of the
    recommended strategy. For temperature and irrigation control a computerized procedure
    is acquired. Using an Android app that connects (Kori et al., 2021) to the controller,
    many agricultural parameters, including as temperature, humidity, soil wetness,
    and rainfall, are tracked and visualised. A strategy to schedule weather forecasts
    was put out in order to foresee (Li et al., 2019) adoption of weather prediction
    information as well as future energy harvesting values based on historical harvesting
    values. A low-cost solar-powered (Devapal, 2020) soil and weather analysis system
    has been offered that looks at different soil properties and weather patterns
    to set up a high-tech smart farm for farmers. IoT, data mining, and android mobile
    applications are all used in the system''s development. Integrating a provincial
    weather station with dual modules to serve as a LoRa-based soil sensor node (Singh
    et al., 2022) for scrutinizing the state of the soil and the weather. During experiment,
    a LoRa portable communication device and an IoT cloud are used to transmit meteorological
    data. Constructed, and tested a flexible (El-magrous et al., 2019) meteorological-soil
    sensor station for acquiring site-specific maps of soil elements, atmospheric
    information, and yield information for the 2018 soybeans season of cultivation.
    Farmers were able to make well-informed decisions on soil selection, irrigation,
    planting, and harvesting thanks to the use of sophisticated tools for weather
    forecasting and data from already-existing systems. The existing weather monitoring
    and forecasting systems have a number of drawbacks, including the absence of AI
    fault detection approaches, a lack of integration with the existing IoT-based
    agriculture system, and a lack of optimize long-range communication technologies.
    There is a need for an intelligent weather system that can identify the soil''s
    nutritional needs and suggest a suitable crop. 2.8. Soil digging (SDG) To enhance
    tillage processes more significant by fusing IoT, “cloud computing”, and “Decision
    support system” (DESS) technologies (Fawzi et al., 2021) the ”Tillage Operations
    Quality Optimization (TOQO)“ model is constructed using two levels: ”Tillage Depth
    1 (TD1)“ and ”Tillage Depth 2 (TD2)“. TD1 = 10–15 cm and TD2 = 25–30 cm. The TOQO
    standard''s tested results improve long-term evolution for the agribusiness by
    maximizing farmer expenditures, accelerating field productivity, and optimizing
    tillage routines. Real-time monitoring of soil-digging machinery, which enables
    farmers to optimise the depth and spacing of rows or holes, is a strength of the
    current system. This accuracy supports resource utilisation that is efficient
    and minimises reductions in waste. Due to the significant differences in soil
    properties, such as moisture content and hardness, the current system needs to
    be improved in terms of performance, affordability, and sensor calibration. Analysis
    to reduce the environmental impact of soil tilling is still lacking in the system.
    More accurate measurements may be possible by the use of the cutting-edge MCLRN
    algorithm. The average growth rate of research publications published between
    2012 and 2023 for PHRS applications that are based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other
    techniques is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (193KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 4. Publication growth rate analysis of PHRS application
    based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. The growth
    rate of publication has been assessed based on the quantity of articles published
    in a given year for a specific PHRS application, such as CYP, CSL, SSL, SGM, DFM,
    STM, WPM, and SDG, and the average growth rate analysis has been assessed based
    on the overall quantity of publications for PHRS application year-wise. As observed
    in Fig. 4 graph, a growing number of publications based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and
    other approaches for PHRS application are made each year, with a high percentage
    of IoT-based PHRS applications. Thus, it can be concluded that the number of PHRS-based
    smart agriculture applications is growing steadily as a result of the convergence
    of IoT, edge, cloud, and AI technologies. 3. During harvesting system (DHRS) After
    preparing the land for the cultivation of crops, there are numerous sub-operations
    engaged during harvesting. The subsystem of the DHRS is shown in Fig. 5. Using
    cutting-edge technologies to automate crop monitoring and irrigation (IoT, MCLRN,
    Data Mining, etc.). It not only emphasises the value of improved production but
    also strongly emphasises data analytics and environmental sustainability. This
    is done to assess the needs and anticipate the compatibility of crops and fertilisers
    in light of the soil and environment. Download : Download high-res image (261KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. DHRS subsystem classification. A wireless
    sensor network is essential for the implementation of smart agriculture (Haseeb
    et al., 2020). There are numerously IoT-enabled prior related work that has been
    done (Ahmed et al., 2018, Anagha et al., 2023, Sah Tyagi et al., 2021) in the
    domain of during the harvesting process. 3.1. Smart irrigation (SIR) Low-cost
    intelligent smart irrigation system using IoT is proposed in three modules. Combined
    (Nawandar and Satpute, 2019) sensor module, irrigation module, and sensor communication
    module. The combined sensor module is used to access crop, plantation, and soil-related
    information. After accessing sensor monitoring data it uses a neural network model
    to make an intelligent decision. These decisions are sent to an irrigation module
    and sensor communication module. The aforementioned data determines whether the
    water machine has to be turned on or off in a certain location. The system keeps
    track of incoming data, and the sensor communication module logs it via the MQTT
    broker. The “AtMega 328” microcontroller and (Saraf and Gawali, 2017) Zigbee communications
    are used to monitor and control sensor data in the existing work. Each field''s
    central node stores sensor data in the cloud database. The report on automatic
    irrigation is delivered to a user via an Android application. An intelligent irrigation
    (Alomar and Alazzam, 2018) system is achieved using IoT and fuzzy logic. As environmental
    variables, air climate and humidity sensors, soil wetness sensors, and light intensity
    sensors are used. By utilizing all the sensor information, a Mamdani fuzzy controller
    controls the flow of water. IoT, a DPLRN, and fuzzy computation are combined to
    form an ecosystem for creating a self-sustaining irrigation system. Soil wetness,
    atmospheric (P. Patel et al., 2022) variables, and the state of crops are all
    input variables in this operational simulation. Leveraging the Raspberry Pi, a
    device called an IoT gateway allows for uploading data to the cloud. To estimate
    if a crop is healthy or slumping, an assortment of DPLRN algorithms are used.
    In order to determine the appropriate time to irrigate the crops, all measured
    input variables are analyzed with a fuzzy logic controller. RFID and sensors to
    establish an efficient farm tracking framework exploiting (Saha et al., 2022)
    “Long range wide area network” (LoRaWAN) protocol with six distinct harvesting
    issues, prohibiting fungal attacks on crops, screening cattle, appropriate watering,
    accurate soil wellness inspection, accurate inspection of crops, and enhancing
    productivity. It maintains appropriate irrigation while conserving water by using
    incredibly effective temperature and humidity sensors. Four distinct categories
    of sensors are used in the soil and crop wellness tracking system to gauge the
    “NDVI” readings of the crops, the “pH” rating of the soil, the percentage of nutrients
    that are contained in the soil, the soil''s compaction, and the amount of water
    in the soil. Cowlar is used by the cattle monitoring system to continuously check
    on the health of the cows. Smart farm decision-making powered by IoT and the cloud
    system that has been designed in order to communicate sensor (Lova Raju and Vijayaraghavan,
    2022) data using “NRF24L01” modules. A suitable irrigation is schedule in which
    the author, without (Sayanthan et al., 2018) the assistance of labour, employed
    an Arduino soil moisture analyzer to measure water requirements at various phases
    of eggplant growth. Using an “Arduino Uno R3” board and an “Arduino DUE”, the
    (Jamroen et al., 2020) intelligent irrigation system is scheduled. For data connectivity,
    the “NRF24L01” module is intended. The current method guards against crop water
    stress situations using a fuzzy inference system. The MCLRN-enabled autonomous
    watering mechanism has been constructed. The raspberry pi and (Vij et al., 2020)
    Arduino mega are two different types of microcontrollers employs in this method.
    The Arduino Mega is equipped with a number of sensors. Arduino Mega sends sensor
    data to Raspberry Pi through the wifi module. Weather data will be retrieved using
    an open-source Application programing interface (API), and a raspberry pi will
    operate to alert a system using weather data and sensor node data. A soil type''s
    propensity for irrigation is predicted using MCLRN. A way to regulating irrigation
    (Mohammed et al., 2023) systems using DPLRN that takes into account the moisture
    and soil structure. In their methodology, soil pictures and moisture sensors are
    used to gather data, which is then processed using real-time videos to determine
    the crop''s need for irrigation and moisture levels. A “VGG-19” model analyses
    the type of image and crop seeded to predict irrigation needs. “TensorFlow” lite
    is used to run experiments on cheap computational hardware and test the proposed
    model on a private dataset. A remote irrigation water pump monitoring, management,
    and (Kirar, 2022) security is developed. The sensors used in this work to detect
    supply voltage and motor current to estimate operating conditions and offer protection.
    The user receives the measured parameters via the SIM900 GSM component regarding
    the intent of remote oversight and management. The Android application was created
    with a better user interface, timer-based functionality, notifications for feedback
    and pump status, among other features. An ATmega 328P microprocessor that is included
    into the Arduino Uno board protects the pump. To track agricultural factors like
    temperature and relative humidity (Hamouda and Elhabil, 2017) a greenhouse smart
    management mechanism is suggested. The watering and cooling of greenhouses are
    managed and controlled automatically by the system. An intelligent system is created
    to track and control several subsystems, including irrigation, (Cecchetti and
    Ruscelli, 2022) lighting, heating, and solar. To enable sensor data to be connected
    to the farm Ethernet network, RS485 bus Ethernet convertor is employed. Automation
    of the heating system, irrigation system, circulation pump, and solenoid valve
    are accomplished using a relay board coupled to a Raspberry Pi 4 microcontroller,
    which is controlled using the HTTP. PHP scripts handle the system''s overall business
    logic. A connected device WSN is created using the “SIXFAB” module (Kiani and
    Seyyedabbasi, 2018) to irrigate crops in agricultural fields, and the Arduino
    component of the module transmits data to a Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway. One
    of the strengths of the existing SIR system is its use of WSNs and machine learning
    techniques for monitoring and scheduling irrigation of crops for large and small
    farming fields by collecting wet and dry soil data according to the climate and
    soil condition, which ensures crops are irrigated at the right time and irrigation
    systems optimize crop growth. There should be irrigation and crop-specific field
    monitoring, which are weaknesses of the current approaches. The current system
    relies on a single kind of irrigation for a variety of crops. There are lackings
    of self-sustaining system and sensor calibration system. Based on the soil nutrients,
    moisture, temperature, and humidity, more data analysis needs to be done. Heuristic
    techniques for improving irrigation and minimising water use are still lacking.
    To prevent water waste for different crops, the water irrigation system can be
    scheduled or rain harvesting strategies need to be used. Transparency of sensor
    data is lacking. The current process is unable to communicate with another system.
    The system''s performance can be enhanced by using simple cryptographic techniques
    to safeguard data flowing from all the sensors. Communication over long distances
    for data is still unpredictable. 3.2. Soil health monitoring and fertilizer management
    (SHMFM) A methodical approach that accumulates instantaneous data from the farm
    site, such as light strength, wetness of the soil, surface temperature, humidity,
    etc was proposed to provide local access (Bachuwar et al., 2018) to soil temperature,
    humidity, soil wetness, and light intensity, an ESP826612E transmits sensor data
    over a Wi-Fi network using the “IEEE 802.11” protocol. A method to produce data
    sources made up of temperature, humidity, and N, P, and K nutrient content (Rahman
    et al., 2019) that are produced from soil data sensor readings. In order to create
    a soil fertility data warehouse, sensor data is uploaded using IoT technologies.
    By combining Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and Light Emitting Diodes (LED) in
    a novel NPK sensor (G et al., 2020) an IoT-based system took into account. To
    determine whether N, P, and K deficiencies exist in the soil chosen for testing,
    the Mamdani inference procedure is used. At regular intervals, the farmer is alerted
    to the quantity of fertilizer to be applied. A technique that (Postolache et al.,
    2022) can aid in the evaluation of changes in soil nutrients for more effective
    administration of drainage and fertiliser control. The appliance may gather information
    on the amount of NPK in the soil, further information on soil temperature, conductivity,
    pH, and moisture. A solar fertigation control mechanism for watering using a hybrid
    model and forecasting control (Ahmad et al., 2022) is built on a weather-based
    system accompanied by a crop a repository controlled by real-time sensors that
    keep track of the water condition of the plants as well as the soil moisture and
    water quality. The continuous gauging system for evaluating the water in the soil
    and nutrients for citrus (Zhang et al., 2017) moisture and nutrient status in
    citrus orchards, so that fruit farmers can understand their orchard''s condition
    in time and adjust fertilization and irrigation strategies according to the data.
    To make it simpler for farmers to plant citrus seeds, (Pratama et al., 2021) an
    IoT-enabled gadget that indicates the soil''s nutrients for citrus seedlings using
    a “NPK” indicators and feeds the outcomes to the Thingspeak cloud. A soil wetness
    monitoring system was developed using LoRaWAN detectors with (Hossain et al.,
    2022) blended transmission modules, no in-field root stations or routers, and
    an unmanned aircraft system (UAS)-based mobile router to retrieve the gauges of
    soil wetness taken from buried indicators for a variety of crops. A continuous
    measurement system is proposed for soil nutrition content using an automated fertilizer
    unit for (Visvesvaran et al., 2021) greenhouse systems. The fertilizer system
    automatically provides the plants with the nutrients required once the measurement
    value reduces under the trigger value. The NodeMSU is utilized throughout the
    system for data communication. The performance of the LoRaWAN network beats that
    of the current system for long-distance data transmission, and the “Mamdani inference”
    optimization method based on IoT fuzzy logic yields the best results for measuring
    soil health. From the discussion above, it can be seen that the current system
    has some drawbacks, such as a lack of standardisation due to the fact that different
    soil sensors use different data formats and protocols to collect data. Due to
    the dependence of soil temperature on climate, sensor calibration is still lacking.
    To better manage soil surface and fertilisation, the current system has to be
    optimized. 3.3. Disease detection and analysis (DDAN) For autonomously identifying
    and categorising plant diseases from leaf photos, a DPLRN algorithm is suggested.
    Using the collected images, (Sladojevic et al., 2016) CNNs are trained and validated
    along with fine-tuning. A convolutional neural network model with squeeze net
    architecture is utilised (Hidayatuloh et al., 2018) to distinguish between healthy
    and diseased tomato plant leaves. There are four steps to creating a DPLRN based
    (Andrianto et al., 2020) smartphone application for spotting rice plant diseases.
    These are creating a system architecture for plant disease detection, creating
    a cloud server application and a smartphone application, testing the smartphone
    application, and assessing the system''s performance. The MLP simulation of plant
    diseases, which acquires information as 10 characteristics and 4139 data points,
    was put forward as a real-time (Kumar et al., 2021) detection method. The four
    common forms of disorders are accurately detected by the neural network. An app
    for cellphones that makes use of deep convolutional neural networks to (Pallagani
    et al., 2019) anticipate crop diseases. A total of 38 different diseases have
    been predicted by the app. Farmers everywhere can make use of it even without
    an internet connection. Controlling a pandemic illness with an IoT-based gauge
    is a crucial agricultural (Khattab et al., 2019) application. The system architecture
    can forecast a variety of plant diseases, and the model has been put to the test
    on tomato and potato crops in lab settings. An electronic method designed to communicate
    with mobile phones (Nagasubramanian et al., 2021) to manipulate disease classification,
    environmental objects, and farmer suggestions. MCLRN algorithms, SVMs, and CNNs
    are used to develop the farming suggestion. A leaf detection analysis is put forward
    using (Thorat et al., 2017) an assortment of sensors, such as temperature and
    soil moisture meters, etc. After processing, the leaf image is collected and uploaded
    to the server. The status of the leaf disease is also communicated to the farmer
    via the mobile app. Using “MDFC-ResNet” and DPLRN-based IoT (Hu et al., 2020)
    devices, a crop diagnosis of illnesses IoT system for several crop types is being
    developed. A publicly accessible collection of 54,306 pictures of ailing and healthy
    plant leaves has been assembled (Mohanty et al., 2016) in which a deep CNNs was
    utilised to identify 14 crop types and 26 illnesses from this controlled sample.
    An IoT-based system that uses MCLRN to deliver conveniently (Truong et al., 2017)
    available real-time local environmental data in rural crop fields. With the method,
    it is possible to both identify fungal illnesses and forecast their potential
    spread among crop fields. A “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based technique for
    plant disease identification is designed. Once the model has been trained using
    (Adeola et al., 2022) MCLRN methods, it is transformed into a lightweight model
    with a kilobyte (KB) size that can be placed into devices with external memory.
    Tensorflow lite is used to perform the model conversion with the already installed
    library. The existing method''s strength is its effectiveness in locating the
    illness at the plant''s root system using information on the soil and environment
    of a given region. The performance of the “Tiny Machine Learning” (TinyMl)-based
    technique to identify the kind of sickness was superior to that of existing DPLRN
    systems. For gathering a vast number of statistics on various plants and climatic
    circumstances, the aforementioned existing method still has several shortcomings.
    Lack of ability to detect and control various diseases. To identify plant diseases,
    several existing systems used CNN-based DPLRN algorithms, but the algorithm performance
    still has to be optimized in terms of accuracy, usefulness and real time plant
    disease analysis. 3.4. Pathogens detection (PDT) Biosensors possessed the ability
    to develop into the forefront of diagnostic techniques for various fields of biological
    studies, which comprises immediate assessment of human blood (Sonu and Chaudhary,
    2022) ingredients for both animal and plant infection recognition, environmental
    surveillance, and airborne pathogen identification. As a result variety of techniques
    for detection of (R. Patel et al., 2022) plant pathogens and mechanisms of biosensing
    systems have been examined, whose two main categories of conventional analytical
    methods for the detection of plant diseases are the “Digital droplet polymerase
    chain reaction” and the “Quantum dots-based biosensor”. The exploration of techniques
    for agricultural disease detection is the overall strength of the present work.
    The analysis illustrates the benefits of miniaturized sensors in terms of convenience
    in production; affordability, speed of reaction, and responsiveness, establishing
    those instruments useful for observations in the field. In terms of high levels
    of automation, the work currently being done for pathogen detection still has
    a research gap. It is lacking sensor standardisation. It is necessary to improve
    the methods for detecting various pathogen types, sensor calibration, dataset
    gathering, and technology integration. A cheap sensor needs to be deployed in
    the creation of an affordable, eco-friendly system. Due to the need for further
    optimisation of IoT-enabled systems, there is still a gap in field testing. 3.5.
    Pest controlling (PCN) IoT and CNN-based insect recognition techniques are combined
    in a system. The technology is (Ramalingam et al., 2020) utilized by pest management
    businesses to keep an eye on pests in a variety of settings, including food storage
    areas, hospitals, gardens, etc. Using the IoT for crop monitoring and pest control
    (Tian et al., 2021) an infrastructure for simultaneous and collaborative simulation
    strategy has been provided. Based on the results, the applied simulation with
    IoT assistance system is the most efficient and accurate solution. An artificial
    IoT and DPLRN (Chen et al., 2020) technology can be used to analyze crop growth
    and predict pest occurrences in an environment. A neural network algorithm called
    “You Only Look Once (YOLO)” is used to identify pests in images. A system for
    the detection and control of pests embedded in an embedded environment is proposed
    in which (Vijayalakshmi et al., 2019) if the acceptable limit gets surpassed in
    terms of both temperature and humidity, then the “raspberry pi” captures the image
    of the plant and compares it to the database, and if pests are found, the farmers
    are notified to fertilize. A “Multi-Agent System (MAS)” by deploying a (Debauche
    et al., 2020) Docker environment orchestrated by “Kubernetes” in the Edge AI-IoT
    architecture is constructed. The system utilizes an AI algorithm to identify plant
    diseases and pests and uses an irrigation pivot to treat the crop. The positive
    aspects of MCLRN algorithms like KNN and the (Materne and Inoue, 2018) linear
    regression framework are used to construct a prediction model in a plantation
    to forecast disease and insect outbreaks. The upside of already-existing systems
    is that building a decentralized and accordance simulation structure with the
    IoT for pest control and crop monitoring in combination to increase crop yields,
    lessens the load on one GPU, and contributes to the operation evenly and concurrently
    with all accessible GPUs and perceives data. Based on the usefulness of data,
    the current pest management method still has a gap. For a robotic technique based
    on DPLRN to detect different kinds of insects and rodents, the current solution
    still has to be improved. Due to various data formats and IoT protocols, there
    are still issues when integrating the current system with another system. The
    amount of manual field monitoring by farmers can be decreased, for example, by
    merging deep irrigation systems with current pest management techniques. By including
    preprocessing to normalise the image before the prediction to minimise the effects
    of photo exposure (varying light intensity in outdoor situations), plant disease
    and pest detection can be enhanced. IoT-based security and privacy of sent data
    still require improvement. 3.6. Weed detection (WDT) Robotic weed control that
    uses MCLRN and IoT to detect weeds in onion fields and (Arakeri et al., 2017)
    spray them with the required herbicide. Installing a weed detecting system in
    a chilli (Islam et al., 2021) field using RADF, KNN, and SVM, among other MCLRN
    and image processing algorithms. Systems were built using MATLAB. In order to
    identify weeds in soybean crops (Razfar et al., 2022) a DPLRN based vision-based
    weed identification system is prepared. Three unique CNNs models and MobileNetV2
    are employed in the five-layer DPLRN architecture. In order to increase agricultural
    productivity (Dasgupta et al., 2020) a concept is suggested by utilizing wireless
    sensor networks and AI models for crop forecast and weed identification. In this
    approach, MCLRN is used to create a model after data are collected from sensors
    via WSN. CNN is used in conjunction with this to detect marijuana in drone-taken
    photo. An algorithm is designed based on CNNs to identify and (Jabir and Falih,
    2022) locate weeds in wheat harvests in the region of Beni Mellal-Khenifra, Morocco,
    using an intelligent system. The YOLO model is used to construct a real-time detection
    and identification model on the Raspberry Pi. A network is established for detecting
    weeds (Kulkarni and Angadi, 2019) using a CNN. The CNN is constructed as a pooling
    layer, and the activation function is a “ReLU”. A remote-controlled robot based
    on a Raspberry (Dankhara et al., 2019) Pi is used to detect weed using an image
    processing technique. A model has been formed for precision (Karthikeyan et al.,
    2021) agriculture based on K-means clustering to classify weed plants. A “CNN”
    technique associated with IoT is used for image processing. When compared to another
    neural network technique, the performance of a WSN employing a Raspberry-based
    system with the DPLRN approach is superior. More accurate results were obtained.
    The above-discussed existing work has flaws based on real-time mobile application
    monitoring of weed detection; more parameters can be added to make the DPLRN model
    performance optimised so that real-time weed can be detected accurately; and analysis
    of weed mapping method still has a gap where more research can be carried out.
    Improvements still need to be made to real-time UAV-based technique optimisation.
    The existing system does not incorporate the integration of various environmental
    sensors, actuators, or feedback controllers for monitoring. More research is still
    needed to develop a custom deep learning algorithm that can identify different
    weed types based on plants. 3.7. Crop losses (CLO) To gain an adequate understanding
    of crop health, an apparatus has been (Shafi et al., 2020) put together that combines
    multi-modal data from the IoT nodes and drone photos. The fused data was subjected
    to MCLRN and DPLRN algorithms for crop health classification and creating health
    maps. Data from the sensor nodes is transmitted via a LoRa module. The system
    is intended to design, develop, and test a next generation of automated (Pérez-Ruiz
    et al., 2015) and robotic systems for efficient pest management in agriculture
    and forestry operations using a real-time kinematics (RTK) and “Global positioning
    system” (GPS) controlled autonomous tractor for straight-line tracking. A drone-based
    system is designed in which a “Raspberry Pi” module is integrated (Saha et al.,
    2018) with an array of 64 separate temperature sensors over 12C, an RGB-D camera
    for taking real-time photos, and a GPS navigation module. The cloud server receives
    and stores all sensor data. A system that makes use of multiple sensors to assess
    the temperature, humidity, pH level and scent of the leaves is compared and examined
    (Giri Babu and Anjan Babu, 2020) to check if the gathered leaf values fall within
    the range specified in the actual dataset for tracking crop health. Using IoT
    and remote sensing (Shukla et al., 2021) a method is proposed for agricultural
    health monitoring. To identify healthy crops, IOT-connected UAVs and MCLRN are
    used. Prescription maps are important because they make use of resources like
    pesticides, water, and fertilizers. Farmers are able to decide what resources
    are necessary to ensure that crops are healthy at every stage of growth. An IoT
    platform is constructed that uses image processing and a classifier algorithm
    to detect plant illnesses. If an (Ayalew et al., 2022) automatic medicine system
    identifies ailments, a sprinkler sprays medication. Additionally, disease transmission
    is tracked based on changes in weather using soil humidity and temperature sensors.
    An automated decision-making (Grimblatt et al., 2021) tools and metrics that track
    plant development and health, which have an immediate and measurable effect on
    farmers'' ability to produce crops. Experiments are carried out using two separate
    sensors, soil moisture and temperature, to ascertain the significance of each
    parameter as the foundation for plant growth. An agricultural production system
    simulation is designed (Matsumoto et al., 2017) to carry out intricate business-based
    assessments of the abundance of inventories and crop destruction brought on by
    an absence of knowledge about the quantity of food acquired, the number of unit
    crops, and the enlargement of cultivated fields. IoT-Edge module (Park and Kim,
    2021) collects strawberry hydroponic environment data and strawberry photos, allowing
    for monitoring and determining strawberry harvest time. Utilizing a Wide-area
    inexpensively network (LPWAN) based on the “NB-IoT” (Chang et al., 2018) a smart
    lighting system is developed for greenhouses of expensive crops. Using the temperature,
    humidity, and methane gas sensors MQ4, LDR, and DHT11 (Mahfuz et al., 2020) an
    embedded system is established based on microcontrollers. Its purpose is to keep
    track of the atmosphere all over the greenhouse. In the event that any sensor
    value is outside of its acceptable range, the Arduino will send the user a notification
    SMS using a SIM 900 GSM modem. Through the Android app, a new threshold value
    is also configured. The performance of the smart monitoring of healthy crops is
    outperformed by the IoT that utilises drone and hybrid MCLRN to detect healthy
    crops in the growing environment. The data is transmitted quickly and cheaply
    between the edge and the cloud using an LPWAN based on the “NB-IoT”. It has been
    determined through research of the already-existing system previously described
    that there is still a gap in monitoring and controlling the crop from numerous
    losses. The current system is missing data processing steps and robotic sensors
    with intelligence that can detect different soil parameters, such as soil PH,
    soil water levels, and other characteristics. The ability for mobile-based applications
    to provide the end user with real-time access to farming field information from
    any location still needs refinement. For example, alerts for watering plants,
    temperature control notifications, and disease detection alarms based on the disease
    types and how this disease might be controlled. The examination of extensive data
    based on various crop types is still lacking. Because of climatic circumstances,
    dissimilar data formats, and dissimilar communication protocols, the system is
    not self-sustaining; it is dependent on a certain region and environmental condition.
    It is also unable to integrate with another subsystem. Fig. 6 exhibits the average
    annual growth rate of papers on research produced throughout 2012 and 2023 for
    DHRS implementations based on IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other procedures. Download :

    growth rate analysis of DHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN and other
    methodology from 2012 to 2023. According to Fig. 6, the DHRS application research
    publication growth rate analysis has been conducted similarly to that of the PHRS
    application research publication growth rate analysis. The DHRS publishing analysis
    graph shows an increase in the number of research published articles year over
    year. Comparing IoT-based DHRS applications to AI, MCLRN, and other techniques,
    the publishing growth rate was higher between 2019 and 2022. This is because more
    research is being done on SIR, DDAN, and CLO-based applications. In comparison
    to the period from 2012 to 2018, the average annual growth rate of publications
    for SIR-based applications between 2019 and 2022 has been calculated to be 69.23
    %. In contrast, between 2019 and 2022, the average growth rates for CLO and DDAN,
    respectively, were 53.26 % and 63.98 %. It is therefore possible to predict that
    there will be an increase in the number of research publications using IoT and
    AI-based approaches for developing DHRS applications. 4. Post harvesting system
    (POHRS) When preparing the ground for agricultural cultivation, farmers that practice
    traditional farming face a number of challenges. These challenges were brought
    on by the rising demand for agricultural production, and it is not simple to match
    this rising demand for food processing, storage, and supply. The Fig. 7 shows
    the post-harvesting subsystem in which various existing research work has been
    done based on storage, harvesting cycle, supply chain, food processing, etc. (Abouelsaad
    et al., 2022). Download : Download high-res image (213KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 7. POHRS subsystem classification. The post-harvest physiology
    and management of fruits and vegetables are covered in this area, along with topics
    like harvesting, handling, packaging, storage, hygienic practises, transportation,
    crop waste, etc. In the context of severe weather, it also covered postharvest
    handling. 4.1. Reaping, sorting, cooling, and storage (RSCS) An agricultural robot
    design is incorporated that would use “Autodesk Fusion 360″ (Sazid et al., 2022)
    and ”Webots Simulator“ for reaping, seed sowing, excavating, unmanned ploughing,
    watering, fertilising, and harvesting. “Proteus 8.9” simulates the complete system.
    For data analysis, “MATLAB” is being used. An IoT-based microcontroller farm robot
    automates the system as a whole. An IoT-based low-cost solution is structured
    in which warehouse''s (Banerjee et al., 2020) hazardous gas, CO2, is detected
    using a gas sensor. Tilts or lateral motions of the rack are picked up by shock
    sensors. To safeguard grains from fire, a warning is issued if a fire flame is
    discovered. The Node-Red dashboard allows a user to view the findings of live
    sensor data anywhere, at any time. IoT has been used to monitor and manage food
    grain waste in warehouses. A “DHT11” indicator (Devi et al., 2021) for temperature
    and humidity, a CO2 sensor for air quality, a PIR sensor for moving object detection,
    and other sensors are integrated using “Arduino” to act as a rat and insect repellant.
    A fan is activated to cool the room if the temperature and humidity are above
    and below, respectively, the threshold levels. All sensor node data is accessible
    on the mobile application. Immediate terms surveillance equipment powered by IoT
    that (Siddiqua et al., 2022) can track temperature, humidity, brightness, and
    gas concentration in freezing storage and notify the user of potentially dangerous
    values when the levels surpass the thresholds. The “Arduino UNO” microcontroller
    regulates sensor data and provides it to the ESP32. The MIT App Inventor is used
    on either a computer or an Android phone to monitor the status of the storage
    room. Using a combination of blockchain technology (Sangeetha et al., 2021) a
    system for gauging crop quality and monitoring storage that links farmers with
    distributors directly. Data is gathered in real-time both in the warehouse and
    on the field. All sensor nodes are linked together using Arduino, and information
    is transmitted to the Raspberry Pi-based IoT gateway using Lora communication.
    Farmers and distributors can visualise and analyse data via a web application,
    which is stored in Azure SQL databases. The invention of a stated IoT-enabled
    warehouse management system in which (Anoop et al., 2021) the NodeMSU microcontroller
    is set up to receive temperature and humidity data in this study. A DT method
    is used to examine the temperature swings that took place in Kerala during the
    past five years. To assess and display the warehouse''s climate state, this climate
    data is transmitted to the cloud server Thingspeak. A system based on IoT is established
    for controlling and monitoring food (Hema et al., 2020) instantaneous grain storage
    and procurement. To monitor the overall status under the granary, the system makes
    use of gauges for climate control, moisture, gas, real-time clocks, and burning
    flame gauges. Sensor data is visualized using the thingSpeak cloud platform. An
    MQTT-based application control warehouse system is developed for fruits and vegetables
    storage. Using MQTT and COAP protocol (Deshmukh and Bhalerao, 2017) sensor information
    can be displayed on a web page and accessed via mobile apps. Compared two techniques,
    ”Evaporative Cooling Chambers“ (ECCs) (Verploegen et al., 2018) and ”clay pot
    coolers,“ and proposed employing non-electric cooling and storage devices as a
    potential solution to the post-harvest warehouse issues in rural Mali. An IoT-enabled
    approach is structured that employs sensors to track the condition of agricultural
    fields and warehouses in real-time. The (Nayak et al., 2022) necessary region
    is surrounded by a number of sensors that can identify any impending dangers and
    notify the appropriate people. The infrastructure for safeguarding the harvested
    crops in the warehouse and monitoring the same in real time through an IoT sensor
    network performs better than the performance of the entire existing system for
    developing refrigeration sections through WSN-based clay pots. The system is affordable
    and accessible to all farmers. The aforementioned summary of current research
    has a number of drawbacks based on harvesting, storing, and cooling. There is
    a dearth of smart alert notifications in the storage system. The current storage
    system still lacks real-time monitoring of insects and rodents. There is a need
    for such a sophisticated intelligent-based algorithm that can regulate the warehouse''s
    temperature automatically in accordance with diverse environmental factors and
    locales. For different fruits and vegetables, storage systems should be based
    on weight and long-term storage capability, which is still lacking in the current
    work. On the security and usability of the system at the user end, there is a
    research gap. To boost the performance of the current system, other sensors can
    be added, including RFID, sound sensors, and various gas sensors. 4.2. Crop waste
    management (CWM) A solution to identify (Chihana et al., 2018) warehouse breaches
    and track grains using IoT prototypes is suggested. The usage of cloud storage,
    WSN, and RFID technologies increases accountability and efficiency while reducing
    theft and administrative mistakes. Using an IR sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi
    module a smart garbage management (Jayalakshmi et al., 2017) system built on IOT.
    After garbage levels reach maximum, dustbins are cleaned as soon as possible.
    A framework is formed for smart (Bong Cassendra P. C. et al., 2018) agriculture
    based on a smart waste management perspective. The author discusses the various
    sensor and communication protocols that can be used to track the waste of crops
    in agriculture. The current system''s main strength is its ability to collect
    data instantaneously on the amount and type of agricultural waste. These data
    are examined using cloud computing to determine where crop waste is accumulating
    and to evaluate the risk of fire, illness, and pest infestation. Satellite images
    and ground-based sensors can be used to monitor crop waste degradation. Farmers
    at present have access to information on greenhouse gas emissions and decomposition
    rates. According to a study of previous research, smart agro-waste control research
    is still in its early stages. Low-energy power sensors and sophisticated techniques
    for managing post-harvest waste are not used. Research is still needed for all
    forms of crop loss management. 4.3. Transportation and tracking (TTN) A three-layer
    perishable generate fog computing model is proposed (Musa and Vidyasankar, 2017)
    in which the RFID-embedded sensors that generate sensor readings for the monitoring
    and control layer are among the data producers. A system for the effective distribution
    and transportation of fresh fruit is developed by utilizing the MQ3 sensor. The
    (Elavarasi et al., 2019) system''s result was that it lessened fruit contamination.
    When damaged fruit is discovered, an SMS is delivered to the user''s mobile device,
    and through a remote, the system removes the spoiled fruit using a pick-and-place
    robot. In this article the author go into great (Onwude et al., 2020) detail about
    how cutting food losses during postharvest cold chain activities might enhance
    food security. IoT and blockchain were suggested (Pervez and Haq, 2019) as a means
    of digitally disrupting supply chains and logistics. The supply-chain architecture
    built on a block chain is designed using a direct acyclic graph data structure.
    The IoT-based technologies used in the management of the agricultural supply chain
    in a developing nation like India are discussed. Real-time data sharing (Luthra
    et al., 2018) uses embedded components including actuators, sensors, and network
    connectivity. Digital technologies enable the (Dadi et al., 2021) creation of
    effective agri-food supply networks. “Big data” and IoT are a combination of several
    technologies that the system uses to evaluate enormous amounts of information
    quickly. RFID can sense the food environment. The Blockchain-based supply chain
    management plan (Bhutta and Ahmad, 2021) that places an emphasis on employing
    IoT devices and Blockchain technology to securely identify, trace, and track agricultural
    food during transportation. The methods used to anticipate backorders include
    SVM, KNN, RADF, and AdaBoost. The IoT-based dairy supply chain model is suggested
    and put into practise. In which (Jachimczyk et al., 2021) the related solution
    and the domain-oriented knowledge model are well matched for the integration and
    synergy-enabling processes. RFID is used to capture and share data for production,
    warehousing, sales, supply, and other processes. Advocated in China by integrating
    blockchain and RFID in the (Feng Tian, 2016) supply chain. Information is transferred
    securely and made public via the traceability system by using blockchain. Real-time
    monitoring of the climate, humidity, and geolocation guarantees that harvested
    crops get to their destination in the best feasible conditions, reducing spoiling
    and improving crop quality. Blockchain technology leveraging RFID-based sensor
    nodes optimises supply chains for all crops in real-time. It reduces waste and
    guarantees that crops get there at their intended location in the best feasible
    condition. It has been determined from the discussion of the TTN''s current system
    that the secure supply chain technique has to be updated for all agricultural
    products. Sensor-based technologies, device security and failure, software security,
    and power management all require improvement. The current infrastructure does
    not allow for the dynamic scheduling of transportation based on the agricultural
    products'' shelf lives. There are significant research gaps in the areas of cloud
    platform load balancing, computational cost, and security protocol. Logistical
    processes based on smart contracts can be added to the system to increase its
    efficiency and power. There is still a need for an autonomous system that unifies
    numerous subsystems using IoT with technologies like blockchain and AI. 4.4. Food
    processing (FDP) “Big data” analytics, MCLRN, and the IoT are used to build a
    (Konur et al., 2023) cyber-physical / IoT based food manufacturing system. The
    intelligent production control system offers intelligent decision assistance.
    A tools is structured for tracking and (Jagtap et al., 2021) lowering energy and
    water consumption (FEW), as well as a decision-support system with pertinent hardware
    and software components, utilizing an IoT four-layer architecture. FEW data are
    gathered and used in the food manufacturing sector to examine and improve procedures.
    The food processing system is more effective when IoT, big data analytics, MCLRN,
    and cyber-physical systems are incorporated than when they are automated. Additionally,
    this analysis teaches data professionals new information about how to forecast
    the baking process for achieving product consistency. Productivity may be raised,
    and performance and profitability can be raised by analyzing these data. The current
    research has been examined for individual agricultural goods. For all agricultural
    goods, testing can be done based on the ingredients and food processing. It is
    necessary to integrate seamless IoT devices to improve food processing. The current
    system lacks a strong security system to safeguard system data. Based on IoT,
    AI, MCLRN, and other processes, Fig. 8 presents the average annual growth rate

    Publication growth rate analysis of POHRS application based on IoT and AI, MCLRN
    and other methodology from 2012 to 2023. For the TTN and RSCS system implementations,
    a large number of research articles have been published between 2018 and 2022.
    The average growth rate for the IoT and blockchain-based TTN system has been measured
    as 63.23 % between 2018 and 2021, and the average growth rate has been measured
    for the IoT and AI-based system for storage and cooling at 58.41 % between 2018
    and 2021. However, there has been less growth in research publications on the
    topics of IoT and AI for the other POHRS applications, such as FDP, CWM, sorting,
    and cooling, between 2012 and 2022. Therefore, there is a need for greater study
    in that area. Using IoT, AI, MCLRN, and other methodology categories, the average
    growth rate of research papers for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS was 41.12 %, 43.23 %,
    and 36.10 %, respectively, till January 2023. 5. Metaheuristic based algorithm
    in smart agriculture application From growing to reaping, an agricultural application
    (Kiani et al., 2022a) uses a meta-heuristic approach. In the first unit, the “Sand
    Cat Swarm Optimization” (SCSO) based algorithm has been created to delegate the
    cultivation work to the appropriate autonomous machines, reducing the labor factor.
    In the second unit, IoT devices keep track of cultivated crops. For crop harvesting
    in the third unit, an improved “ANT colony optimization” (ACO) algorithm has been
    created. A 3D strategy approach has been (Kiani et al., 2022b) employed using
    a couple of Progressive enhancement Grey Wolf Optimisation (I-GWO) and Improved
    Grey Wolf Optimisation (Ex-GWO) for self-sustaining farm operations to search
    for a collision-free feasible route in a sufficient period with minimal expenditure
    in various atmospheric conditions and for multiple barriers. The goal is to tackle
    the NP-hard problem of successful crop harvesting by identifying the finest and
    most suitable paths for UAVs. The results indicate an endeavor to avoid any local
    optima pitfalls and determine the most effective response in an adequate span
    of duration. The fuzzy logic-based “Non-dominated sorting (Fathollahi-Fard et
    al., 2023) genetic algorithm” (NSGEA) model has been developed as a metaheuristic
    optimization strategy where the model incorporates the advantage of multiple factors
    of apprehension such as harvesters'' effectiveness, waves of crops that become
    ripe, parameter weather, as well as adjustments in the value of commodities. The
    framework takes into consideration a wide range of desired results, including
    profitability optimization, preventing waste, and carbon dioxide emissions reduction,
    and it is utilized to calculate the optimum amount of day''s labor for farmers
    and laborers on every block of land. The usefulness of the currently available
    SCSO, ACO, I-GWO, Ex-GWO, and NSGEA metaheuristic algorithms put into effect in
    IoT-based agriculture exceeded other approaches, and the model suggested may be
    used for different applications in a variety of agricultural areas. There are
    still some issues with the optimised performance technique that is currently being
    used to solve NP-hard issues in the field of smart agriculture. Lack of standardisation
    for big croplands utilising IoT and IoT of transportation employing a portable
    robot system to monitor the farming field based on SIR, SCL, CSL, CYP, SGM, SSL,
    STM, SHMFM, DDAN, PDT, WDT, PCN, CLO, TTN, FDP, and RSCS. While supply chain optimizer
    for several harvested crops is currently lacking, the used NSGEA algorithms in
    multiobjective problems can be extended by “Benders decomposition” or “Lagrangian
    relaxation”. 6. Technologies based on the IoT for smart agriculture The development
    of IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems has relied on a variety of technologies
    in the past. It is possible to use this technology wirelessly or wiredly. It is
    conceivable to build an infrastructure for intelligent agriculture at a low cost
    by combining sensors, controllers, and communication technologies. Through the
    synthesis of IoT, artificial intelligence, edge computing, and cloud computing,
    IoT-enabled technologies have made advancements in developing smart agriculture
    systems as well. This section analyses various technologies for developing smart
    agriculture systems in the different major areas of farming operations on the
    basis of discussion in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application. The estimation average rate of several technologies utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS system is depicted in Fig. 9 of the graph.
    According to the existing survey (Kalyani and Collier, 2021) and proposed survey
    report, this is the estimated percentage of technologies used in smart agriculture
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (215KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 9. Growth rate of various technologies used in PHRS, DHRS, POHRS subsystem
    between 2012 and 2022. According to an average percentage analysis of various
    technologies conducted between 2012 and 2022, the use of IoT and other technologies
    for the development of smart agriculture would increase by 2028 (Research and
    Markets, 2023). Table 1 presents cutting-edge technologies, sensor or devices
    that can be applied to build smart agriculture using IoT architecture (Chamara
    et al., 2022) based on PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS. From Table 1 it can be seen that
    the use of IoT has advanced the field of smart agriculture from 2012 to 2023.
    The advancement has been done by deploying various IoT devices / sensors (Pyingkodi
    et al., 2022), wireless communication protocols (Khanh et al., 2022), and UAVs
    using micro-electromechanical system (MEMS) technologies to automate the farming
    field operations (Boursianis et al., 2022). It is possible to communicate from
    machine to machine using a variety of communication standards (Orfanos et al.,
    2023). Table 1. Analysis of Technologies used in the smart agriculture between

    The graph in Fig. 10 represent how much data is consumed in GBPS by PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems. This data bandwidth estimate is evaluated and (Annual Internet,
    2023; Virtual Cisco, 2017) measured using prior research. This information is
    obtained through a variety of IoT sensors and actuators, including cameras, DHT
    temperature and humidity sensors, air pressure sensors, rain sensors, distance
    sensors, water flow metres, and others. These sensors and actuators are utilised
    to create smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Information for real-time crop
    management is updated often, like every minute or hour. In the upcoming years,
    it is anticipated that the average data bandwidth for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems would keep expanding. The rapid development of sensors and actuators,
    as well as the rising demand for real-time crop management data, are to blame
    for this. As technology has developed, the maximum data bandwidth for IoT-based
    smart agriculture systems has increased year over year. The available data bandwidth
    for various IoT based PHRS, DHRS and POHRS applications from 2012 to 2022 is shown
    in the graph Fig. 10. Download : Download high-res image (152KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 10. Data consumption analysis (GB) used by IoT devices year
    wise for various IoT based subsystems in smart agriculture. IoT technologies were
    still in their infancy between 2012 and 2014, and data storage capacity for applications
    in the IoT remained quite constrained. Data rates ranging from a few kilobyte
    per second (Kbps) to a few megabyte per second (Mbps) were accessible via wireless
    technologies including 2G and 3G cellular networks, which were widely used. The
    data bandwidth for IoT applications has increased dramatically between 2015 and
    2018 thanks to 4G LTE cellular networks technologies. Higher data speeds were
    offered by 4G networks, which typically oscillated between tens of Mbps to hundreds
    of Mbps. This made it possible to collect and analyse more data thoroughly while
    also enabling the transfer of data more quickly. Improvements to 4G networks and
    the rollout of 5G networks, which promise even more data bandwidth and lower latency,
    started in 2019 to 2021. Data rates of up to several gigabits per second (Gbps)
    are available with 5G technology. Even while 5G was not yet widely available,
    its promise for fast data transfer was becoming more and more clear. The global
    rollout of 5G networks, which are currently in development, will continue in 2022
    and 2023. This will result in enhanced data bandwidth for IoT-based smart agriculture
    applications. Although the actual data rates that can be achieved in real-world
    settings depend on network coverage and infrastructure, the data bandwidth needed
    for IoT-based smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems might vary depending on the
    implementation and the amount of data being communicated. The overall bandwidth
    needs will be influenced by elements including the volume of data gathering, the
    number of sensors placed, and the complexity of the data being conveyed. Communication
    involves a number of factors, such as the data rate, the frequency bands, the
    range, the application, and the cost. A systematic analysis of these factors has
    been conducted in Table 2 to determine which communication standards are to be
    used in PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystem. As from Table 1 and Table 2, some IoT-based
    communication technologies can also be considered in the 5G/5G beyond smart agriculture
    system. Table 2. Comparative analysis of various communication technologies used
    in smart agriculture. Communication Technologies Frequency Bands Data Rate Range

    problem in CYP, SSL, SIR, DDAN, PCN, WDT, and CWM operations. Existing public
    dataset has been reviewed for several farming operations (Lu and Young, 2020)
    including SSL, DDAN, WDT, CWM, etc., and classified this dataset based on the
    specific problem that can be solved using the IoT based computer vision algorithm
    for PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Including some existing external datasets
    created by various authors can be found in Table 3. This collection includes many
    plant-leaf diseases that affect fruits, vegetables, and seeds. For instance, tomatoes,
    brinjal, potatoes, guava, wheat, cotton, apples, oranges, and so forth. Table
    3. Analysis of dataset that can be used for developing smart agriculture based
    subsystem. References Details (Rauf and Lali, 2021) This dataset of healthy and
    unhealthy guava fruits and leaves can be used to solve plant disease-related issues
    using computer vision techniques. The illness categories in this image dataset
    are Dot, Canker, Mummification, and Rust. Pakistan is the source of the images.
    (Yogesh Suryawanshi et al., 2022) An image collection consists of four vegetables:
    “Bell Pepper”, “Tomato”, “Chili Pepper”, and “New Mexico Chile”. The five distinct
    substructure classes in each vegetable collection are Ripe, Old, Dried, and Wounded.
    (Natnael Tilahun, 2022) This image collection was gathered from a potato farm
    in Holeta, Ethiopia to help in the detection of potato leaf disease. The aforementioned
    collection comprises two distinct varieties of photos. Both “Healthy” and “Late
    Blight” have 363 and 63 images, respectively. The potato disease issue can be
    resolved with this dataset. 8. Comprehensive shortcomings of PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS
    As discussed above in 2 Pre-harvesting system (PHRS), 3 During harvesting system
    (DHRS), 4 Post harvesting system (POHRS), 5 Metaheuristic based algorithm in smart
    agriculture application, some shortcomings have been addressed from the existing
    work on IoT-enabled smart agriculture systems. Individually, these gaps are identified
    according to the various farming activities. The gaps that are noticeable for
    PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS are discussed in the Table 4 from which it can be analysed
    that smart agriculture is a broad research area and the developed existing IoT-enabled
    system still has shortcomings in terms of standard protocols, inconsistencies
    in collected data, and inconsistencies of IoT devices (such as there are multiple
    temperature sensors but their data formats are different and also it is difficult
    to interface that sensor with multiple subsystem microcontroller because of the
    varying platform), difficult to integrate existing system to multiple regions
    because of the environmental factor, cost, lack of technologies enhancement of
    the system and endorsement with real-time information with external source information.
    As from sections, 2, 3, 4 and 5 it can be extrapolated that more examination needs
    to be performed to accomplish IoT-based solutions for the SSL, SGM, SDG, PDT,
    affected crop sorting, CWM, and FDP. Research can be conducted on different crop
    types location-wise. IoT data security is a significant uncertainty, so there
    is a need for scalable WSN or robust mechanisms to protect data. Table 4. In depth
    shortcomings analysis of the existing smart agriculture system based on PHRS,
    DHRS and POHRS. PHRS Problems Focused Description Inconsistency with Standards
    Security protocols, device compatibility, and firmware still need to be standardized
    for IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM, SSL, SGM, DFM, WPM, and SDG systems. Compared to
    other methods and outcomes, the existing systems are difficult to compare. Standardized
    procedures and frameworks are necessary for assessing and comparing different
    methods. Limited Data analysis IoT is dependent on the volume of data. Most of
    the time that information is not easily accessible because of non-availability
    of open source data. More trustworthy sensor data and adequate data-gathering
    techniques are required because still depended on external source data. Data should
    be location-wise, all types of data, and should be validated with real-time and
    existing data. There is need for advanced data analytics techniques to make sense
    of these vast generated data. Inadequate scalability For IoT-based CSL, YPR, STM,
    DFM, and WPM applications, there are many active research projects; nevertheless,
    there is still work to be done to scale this system for commercial applications.
    SGM, SSL and SD-based IoT-based systems require more research. This system are
    not fully automated. Inadequate knowledge Performing experiments on the crop relies
    on understanding of the crop physiology as well as a range of environmental factors,
    which is yet not fully understood. More study is needed on the physiological processes
    of various crops, as well as the effects of environmental conditions on crop growth
    and development. Inability to integrate with current agricultural systems To make
    the fully IoT-based pre-harvesting method more effective, the system can be incorporated
    with the existing agricultural systems such as smart crop recommendation system
    based on weather, location, seed selection and soil nutrients analysis, smart
    soil digging, etc. There is a lack of research in this area of integration. The
    study has to be performed to discover the potential benefits and drawbacks of
    the integration. Limited Accuracy Currently, most IoT devices lead to erroneous
    and inconsistent data, as they have limitations in terms of accuracy, reliability,
    and precision. In addition, sensor calibration is also important despite being
    complex and time-consuming and can result in inconsistent results if not done.
    Also, these devices have to place optimally to ensure correct data collection,
    which can be further used for analysis. The study has to be performed to make
    a system accurate and reliable. Cost Effective IoT-based systems can be expensive
    to install and maintain and thus can be a barrier while adopting the technique,
    especially for small-scale farmers. Although the cost of devices has decreased
    in recent years, the overall integration can still lead to a higher cost. Research
    has to be focused to investigate cost-effective solutions. Use of MCLRN approaches
    The present work has used MCLRN techniques in IoT-based systems, however due to
    the overfitting issue, the trained MCLRN model still cannot make an accurate forecast.
    DHRS Multi-technology incorporating IoT makes it possible for the system to apply
    a variety of technologies during the harvesting process. These technologies can
    be combined to create a system, but research is needed to determine the best way
    to do so. According to the study of the current work, several systems have not
    been fully incorporated. Such as SIR with SHMFM, PCN, PDT, WDT, CLO etc. System
    for Enhancing Irrigation Research must be conducted to point out the efficient
    way to irrigate the plants as compared to the traditional methods of irrigation.
    Such as irrigation system should be managed automatically on behalf of different
    of types crops. Acquiring and adopting users Existing IoT-based DHRS systems are
    still mishandled and challenging to adopt in various environments. Research must
    be performed to make a system that can be easily handled and adopted by end users
    in different environments. Soil health The DHRS process includes IoT enabled system
    for crop monitoring and SHMFM. Research must be performed to examine how SIR affects
    soil systems, microbial residents, and nutrient process for various crops. Environment''s
    impact Still, research is to be investigated based on environmental factors such
    as calibration of temperature, humidity, and rainfall during SHMFM and DDAN. Privacy
    and Security As far as the security of IoT-based DHR systems is concerned, very
    little research has been conducted. Detecting the diseases accurately Although
    IoT-based systems can provide real-time plant health data, there are still limitations
    to how precise the data is. Various factors affect accuracy and research must
    be done to monitor those factors, which can impact accuracy. Efficient Energy
    Continuous data collection is difficult in remote regions. A cost-effective, self-sustaining,
    and optimised technique should be implemented in the current IoT-based systems
    for PDT, DDAN, SHMFM, and WDT so that field monitoring data can be gathered continually.
    Analysing pest behaviour The system to detect pests accurately still needs improvement.
    As various pests respond differently in different environments. Optimization of
    Object Detection algorithms Need more research in the areas of IoT-enabled systems
    for WDT, PDT, CLO, and PCN to provide optimized solutions for accurate results.
    So system performance can be increased. POHRS Security and Privacy While most
    harvesting data must be stored properly and securely. Various IoT-based systems
    can be implemented to monitor and store the data. In this era of cyber threats,
    the system must be made in such a way to make the data properly stored, thus making
    it secure. Innovative solutions with a low cost Developing IoT enables cost-effective
    solutions in post-harvest activities is challenging based on security and privacy.
    As in POHRS, there are still some shortcomings in the existing system, which needed
    to be addressed. Such as in RSCS, SWM, and TTN there is still lacking data security,
    data storage, and low-cost automated system of fruits and vegetables monitoring.
    Research must be done to deeply understand such a situation and make a cost-efficient
    system so that it can be used by small-scale farmers also. Miniature studies In
    POHRS most of the ongoing work is focused on TTN, RSCS, and CWM but missing this
    existing system on a large scale for post-harvest phases. In the current automated
    RSCS system, the sorting technique management can be improved by including scheduling
    and weightage systems for post-harvest storage of crops during the TTN process,
    because Indian farmers have fewer low-cost smart facilities. Research can be done
    to investigate the effectiveness of the IoT system on a large scale as well. Incorporating
    multiple methods IoT system integrates different components which are somehow
    correlated to each other. Research should be carried out to determine how those
    components must be integrated as a distributed system that develops a self-sustainable
    and cost-efficient system. Availability and Reliability The IoT-based system should
    be readily available for the end users. Research should be done regarding the
    improvements in the availability of the data during TTN as well as while RSCS,
    utilizing real-time monitoring. 9. Proposed architecture for smart agriculture
    From PHRS to POHRS, a number of existing smart methodologies have been established
    for all different types of farming tasks, and they are all covered above along
    with their benefits as well as their drawbacks. By using the proposed architecture
    the limitations of the present structures can be reduced in light of the discussion
    above. A compact sensor network is made possible. Thanks to the integration of
    IoT, MCLRN, metaheuristic optimisation algorithm, AI, edge computing, cloud computing,
    SDN, cryptography for data security, UAVs, etc. Using 5G (gNB architecture) and
    5G beyond networks (Abdulghaffar et al., 2021), the recommended IoT-facilitated
    smart farming architecture is designed on the basis of IoT layered architecture
    in the Fig. 11. The sensor layer consists of different types of sensors, and data
    transmitters (“sx1276”, “nrf24l01”, etc.), cameras, high-frequency navigation
    (GPS), etc. It acts to collect and transmit facts it to the central server utilizing
    a 5G network connectivity via an edge gateway for data processing and analytics.
    The central server gives the farmers useful information using miscellaneous algorithms
    and standard procedures. These details may be on the choice of crop, seed germination,
    irrigation, soil analysis, and status, livestock status, crop diseases detection,
    crop sorting and storage, tracking, etc. The collected data are about the PHRS
    subsystem, DHRS subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. These subsystems are interconnected
    to each other to make the overall agriculture system automated. So that farmers
    can optimize their farming procedures and enhance crop yields. Under this system,
    the automated actuators can be used to enable farmers to remotely control some
    of the devices such as irrigation motors, pest control, soil digging, etc. Layer
    by layer, smart agriculture can be developed as follows: Download : Download high-res
    image (896KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Proposed 5G based Smart
    Agriculture Framework. 9.1. Perception layer In this layer, multiple sensor networks
    can be created by deploying various sensor nodes for the PHRS subsystem, DHRS
    subsystem, and POHRS subsystem. This subsystem is communicated to each other as
    machine-to-machine communication (Sakthivel and Vidhya, 2021) and connected to
    an each 5GIoT base edge gateway. The PHRS subsystem retrieves the data of various
    environmental factors, including water in the soil, fertiliser, temperature, and
    humidity, sunlight, flood and drought-related, etc, and transmits this data to
    the local IoT edge gateway for further computation and analysis. The DHRS subsystem
    consists of the sensor data of irrigation, NPK, pest controlling, weed detection,
    disease prediction, livestock, insects sound, crop field, etc. This data is also
    transmitted to a local IoT edge gateway and the same as POHRS sensor network data
    will be collected and transmitted to its IoT local edge gateway for further computing
    and analysis. This all subsystems are the backbone of the IoT sensor network.
    9.2. Network layer The entire IoT AGRI subsystem is designed based on the 5G network,
    but it can enable 5G beyond the network as needed. Essentially, a 5G core network
    is a high-level network that is made up of a radio access network and one or more
    edge networks. The 5G base stations are connected to open flow switches which
    are known as gNB switches (edge network). For traffic offloading and “quality
    of service (QoS)” implementation, SDN controllers can interface with base stations
    using the open flow protocol. The “protocol data unit (PDU) session” or “user
    plane function (UPF)” is used in the core network to connect the data network
    (DN). The SDN controller controls all gNB, UPF, and data plane switches. This
    layer is responsible for all transmissions and communications between sensors,
    IoT gateways, and cloud servers. 9.3. Cloud layer The network layer''s via SDN
    controller would transport the sensor data acquired from the perception layer
    to the cloud layer platform, where analytics would be carried out utilising tools
    like AI, MCLRN, Weka, and Hadoop, among others. Cloud platforms include “AWS”,
    “Azure”, “IBM Cloud”, etc. To handle and analyse the data gathered from the sensors,
    this cloud service offers storage and computational capabilities. The designed
    API gateway is used to manage communication between the edge gateway and the cloud
    server while utilising all authentication services. 9.4. Application layer The
    insights produced by the cloud server will be available to the end user through
    mobile applications, web applications, etc., including farmers, stack holders,
    suppliers, ranchers, purchasers, etc. So that farmers may make informed judgements,
    this programme gives them real-time information regarding the PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS. 9.5. Data storage and processing layer Depending on the particular applications
    and the volume of data collected, the data storage needs for IoT-based PHRS, DHRS,
    and POHRS subsystems can change. Numerous services, including data source, data
    processing, decision support, transmission system, authorization, storage space,
    and reliability, are offered in the data storage and processing layer. The digital
    footprint of the data collection and storing for the IoT-based PHRS, DHRS, and
    POHRS subsystems in smart agriculture is shown in Fig. 12. Download : Download
    high-res image (611KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Data processing
    and storage footprint. Data gathering: Obtaining information from numerous agricultural
    fields (F) using a variety of sensors, including those that measure things like
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, soil ph, soil NPK, air pressure, RFID, rodents,
    insects, and other animals, as well as things like plant color recognition, rainfall,
    disease detection, and recognization through cameras, storage and cooling control
    of harvested vegetables or fruits, transportation and tracking, water flow measurement,
    level, and pump control. This sensor and actuator data is sent to the server for
    analysis and decision-making for the farm fields, or real-time monitoring. Depending
    on the sensor type and frequency, a single sensor node may generate data on average
    in the range of KB to a megabyte (MB) each day. The expected data storage, for
    instance, can range from GB to terabytes (TB) per year if there is a vast farming
    area with numerous sensors. In addition, image and video data are gathered from
    drones to monitor crop health, pest detection, weed detection, and crop yield.
    This data contains high-definition images of farms in 5 to 100 MB sizes. It is
    possible to estimate total storage capacity by estimating the frequency of capturing
    such imaginary data. The sensor data for CYP, CSL, SGM, STM, SDG, SIR, RSCS, CWM,
    DDAN, PDT, CLO, WDT, SHMFM TTN, and FDP systems as well as scheduling irrigation,
    measuring insect control effectiveness, managing livestock, keeping track of crop
    yields, and managing agribusiness depend on the overall dimension of the farm,
    the variety of crops grown there, and the amount of detail that can be gathered.
    For each crop every year, this data size can be in the KB to MB range. However,
    WPM generates climate-related data that can be recorded for historical research
    and transmitted in KB each hour or day. Data pre-processing: In the pre-processing,
    the gathered data are prepared for further analysis. Which is used to fill in
    the missing data, remove the redundant data, format the data into its size, type,
    and classes, and normalize the data to make data more reliable and knowledgeable.
    Data repository: The local storage server, which may be a NoSql, time-series,
    or relational database, stores all pre-process data. It is quite difficult to
    make the data more trustworthy and long-lasting because the database storage can
    come from a variety of sources of different types and sizes. The data is cleaned
    using a variety of pre-processing techniques throughout the pre-process. There
    are different, specialised cleaning techniques for text and picture data, such
    as stemming and lemmatization, as well as image geometric conversions, image filtering,
    segmentation, Fourier transform, and image restoration, among others. Data from
    both the past and the present is kept in the storage repository. In the edge computing
    layer, data transmission management is carried out between this data processing
    layer. The interval between acquisition and utilisation might vary extensively,
    ranging from a couple of seconds, minutes, or hours to a few weeks, or possibly
    a full year in extreme circumstances. Therefore, several transmission techniques
    can be used for quick and secure long-distance transmission via wired or wireless
    means. High-speed data connection, such as a 5G communication network, is also
    necessary. Various data flow control techniques, including stop and wait, feedback
    control, sliding windows, two-directional communications, etc., will be used to
    manage the data communication traffic between these two communications. Throughout
    all of these steps, data analyses are carried out utilising different MCLRN and
    AI algorithms to send actions and notifications to the user''s cloud server. A
    suggested approach for smart farming system data footprint is developed based
    on smart PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS existing work deficiencies using a 5G data communication
    network. For the storage of this PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the maximum
    average data volume analysis is shown as a graph in Fig. 13. The regular data
    volume analysis is estimated in Fig. 13 as a graph based on the communication
    technologies range, periodicity of the sensor devices, camera resolution, data
    bandwidth, etc. Using different types of agricultural activity properties, this
    average data volume utilisation analysis over the past 30 days has been calculated.
    The analysis of the 30-day total average data volume was calculated at 1.38856
    GB. Depending on the particular PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS application, the data transfer
    frequency changes. Download : Download high-res image (156KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 13. Estimated digital footprint for one month of proposed
    PHRS,DHRS and POHRS Systems. For instance, a system used to track soil temperature
    and nutrient content might release information once each hour or day. Meanwhile,
    a different system will deliver data every minute for crop growth assessment.
    As more smart sensors are deployed and technology is developed, the amount of
    data conveyed for different crops in soil and crop growth monitoring will expand
    in the future. Aspects that can increase the volume of data include the number
    of sensors used, the type of data (image, text, or numerical), frequency, distance,
    time, cost of data transmission, size of the farmed area, crop type, climate,
    irrigation method, soil type, disease type, etc. 10. Comparative analysis of existing
    smart agriculture system with proposed 5G based architecture For the recommendation
    of a 5G-based smart agriculture framework, some of the existing available research
    surveys have already (Liu et al., 2023) been carried out, in which the major technologies
    and technological barriers preventing the advancement and development of smart
    agriculture applications leveraging 5G technologies are described. The resultant
    effect of 5G on the IoT for smart agriculture is outlined. An exploration of precision
    agricultural (Majumdar et al., 2023) applications has been explored using green
    IoT-based solutions, utilizing UAVs, LPWANs, and 5G networks as well as an assortment
    of technical issues. Utilizing 5G networks and beyond, the long-lasting expansion
    of digital farming through the incorporation of green IoT technology enables the
    IoT greener. The proposed architecture above has been recommended by incorporating
    each multiple-edge gateway grid with the central controller for all small and
    large farming area data based on the existing 5G-based smart agriculture architecture.
    The advantages of using this agriculture system over existing IoT-based agriculture
    systems include the immediately apparent advancement across multiple agriculture
    applications, centralised archives of data, estimation process power, etc. Existing
    smart agriculture exhibits challenging obstacles and demands to handle high volume
    data storing processes, computation power, and managing various agriculture applications
    of small and large farming areas. Therefore, in this instance, data computation,
    interpreting, and other capabilities can be offered close to the network''s edge,
    where initially the data are originated. Edge computing power has benefits such
    as decreased latency, bandwidth savings, reduced downtime, increased trustworthiness,
    improved privacy and security, etc. The proposed IoT-based architecture allows
    for the best provisioning of resources using SDN, network segmentation, route
    optimisation, load balancing, and other practises. A evaluation of current smart
    farm systems with the proposed IoT architecture is shown in Table 5 below based
    on the various parameter. Some of the characteristics are identical in the proposed
    5G-based smart agriculture architecture and the existing smart agriculture architecture.
    The comparison has been verified based on this characteristic. Table 5. Advantages
    of the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system with existing smart agriculture
    system. Comparative parameter (Udutalapally et al., 2021) (Liu et al., 2023) Proposed
    5G based IoT agriculture architecture system Bandwidth Low Bandwidth Fast bandwidth
    with single edge network Fast bandwidth with single and multiple edge network
    with LPWAN communication Latency High latency rate and risk of data loss during
    cloud transmission. Delay time will be increased for large farming area. Delay
    time is reduced as of using multiple edge gateway. Interruption Interruption rate
    are high Interruption rate can be high if switching to 5G beyond network or multiple
    edge network. Interruption are reduced because authenticated edge connection for
    small and large farming field WSN and can be customized based on the network.
    Data storage Limited storage capacity and complicated database management because
    of limited globalization. High storage capacity at the cloud end, as the architecture
    is for small farming area. Capable of managing databases at the edge network and
    storage capacity will be maximum as using distributed system. Energy efficient
    Requires a lot of energy for calculation and processing while transmitting various
    types of data at long distances. More energy required as system is not fully distributed.
    Less energy consumption as system is distributed. Minimises the necessity for
    transmission of data over long distances. Real time decision Real-time decision-making
    can be accomplished although has a larger latency, which restricts its effectiveness
    for circumstances where timeliness is essential. Real time decision possible but
    lack in independency at each edge network. Increase productivity and yield by
    enabling real-time decision-making with exposure to the constantly changing conditions
    on the farm. PHRS Subsystems Integration of PHRS sub systems is possible with
    other farming sub system but need much enhancement, as limited range of network
    connections and no such algorithm for intelligent decision making at the edge
    level. Since PHRS module data differ from farm to farm, there are chances of data
    overload at the edge network level because there are no such discussions on NP-hard
    problem optimization strategies. Using of metaheuristic-based algorithms it is
    possible to increase the efficiency of PHRS, sub-systems in 5G-based or beyond
    networks. DHRS Subsystems Integration of DHRS sub-systems is limited as it provides
    a huge volume of image and video-type data. Integration of the DHRS subsystem
    is achievable as discussed about the UAVs-based system for various image vision
    problems. Integration of DHRS with PHRS subsystem is achievable using NB-IoT M2M
    communication. POHRS Subsystems Integration of POHRS subsystem is limited. POHRS
    subsystem integration for supply chain management. Management of POHRS subsystems
    for TTN, FDP, cooling, harvesting, and farmers'' inventory. Security and privacy
    Device security, data authentication, network slicing, and encryption still need
    to be improved. There is no analogous method discussed for recognising security
    ambiguity while deploying IoT devices for securing inconsistent energy-efficient
    communication devices for considerable distance and durability. The system becomes
    more efficient and capable with the help of 5G, SDN, and distributed edge computing
    structures and is able to oversee massive amounts of network traffic and data
    authentication. As a result of the discussion in Table 5 above, it can be concluded
    that creating the proposed 5G based smart agriculture system using edge computing
    could effortlessly extend to meet the increasing necessities of modern farming.
    The entire structure can be customized by how the agricultural operation grows
    and network changes or whether its operations require more sensors and devices.

    surveys information. Table 6. Comparative analysis of proposed survey from existing

    the gap in existing reviews for IoT-based smart agriculture by classifying pre-
    and post-harvest activities into PHRS, DHRS, and POHRS subsystems. Based on this
    categorization, various existing work has been discussed in detail with an analysis
    of the IoT communication technologies and metaheuristic approach used in the IoT
    based smart agriculture system. As a result of the discussion of the problem in
    existing work, the 5G and 5G beyond smart agriculture system architecture are
    being prepared. With this recommended framework, the shortcomings of the existing
    work can be reduced, and the system can be optimized. 11. Conclusion IoT-based
    smart agriculture is the advancement of the digital transformation of various
    traditional farming subactivities. In this a comprehensive review by categorizing
    the farming subactivities based on the Pre, During, and Post harvests of the smart
    agriculture-based existing application has been discussed in detail. We have also
    observed the research gaps for each and every activity separately. Based on these
    research gaps it has been analyzed that developing an intelligent farming system
    is still a challenging process. We have tried to address these challenges and
    enhance the performance of the existing systems by proposing a 5G-based hybrid
    framework for smart agriculture. The outcome of the proposed survey is validated
    by comparison with the existing survey papers. It is found that various existing
    surveys have not been represented considering the smart agriculture applications
    according to the Pre, During, and Post harvesting phases. Therefore, our survey
    methodology and outcome seem to outperform the other surveys conducted so far
    for smart agriculture. In future work the technology wise survey for the different
    aspects of smart agriculture may be conducted. For example, we can have a comprehensive
    survey on the use of Machine learning algorithms for each activity of smart agriculture.
    Also crop wise comprehensive survey can be conducted involving all the pre, during
    and post-harvest activities. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

  description: This article examines the construction of image recognition algorithms
    for the classification of plant pathology problems. Rooted in science and technology
    studies research on the effects of agricultural big data and agricultural algorithms,
    the study ethnographically examines how algorithms for the recognition of plant
    pathology are made. To do this, the article looks at the case of a German agtech
    startup developing image recognition algorithms for an app that aims to help small-scale
    farmers diagnose plant damages based on digital images of their symptoms. The
    study posits that the construction of these algorithms can be grasped as a succession
    of layers, at each of which the startup’s employees carry out different selection
    practices. It is argued that these practices gradually inscribe a selective recognition
    of the phenomenon of plant pathology into the algorithms of the app. This selective
    recognition is reflected in the fact that the emerging algorithms are effective
    in identifying isolated plant damages on isolated crops, while ignoring most agroecosystem-related
    actors and relations through which plant damages arise. The article concludes
    that the app’s selective recognition of plant pathology is likely to perpetuate
    or even exacerbate the pesticide use of its users. This is because the app’s view
    of plant pathology as a phenomenon comprised of isolated plant damages on isolated
    crops is more compatible with the use of chemical pesticides than with approaches
    to crop protection that strive for a more moderate use of these substances (e.g.,
    integrated pest management, agroecology, organic agriculture).

    \ and Classification: A Survey Chapter © 2023 Introduction In recent years, image\
    \ recognition algorithms have been used for a growing number of classification\
    \ tasks in agrifood systems. Not long ago, John Deere, for example, released a\
    \ field sprayer that deploys algorithms to identify and kill weeds, while moving\
    \ across a piece of land. Other companies—like RSIP Vision—commercialize algorithms\
    \ for sorting and grading fresh agricultural products that can be integrated into\
    \ industrial production machines. Still other companies—like BASF, Bayer, or FLORA,\
    \ 1 the startup around which this article revolves—develop mobile apps that feature\
    \ algorithms for diagnosing plant damages based on digital images of their symptoms.\
    \ 2 Given this proliferation of image recognition algorithms in agriculture, this\
    \ article explores how such algorithms are constructed in situated practices,\
    \ and how they are made to recognize agricultural phenomena. This research contributes\
    \ to a growing body of scholarship associated with science and technology studies\
    \ (STS) examining the problematic effects of agricultural big data (Bronson 2019;\
    \ Bronson and Knezevic 2016; Carbonell 2016) and agricultural algorithms (Carolan\
    \ 2020; Miles 2019) on rural environments and societies. A common critique running\
    \ through these two closely related strands of research is that contrary to the\
    \ lofty promises generally associated with these phenomena, they often lead to\
    \ a reproduction of agriculture-related problems of past decades (e.g., concentration\
    \ of corporate power, land grabbing, spreading of monocultures). However, especially\
    \ with regard to algorithms, it is not yet entirely clear how this reproduction\
    \ comes about. Given this puzzle, this article explores the causes for the sometimes-problematic\
    \ effects of agricultural algorithms in further depth. In doing so, it draws inspiration\
    \ from a group of scholars who ethnographically explore the construction of algorithms\
    \ to better understand how the sometimes-problematic effects of these devices\
    \ come about and how they might be circumvented (Bechmann and Bowker 2019; Jaton\
    \ 2017, 2021). In short, rather than examining the effects of stabilized algorithms\
    \ in hindsight, this article looks at agricultural algorithms in the making. To\
    \ work towards such an understanding of agricultural algorithms, this study presents\
    \ an ethnographic analysis of the agtech startup FLORA and its flagship technology\
    \ PHYTØ, an app that uses image recognition algorithms to diagnose plant damages\
    \ based on digital images of their symptoms. Following a diagnosis, PHYTØ also\
    \ provides users with recommendations for treatment and preventive measures. These\
    \ recommendations, the startup regularly stresses, are meant to be “impartial,”\
    \ meaning they are supposed to include both chemical and non-chemical remedies.\
    \ With this in mind, FLORA’s business model for monetizing PHYTØ has changed several\
    \ times since the startup was founded in 2015. At the time of writing (late 2022)\
    \ it rests on two pillars: First, renting out PHYTØ’s algorithms to large input\
    \ manufacturers who use them in company-branded apps to increase sales of their\
    \ core products. Second, FLORA has built a digital platform to connect farmers,\
    \ pesticide retailers, and pesticide manufacturers while charging commissions\
    \ on additional pesticide sales brokered to the latter via PHYTØ’s diagnoses.\
    \ Despite its current business model, it is important to emphasize that FLORA\
    \ has not always been cooperating with the agrochemical industry. In other words,\
    \ the effects described in this article partly predate FLORA’s collaboration with\
    \ the agrochemical industry and therefore cannot be reduced to it. Given this\
    \ case, the article approaches the construction of FLORA’s algorithms as a succession\
    \ of “layers of knowledge production” (Bechmann and Bowker 2019). My analysis\
    \ highlights how, at each of these layers, FLORA employees subject the phenomenon\
    \ of plant pathology to different practices of “selection” (Lynch 1990) to turn\
    \ it into something that can be recognized by algorithmic means. I argue that\
    \ these practices gradually inscribe a selective recognition of plant pathology\
    \ into PHYTØ’s algorithms, that is, a recognition that is effective in identifying\
    \ isolated plant damages on isolated crops, while ignoring most agroecosystem-related\
    \ actors and relations through which plant damages arise (e.g., crop varieties,\
    \ environmental stresses, cultivation practices). I develop this argument by tracing\
    \ in detail how, at each of the layers that constitute the construction of PHYTØ’s\
    \ algorithms, some aspects of the phenomenon of plant pathology are singled out\
    \ for recognition, while others are omitted as a concomitant effect. The article\
    \ concludes that a likely consequence of this selective recognition is that PHYTØ\
    \ unintentionally perpetuates or even exacerbates the pesticide use of its users.\
    \ This is because the app’s recognition of plant pathology as a phenomenon comprised\
    \ of isolated plant damages on isolated crops is more compatible with the use\
    \ of chemical pesticides than with approaches to crop protection that strive for\
    \ a more moderate use of these substances, such as integrated pest management\
    \ (IPM), agroecology, or organic farming. I develop my argument as follows: Section\
    \ two gives a more thorough introduction to the problem of the study by reviewing\
    \ existing critiques of agricultural big data and agricultural algorithms, before\
    \ making a case for studying agricultural algorithms in the making. Section three\
    \ outlines the case and the methodology through which the present article scrutinizes\
    \ the construction of agricultural algorithms. Section four presents the main\
    \ findings of the article by describing the different layers that constitute the\
    \ construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms and the selection practices these layers\
    \ entail. Lastly, section five closes the paper by discussing the wider implications\
    \ of its findings for debates on the link between digital agriculture technologies\
    \ and pesticide markets. Studying agricultural algorithms in the making Promises\
    \ and pitfalls of agricultural big data The ascent of agricultural image recognition\
    \ algorithms is closely intertwined with the rise of agricultural big data, since\
    \ most agricultural image recognition algorithms are built with datasets that\
    \ could be referred to as “big.” Consistent with general discourses on digital\
    \ agriculture, the ascent of agricultural big data is accompanied by the promise\
    \ that the phenomenon will help to feed the world’s growing population. STS-oriented\
    \ scholars, in contrast, generally take a more critical stance toward agricultural\
    \ big data. An early commentary comes from Bronson and Knezevic (2016) who reflect\
    \ on how novel big data collection and analytics tools affect power relations\
    \ among actors in agrifood systems. Situating themselves at the intersection of\
    \ critical data studies and critical food studies, the authors highlight the possible\
    \ concern that “Big Data is poised to reproduce long-standing relationships between\
    \ food system players” (p. 3). As an example, they invoke Monsanto’s free “Weed\
    \ ID” app arguing that it strengthens the company’s dominant market position by\
    \ helping users identify weeds and map weed pressure while at the same time “promoting\
    \ proprietary chemicals” (p. 2). Given such dynamics, the authors call for further\
    \ empirical work on the issue. In the same vein, Carbonell (2016) argues that\
    \ contemporary agriculture is witnessing a big data-induced power shift from small-scale\
    \ farmers to corporations. Among others, she describes this power shift as being\
    \ rooted, in the “selective use of big data in industrial agriculture” (p. 3).\
    \ By this she means that “[b]ig data and analytics on conventional industrial\
    \ farms […] focus almost exclusively on inputs and production” (ibid.) while neglecting\
    \ other important issues like “industrial agriculture externalities and vulnerabilities.”\
    \ Put simply, she argues that most agricultural big data projects privilege dominant\
    \ types of agricultural knowledge while negleting other already marginalized ones.\
    \ Shifting the focus away from the Global North, Fraser (2019) has undertaken\
    \ a comprehensive study of how big data affects farmers in the Global South. He\
    \ argues that the proliferation of big data-driven technologies should not be\
    \ conceptualized as an equitable “exchange” (e.g., user data in exchange for digital\
    \ services)—as the providers of these technologies often do—but as an opportunistic\
    \ “data grab,” that is, a process in which actors from the Global North deprive\
    \ farmers in the Global South of their data against their will. Building on this,\
    \ Fraser develops a second important argument. He argues that the specificity\
    \ of the effects of big data-driven technologies in the Global South lies in the\
    \ close intertwinement of processes of “data grabbing” and processes of “land\
    \ grabbing.” As he puts it, “land grabs in the twenty-first century will pivot\
    \ on digital knowledge” (p. 13)—an assessment that is consistent with latest research\
    \ on the financialization of farmland (Fairbairn 2020). Fairbairn and Kish (2022)\
    \ highlight another somewhat related aspect. As they argue, big data-driven technologies\
    \ are often framed as a means to solve “a data deficit among farmers” (p. 3).\
    \ As Fairbairn and Kish stress, this common rationale for diffusing big data-technologies\
    \ is problematic because it is largely oblivous of “how the structural residues\
    \ of colonialism, agricultural intensification, and neoliberal development policies\
    \ have played a role in producing farmer vulnerability in the first place” (p.\
    \ 9). In other words, they argue that current efforts to diffuse big data technologies\
    \ in countries of the Global South fall short of addressing the root causes of\
    \ the problems responsible for the current state of agriculture in these countries\
    \ which is why the respective innovations should be regarded as “technological\
    \ fixes” more than anything (Fairbairn et al. 2022; Fairbairn and Guthman 2020).\
    \ Taken together, this small selection of studies illustrates that the phenomenon\
    \ of agricultural big data is anything but neutral. More precisely, they illustrate\
    \ that the ways in which the respective technologies are developed, commercialized,\
    \ and circulated, raise numerous problems of politico-economic, epistemic, and\
    \ postcolonial nature, to name but a few, that need to be considered when analyzing\
    \ them. Problematic effects of agricultural algorithms Many, if not all, of the\
    \ technologies discussed in the previous subsection are equipped with algorithms\
    \ to analyze the growing amounts of data that they are confronted with. Yet, compared\
    \ to the attention that algorithms have received with respect to other application\
    \ areas—like surveillance (e.g., Introna and Wood 2002) or health care (Henwood\
    \ and Marent 2019)—the attention that they have attracted with respect to agriculture\
    \ is rather small. In this subsection, I present two STS-informed studies of agricultural\
    \ algorithms that help derive an approach for expanding social science and humanities\
    \ research on these emerging technologies. In a first important study, Miles (2019)\
    \ examines how algorithms have shaped the rise of digital agriculture. Through\
    \ an approach rooted in media studies, he develops the argument that algorithms\
    \ have enabled the rise of digital agriculture in two important ways. First, by\
    \ bringing into being an “algorithmic rationality” by which he means a “reorganization\
    \ of industry and reasoning upon rule-based grounds, fueled by the emergence of\
    \ capitalism and the liberal nation-state” (p. 5). Second, by giving rise to what\
    \ he calls “algorithmic epistemology” which he specifies as “a fetishization of\
    \ information that ascribes super-natural divination to digital technology” (p.\
    \ 5). Building on these considerations, Miles concludes that as long as algorithms\
    \ are deployed in capitalist systems of production, the knowledge they generate\
    \ will inevitably lead to a perpetuation of these systems. A second insightful,\
    \ somewhat less deterministic study on agricultural algorithms comes from Carolan\
    \ (2020). Invoking Latour’s (1999) concept of “chains of translation,” the study\
    \ scrutinizes what Carolan refers to as algorithmic “data value chains” (p. 1).\
    \ To do so, Carolan draws on qualitative interviews with “farmers, crop scientists,\
    \ statisticians, programmers, and senior leadership” (p. 1) who, taken together,\
    \ were involved with 91 different algorithm-based technologies. Analytically,\
    \ Carolan adapts Latour’s concept of “chains of translation” in two important\
    \ ways. First, he blends Latour’s focus on epistemic chains of reference with\
    \ a focus on politico-economic value chains. Second, he does not scrutinize one\
    \ “chain of reference” from beginning to end but many different ones, in fragments.\
    \ Through this, Carolan argues that the algorithms he studied give rise to different\
    \ kinds of “lock-in” (p. 2) effects, which he specifies as “a term used to describe\
    \ when seemingly small alterations produce immensely consequential pathways that\
    \ become calcified and resistant to change” (ibid.). As examples of such lock-in\
    \ effects, Carolan describes how one of the algorithms he looks at favors the\
    \ cultivation of monoculture-oriented crops like field corn and soy. Another example\
    \ he mentions is that a different platform makes users unlearn “local analogue\
    \ knowledge” (p.8) about soils or landscapes. Together, these two studies provide\
    \ fruitful insights regarding some of the problematic effects that agricultural\
    \ algorithms may have. However, they do not go into much detail about the actual\
    \ practices through which these effects arise, which is why the present article\
    \ suggests a slightly different approach for the study of agricultural algorithms.\
    \ Agricultural algorithms and the selective recognition of plant pathology The\
    \ purpose of this study is to delve deeper into the practical causes of the sometimes-problematic\
    \ effects of agricultural algorithms. How is it that some agricultural algorithms\
    \ promote monocultures or contribute to a disappearance of local knowledge? To\
    \ explore such questions, this article examines the construction of a set of algorithms\
    \ deployed in a single agricultural technology in-depth. The study is greatly\
    \ inspired by a growing strand of ethnographic research concerned with the analysis\
    \ of algorithms in the making (Bechmann and Bowker 2019; Jaton 2017, 2021; Mackenzie\
    \ 2015; Seaver 2017). As Jaton (2017, 2021) puts it, the necessity of such an\
    \ approach lies in the problem that the concrete practices involved in the construction\
    \ of algorithms are invisible in most cases, and that this invisibility can lead\
    \ to societal tensions. To illustrate this “negative invisibility” (Star and Strauss\
    \ 1999) Jaton invokes different examples such as the controversy regarding the\
    \ role of the Facebook algorithm in the election of Donald Trump, the use of algorithms\
    \ by police departments to create profiles of potential perpetrators, or the various\
    \ biases (e.g., gender, age, skin color) that have been identified in facial recognition\
    \ algorithms. Even though a little less explicit in their political significance—and\
    \ therefore perhaps far less discussed to date—the examples of agricultural algorithms\
    \ and their problematic effects described in the previous section could be added\
    \ to this list. In light of such examples, Jaton (2021) stresses that “making\
    \ the work practices that underlie algorithms’ veracities more visible” (p. 85),\
    \ should be seen as a first step in developing algorithms that are more aligned\
    \ with values that societies deem desirable. In this endeavor, Jaton draws inspiration\
    \ from an autoethnographic study by Bechmann and Bowker (2019). In said study,\
    \ the authors chose the rather unconventional approach of developing different\
    \ algorithms themselves, while documenting their work practices. Among others,\
    \ they designed an image recognition algorithm to perform a gender classification\
    \ based on user images retrieved from Facebook. In developing this algorithm,\
    \ they identified five important “layers of knowledge production” (p. 1), namely\
    \ “problem definition,” “data collection,” “data cleaning,” “model selection,”\
    \ and “model training.” They argue that the work practices they had to perform\
    \ at each of these layers had potential “discriminatory consequences” (p. 7).\
    \ As an example, with regard to the layer of problem definition, they mention\
    \ how their decision to build an algorithm to perform a binary gender classification\
    \ (for reasons of technical simplicity) resulted in an image recognition algorithm\
    \ that discriminated against people who do not identify as men or women. Referring\
    \ to the layer of data collection, another example they mention is how their choice\
    \ to train their algorithm based on images of Facebook users discriminated against\
    \ Facebook non-users. This might manifest, for instance, in the algorithm classifying\
    \ people of a certain age group more accurately than others. Simply put, this\
    \ article translates Bechmann and Bowker’s (2019) concern with the construction\
    \ of algorithms and the accompanying discriminatory effects to the realm of agriculture.\
    \ Yet, considering that PHYTØ’s image recognition algorithms are designed to classify\
    \ plant damages, the article does not scrutinize how their construction process\
    \ is accompanied by discrimination but by “selection.” To this end, the article\
    \ draws on a pragmatist conceptualization of selection in scientific work. As\
    \ Lynch (1990) puts it “[s]election concerns the way scientific methods of visualization\
    \ simplify and schematize objects of study” (p. 153). He highlights that selection\
    \ should be seen as a simultaneous process of reducing and adding to the phenomena\
    \ under study that gradually leads to a visualization with a high degree of facticity:\
    \ On the one hand, scientists simplify the phenomena they study in order to translate\
    \ their complexity into texts, figures, or diagrams. On the other hand, they add\
    \ to these phenomena by highlighting certain aspects of them. Drawing these two\
    \ theoretical influences together, this article assumes that the construction\
    \ of the image recognition algorithms deployed in PHYTØ must be regarded as a\
    \ succession of layers, at each of which the startup’s employees engage in different\
    \ selection practices. These selection practices single out some aspects of the\
    \ phenomenon of plant pathology to make them algorithmically recognizable, while\
    \ omitting other aspects as a concomitant effect. Overall, these selection practices\
    \ lead to what I refer to as a selective recognition of plant pathology—a recognition\
    \ that is effective in identifying isolated plant damages on isolated crops, while\
    \ ignoring most agroecosystem-related actors and relations through which plant\
    \ damages arise. To explore the emergence of PHYTØ’s selective recognition, the\
    \ article addresses the following two closely related questions: How do the employees\
    \ of FLORA construct image recognition algorithms for the recognition of plant\
    \ pathology problems, and how do they select the aspects of plant pathology that\
    \ are to be recognized by PHYTØ and those that are not? Case and methodology The\
    \ paper consists of a qualitative single-case study (Yin 2009) centred on the\
    \ agtech startup FLORA. The startup in question was founded in 2015 as a spin-off\
    \ of a German university. In 2020, FLORA had already raised five rounds of venture\
    \ capital funding with a total volume of about 20 million Euros. At the time of\
    \ writing, FLORA’s website reports three offices (Berlin, Indore, Hyderabad),\
    \ 200 employees, and “70,000 daily active app users.” Furthermore, the website\
    \ reports that PHYTØ covers “30 major crops” while being able to recognize “500\
    \ plant damages.” To achieve this, the team of the startup had to construct a\
    \ specific algorithm for each crop and plant damage. Hence, whenever the FLORA\
    \ team decides to add new crops or plant damages to PHYTØ’s diagnostic portfolio,\
    \ it has to construct new algorithms. This article explores the situated practices\
    \ that make up this work. The data for this research project was collected between\
    \ November 2018 and November 2021 as part of an “organizational ethnography” (Neyland\
    \ 2008). Inspired by sociological and anthropological analyses of high-tech startups\
    \ as spaces of knowledge production (Fochler 2016; Rabinow 1997; Smith-Doerr 2005),\
    \ the idea behind this research design is to allow for an in-depth immersion into\
    \ the work practices at FLORA. On a more specific level, the article draws methodological\
    \ inspiration from the already mentioned article by Bechmann and Bowker (2019),\
    \ in that it traces the work that is carried out at the different “layers” that\
    \ constitute the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms. Unlike Bechmann and Bowker,\
    \ however, the article does not rely on autoethnography, but on more classical\
    \ forms of ethnographic data collection. Consistent with suggestions made by Creswell\
    \ et al. (2007) \uFEFFfor case study research, the article uses different types\
    \ of qualitative data. First, it mobilizes observational data collected during\
    \ a total of 13 weeks of ethnographic fieldwork at FLORA’s offices in Germany\
    \ and India, which included accompanying the employees of the startup in the field.\
    \ Second, the article relies on interviews with different members of the FLORA\
    \ team who are closely involved in the development of the image recognition algorithms\
    \ (n = 8). Third, it integrates insights from different documents that circulate\
    \ within FLORA (n = 11). Data analysis proceeded through thematic analysis (Braun\
    \ and Clarke 2006). In a first step, all of the above materials were assembled\
    \ in a dataset documenting the various practices performed in the construction\
    \ of FLORA’s algorithms. Subsequently, the most important layers of this construction\
    \ process were identified by searching the dataset for recurring references to\
    \ practical problems. This second, relatively straightforward step led to a subdivision\
    \ of the results section into the following five layers: Delineating problems,\
    \ collecting data, preparing data, transfer learning, representing results. In\
    \ a final step, these layers were analyzed with respect to the selections they\
    \ entail. The following section presents the results of this analysis layer by\
    \ layer. The five layers of PHYTØ’s algorithms Defining problems The first layer\
    \ in the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms consists of defining the problems\
    \ that the app is intended to solve. The empirical basis of this subsection consists\
    \ of scientific articles on the development of image recognition algorithms for\
    \ plant pathology, interviews with two of the co-founders of FLORA, and interviews\
    \ with two of the plant pathology experts working for the startup. As I will show,\
    \ the two main selection practices on this layer are “deciding on a machine learning\
    \ problem” and “prioritizing crops and plant damages.” Deciding on a machine learning\
    \ problem A selection practice at the root of all algorithms developed by FLORA\
    \ is the initial decision on the type of machine learning problem that each algorithm\
    \ shall solve. In the case of PHYTØ, this problem is always the same: classifying\
    \ crops and plant damages. As one of the co-founders recalled in an interview,\
    \ they first got the idea for PHYTØ while reading an agricultural informatics\
    \ article by Barbedo (2013). Said article reviews computational methods to address\
    \ the closely related problems of detecting, quantifying, and classifying plant\
    \ diseases based on digital images of their symptoms. As Barbedo defines it, “detection”\
    \ is a problem in which an algorithm is supposed to recognize one disease among\
    \ many possible diseases that the algorithm is not required to recognize. By “quantification”\
    \ he refers to a problem in which an algorithm is meant to determine the severity\
    \ of a disease by evaluating the surface area covered by its symptoms. Lastly,\
    \ and most influential for FLORA, Barbedo reviews “classification” methods that\
    \ aim to recognize “whichever pathology […] is affecting the plant” (p. 6). One\
    \ of the classification methods Barbedo highlights in his review are “neural networks”—the\
    \ method that the developers of PHYTØ would opt for. As examples for this method,\
    \ he cites a study in which Sanyal et al. (2007) propose a neural network to classify\
    \ six different mineral deficiencies in rice plants. Another example he mentions\
    \ is an article by Kai et al. (2011) in which the authors train a neural network\
    \ to recognize three kinds of diseases in maize. Based on such examples, Barbedo\
    \ criticizes that the algorithms that are suggested in the respective articles\
    \ are far “too specific” (p. 10), as they are only able to detect a few plant\
    \ damages, on a few crops. The developers of PHYTØ took this criticism to heart\
    \ in that they set out to develop an app for classifying significantly more crops\
    \ and plant damages. Nevertheless, Barbedo’s overview illustrates how deciding\
    \ on a machine learning problem is a practice of selection. FLORA decided to develop\
    \ classification algorithms. This decision entails that PHYTØ’s algorithms, once\
    \ finalized, are able to classify a finite number of isolated crops and plant\
    \ damages. Simultaneously, it entails that PHYTØ’s algorithms ignore other agroecosystem-related\
    \ actors and relations. This can be illustrated with an example: Because FLORA’s\
    \ decision for classification algorithms implied a decision against quantification\
    \ algorithms, PHYTØ is not able to recognize the severity of plant damages. A\
    \ possible consequence of this is an increased use of chemical pesticides by farmers.\
    \ This is because crop protection approaches intended to reduce pesticide use,\
    \ such as IPM, are particularly dependent on knowledge regarding the severity\
    \ of plant damages. The reason is that this knowledge is needed to verify whether\
    \ or not pest pressure exceeds a threshold that justifies the use of chemical\
    \ pesticides. Prioritizing crops and plant damages Since FLORA’s resources for\
    \ developing new image recognition algorithms are limited, and the startup therefore\
    \ cannot develop algorithms for recognizing all existing crops and plant damages,\
    \ the second important selection practice on this layer consists of prioritizing\
    \ the crops and plant damages that ought to be recognized by PHYTØ. As the head\
    \ of FLORA’s “plant team” recalled in an interview, in prioritizing the crops\
    \ that ought to be recognized by PHYTØ they initially relied mainly on publicly\
    \ accessible FAO statistics to find out which crops were grown the most in the\
    \ countries they targeted (e.g., Brazil, Mali, India). In addition, they consulted\
    \ local experts to further refine their prioritizations. Yet, the more images\
    \ FLORA received on a daily basis, the more independent the startup became from\
    \ external statistics. As explained by the head of the plant team, once they had\
    \ managed to establish a stable flow of incoming images, they created their own\
    \ user-specific prioritizations of crops. As an example, his team found out that\
    \ although tea is grown in many regions of India, they received few photos of\
    \ that particular crop because the farmers in question usually have specialized\
    \ extension agents and do not use PHYTØ. In the same vein, the FLORA team needs\
    \ to prioritize the plant damages that ought to be recognized by PHYTØ. A long-time\
    \ employee of the plant team put it like this: “You have to find your enemies.\
    \ […] You can’t start at A and in two years you’ll be at Z. You just have to find\
    \ the most important pathogens […].” As the employee continued to explain: “There\
    \ are 100 different pathogens per crop. You can’t build a database for everything,\
    \ but you can work through the twenty most important ones.” To this end, as with\
    \ crops, the FLORA team initially relied on publicly available statistics, scientific\
    \ literature, and expert opinions to establish a first prioritization of plant\
    \ damages. Subsequently, once the startup had established a sufficient number\
    \ of incoming images per day, FLORA’s plant team began to increasingly examine\
    \ this stream of incoming images to identify plant damages that were most common\
    \ among PHYTØ users. In summary, prioritizing crops and plant damages is a selection\
    \ practice, since it pretty straightforwardly defines which crops and plant damages\
    \ will be recognized by PHYTØ, and which will not. At the same time, selecting\
    \ some crops and plant damages to be recognized implies that other crops and plant\
    \ damages are excluded from recognition. In the case of PHYTØ, this is most apparent\
    \ in the exclusion of rare crops and plant damages. As for crops, it can be argued\
    \ with Carolan (2020) that this exclusion creates a “lock-in” effect in that PHYTØ’s\
    \ diagnostic capacity incentivizes the cultivation of commonly grown crops and\
    \ disincentivizes the cultivation of rarely grown crops, thereby homogenizing\
    \ agroecosystems. As for plant damages, the case of PHYTØ demonstrates a neglect\
    \ of knowledge production regarding rare plant damages. Generating data The second\
    \ layer in the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms consists of generating data\
    \ regarding the crops and plant damages that the app is supposed to recognize.\
    \ The empirical material used to describe this layer consists of observations,\
    \ interviews, and documents centered on FLORA’s so-called “picture hunters,” a\
    \ group of trained experts employed by the startup to generate data in a targeted\
    \ fashion. The two most important selection practices on this layer are “hunting\
    \ pictures” and “taking good pictures.” Hunting pictures Most of the data that\
    \ FLORA requires to develop new algorithms is generated through a practice that\
    \ the team of the startup calls “picture hunting.” In brief, picture hunting means\
    \ sending workers with plant pathology expertise into random or pre-selected fields\
    \ to take pictures of specific plant damages occurring on specific crops. FLORA\
    \ has been relying on picture hunting since its beginnings in Germany in 2014.\
    \ As of 2016, the startup began developing PHYTØ almost exclusively for India.\
    \ To accomplish this localization, FLORA employed up to ten picture hunters at\
    \ a time, on temporary contracts, in order to quickly produce the images needed\
    \ to develop the algorithms that its team deemed necessary for Indian users. In\
    \ February 2019, during my fieldwork in India, I met with one of FLORA’s picture\
    \ hunters, a young man named Amar, who lived in the city of Bapatla. More precisely,\
    \ one of the employees of FLORA’s regional office near Hyderabad, Dinesh, who\
    \ accompanied me on the six-hour bus drive to Bapatla, had asked Amar if he would\
    \ be willing to give me an interview, and show me his work, to which the picture\
    \ hunter agreed. As Amar explained, after finishing school he had studied agriculture\
    \ and then worked as an agricultural extension agent for eight years. In this\
    \ time, he had been collaborating occasionally with the current head of FLORA’s\
    \ office near Hyderabad, a senior researcher at the International Crops Research\
    \ Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT). Through this professional connection,\
    \ Amar was eventually offered a job as a picture hunter which he gladly accepted.\
    \ After the interview, Amar, Dinesh, and I drove to a nearby village. There I\
    \ was given the opportunity to observe the actual practice of picture hunting\
    \ from up close: Having arrived in the village, Amar, Dinesh, and I headed to\
    \ a nearby chili field. Once we reached the field, we walked along its edge while\
    \ observing the plants that passed us by. At some point, after a minute or two,\
    \ the men stopped walking. They both looked at a chili plant that was smaller\
    \ than the others and whose leaves looked yellowish and shrivelled. The plant\
    \ looked sick. Standing in front of the plant, the two men exchanged a few sentences\
    \ in Telugu which I did not understand. At some point, Dinesh bent down to the\
    \ plant, and broke off a stem holding it in front of them for closer examination.\
    \ After a couple of seconds, the men seemed to have reached an agreement. Amar\
    \ took a smartphone out of his pocket, preparing himself to take a picture of\
    \ the sick plant. To do this, he swiped and tapped the screen of his smartphone\
    \ a few times, bent his knees slightly, and then took several photos of the plant\
    \ from slightly different angles and distances. The app that Amar used for this\
    \ work was not PHYTØ, but a different app called COLLECTØ which the FLORA team\
    \ had developed specifically for the purpose of picture hunting. As COLLECTØ is\
    \ a tool for data generation alone, the app does not provide diagnoses. Instead,\
    \ it asks its users to identify both the crop and the plant damage they intend\
    \ to photograph themselves. In this way, COLLECTØ generates pictures that are\
    \ referred to as “labeled,” that is, equipped with a digital name tag indicating\
    \ the depicted crop and plant damage—an important prerequisite for training of\
    \ new algorithms. In short, the practice of picture hunting constitutes a selection\
    \ practice in that it reduces the phenomenon of plant pathology as it occurs in\
    \ the field into a narrow set of “inscriptions” (Latour and Woolgar 1986)—namely\
    \ digital images and name tags of crops and plant damages—that can be translated\
    \ into new algorithms. At the same time, the practice also implies that most of\
    \ the situated agroecosystem-related actors and relations through which a given\
    \ plant damage occurs be left in the field. What plants are growing next to the\
    \ diseased crop? What animals surround it? What is the soil like in which it grows?\
    \ We do not know, and picture hunters are not supposed to produce any data to\
    \ that effect. However, it is precisely such data that is important for alternative\
    \ approaches to crop protection (e.g., IPM, agroecology, organic farming). Taking\
    \ good pictures Besides searching, identifying, and labeling plant damages, picture\
    \ hunters are expected to photograph them in a particular way. Thinking back to\
    \ the previous subsection, Amar did not take the photos of the diseased chili\
    \ plant just anyhow. Instead, he positioned his body and his smartphone in front\
    \ of the plant in a way that seemed to follow a certain protocol. This protocol\
    \ is defined in a PowerPoint presentation created by the German FLORA team. The\
    \ title of that presentation is “Taking good pictures for image recognition -\
    \ Short guide.” The declared goal of the presentation is to teach prospective\
    \ picture hunters how to take “good pictures.” As the presentation explains on\
    \ the first slide, “[a] crucial limitation of image recognition performance has\
    \ to do with picture quality” specifying that if the images that are used for\
    \ developing new algorithms are of “bad” quality the classification performance\
    \ of these algorithms will also turn out to be bad. To explain this distinction,\
    \ the presentation lists six qualities which, according to its creators, determine\
    \ whether pictures count as good or bad. These qualities are “distance,” “sharpness,”\
    \ “brightness,” “background,” “camera (settings),” and “reflection.” The presentation\
    \ then devotes one slide to each of these criteria providing sample images and\
    \ brief instructions. The slide dedicated to “distance,” for example, shows three\
    \ pictures of entire crops instead of only their leaves and explains “Plants are\
    \ too distant. Details are lacking. You can’t see any symptoms.” In a similar\
    \ vein, the slide concerned with “reflection,” presents four images with strong\
    \ light reflections and provides the explanation that “Backlight, sunlight and\
    \ flash may cause reflections that disturb a good performance.” As these examples\
    \ make clear, the presentation is intended to teach picture hunters how PHYTØ’s\
    \ nascent algorithms process digital photographs—an algorithm-informed way of\
    \ looking at plant damages that is quite different from the way human plant pathology\
    \ experts look at them. The difference between these two ways of looking at plant\
    \ damages is most noticeable on the slide concerning the quality criterion background.\
    \ To familiarize prospective picture hunters with the peculiarities of the quality\
    \ criterion background, the slide shows several pictures from FLORA’s database\
    \ that, while all displaying manifestations of plant damages that would likely\
    \ be recognized by a human specialist—as the depicted crops and symptoms of plant\
    \ damages can be seen well—likewise contain backgrounds that are likely to diminish\
    \ the diagnostic performance of PHYTØ’s nascent algorithms by containing atypical\
    \ features. As an example, a photo on the slide shows a leaf with distinct yellowish\
    \ discoloration—a clear indication of a plant damage. However, while taking the\
    \ photo, the user who uploaded the picture held the leaf in front of the rear\
    \ of a silver car, which is clearly visible in the background. The slide criticizes\
    \ this practice by explaining that in that image the “[m]ost visible patterns\
    \ stem from background.” Another example contained on the slide is a shriveled\
    \ leaf with light lesions lying on a colorful patterned surface that could be\
    \ a tablecloth or a piece of wrapping paper. In this case, the slide criticizes\
    \ that “[a] lot of artificial background is shown.” As can be inferred from these\
    \ examples, although the leaves of the crops and the symptoms of the plant damages\
    \ that affect them are clearly visible, the images are considered as “bad” because\
    \ their background is either too “artificial” or has too “visible patterns.” Even\
    \ though the images may be meaningful to the eye of a human plant pathologist,\
    \ they count as bad within the startup and will not be used in the development\
    \ of new algorithms because they do not meet the technical quality standards prescribed\
    \ by PHYTØ. To sum up, taking good pictures constitutes a selection practices\
    \ in that it further narrows the already narrow range of inscriptions of plant\
    \ pathology that picture hunters produce. For one, taking good pictures leads\
    \ to a set of algorithms that “perform well.” For another, it sets a new algorithm-centered\
    \ norm of what counts as plant pathology (“good pictures”) and what does not (“bad\
    \ pictures”). The result is a diagnostic technology that recognizes typical manifestations\
    \ of plant damages relatively well, while recognizing atypical manifestations\
    \ of plant damages or atypically photographed plant damages less well. Preparing\
    \ data The third layer in the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms consists of preparing\
    \ the data that reaches the servers of the startup. The empirical basis for the\
    \ description of this layer is formed by interviews with and observations of two\
    \ FLORA employees in charge of this work. The two primary selection practices\
    \ on this layer are “sorting out garbage” and “labeling pictures” (the latter\
    \ of which already briefly appeared in the subsection on hunting pictures). Sorting\
    \ out garbage A first important practice in preparing the images uploaded by regular\
    \ PHYTØ users, consists of sorting out the ones that do not depict crops or plant\
    \ damages, or as the team of the startup puts it, images that depict “garbage.”\
    \ The remaining images serve FLORA to supplement the images collected by the picture\
    \ hunters. As the employee responsible for maintaining FLORA’s image database\
    \ explained in an interview, the ratio of these discarded images is relatively\
    \ high: “[W]e are at 40,000, 50,000 pictures a day, but you have to consider,\
    \ about 50% of them are some kind of fooling around, so, garbage, not a plant.”\
    \ More specifically, the FLORA team distinguishes only between two categories,\
    \ “garbage” and “interesting.” In the early days of FLORA, the work of assigning\
    \ images to these categories was carried out by human freelancers. Relatively\
    \ shortly after the launch of PHYTØ, however, these freelancers were replaced\
    \ by an image recognition algorithm capable of distinguishing whether a given\
    \ picture depicted a plant or not. As in the case of any image recognition algorithm,\
    \ the classifications of this algorithm are not always correct. As a typical source\
    \ of error, the computer scientist mentioned that the algorithm would sometimes\
    \ classify pictures of certain atypically looking flowers as “garbage,” since\
    \ it is not attuned to their visual patterns. In short, sorting out “garbage”\
    \ is a selection practice in that it filters the images that reach the startup\
    \ every day. On the one hand, this practice helps to maintain the quality of FLORA’s\
    \ image database since it keeps out most images that do not depict crops or plant\
    \ damages. On the other hand, it can lead to what might be referred to as “collateral\
    \ damage,” in that pictures of atypical crops or plant damages are sorted out.\
    \ In short, then, we are again faced with a narrowing or simplification of what\
    \ should and should not be recognized as plant pathology. Labeling pictures The\
    \ second, and more time-consuming, practice in preparing FLORA’s data consists\
    \ of “labeling” it. As already touched upon, the notion of labeling designates\
    \ the practice of attaching a digital name tag to a given picture. To be precise,\
    \ labeling is a two-step practice: Initially, a first expert is required to attach\
    \ a name tag of a crop or plant damage to an image she would like to process—a\
    \ work that is also referred to as “pre-labeling.” This expert can be both a picture\
    \ hunter in the field using COLLECTØ or a FLORA employee at a desk browsing through\
    \ the startups database. To do so, these experts use a digital interface called\
    \ “Kangaroo.” The next step requires a second expert, also using Kangaroo, to\
    \ “validate” the label selected by the first expert. Once this validation is completed,\
    \ an image counts as “labeled” and is eligible for “training.” A video tutorial\
    \ on how to use Kangaroo that is circulated within FLORA, provides an impression\
    \ of how Kangaroo structures the work of labeling. In the tutorial a FLORA employee\
    \ searches the startup’s image database for all images of cotton—a search that\
    \ is executed by FLORA’s already deployed algorithms for recognizing crops. Subsequently,\
    \ the employee searches the results manually for images of a cotton disease for\
    \ which the startup aims to develop a new, or refine an existing, algorithm by\
    \ clicking through the search results. To facilitate the task of labeling, Kangaroo\
    \ provides users with additional information related to the displayed images:\
    \ A light gray box on the left of the user interface lists additional information\
    \ that was attached to the images in question in the moment they were taken. A\
    \ light gray box on the right side of the image, shows classification results\
    \ that these images produced in running through FLORA’s already deployed algorithms.\
    \ These classification results include the depicted crop (e.g., “Cotton”), the\
    \ depicted plant damage (e.g., “Tobacco Caterpillar”), and a probability for the\
    \ classification of that plant damage (e.g., “55/100”). The remaining task for\
    \ the Kangaroo user is to decide which disease label to attach to the image on\
    \ the screen before the image is eventually cleared for validation. In summary,\
    \ labeling is a selection practice in that it determines which images in FLORA’s\
    \ database are used for training new algorithms. For one thing, labelling prepares\
    \ parts of FLORA’s image data for training, by equipping it with unambiguous name\
    \ tags. For another, labeling creates new residual categories of “things that\
    \ are hard to classify” (Bowker 2000, p. 661). As an example, FLORA categorically\
    \ excludes images of leaves affected by multiple plant damages at the same time.\
    \ This is because such combinations of plant damage are less common and therefore\
    \ it would require more resources to collect the required number of images to\
    \ develop the appropriate classification algorithms. Thus, again, agroecosystemic\
    \ complexity is weighed against economic constraints, with the latter ultimately\
    \ drawing the longer straw. Transfer learning The fourth layer in the construction\
    \ of PHYTØ’s image recognition consists of a process that computer scientists\
    \ refer to as “transfer learning.” The description of this layer is based on two\
    \ interviews with the computer scientist in charge of this process, in which a\
    \ PowerPoint presentation that he had created for due diligence purposes served\
    \ as a stimulus. The two main selection practices on this layer are “preparing\
    \ datasets” and “training algorithms.” Preparing datasets According to the computer\
    \ scientist, the most work-intensive task in shaping new algorithms consists of\
    \ preparing the required datasets. At the time of the interview, FLORA had about\
    \ “about 15 million pictures” in its database of which “about 500,000” were labeled.\
    \ Again, a smaller proportion of these labeled images, the computer scientist\
    \ continued, was actually “validated” too, and thus qualified to be included in\
    \ one of the datasets that he assembled for the training of new algorithms. As\
    \ he explained it, there is a certain threshold of “at least fifty pictures per\
    \ class” 3 below which it would not make sense to begin with the preparation of\
    \ datasets. Provided that this threshold is met the next important task that the\
    \ computer scientist performs consists of splitting the images into a “training”\
    \ dataset (or “set” in short) and a “test” set (or “evaluation” set), wherein\
    \ he puts one-third of the images in the training set and two-thirds in the test\
    \ set. As the computer scientist put it, the training set serves him to extract\
    \ the visual patterns of the crops or plant damages that are depicted on the images\
    \ it contains and to translate these patterns into machine-readable code. The\
    \ result of this work is an algorithm that has “learned” the visual patterns of\
    \ all the images contained in the training set. In a second step, the resulting\
    \ algorithm is evaluated by being confronted with the test set. The aim of this\
    \ evaluation is to find out how well the new algorithm classifies images of crops\
    \ or plant damages that are “unknown” to it. Since all utilized images have been\
    \ manually labeled beforehand, it is now possible to draw a comparison between\
    \ how the nascent algorithm classifies the test set and how FLORA’s human experts\
    \ have classified it beforehand, and to thereby determine its “accuracy.” However,\
    \ as the computer scientist continued to explain, distributing pictures across\
    \ the train and the test set is “not so trivial” since an unthoughtful distribution\
    \ can cause problems that reduce the performance of the prospective algorithms.\
    \ The most important of these problems is known as “overfitting.” In a nutshell,\
    \ computer scientists use the term overfitting to refer to situations in which\
    \ a becoming algorithm adjusts itself to visual patterns in the training data\
    \ that are too specific and do not generalize to unknown data. Thus, a classical\
    \ indicator of overfitting is that the classifications of a nascent algorithm\
    \ are correct much more often when analyzing the training set than when analyzing\
    \ the test set. The computer scientist described several practices through which\
    \ he attempts to avoid overfitting: First, adding more data to the training set.\
    \ Although the computer scientist generally follows the above-mentioned rule of\
    \ at least 50 pictures, there is no fixed number of pictures that must be included\
    \ in a training set to avoid overfitting. A general rule, however, is that more\
    \ data yields better algorithms than less data. A second practice the computer\
    \ scientist applies to prevent overfitting is called “data augmentation.” Simply\
    \ put, data augmentation means randomly rotating, enlarging, or adding color filters\
    \ to the images of the training set in order to diversify it and thus increase\
    \ the classificatory performance of the algorithms that are trained with it. Another\
    \ practice or rule that the computer scientist described is to never split the\
    \ images uploaded by one user across the training and test set, provided that\
    \ the respective user uploaded more than one image (which is especially prevalent\
    \ in the case of picture hunters). According to the computer scientist, the reason\
    \ for applying this rule is that if the images in the training set and the test\
    \ set are too similar (e.g., shape of the leaf, lighting conditions, background\
    \ details), the resulting algorithm will “memorize” these similarities, rather\
    \ than classifying the depicted plant damage based on more universal visual patterns.\
    \ In sum, the practice of preparing datasets constitutes a selection practice\
    \ in that it ultimately defines the images whose visual patterns are “learned”\
    \ by FLORA’s becoming algorithms. The consequences of this practice are closely\
    \ related to those of the practice of labeling images. More specifically, the\
    \ practice of preparing datasets explains why FLORA requires a certain number\
    \ of images to create algorithms that perform well, and why the startup’s team\
    \ thus feels compelled to ignore rarer manifestations of plant damages that are\
    \ more difficult to get images of. Training algorithms Compared to the preparation\
    \ of data sets, the actual training of new algorithms represents a rather small\
    \ fraction of the computer scientist’s day-to-day work. As he put it, “this normal\
    \ training that’s relatively trivial but preparing datasets, that’s quite tricky.”\
    \ One reason for this perceived triviality of training PHYTØ’s algorithms is that\
    \ in transfer learning developers take an algorithm that has been trained for\
    \ a certain classification task (e.g., recognizing balloons) as a basis for a\
    \ new algorithm meant to perform a different classification task (e.g., recognizing\
    \ cars). In the case of PHYTØ’s image recognition algorithms, the algorithm of\
    \ origin is an algorithm called “GoogLeNet” which has been developed by the Google\
    \ scientists Szegedy et al. (2015). In its development process GoogLeNet was trained\
    \ on a freely available database called “ImageNet” containing more than 14 million\
    \ hand-labelled images covering approximately 20,000 different categories (e.g.,\
    \ mushroom, umbrella, coffee mug). Given this pre-trained algorithm, FLORA’s computer\
    \ scientist explained that his task in training PHYTØ’s algorithms would essentially\
    \ consist of adapting GoogLeNet to FLORA’s needs. As he explained it, image recognition\
    \ algorithms consist of different layers (not to be confused with the layers that\
    \ form the analytical unit of this article), all of which are designed to recognize\
    \ different visual “features,” where the first layers are designed to recognize\
    \ more general or “low-level features” (e.g., colors, edges, blobs) while the\
    \ latter are meant to recognize more specific or “high-level features” (e.g.,\
    \ facial expressions, objects, animals). As he summed it up, in training he would\
    \ simply “chop off” the last layer of the 22-layered GoogLeNet algorithm and replace\
    \ it with a new layer that was attuned to the specific visual features of FLORA’s\
    \ image database. This work of replacing the last layer begins, with the definition\
    \ of the number of “epochs,” that is, the number of times the becoming algorithm\
    \ is supposed to analyze the relevant data sets (e.g., images of “fall armyworm”\
    \ in “maize”) in a training process. Then the computer scientist initiates the\
    \ actual training process. During this analysis, the “weights” of the becoming\
    \ algorithm, that is, its numerical features, change with each epoch in relation\
    \ to the specificities of the analyzed dataset. The result of this process is\
    \ a graph showing how the classificatory performance of the respective algorithm\
    \ has changed in the course of the epochs. This classificatory performance can\
    \ be expressed with various metrics. A common metric for this purpose is “accuracy,”\
    \ which is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total\
    \ number of predictions. Once a certain number of these trainings have been completed,\
    \ the computer scientist evaluates their results. As he put it, “in the end you\
    \ get an Excel sheet with accuracies for different disease-plant combinations.”\
    \ In evaluating the results listed in this Excel sheet, the computer scientist\
    \ is in close exchange with the employees of the plant team. The way he explained\
    \ it, “typically, this table goes to the plant experts, who look over it, to see\
    \ if they notice anything that might be a mistake.” An example of how such a mistake\
    \ might manifest itself is that the plant team might find that the accuracy for\
    \ a particular plant damage in a particular crop is very low, even though the\
    \ computer scientist had calculated a higher one in a previous training. As he\
    \ pointed out, he would usually correct such errors through “trial by error,”\
    \ that is by changing the dataset or the code of the algorithm while hoping “that\
    \ it [the accuracy] gets better somehow.” Lastly, “when the results are useful,”\
    \ he continued to explain, “I just have to switch them live.” In summary, training\
    \ algorithms is a selection practice in that the computer scientist is required\
    \ to determine at what point a nascent algorithm is ready to be deployed. If the\
    \ FLORA team has worked meticulously throughout all the previous layers, the training\
    \ results in a new algorithm capable of recognizing a particular plant damage\
    \ in a particular crop with a high degree of accuracy. In case something went\
    \ wrong on one of the previous layers, the computer scientist must work with the\
    \ plant team to identify the source of error and see that it is corrected, before\
    \ reinitiating training. It is this fragility of PHYTØ’s becoming algorithms,\
    \ which is particularly tangible at this point, that explains the rigorous selection\
    \ of the FLORA team across the previous layers. Representing results The fifth\
    \ layer in the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms consists of representing their\
    \ classificatory results. The description of this layer is also based on the interview\
    \ with the computer scientist that formed the basis of the previous subsection,\
    \ and by two documents circulating within the startup. Unlike the previous subsections,\
    \ this subsection describes only one selection practice, namely “displaying diagnoses.”\
    \ Displaying diagnoses Once the algorithms developed by the FLORA team are deployed\
    \ in PHYTØ, the actual classification of incoming pictures is carried out by a\
    \ server that the team of the startup refers to as “Butterfly.” Within Butterfly,\
    \ six different algorithms work together to generate PHYTØ’s final diagnoses.\
    \ In our interview, the computer scientist pointed out that when an image is uploaded\
    \ by a user all these six algorithms operate simultaneously, with the analytical\
    \ process taking “roughly a second.” Besides the aforementioned algorithms for\
    \ the recognition of crops and plant damages, also referred to as “Crop Net” and\
    \ “Disease Net,” Butterfly comprises the “Object Net,” capable of detecting whether\
    \ an object other than a crop is depicted on an uploaded image. Another algorithm,\
    \ the “Quality Net” serves the purpose of determining whether there are any quality\
    \ problems with the image that might affect its classification such as the picture\
    \ being “too blurry.” Fifth, the “Species Net” serves the purpose of determining\
    \ whether other species are shown in the image. Lastly, there is “Weevil,” which,\
    \ as the computer scientist put it, “is a kind of meta net that takes all the\
    \ outputs from these nets and then decides what should be displayed in the app.”\
    \ As for the outputs of Weevil the FLORA team has defined different thresholds\
    \ (probabilities) in relation to which PHYTØ’s user interface displays diagnostic\
    \ results differently. First, if the probability that Weevil calculates for a\
    \ plant damage exceeds a certain threshold PHYTØ displays an unambiguous classification\
    \ like “Potassium Deficiency.” Second, if Weevil calculates a relatively high\
    \ probability for multiple plant damages, PHYTØ’s user interface shows a list\
    \ of these plant damages and invites users to make the final classification by\
    \ themselves. Third, there are situations in which PHYTØ displays an error message\
    \ to its users, for example, when the “Crop Net” or the “Disease Net” do not calculate\
    \ a sufficiently high probability for an uploaded image, or when the “Object Net”\
    \ calculates a particularly high probability. Overall, this way of displaying\
    \ the classifications of PHYTØ aims to minimize the number of false positive diagnoses\
    \ generated by the app, as these might cause damage to crops and ultimately lead\
    \ to dissatisfied users. To sum up, the selection practices of all previous layers\
    \ culminate in the display of diagnoses. For one, the design decisions that the\
    \ FLORA team has made with regard to the display of diagnoses enable PHYTØ to\
    \ present its users with unambiguous diagnoses or lists of probable plant damages\
    \ for a finite number of crops. For another, these diagnoses are stripped of information\
    \ regarding almost all situated agroecosystem-related actors and relations through\
    \ which the plant damage in question occurred. In other words, PHYTØ’s display\
    \ of results “re-presents” (Coopmans et al. 2014) plant pathology as a phenomenon\
    \ that consists of isolated plant damages on isolated crops. Discussion and conclusion\
    \ This study has shown how the construction of image recognition algorithms for\
    \ the classification of crops and plant damages redefines what counts as plant\
    \ pathology and what does not in contemporary agriculture. More specifically,\
    \ the study has demonstrated that this redefinition proceeds through practices\
    \ of “selection” (Lynch 1990) carried out at different “layers” (Bechmann and\
    \ Bowker 2019), at each of which some aspects of the phenomenon of plant pathology\
    \ are singled out for recognition, while others are ignored as a concomitant effect.\
    \ Overall, I argue that these practices lead to a selective recognition of plant\
    \ pathology. In the case of PHYTØ, this selective recognition takes the form of\
    \ the app being able to recognize a finite number of isolated plant damages on\
    \ isolated crops with a high degree of accuracy, while simultaneously ignoring\
    \ the majority of agroecosystem-related actors and relations through which plant\
    \ damages occur. One likely consequence of this selective recognition is that\
    \ it unintentionally perpetuates or even exacerbates the use of chemical pesticides\
    \ by PHYTØ users. Simply put, this is because the knowledge generated by PHYTØ’s\
    \ algorithms is more conducive to chemical-intensive agriculture than to less\
    \ chemical-intensive agriculture. This discussion section will deepen this thought\
    \ in relation to the literature on agricultural big data and algorithms that was\
    \ invoked at the beginning of this article. To begin with, the findings of this\
    \ article extend scholarly debates concerned with agricultural big data. First,\
    \ the article substantiates Bronson and Knezevic’s (2016) concern that agricultural\
    \ big data might lead to an expansion of the dominant market position of Big Ag\
    \ corporations. More specifically, the present article offers an in-depth look\
    \ at how the everyday work at an agtech startup takes part in this expansion.\
    \ As mentioned earlier, FLORA’s business model has changed considerably over the\
    \ years, but currently rests on the indirect sale of pesticides. One interesting\
    \ aspect of this development is that work on PHYTØ’s algorithms began before the\
    \ idea of collaborating with the agrochemical industry arose within the startup.\
    \ Hence, it seems that, rather than FLORA actively seeking to collaborate with\
    \ the agrochemical industry from the onset, the diagnostic capacity of PHYTØ’s\
    \ algorithms attracted the attention of the agrochemical industry, particularly\
    \ as it improved over time. This sequence of events suggests that the selective\
    \ effects arising in the construction of PHYTØ’s algorithms are at least partially\
    \ unintentional. Second, the results of this article resonate with and add to\
    \ Carbonell’s (2016) argument that most agricultural big data projects privilege\
    \ knowledge that is focused on “inputs and production” (p.3) while refraining\
    \ to produce knowledge about other objects like “industrial agriculture externalities\
    \ and vulnerabilities” (ibid.). Complementing Carbonell’s findings the present\
    \ article documents the big data-driven non-production of knowledge regarding\
    \ agroecosystem-related actors and relations. As indicated in the previous paragraph,\
    \ an interesting aspect of this dynamic is that the reason for this non-production\
    \ of knowledge does not seem to be intention, but rather an interplay of technological\
    \ prescriptions (e.g., algorithms requiring a certain number of pictures to produce\
    \ accurate classifications), economic pressures (e.g., the amount of resources\
    \ it takes to collect the required number of pictures), and material resistances\
    \ of agricultural matters (e.g., some crops and plant damages being more difficult\
    \ to find in the field than others). It is this collective and unintentional nature\
    \ of the perpetuation or exacerbation of historical problems in agriculture that\
    \ should be given greater prominence in critical analyses of agricultural big\
    \ data. Third, the article complicates debates about what Fraser (2019) refers\
    \ to as “data grabbing.” While the article agrees with Fraser that it is deeply\
    \ concerning how companies from the Global North are accumulating agricultural\
    \ data in the Global South, it comes to a different conclusion as to how this\
    \ accumulation occurs. More specifically, in the case of PHYTØ, the problem seemed\
    \ to be less a problem of grabbing pre-existing data and more a problem of collectively\
    \ constructing allegedly “raw data” (Bronson 2022; Denis and Goëta 2017). This\
    \ small distinction, while not necessarily inconsistent with Fraser’s point, has\
    \ important analytical implications. This is because it urges scholars not to\
    \ reduce big data-driven startups in agriculture to an activity of extraction,\
    \ but to take them seriously as spaces of knowledge production that can easily\
    \ be aligned with the interests of the agrochemical industry. Fourth, the article\
    \ adds another layer to Fairbairn and Kish’s (2022) argument that big data-driven\
    \ technologies in Global South countries are usually oblivious to local specificities\
    \ of these countries (e.g., colonialism, agricultural intensification, neoliberalism).\
    \ In the case of FLORA, too, an obliviousness to local specificities can be observed.\
    \ In the case of the startup, however, this obliviousness primarily concerns flora,\
    \ fauna, and environmental conditions. However, the bottom line that can be drawn\
    \ is the same: Even if big data-driven technologies may generate superior agricultural\
    \ knowledge regarding some specific areas, this knowledge production is inevitably\
    \ accompanied by a non-production of knowledge regarding other areas. From a current\
    \ perspective, this non-production of knowledge appears detrimental to countries\
    \ in the Global South, as it seems to reproduce old patterns of inequality (e.g.,\
    \ promoting dependence on chemical pesticides in the Global South, while most\
    \ of the profits from pesticide sales flow to the Global North). As for the second\
    \ body of literature discussed in this study, the article extends STS-informed\
    \ research on agricultural algorithms in several ways: First, the study expands\
    \ on Miles’ (2019) argument that agricultural algorithms do not represent a break\
    \ with productivist agriculture but are highly rationalist technologies that serve\
    \ to extend and intensify it within a political-economic context that rewards\
    \ rationalist efficiencies. While Miles primarily analyzed documents, this article\
    \ substantiates his account by showing how the dynamics he describes manifest\
    \ themselves in a situated empirical setting. A strength of such an ethnographic\
    \ analysis is that it allows us to understand the practical problems of the actors\
    \ developing agricultural algorithms as they unfold in their daily work, rather\
    \ than analyzing them after the fact. Second, the present article expands on Carolan’s\
    \ (2020) argument that agricultural algorithms lead to a number of lock-in effects.\
    \ To stick with Carolan’s terminology, it can be said that the study reconstructed\
    \ how a lock-in effect in favor of chemical pesticides has been inscribed into\
    \ PHYTØ. However, the article goes a step further by suggesting that identifying\
    \ harmful lock-in effects is only a first step in addressing this problem. In\
    \ line with Jaton (2017; 2021), the article takes the position that much more\
    \ attention should be paid to the practical causes of these effects. As such,\
    \ the article has identified concrete practices by which specific agroecosystem-related\
    \ actors and relations have been excluded from PHYTØ’s algorithmic services. Deeper\
    \ knowledge of such practices, this article’s ethnographic conviction goes, is\
    \ necessary to enable practitioners, scholars, and activists alike to think about\
    \ ways to mitigate the potentially harmful consequences of agricultural algorithms.\
    \ The article should therefore be read as an invitation to conduct further ethnographic\
    \ studies of agricultural algorithms in the making. Notes The name of the startup,\
    \ as well as the names of its apps, are pseudonyms. This article uses the term\
    \ “plant damage” as an umbrella term for the totality of symptoms caused by plant\
    \ pests, diseases, and nutrient deficiencies. In machine learning vernacular,\
    \ the term “class” refers to different groups of things that a classification\
    \ algorithm ought to classify. References Barbedo, J. G. 2013. Digital image processing\

  description: Crop prediction is a very difficult feature obtained by different characteristics
    like environment, genotype, and their associations. Policy and decision-makers
    depend on accurate crop yield predictions to ensure timely import and export recommendations
    to reinforce food security. In agriculture, boosting in machine learning (ML)
    is utilized to forecast crop yield. Many boosting ML approaches such as classification,
    prediction, and clustering predict agricultural production. Data mining techniques
    are a mandatory technique for achieving significant solutions for this issue.
    To perform the crop prediction based on different weathers in big data analytics
    is called as Margalef Kernel Perceptron and Winnow Brown Boosting Classification
    (MKP-WBBC) method. MKP-WBBC method for big data-based crop yield prediction is
    split into two sections, namely, feature selection and classification. First Margalef
    Kernel Perceptron-based feature selection is applied to the Crop Yield Prediction
    dataset to select computationally efficient features even in case of huge voluminous
    data. Second, with the unique features selected, Winnow Brown Boosting Classification
    is applied for accurate and precise crop yield prediction. The main contribution
    of the new crop yield prediction method is the potentiality to produce accurate
    predictions and reasonable insights in a simultaneous fashion. This was arrived
    at by the training and learning algorithm to choose the unique features and not
    only boosts the results other than enhance the cache hit rate to balance prediction
    accuracy for training data and generalizability to test data. A discussion of
    the results achieved reveals the productive performance of the MKP-WBBC method
    to predict crop yield accurately. Furthermore, results indicate the proposed MKP-WBBC
    can efficiently enhance crop yield prediction performance and analysis the existing
    methods in different parameters likes, feature selection accuracy, feature selection
    time, error rate, and air pollution prediction accuracy.

    learning algorithmGenerative adversarial network 1. Introduction Biomass estimation,
    fertilisation, and crop production reflect crop yield potential (Mansaray et al.,
    2020). The prediction of these variables allows the selection of crop cultivars
    with high yield potential (Gouranga and Kumar, 2014). Usually, these variables
    are either time-series or non-time-series datasets (Gaso et al., 2019, Wang et
    al., 2016). Deep neural networks (DNNs) were widely used for predicting such crop
    time-series or non-time-series variables (Unal, 2020). However, DNNs are data-hungry
    algorithms (Adadi, 2021) that generalise better with large training datasets (Demir
    et al., 2021). Additionally, collecting large datasets is expensive and laborious
    (Taylor and Nitschke, 2018). Therefore, providing synthetic, large datasets is
    preferable before implementing DNNs (Sawicki and Zieliński, 2020). Random transformation,
    pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition are the common methods that
    were introduced for continuous time-series and non-time-series data augmentation
    (Iwana and Uchida, 2021). Random transformation techniques of data such as jittering
    (Fields et al., 2019), rotation (Okafor et al., 2018), slicing (Cui et al., 2017),
    scaling (Chen et al., 2020), time warping (Kim et al., 2020), frequency wrapping
    (Kadyan et al., 2021), and permutation (Haralabopoulos et al., 2021) assume that
    the results of the transformations are typical of the dataset. However, given
    the different properties of each dataset, these techniques are not applicable
    to all continuous time-series and non-time-series datasets. Additionally, random
    transformations change the original distribution of data (Iwana and Uchida, 2021).
    Conversely, pattern mixing, generative models, and decomposition preserve the
    original distribution (Iwana and Uchida, 2021). Generative models, such as autoencoders
    (AEs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs), sample the new data from the original
    data distribution. Nevertheless, VAEs and AEs can be too lossy (Chen et al., 2017),
    require data cleaning because of their unsupervised learning base, and need sufficient
    training data (Gurumurthy et al., 2017). Moreover, the AEs'' and VAEs'' wrong
    choice of the inference distribution degrades the quality of augmentation output
    (Zhao et al., 2017). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) suffer from the vanishing
    of gradients, mode collapse, and convergence failure. The first issue makes the
    discriminator almost faultless, which causes the generator gradient to vanish
    and learn nothing. The second issue leads the GAN to produce limited variety of
    samples. The third issue forces model parameters to oscillate, destabilise, and
    never converge (Lan et al., 2020, Wang, 2009). Furthermore, flow generative models
    are inefficient regarding uniform-noise-based dequantization, less-expressive
    affine coupling flows, and convolutional layers are not powerful enough (Ho et
    al., 2019). Decomposition methods extract the trend and independent components
    to generate new patterns (Iwana and Uchida, 2021). Decomposition methods consider
    a series as a combination of level, trend, seasonality, and noise components (Wen
    et al., 2019). In addition, time-series data have a natural temporal ordering,
    making time-series analysis distinct from that of other standard data with no
    natural ordering, such as continuous non-time-series data (Dagum, 2010). Thus,
    decomposition methods are not suitable for continuous non-time-series data augmentation.
    Overall, the decomposition methods are likely to preserve the original data distribution
    but are unsuitable for continuous non-time-series data. Pattern mixing methods
    mix the nearest or same-class patterns to produce a new pattern either by interpolation,
    extrapolation, deviation from the mean, averaging, or weighted averaging in the
    time, frequency, or magnitude domains. Time mixing is more suitable for time-ordered
    series. The frequency is suitable for sound recognition (Iwana and Uchida, 2021).
    Averaging and interpolation create a new pattern in the magnitude domain at the
    midpoint between the two close or same-class patterns or extend the average to
    several points. Fortunately, averaging and interpolation methods create new datapoints
    that fit into the original data distribution. The synthetic minority over-sampling
    technique (SMOTE) interpolation may achieve the same goal, but by generating a
    new linear datapoints’ vector (Chawla et al., 2002). If so, the interpolation''s
    error is proportional to the square of the distance between the datapoints. Thus,
    SMOTE cannot approximate the nonlinearity of highly spaced continuous data. Additionally,
    the SMOTE extrapolation may create noisy data, increasing the augmentation loss
    and changing the data’s probability and joint probability distribution. Further,
    nonlinear interpolation methods (splines and polynomials) require specific standard
    calculus; they need supporting datapoints to calculate the supporting data values,
    which requires two parallel variables, as for the Euclidean formula (Antoulas,
    1988, Lehmann et al., 1999, Yang et al., 2014). For that end, the trigonometric-Euclidean-smoother
    interpolator (TESI) creates virtual supporting datapoints in a trigonometric-rectangular
    coordinate system to find the supporting data values using linear and nonlinear
    Euclidian transformation functions. Despite the abundance of time-series and non-time-series
    data augmentation methods, such methods are still limited in terms of retaining
    the data''s original distribution. Additionally, such methods do not consider
    the temporal and zonal nonlinear patterns of crop growth. The TESI nonlinear functions
    may approximate the nonlinear changes (e.g., biomass change over time) of crop
    phenology in time-spaced sampling, thereby reducing the cost of sampling for scientists.
    In addition, they intensify zonal synthetic sampling (e.g., crop biomass and yield
    sampling), thereby reducing sampling labour. Therefore, this study aims to: (i)
    develop a trigonometric-Euclidean-smoother interpolation (TESI) for continuous
    time-series and non-time-series data augmentation to prevent DNNs from under/overfitting;
    (ii) compare the TESI performance to the tabular variational autoencoder (TVAE)
    and the conditional tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN); and (iii)
    compare the DNN performance before and after data augmentation. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Materials 2.1.1. Data collection To meet the present study''s aim,
    two time-series datasets, oil palm production and rice production, and two non-time-series
    datasets, fertiliser and rice total aboveground biomass (TAGB), were augmented
    using the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN algorithms. The oil palm dataset is an open-source
    dataset provided by the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB). The rice production dataset
    was provided by the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). The first dataset
    consists of the monthly principal statistics of oil palm per estate in Malaysia
    from 2019 to 2021. This dataset gathers 432 samples and five features: the production
    of crude palm oil (PCPO) (t), the production of palm kernel (PPK) (t), the production
    of crude palm kernel oil (PCPKO) (t), the yield of fully mature oil palm produce
    (FFB) (t/h), oil palm production area (OPPA) (h), and the fully mature oil palm
    produce received by mill (FFBM) (t). The second dataset gathers the principal
    statistics of the rice crop for the seven rice-producing countries in Asia, including
    China, India, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Vietnam, and Bangladesh, from 1961
    to 2020. This dataset includes 420 samples and nine features: the production quantity
    of rice (PQR) (t), rice yield (YIELD) (hg/h), production of milled rice (PMR)
    (t), agricultural land (AGL) (h), cropland (CPL) (h), land area under irrigation
    (LAUI) (h), arable land (ARL) (h), harvested area (AH) (h), and the currently
    irrigated area (ACI) (h). The fertilisers dataset includes the nitrogen (N) (t),
    phosphorus (P) (t), and potassium (K) (t) used by 243 countries in 2019. The rice
    TAGB dataset was collected in a split-plot in a randomised complete block design
    (RCBD) at a farmer’s field in IADA KETARA, Lubuk Kawah, Jerteh Terengganu (5◦43′4′′
    N, 102◦29′33′′E) during the off-season from February to June 2018. The study field
    and experimental design figures, cultivar selection, sampling methods, and biomass
    trait measurements have all been detailed out in Muharam et al., 2021, Hashim
    et al., 2022. This dataset includes 360 samples and 860 features: the sum of the
    total aboveground (TAGB) biomass, five raw spectral bands, four rice traits, 90
    visible and near-infrared vegetation indices (VIs), and 760 grey level co-occurrence
    matrix (GLCM) texture features. The rice TAGB was measured in grammes per quadrant
    (g q-1). The four rice traits were the green leaf (GL) (g q-1), dead leaf (DL)
    (g q-1), stem (STEM) (g q-1), and storage organ (SO) (g q-1) biomass. The five
    raw spectral bands were acquired by a MicaSense Red-Edge multispectral camera
    mounted on a DJI quadcopter drone, processed by the Pix4 DMapper Pro (version
    4.0, Pix4 D Lausanne, Switzerland), and stored in a raster format by ArcGIS software
    (10.8.1). After that, the raster values were used to calculate the 90 VIs using
    Microsoft Excel 2013. Eight GLCM features, the mean (ME), variance (Var), homogeneity
    (HM), contrast (CONT), dissimilarity (DISS), entropy (ENT), second moment (SM),
    and correlation (CORR), were extracted per band using ENVI software (ENVI, 5.6.1).
    Then, 19 statistical metrics were calculated for each GLCM-feature by using SNAP
    software (8.0.0), resulting in 760 texture features. The 19 statistical metrics
    include the min, max, mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation,
    and the percentiles 35 %, 40 %, 45 %, 50 %, 55 %, 60 %, 65 %, 70 %, 75 %, 80 %,
    85 %, 90 %, and 95 %. Each dataset has been augmented by a factor of 10 times.
    Generally, the four datasets are a collection of different distributed features,
    including normal, right-skewed, left-skewed, bimodal, binomial, Poisson, and Pascal.
    Table 1 shows a descriptive summary of the datasets. Table 1. Summary of datasets.

    et al. (2022) 2.2. Methods 2.2.1. Feature selection Multicollinearity inflates
    regression standard errors, complicating the calculation of individual regression
    coefficients and causing the DNN to underfit or overfit the model (Siegel, 2016).
    Therefore, the variance inflation factor (VIF) was used to eliminate collinear
    dataset’s features, using the formula , where R2 is the coefficient of determination
    between the dataset features. Additionally, the Spearman’s r rank coefficient
    (rs) was used for relevant features selection because the four datasets contain
    a mixture of normally and anomalously distributed features (Schober and Schwarte,
    2018). The rs was calculated with the formula , where refers to the feature. With
    is the rank of among all values of the feature and is the rank of among all values
    of feature . The features with low VIF values (VIF < 10), which is the maximum
    acceptable level (Qi et al., 2020, Tian et al., 2021), and high rs values were
    selected to form the new datasets for augmentation. Tha was done to analyse the
    effect of data augmentation on the VIF and rs values, retaining the data original
    distribution, augmentation loss, and the DNN performance. 2.2.2. Data augmentation
    2.2.2.1. TVAE‑based data augmentation Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are deep
    Bayesian generative models based on the principles of amortised variational inference
    (Lavda et al., 2020). VAE includes an encoder network with parameters and a decoder
    network with parameters , and are weights and biases, respectively. VAEs assume
    that the input dataset , where , is identically distributed data (IID). Basically,
    (i) the encoder approximates the true posterior probability of the input feature
    (Li et al., 2020), (ii) it samples the latent feature from a prior distribution
    with the joint probability of the model , where (Shen et al., 2021), (iii) generates
    feature from the conditional distribution , and (iv) minimises the reconstruction
    loss through network backpropagation. The encoder infers the best values of the
    latent feature given the data by approximating the true posterior probability
    . To that end, the variational posterior probability (approximated) is calculated
    by Bayes formula as follows: (1) Both networks are trained to minimise the reconstruction
    loss between the output and the input dataset. Both are trained by stochastic
    gradient-based optimisation, maximising the sample estimate of the lower bound
    on the data loglikelihood. (2) (3) The first term of (Eq. (3)) is the negative
    reconstruction loss, and the second term of the (Eq. (3)) is the Kullback-Leibler
    divergence. A tabular VAE (TVAE) was developed by Xu et al. (2019) and was used
    in this study for data augmentation because of its zero approximation error (Doersch,
    2016). 2.2.2.2. CTGAN‑based data augmentation Generative adversarial networks
    (GANs) consist of a generator and a discriminator networks. learns a distribution
    from the training dataset then generates an output from random noise . and the
    training data are fed into the discriminator model . The output is compared to
    the output . identifies if a sample comes from the training data or . results
    in a probability of 1 if is realistic and 0 if the latter is generated. This probability
    range determines how much is realistic or generated. is the output of a logistic
    activation function. The two networks play a min-max game, where works to minimise
    with the formula . When converges to 1, assumes that . Therefore, works to maximise
    and with the minmax loss formula . The min-max trade-off leads the discriminator
    to reach the point . Finally, the minmax loss formula (Eq. (4)) is optimised with
    an iterative gradient descent algorithm by fixing and in alternating steps (Goodfellow
    et al., 2020). (4) This study uses a conditional tabular data GAN (CTGAN) for
    data augmentation, developed and explained in detail in Xu et al. (2019). The
    CTGAN uses a mode-specific normalisation based on a variational Gaussian mixture
    model (VGM), a conditional generator, and a training-by-sampling method to handle
    the class imbalance, which may save the data features'' original distribution.
    2.2.2.3. TESI construction and justification Augmenting the data size improves
    the DNN''s generalisation ability (Xu et al., 2020). However, finding new data
    points that fit the original distribution is complex, critical, and a vital assessment
    that the data is realistic is required (Aziira et al., 2020). Several data augmentation
    methods have been developed, but there has been considerable concern regarding
    saving the original data distribution. The TESI is a linear and nonlinear smoothing
    interpolator that generates new data points between two close datapoints, which
    forces the latter to fit into the original data distribution. SMOTE interpolation
    may achieve the same goal, but by generating a new linear datapoint''s vector.
    In this case, the interpolation error is proportional to the square of the distance
    between the two close datapoints, and the latter do not fit into the data''s original
    distribution. The two methods are suitable for interpolating only less-spaced
    linear time series and non-time-series vectors. In contrast, the TESI uses nonlinear
    interpolation functions, linear Euclidian (LN-TESI), quadratic Euclidian (Q-TESI),
    cubic Euclidian (C-TESI), and logarithmic Euclidian (L-TESI), to interpolate the
    new datapoints that fit into the data features'' original distribution, which
    makes it suitable for less spaced and spaced linear and nonlinear time-series
    and non-time-series vectors. The established data augmentation methods are still
    limited in terms of retaining the data''s original distribution and do not consider
    the temporal and zonal nonlinear patterns of crop growth. The LN-TESI, Q-TESI,
    C-TESI, and L-TESI may approximate the linear and nonlinear changes (e.g., biomass
    change over time) of crop phenology in time-spaced sampling, thereby reducing
    the cost of sampling for scientists. In addition, they intensify zonal synthetic
    sampling (e.g., crop biomass and yield sampling), thereby reducing sampling labour.
    Supposing a continuous feature with datapoints, where . The TESI projects each
    datapoint in a rectangular coordinate system, where is the reference zero-zero
    (0,0) for the following one (Fig. 1). Thereafter, the TESI creates a vector of
    supporting datapoints, where , to interpolate mew supporting data values in the
    rectangular vector , where using the Euclidian interpolation. The vector is calculated
    using the Pythagoras formula, , according to the formula . Where and are the opposite
    and adjacent sides of the angle , respectively. . To find , the trigonometric
    sine rule implies that and , where is the hypotenuse and (see Fig. 2). Download

    to the quadratic Euclidian (Q-TESI) (Eq. (8)), cubic Euclidian (C-TESI) (Eq. (9)),
    and log Euclidian (L-TESI) (Eq. (10)) nonlinear functions. (8) (9) (10) 2.2.3.
    Evaluation of data augmentation performance The mean absolute error (MAE) was
    used to evaluate the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN’s augmentation loss according to the
    formula . where and . is the generated value of a dataset with datapoints and
    the real value of a dataset with datapoints. For better MAE interpretation, the
    MAE was standardised to a percentage ( ) according to the formula . is the augmented
    features’ mean. Additionally, the probability density function (PDF) was calculated
    for the dataset’s features before and after data augmentation. The PDF curves
    were plotted for each selected feature to identify the algorithm that preserves
    the features original distributions. The rs and VIF values were used to show the
    TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN’s data augmentation effect on the dataset’s multivariate
    correlation and multicollinearity. 2.2.4. Deep neural network (DNN) We applied
    a DNN to predict the PCPO (t), PQR (t), N (t), and TAGB (g q-1) from the independent
    features in the oil palm, rice, fertilizers, and TAGB datasets, respectively,
    before and after data augmentation. DNNs are a series of hidden layers between
    the input and output layers (Islam et al., 2018). A layer is a network of interconnected
    mathematical processing units (neurons). The input neuron (from the input layer)
    transmits a summed multiplication of input features , and weights , with a small
    change in weight i.e., bias to the output neuron in the hidden layer, according
    to the formula . The output is then activated with an activation function (e.g.,
    to generalise a prediction (Aggarwal, 2018). The prediction of the input feature
    is computed with the formula . The adaptation of and allows the network to generalise
    the best model (Gurney, 2018). Backpropagation is a common method for weight and
    bias updates (Buscema, 1998). Backpropagation minimises a loss function till this
    latter converges to zero, updating and that give the lowest difference between
    the observed and predicted . The input is a feature vector or a feature matrix
    dataset. In this study, the DNN was used for the regression task. DNN has five
    layers: (i) the input layer, (ii) the first hidden layer, (iii) the second hidden
    layer, (iv) the dropout layer, and (v) the output layer Fig. 3. Download : Download
    high-res image (353KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 3. The deep neural
    network architecture. The number of neurons in each layer varied from dataset
    to dataset, depending on the number of features (https://medium.com/). Consequently,
    the input layer contains neurons whose number equals the number of features in
    the input dataset: 6 for the oil palm dataset, 9 for the rice dataset, 3 for the
    fertiliser’s dataset, and 860 for the TAGB dataset. The dense hidden layers have
    neurons that are 2/3 the number of neurons in the input layer: 4 for the oil palm
    dataset, 6 for the rice dataset, 2 for the fertiliser’s dataset, and 580 for the
    TAGB dataset. The chosen number of hidden layers and neurons is expected to improve
    the DNN''s performance (Arifin et al., 2019). The dropout layer has a drop rate
    of 0.3, which drops 30% of the number of neurons in the previous hidden layer.
    Consequently, the dropout layer retained 3 neurons for the oil palm dataset, 4
    neurons for the rice dataset, 1 neuron for the fertiliser dataset, and 387 for
    the TAGB dataset. The dropout layer stochastically drops out neurons during training
    in order to avoid the co-adaptation of feature detectors (Baldi and Sadowski,
    2013), which helps prevent overfitting (https://keras.io/). Finally, the output
    layer includes one neuron. The 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 5th layers were dense layers
    with a leaky rectified linear unit (leaky-ReLU) as an activation function. The
    leaky-ReLU was chosen because of the complex, nonlinear relationship between the
    dataset’s features. The other hyperparameters of the three dense layers and the
    dropout layer were set by default. The mean squared error (MSE) was used as the
    DNN loss function. The Adam optimiser was used with a learning rate of 0.008,
    beta_2 of 0.999, epsilon = 1E-07, amsgrad set to false, and the name “Adam” to
    tune the weights of each layer after each iteration. The small learning rate may
    lead to better minimization results (Du and Swamy, 2019). The DNN was trained
    and validated on 70% of the data, then tested on 30%. The DNN was trained, validated,
    and tested over 5000 epochs. The coefficient of determination (R2) and the root
    mean squared error (RMSE) were used as the DNN metrics. 2.2.5. Evaluation of the
    DNN performance The R2 and RMSE were used for DNN’s model evaluation, calculated
    using equations (Eq. (11), Eq. (12)). (11) (12) where is the total feature samples,
    is the actual or measured feature value, is the estimated feature value and is
    the mean value of the feature. The training test differences of the R2 (TTDR2)
    and RMSE (TTDRMSE) were calculated to evaluate the DNN under/overfitting from
    formulas and . , , , and are the training R2, test R2, training RMSE, and test
    RMSE, respectively. Low TTD values indicate low DNN under/overfitting. Moreover,
    for better RMSE interpretation, the RMSE was compared to the mean squared of the
    dependent feature in each dataset, i.e., the PCPO (t), PQR (t), N (t), and the
    TAGB (g q-1). 2.2.6. The feature selection and algorithms coding PyCharm software
    (2022.3) was used as an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop the
    TVAE, CTGAN, TESI, and DNN codes. Additionally, it was used to develop the feature
    selection code. The Python (3.8.15) programming language was used to write the
    feature selection and MLs codes. Pandas (1.3.5) library was used to apply the
    Spearman''s correlation test. The statsmodels module (0.12.2) was used to apply
    the VIF test. The synthetic data vault (SDV) ecosystem (0.13.1) was imported to
    PyCharm for the TVAE and CTGAN applications. The Pandas (1.3.5) library was used
    to read the dataset.csv files. The NumPy (1.21.6) library was used with the itertools
    (3.8.15) and math (3.8.15) modules for the TESI coding. The TensorFlow API (2.9.2),
    Keras (2.9.0), and Scikit-Learn (1.0.2) libraries were used for the DNN coding.
    3. Results 3.1. The analysis of data augmentation performance 3.1.1. The analysis
    of feature selection The VIF and rs values are shown in Table 2, Table 3, Table
    4, Table 5 to show the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN’s data augmentation effects on the
    dataset’s multivariate correlation and multicollinearity. The outperforming algorithm
    is one that increases the rs and decreases the VIF. The VIF and rs ranges were
    0.79–0.97 and 4.07–4.93 on the oil palm dataset before data augmentation (BDA)
    (Table. 2). After data augmentation, the CTGAN reduced the VIF (1.41–1.41) but
    also reduced the rs range (0.01–0.02). Similarly, the TAVE decreased the VIF range
    (2.41–2.41). However, it decreased rs range (0.59–0.78). In contrast, the LN-TESI,
    Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI decreased the VIF ranges to 4.71–4.71, 4.22–4.22, 4.10–4.10,
    and 4.58–4.58, while increasing the rs ranges to 0.81–0.97, 0.79–0.97, 0.79–0.97,
    and 0.81–0.97. Table 2. Summary of rs and VIF values before and after data augmentation

    the VIF and rs ranges were (0.80–0.99) and (4.75–9.88) before data augmentation
    (Table. 3). After data augmentation, the CTGAN decreased the VIF range (1.23–1.42),
    while strongly decreasing the rs rs range (0.00–0.01). The TAVE overcame the CTGAN
    by decreasing the VIF range (2.73–3.55) and slightly decreasing rs range (0.66–0.78).
    On the contrary, the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI decreased the VIF ranges
    to 5.68–8.86, 4.99–8.60, 4.82–8.53, and 5.16–8.82 and retained the rs ranges of
    0.81–0.99, 0.80–0.99, 0.80–0.99, 0.80-and 0.99, respectively. The rs and VIF ranges
    were 0.91–0.98 and 9.82–9.82 on the fertiliser’s dataset before data augmentation
    (Table. 4). After data augmentation, the CTGAN reduced the VIF (0.00–0.00) and
    rs (0.00–0.01) ranges. The TAVE also decreased the VIF range (1.50–1.50) while
    decreasing the rs range (0.25–0.40). In contrast, the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI,
    and L-TESI retained the VIF (10.30–10.30, 9.96–9.96, 9.87–9.87, and 10.08–10.08)
    and rs (0.91–0.98). The rs and VIF ranges were 0.80–0.86 and 1.65–7.81 (BDA) on
    the TAGB dataset before data augmentation (Table. 5). After data augmentation,
    the CTGAN inflated the VIF range (1.16–13.16) and decreased the rs range (0.00–0.05).
    Likewise, the TAVE inflated the VIF range (2.68–44.80) and decreased the rs range
    (0.22–0.51). The L-TESI increased the rs range (0.81–0.88) and slightly increased
    the VIF range (1.99–10.00). The LN-TESI decreased the VIF range (1.67–7.44) while
    slightly decreasing rs range (0.69–0.84). Conversely, the Q-TESI and C-TESI decreased
    the VIF ranges (1.57–6.84 and 1.55–6.66) and increased the rs ranges (0.81–0.88
    and 0.81–0.88). Overall, the TESI retained the VIF ranges less than 10 on the
    four datasets; the TESI either retained or decreased the VIF range. Furthermore,
    the TESI either retained or increased the rs ranges on the four datasets. The
    TESI had the same effect on the four time-series and non-time-series datasets.
    Conversely, the CTGAN and TAVE decreased the VIF and rs ranges on the four datasets.
    3.1.2. The analysis of the data augmentation loss The MAE and MAEP results are
    shown in Table 6, Table 7, Table 8, Table 9 to show the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN
    augmentation losses. On the oil palm dataset (Table. 6), the C-TESI achieved the
    lowest MAEP range (0.60–2.85%), followed by the L-TESI (MAEP range = 1.37–1.72%),
    Q-TESI (MAEP range = 1.02–3.27%), LN-TESI (MAEP range = 2.38–4.54%), TVAE (MAEP
    range = 19.86–16.20%), and lastly by CTGAN (MAEP range = 0.79–321.61%). Table

    Table 8. Summary of the MAE loss values of the fertilizer’s dataset after data

    data augmentation. Moreover, the C-TESI achieved the lowest MAEP range (0.77–1.72%)
    on the rice dataset (Table. 7). It was followed by the Q-TESI (MAEP range = 1.15–2.19%),
    the L-TESI (MAEP range = 1.13–3.08%), the LN-TESI (MAEP range = 2.39–4.77%), the
    TVAE (MAEP range = 5.49–11.66%), and lastly by the CTGAN (MAEP range = 11.93–24.13%).
    Further, the C-TESI achieved the lowest MAEP range (2.04–2.21%) on the fertiliser’s
    dataset (Table. 8). It was followed by the LN-TESI and Q-TESI (MAEP range = 5.11–5.51%),
    the L-TESI (MAEP range = 9.17–10.41%), the CTGAN (MAEP range = 15.07–16.38%),
    and lastly by the TAVE (MAEP range = 1217.19–1428.57%). Furthermore, the L-TESI
    achieved the lowest MAEP range (0.77–1.72%) on the TAGB dataset (Table. 9). The
    LN-TESI, Q-TESI, and C-TESI followed with MAEP ranges of 0.45–20.12%, 0.60–20.85%,
    and 1.08–23.35%, respectively, followed by the TAVE (14.76–2672.58%), and finally
    the CTGAN (MAEP range = 20.19–5315.71%). Overall, the TESI achieved low MAEP values
    on the four time-series and non-time-series datasets. In contrast, TAVE and CTGAN
    did the same only on the two non-time series datasets. Further, the C-TESI, L-TESI,
    Q-TESI, and LN-TESI achieved lower MAEP values than TAVE and CTGAN on the four
    datasets. Furthermore, the C-TESI overcame the other algorithms on the oil palm,
    rice, and fertiliser datasets, while the L-TESI did the same on the TAGB dataset.
    3.1.3. The analysis of data augmentation through the probability density function
    The probability density functions (PDF) of the four dataset’s features were calculated
    before and after data augmentation. Their curves are plotted in Fig. 4, Fig. 5,
    Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8 to show the algorithm resulting in optimal PDF’s curve
    convergence. The algorithm that leads to optimal convergence is one that retains
    the feature''s original distribution. Download : Download high-res image (476KB)

    Plots c, d, e, and f illustrate the PDF curves of the DL (g q-1), SO (g q-1),
    SSRE (unitless), and the CVMB (unitless) features. The LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI,
    and L-TESI led to the optimal PDF curve convergence for the PCPO (t) and PCPKO
    (t), OPPA (h) features (Fig. 4a-c). On the contrary, these features’ PDF curves
    did not converge when augmented with TAVE. Furthermore, when augmented with CTGAN,
    only the PCPKO (t) PDF curve (Fig. 4b) converged, but not the PCPO (t) (Fig. 4a)
    and OPPA (t) (Fig. 4c). Overall, the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI retained
    the feature''s original probability distribution in the oil palm dataset. The
    TVAE did not, and the CTGAN did not, except for the PCPKO (t) feature. Similarly,
    the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI led to the optimal PDF curve convergence
    for the PQR (t), PMR (t), AGL (h), and CPL (h) features (Fig. 5a-d). In contrast,
    the PDF curves of these features did not converge when they were augmented with
    the TAVE and CTGAN (Fig. 5a-d). Overall, the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI
    retained the feature original probability distribution on the rice dataset also.
    Conversely, the TVAE and CTGAN did not. On the fertilisers'' dataset, the LN-TESI,
    Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI led to the optimal PDF curve convergence for N (t)
    and K (t) features (Fig. 6a–b). Only the LN-TESI led to the optimal PDF curve
    convergence for the P (t) feature (Fig. 6c). On the contrary, the TVAE didn’t
    result in any convergence for the three features. Moreover, the CTGAN resulted
    in good convergence only for the N (t) (Fig. 6a). In comparison to the CTGAN,
    the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI retained the feature of the original probability
    distribution on the fertiliser''s dataset. The TVAE did not. The LN-TESI, Q-TESI,
    C-TESI, and L-TESI led to the optimal PDF curve convergence for all TAGB dataset
    features, including the TAGB (g q-1), PH (m), DL (g q-1), SO (g q-1), and the
    standard deviation of the second moment of the red-edge band (SSRE) (unitless),
    except the PH (m) when augmented with LN-TESI (Fig. 7, Fig. 8). On the contrary,
    the TAVE did not result in any PDF curve convergence for all TAGB dataset features.
    The CTGAN led to the PDF’s curve convergence only for the TAGB (g q-1) and the
    DL (g q-1). Only the LN-TESI resulted in the PDF curve of the blue band mean texture
    CVMB (unitless) convergent. Overall, the Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI retained the
    features'' original probability distributions for all the TAGB dataset features.
    The L-TESI did the same except for the PH (m) feature, and the CTGAN did the same
    only for the TAGB (g q-1) and the DL (g q-1). On the contrary, the TVAE did not.
    Generally, the TESI had the same effect on the four time-series and non-time-series
    datasets regarding retaining the features’ original distribution. 3.2. The performance
    of the DNN before and after data augmentation The R2 and RMSE results obtained
    before and after data augmentation are summarised in Table 10, Table 11, Table
    12, Table 13. The test R2 and RMSE values are used to identify the algorithm that
    boosts the DNN performance. Overall, the DNN achieved the highest R2 and lowest
    RMSE values on the four datasets when augmented with TESI first. The TVAE comes
    next, followed by the CTGAN. Table 10. Summary of the DNN R2 and RMSE results
    before and after data augmentation of the oil palm dataset. Table 11. Summary
    of the DNN R2 and RMSE results before and after data augmentation of the rice
    dataset. Table 12. Summary of the DNN R2 and RMSE results before and after data
    augmentation of the fertilizers dataset. Table 13. Summary of the DNN R2 and RMSE
    results before and after data augmentation of the TAGB dataset. On the oil palm
    dataset (Table. 10), before data augmentation, the DNN achieved an R2 of 0.92
    and a RMSE of 6.6E+04 (t). The DNN increased the R2 to 0.99 and decreased the
    RMSE to 2.4E+04 (t) after augmenting the oil palm dataset with the LN-TESI, Q-TESI,
    C-TESI, and L-TESI. On the contrary, the DNN decreased the R2 to 0.63 and increased
    the RMSE to 9.5E+04 (t) after augmenting the oil palm dataset with the TAVE. Likewise,
    the DNN decreased the R2 to 0.00 and increased the RMSE to 1.4E+05 (t) after augmenting
    the oil palm dataset with the CTGAN. The DNN achieved the lowest model underfitting
    after augmenting the oil palm dataset with L-TESI (TTDR2 = −0.01 and TTDRMSE =
    4.0E+03 (t)). The DNN overfit the model on the C-TESI, LN-TESI, and Q-TESI (TTDR2
    = -0.03 to −0.01 and TTDRMSE = 5.0E+03–1.7E+04 (t)), which is higher than on the
    L-TESI and lower than on the CTGAN (TTDR2 = 0.01 and TTDRMSE = -1.0E+04 (t)) and
    TVAE (TTDR2 = 0.07, TTDRMSE = −8.0E+03 (t)) augmented oil palm datasets. The DNN
    achieved the highest model overfit before data augmentation (TTDR2 = 0.02 and
    TTDRMSE = −1.9E+04 (t)). On the rice dataset (Table. 11), before data augmentation,
    the DNN achieved an R2 of 0.99 and a RMSE of 4.8E+06 (t). After data augmentation,
    the DNN achieved the same R2 of 0.99 when the rice dataset was augmented with
    TESI, achieving the lowest model under/overfitting with a TTDR2 of 0.00. Moreover,
    the DNN achieved the lowest RMSE with values of 7.6E+05, 9.2E+05, 9.9E+05, and
    1.3E+06 (t) when augmenting the rice dataset with the LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI,
    and L-TESI, respectively. The DNN overfit the model with respective TTDRMSE values
    of 3.1E+06, 3.1E+06, 3.0E+06, and 2.6E+06 (t). In contrast, after augmenting the
    rice dataset with TAVE, the DNN reduced the R2 to 0.68 and increased the RMSE
    to 2.4E+07 (t), while decreasing the TTDR2 to −0.05 and increasing the TTDRMSE
    to 1.0E+06 (t). Likewise, the DNN decreased the R2 to 0.00 and increased the RMSE
    to 6.6E+07 (t), achieving a TTDR2 of 0.00 and TTDRMSE of 1.0E+06 (t). Overall,
    the TESI overcame the CTGAN and TAVE in boosting the DNN''s performance and stability.
    On the fertiliser’s dataset (Table. 12), before data augmentation, the DNN achieved
    an R2 of 0.57 and a RMSE of 2.9E+06 (t). After data augmentation, the DNN increased
    the R2 values to 0.95, 0.94, 0.77, and 0.87 and the RMSE values to 1.5E+06, 1.7E+06,
    1.1E+06, and 8.1E+05 after augmenting the fertiliser’s dataset with the LN-TESI,
    Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI, respectively. The DNN achieved a much lower R2 (0.00)
    and higher RMSE (1.6E+05, 3.0E+05 (t)) on the fertilisers dataset when it was
    augmented with TVAE and CTGAN. Additionally, the DNN overfit with a TTDR2 of 0.03
    and TTDRMSE values of −1.1E+06 and −1.2E+06 after augmenting the fertiliser’s
    dataset with the LN-TESI and Q-TESI. The latter was followed by the C-TESI and
    L-TESI, the TVAE, and lastly the CTGAN. Details are shown in Table. 12. Overall,
    the TESI overcame the CTGAN and TAVE in boosting the DNN''s performance and stability.
    Before data augmentation, the DNN achieved an R2 of 0.43 and a low RMSE of 7.7E+01
    on the TAGB dataset (Table. 13). After data augmentation, the DNN increased the
    R2 values to 0.92, 0.93, 0.90, and 0.92 and decreased the RMSE values to 2.9E+01,
    2.8E+01, 3.4E+01, and 3.0E+01 (g q-1) after augmenting the TAGB dataset with the
    LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI, respectively. The DNN achieved slightly higher
    R2 (0.60) and slightly lower RMSE (4.8E+01 (g q-1)) after augmenting the TAGB
    dataset with TVAE. The DNN achieved the highest model stability when the TAGB
    dataset was augmented with the Q-TESI (TTDR2 = 0.01 and TTDRMSE = -3.0E+00 (q
    q−1)), LN-TESI (TTDR2 = 0.02 and TTDRMSE = -5.0E+00 (g q−1)), L-TESI (TTDR2 =
    0.03 and TTDRMSE = -6.0E+00 (g q−1)), C-TESI (TTDR2 = 0.04 and TTDRMSE = -9.0E+00
    (g q−1)), TAVE (TTDR2 = 0.11 and TTDRMSE = -4.0E+00 (g q−1)), CTGAN (TTDR2 = 0.19
    and TTDRMSE = -2.2E+01 (g q−1)), and lastly BDA (TTDR2 = 0.51 and TTDRMSE = -5.3E+01
    (g q−1)). Overall, the TESI boosted the DNN model''s performance and stability
    better than the TVAE and CTGAN on the TAGB dataset. However, the TVAE did the
    same with acceptable rates. The TESI increased the features correlation in the
    non-time-series datasets more than in the time-series datasets. 4. Discussion
    4.1. The performance and effects of data augmentation According to the findings
    in Sections 3.1.1-3, the TESI retained the VIF ranges less than 10 on the four
    datasets; compared to the rs (rs = 0.79–0.99) and VIF (VIF = 1.65–9.82) results
    before data augmentation, the TESI either retained (VIF range = 1.99–10.06) or
    decreased (VIF = 1.55–6.66) the VIF ranges on the four datasets. Furthermore,
    the TESI either retained (rs = 0.79–0.97) or increased (rs = 0.81–0.99) the rs
    ranges on the four datasets. The TESI had the same effect on the four time-series
    and non-time-series datasets. Conversely, the CTGAN and TAVE decreased the rs
    ranges and either increased or decreased VIF ranges on the four datasets. Moreover,
    the TESI overcame the TAVE and CTGAN in minimising the MAE loss; the C-TESI achieved
    the lowest MAEP on the oil palm (0.60–2.85%), rice (0.77–1.72%), and fertilisers
    dataset (2.04–2.21%). The L-TESI did the same on the TAGB dataset (0.77–1.72%).
    The LN-TESI and Q-TESI achieved similar MAEP results. Furthermore, the LN-TESI,
    Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI retained the feature original distribution in the four
    datasets. On the contrary, the CTGAN and TVAE did not. The independent feature
    explains better the dependent feature when the bivariate correlation between them
    increases. However, independent features badly explain the dependent feature when
    the multivariate correlation between them increases due to the inflated standard
    errors (Siegel, 2016). Such inflation hardens the precise estimation of regression
    coefficients. Such imprecision makes the P-value of the model not trustable (Daoud,
    2018). The joint PDF is proportional to the multivariate correlation (Grami, 2016).
    It can be theorised that the TVAE and CTGAN change the probability density function
    and the joint probability density function, which alters the VIF and rs values
    and results in high loss values. This theory is supported by the present study''s
    results. Hypothetically, the discriminator overcame the generator, which diversified
    the data output and further changed the feature''s PDF. Otherwise, the data size
    was small, limiting the generator''s power to approximate the original distribution
    and further generating incorrect distribution data. The GAN''s discriminator''s
    diversification requires the use of diverse and high-quality data to learn from,
    forcing the generator to generate new diverse data. Arora and Zhang (2017) agreed
    with this hypothesis. He reported that the issue with GANs is the lack of diversity
    in the training data and that the output is affected by noise. The lack of training
    diversity leads the discriminator to stack in a local minimum and get fooled by
    the generator, producing duplicated, low-quality data, i.e., mode collapse. The
    VAEs tackled the mode collapse based on the approximate perplexity calculation,
    approximating the real data distribution much better. A text and generative document
    modelling study used a VAE that concluded the same hypothesis (Miao et al., 2016).
    However, this study''s results agreed with those of Arora and Zhang (2017), who
    found that the VAE generates unrealistic images while the TVAE alters the feature''s
    PDF more than the CTGAN. The implicit assumption of the VAE is that the latent
    variable has a normal distribution (Kingma and Welling, 2014), which led the VAE
    to generate normally distributed data in most cases, altering the original feature
    PDF. Overall, the arbitrary change in the PDF led to an arbitrary change in the
    joint PDF . When the , the features are uncorrelated and independent. When , the
    independent features are orthogonal. The first and second situations decrease
    the rs and the VIF, respectively. On the contrary, the TESI interpolates the new
    datapoints within the original vector''s curve, which saved the original PDF.
    Overall, the TVAE and CTGAN performances are limited by weak inference and the
    need for generating diverse data, which alters the data''s original distribution.
    In turn, this latter alters the rs and VIF values. The agricultural literature
    lacks a comparison between TVAE and CTGAN for this study''s aim. 4.2. The performance
    deep neural network According to the findings in Section 3.2, compared to the
    DNN R2 (0.43–0.99) and RMSE (7.7E+01–4.8E+06) values achieved on the four datasets
    before data augmentation, (i) the DNN achieved the highest R2 (0.77–0.99) and
    lowest RMSE ranges (2.8E+01–8.1E+05) when the four datasets were augmented with
    TESI; (ii) the DNN achieved the best R2, RMSE, TTDR2, and TTDRMSE results after
    augmenting the four datasets with LN-TESI, Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI; (iii) the
    DNN achieved lower R2 and higher RMSE values after augmenting the four datasets
    with TVAE (R2 = 0.00–0.68, RMSE = 4.8E+01–2.4E+07); (iv) the DNN achieved much
    lower R2 and much high RMSE values after augmenting the four datasets with the
    CTGAN; and (v) the DNN achieved higher R2 and RMSE values in the training phase,
    then the validation, then the test phase, or vice versa. Hypothetically, the first
    outcome is attributed to three conditions: (i) augmented data size; (ii) low VIF
    between the explanatory features; and (iii) a high correlation between the dependent
    and independent features. The second condition is available before data augmentation.
    However, before data augmentation, the DNN performed lower than after augmenting
    the four datasets with TESI, which implies that the first and third conditions
    are more critical than the second. The TESI interpolation most likely provides
    a larger data confidence space for the DNN to select the best model, as it increases
    the nearby data points (Shorten and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). On the other hand, data
    augmentation provides varied and sufficient data points to train the DNN (Mikołajczyk
    and Grochowski, 2018). Similarly, the high correlation between the dependent and
    independent features allows the DNN to better fit the model (Kira and Rendell,
    1992). Moreover, the correlation guarantees the association between the dependent
    and independent features, giving the DNN predictive certainty (Crawford, 2006).
    Furthermore, the selection of highly correlated features reduces the complexity
    of a model and makes it easier and more precise to interpret the regression coefficients
    (Burruss and Bray, 2005). Nevertheless, the TVAE augmented the data size, retaining
    low VIF values but reducing rs (the third outcome). Consequently, the DNN performed
    lower on the low-rs oil palm, rice, and TAGB datasets and performed poorly on
    the very low-rs fertiliser dataset when augmented with TAVE, compared to when
    they were augmented with TESI or before data augmentation. Therefore, it can be
    assumed that the third condition would be more critical. The fourth outcome supports
    this assumption that the CTGAN dataset presented low VIF values and high data
    size but reduced rs and led the DNN to perform poorly in the three metrics. A
    GAN was used for cotton weed and biomass image generation. These images were used
    to train a region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) for the croton’s
    weed and biomass detection and achieved a moderate mean average precision of 0.60–0.64
    (Sapkota et al., 2022). Moreover, a convolutional neural network-based approach
    was applied for cassava storage root counting using real and synthetic images.
    The latter were generated by a conditional GAN. The CNN achieved percentage agreement
    of 86% and 71% on counting “old” and “young” storage roots, respectively (Atanbori
    et al., 2019). A GAN was also used to generate synthetic images for further crop
    and weed segmentation using convolutional neural networks U-Net, BONNET, SEGNET,
    and UNET-RESNET. Only UNET-RESNET outperformed the other networks in terms of
    accuracy on synthetic data compared to real data (Fawakherji et al., 2020). Despite
    its intensive use, GAN''s performance for synthetic data generation is acceptable
    but not high, and it was used for image datasets, but especially not on continuous
    tabular datasets. Therefore, the TAVE and CTGAN were invented but were not used
    for agricultural applications, according to the best of this study’s review. It
    was hypothetically expected that the smoothing effect of the Q-TESI, C-TESI, and
    L-TESI nonlinear interpolation, compared to the LN-TESI linear interpolation,
    would boost the DNN model''s performance and stability, whereby the smoothing
    reduces the data dispersion and allows the DNN to develop a simple, generalizable
    model. Also, it simplifies the curve changes to help predict different trends
    and patterns with low error, especially in noisy data. The model''s generalizability
    reflects the stability of the DNN. This hypothesis agrees with the literature
    (Benoit, 2011, Li and Luan, 2005). However, the second (ii) outcome disagrees
    with this hypothesis, supporting the role of data size and the high correlation
    between the dependent and independent features. The DNN achieved high stability
    on the datasets augmented with the TESI in terms of R2 and RMSE. However, this
    was lower on the noisy data, which might lead the DNN to learn a flexible or complex
    model. In other words, the DNN modelled the training set with high variance, leading
    to the misapplication of the learned model on the validation and test sets (Shorten
    and Khoshgoftaar, 2019). As a result, in noisy data, such as the fertilisers and
    TAGB datasets, the DNN under- or overfits the model. On the contrary, it accurately
    fit the model on the non-noised data, such as the oil palm and rice datasets.
    It would be the typical case where the DNN performs better on the training data
    than on the test and validation data. On the non-time-series fertiliser and TAGB
    datasets, the DNN performed inversely (outcome v). Both datasets contained inherent
    data variability (i.e., highly noisy data) that might affect the R2 and RMSE values.
    Typically, all datasets are split 70%-30%-30% among the learning cycle (training,
    validation, and testing). The training set has a larger size and, consequently,
    a considerable amount of noisy data compared to the validation and test sets.
    In this case, the R2 would have a high variance but a low value. The data noise
    complexity made the DNN model unconfident in describing the dependent feature
    via the independent features in the training phase. At the test phase, with low
    data sizes, the DNN applied the model with more confidence, consequently increasing
    the R2 values. The oil palm and rice datasets could contain fewer noisy data points,
    which is why the DNN performed within the typical case. This assumption is confirmed
    by Saseendran et al. (2019), who registered a decrease in accuracy of 3% with
    every 10% increase in sample noise. 5. Conclusion This study developed a trigonometric-Euclidean-smoother
    interpolator (TESI) for time series and non-time series data augmentation. It
    also compared the TESI, TVAE, and CTGAN effects on the feature''s rs, VIF, original
    distribution, augmentation loss, and DNN performance. The TESI retained the feature’s
    original distribution and reduced the augmentation loss, while the TVAE and CTGAN
    did not. The TESI retained or increased the feature''s rs values. Additionally,
    the TESI retained or decreased the feature''s VIF values. The TVAE and CTGAN performed
    conversely. Moreover, the DNN achieved the highest R2 and lowest RMSE results
    on the four datasets when augmented with TESI. When they were augmented with the
    TAVE, the DNN achieved lower R2 and higher RMSE values. When they were augmented
    with the CTGAN, the DNN achieved much lower R2 and much higher RMSE values. Finally,
    the Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI performed better than the LN-TESI in terms of retaining
    the feature''s original distribution, minimising the augmentation loss, retaining
    or decreasing the VIF values, and retaining or decreasing the rs values. For the
    time-series datasets, the TESI significantly smoothies and increases the data
    stationarity, resulting in constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation structure
    over time, which minimises the noisy data effect on the DNN performance. Further,
    the Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI minimise the proportionality of interpolation error
    to the square of the distance between the data points compared to the LN-TESI.
    Furthermore, the Q-TESI, C-TESI, and L-TESI may approximate the nonlinear changes
    of crop phenology in time-spaced sampling, thereby reducing the cost of sampling
    for scientists. Furthermore, they intensify non-time series zonal synthetic sampling,
    which reduces sampling labour. However, the TESI is limited for non-time series
    data augmentation; the TESI creates a routine-based-smoothed data, which allows
    DNNs to approximate a constant model during the training phase but less generalizable
    if changing the test data. Moreover, autoregressive models like the long short-term
    memory neural network (LSTM) might be better than the DNN for modelling time-series
    data. Future studies may apply an LSTM for the same aim as this study. CRediT

    Several applications and systems depend on the plant disease data analysis results
    for the efficient functioning of crop yield and disease prediction. A crop disease
    prediction system necessitates an enormous amount of data management for the corresponding
    identification and forecasting process. The database here consists of the names
    of the crop, types, enzymes, cells, DNA, and so on. Despite its complexity, analysis
    of data is said to be paramount in several areas of work as it enhances the data
    quality utilized. With the establishment of many crop diseases in farmer fields,
    accurate and early detection of crop diseases is said to be achieved through accurate
    extraction of features or attributes. The presence of unnecessary features or
    attributes causes results in increasing the time for disease prediction but also
    compromises the rate of accuracy. Though, it is extremely incompetent and hence
    susceptible to an error with the inception of big data. Therefore, in this work,
    the Rank Regressive Learning process is presented to extract relevant features.
    With obtained features, Proaftn Fuzzy Classification is carried out to categorize
    diseases for identifying crop diseases with minimum error rate. In Subramani et
    al. (2022), a Preemptive Classification using the Discrete Data method was performed
    into obtaining distinguishing features for crop disease identification. The PC-DD
    method necessitated partial series by means of probabilistic data substitution
    for enhancing the analysis rate. The analysis state performed the classification
    process by employing random forest on the basis of dual combinations, i.e., series
    difference, and probability. The probability factor here was designed on the basis
    of identical data observed via series probability classification. The process
    was said to be repeated until the detection. With this type of design, performance
    improvements in terms of detection accuracy, analysis ratio, analysis time, and
    classifications were ensured. Although progress is observed in various factors
    like precision (accuracy), time, and error rate for crop disease identification
    was not focused. The thrips incidence prediction method was obtained in Manrique-Silupu
    et al. (2021) with the objective of estimating the classification of pest incidence
    level to establish the machine learning techniques. Also, a detailed utilization
    of atmospheric variables was measured with the input data. Moreover, Support Vector
    Machine techniques were also employed for assessing diseases according to the
    prevailing climatic conditions. With this type of assessment not only resulted
    in pest management control but also reduced the cost also. Though cost in addition
    to pest management both considered to be important aspects for the classification
    of pests were performed at the cost of accuracy. Plant disease is a crucial field
    of interest and also agriculture field is concerned. Verity of pathogens is the
    root source of plant disease. Several resources and high intensity of proficiency
    are necessitated for accurate disease prediction. A few diseases are so frequent
    and have similar indicators even distinct experts may provide a diversified opinion
    regarding the disease. In Dahiya et al. (2022), several deep learning frameworks
    were analyzed and validated for plant leaves disease detection. Management of
    crop diseases over the past few years implemented with the purpose of avoiding
    them has changed considerably. For this purpose, in recent years novel information
    and communication techniques are probable in predicting change in disease severity
    by employing big data analysis techniques. An analysis and classification of research
    studies are designed in Fenu and Malloci (2021) to forecasting crop disease prediction
    at a pre-symptomatic stage. AI-based machine learning and deep learning were presented
    in Jackulin and Murugavalli (2022) to comprehensively review different types of
    crop disease detection mechanisms determined by the designed methods. Uncontrolled
    utilization of fungicides brings about pathogen resistance and generates fatalistic
    influence in the general atmosphere. The crop disease predictive method in similar
    circumstances is perhaps efficient in early disease prediction. However, the overhead
    incurred was not focused. In Ahmed et al. (2015), a stepwise regression analysis
    technique for disease prediction was designed. This type of analysis resulted
    in the identification of disease variability accurately. Despite accuracy factors
    involving disease identification evolved, the time and error rate were not concentrated.
    Different types of statistical mechanisms were utilized to plant disease prediction.
    Nevertheless, the requirement to design a novel method considering several transposed
    environmental aspects and appropriate the improved Korean domestic farmhouse.
    The potato late blight prediction model called BLITE-SVR designed in Gu et al.
    (2016) by SVR and statistical method is ensured robust disease detection performance.
    A crop disease called powdery mildew on wheat is considered a very large frequent
    as well as catastrophic foliar disease, which is emerged into crucial minimizations
    during wheat production. In Zhao et al. (2018), an assessment of Moderate Resolution
    Imaging Spectro radiometer time-series data products was designed into predicting
    the wheat powdery mildew. Today’s world is heavily influenced by both information
    and communication techniques. These techniques are several aspects of human life
    and occupation. However, every day, further specimens of probable application
    of data communications techniques are individually exposed. With the most significant
    and demanding task in agriculture being plant protection owing to its intricacy
    and the absence of unique apparatus that could predict disease even at the early
    stage, several mathematics-based techniques were applied (Ilic et al. 2018) for
    possible fruit disease infection. 1.1 Problem definition Most of the conventional
    machine learning techniques have been designed for the prediction of crop disease.
    But, it failed to increase the classification accuracy of crop disease. In addition,
    the error rate for disease prediction was not minimized. The existing classification
    method failed to detect the early stage of the disease to perform crop disease
    identification Traditional feature extraction method was unable to take less time.
    To overcome the existing issue, Rank Regressive Learning and Proaftn Fuzzy Classification
    (RRL-PFC) method is introduced to enhance crop disease prediction accuracy with
    lesser time. The integrated method, i.e., learning and classification select crop-related
    features for categorizing into distinct classes is made first via Rank Regressive
    Learning and then applied to resultant features to Proaftn Fuzzy Classification
    for accurate categorization of distinct diseases. 1.2 Contributions to the work
    The major contributions of rank regressive learning and Proaftn fuzzy classification-based
    (RRL-PFC) are listed below. The RRL-PFC method uses the novelty of Rank Regressive
    function for performing feature selection with aid of Least Square Estimates.
    The problem is formulated as a relative ordering between different feature values
    where computationally efficient features are considered. Hence, it reduces the
    feature selection forecasting time and overhead. The novelty of the Proaftn Fuzzy
    classifier is applied to Crop Disease Prediction model for classifying crop disease,
    therefore maximizing the margin of detection and crop disease prediction with
    improved accuracy and reduced error rate. Experimental evaluation of this proposed
    RRL-PFC method achieves better crop disease prediction and time, and overhead
    for crop disease prediction and improving crop disease prediction accuracy compared
    with the other crop disease prediction methods. 1.3 Structure of the paper The
    rest of the paper is outlined as follows: Section 2 discusses the area of crop
    disease prediction. Section 3 implements the proposed Rank Regressive Learning
    and Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction method. In Sect.
    4, the experimental setup and validation of results of the RRL-PFC method are
    measured by comparing existing conventional methods mentioned and discussed. Finally,
    the conclusion is discussed in Sect. 5. 2 Literature review Horticultural crops
    are considered significant aspects in our daily aspects of life and specifically
    consist of fruits, vegetables, botanical products as well as garden plants. In
    the evolution of contemporary culture, agricultural crops are not only taking
    part in economic aspects of line within given that foods uninterruptedly but as
    well play a significant part in improving the individual lifestyle. In the modern
    days, therefore, both autonomous and semi-autonomous apparatus are utilized in
    identifying crop disease by utilizing computer vision techniques. In Oliveira
    Aparecido et al. (2020), an elaborate introduction to deep learning techniques
    along with the inclusion of 71 recent research works employing deep learning techniques
    was investigated for crop disease detection. A systematic review of ML in the
    domain of agriculture was investigated in Saha et al. (2020) with the main focus
    on crop yield prediction, disease, and weed detection in crops. Yet another detailed
    review of the advantages and disadvantages of each ML technique and the appropriateness
    of these techniques in the process of distinct agricultural circumstances were
    presented in Bhatia et al. (2020). Prior to the attainment of maturity, the presence
    of diseases in the leaves of fruits, wheat, and rice with citrus is able to result
    in paramount influence on their yields also. Hence, it requires swift and accurate
    disease diagnosis in leaves of fruits, wheat, rice as well as citrus in the early
    stage itself. In Aggarwal et al. (2022), reviews of agreed businesses designed
    for accuracy widening the rice formation considered to be the main harvests on
    the earth were analyzed. Also, an overview and investigation of several materials
    and methods recognized with crop disease identification were also introduced.
    In Kumar et al. (2022), a CNN algorithm was utilized in designing the forecast
    mechanism by employing Tensor Flow’s Keras API. This in turn also assisted the
    farmers in identifying the cotton disease. As probable diseases are said to be
    developed on the leaves of the plant, classification is said to be hindered constantly
    due to several obstacles like overfitting, low accuracy, and so on. An efficient
    framework to classify multiple leaf diseases of plants was analyzed inSaberi Anari
    (2022). Also, a deep transfer learning technique was applied for extracting robust
    features. The purpose of addressing issues is different types of pests and crop
    diseases, rapid dispersal momentum with the prolonged time intervals of disease
    classification manually, and crop disease identification to establish deep learning
    from the angle of biological and ecological security was presented in Wang (2022).
    As a result, recognition accuracy was found to be improved. Yet another deep lens
    classification and detection model for plant leaf disease detection was presented
    in Shook et al. (2021). However, with varying time intervals, the disease pattern
    may also change. In order to address this aspect, SVR among the radial basis function
    kernel was designed in Shook et al. (2021). With this not only disease predictions
    were made accurately but also improved the crop yield significantly. Due to hectic
    climatic changes, even experienced farmers face difficulties in making constructive
    decisions that in turn result in crop failure, therefore causing disease. In Menon
    et al. (2021), the Decision Tree model was designed to predict disease efficiently.
    Certain machine learning techniques were investigated in Fenu and Malloci (2019)
    for predicting crop disease. Distinguished from prior works, a crop disease prediction
    method combined with Rank Regressive Learning-based Feature Selection and Proaftn
    Fuzzy Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction concerning big data analysis
    is proposed in this paper. By introducing the least square estimation function,
    highly relevant features on the basis of relative ordering between different feature
    values are obtained. Also, with the partial indifference relations maximum resemblance
    factors involved in prediction are analyzed. As a result, the important performance
    metrics involving big data, such as feature detection time, the overhead involved
    in crop disease detection, and minimum error rate with maximum crop disease prediction
    accuracy are obtained. 3 Methodology Crop diseases necessitate significant inferences
    that are used for food security and production losses. Over the past few years,
    the continuing international trade and alternating weather have not only aggravated
    prevailing advantageous circumstances for crop disease other than also produced
    innovative situations by which agriculture should now take on. In this work, we
    plan to develop a Rank Regressive Learning and Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based
    Crop Disease Prediction method involving big data with minimal feature selection
    time, feature selection overhead, error rate, and improved crop disease prediction
    accuracy. Big data specifically involves volume, veracity, velocity, and variety.
    In our work, rather than volume and variety focus is made on veracity and velocity.
    To be more specific, veracity denotes the reliability of data, instead of acquiring
    the data from third parties the soybean dataset is acquired from native sites,
    therefore ensuring reliable results. Next, as far as the velocity is concerned,
    the focus is on acquiring data trending over time. With these two big data analytics
    features, the proposed RRL-PFC method consists of two steps, namely feature selection
    and data classification. Initially, with the Soybean dataset provided as input,
    the Rank Regressive Learning-based Feature Selection model is applied for predicting
    relevant features based on the relative ordering between different feature values.
    After performing the feature selection, the Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based
    Crop Disease Prediction process is carried out to categorize crop diseases. Proaftn
    being a supervised learning fuzzy classification determines the fuzzy indifference
    relations by generalizing the index to turn in aid of classifying the crop disease
    accurately. The merits of the proposed work include the following, at first, relevant
    features are selected by applying the Rank Regressive Learning process. Here,
    the correlation coefficient between features is estimated to identify relevant
    features Next, the Proaftn Fuzzy Classification process is performed to classify
    data to predict crop disease with improved accuracy. Below, a detailed description
    of the proposed method is explained. 3.1 Rank regressive learning-based feature
    selection model Feature selection is employed to choose relevant features and
    eliminate the unrelated feature. It also aids in detecting unrelated features,
    which minimizes overfitting and may lead to an enhancement in performance. It
    reduces the time taken for predicting diseases. Selecting the feature model would
    make sure an appropriate sample classification is frequently difficult in real-life
    classification issues other than giving a huge amount of applicant features. Not
    all the features are in use for crop disease prediction. Therefore, optimal features
    have to be selected. In this work, Rank Regressive Learning-based Feature Selection
    is applied with the objective of selecting the optimal features for further disease
    prediction in a computationally efficient manner. The performance of the Rank
    Regressive Learning-based Feature Selection process in the proposed method evaluates
    the significance and redundancy of features. For each feature, the least square
    regression function is carried out for selecting relevant features. Next, the
    feature selection problem is studied as a Least Square Estimate computation problem
    with Rank Regression. Finally, the optimal features are selected in an effective
    manner. The advantages of feature selection by using the Rank Regressive learning
    process are as follows. First, the significance and redundancy of features are
    considered to measure the distance between features for relevant feature identification.
    Second, Rank Regression is applied to estimate the least square and correlation
    coefficient value. Based on estimated value, relevant features are considered
    by discarding irrelevant features of data. Figure 1 shows the flow diagram of
    the Rank Regressive Learning -based Feature Selection model. Fig. 1 Flow diagram
    of rank regressive learning-based feature selection model Full size image As shown
    in the above figure with the soybean dataset provided as input, the objective
    remains in selecting the significant feature in a computationally efficient manner.
    In other words, complete data with no suspensions have to be selected. Features
    are said to be plotted in such a manner as to linearize the unreliable function
    for a specific distribution. The horizontal axis represents the failure representations,
    and the vertical axis represents the unreliability measures. Next, these unreliability
    measures are evaluated by means of median ranks, also called rank regression via
    the least square regression function. The least square regression function in
    rank regression is designed in such a manner that the straight line is fitted
    to a set of data points (i.e., feature values) such that the sum of the squares
    of the distance of the feature values to the fitted line is minimized. This minimization
    is said to be done either in the horizontal or vertical direction. In our work,
    it is performed in the horizontal direction, i.e., the line is fitted so that
    the horizontal deviations from the feature values to the line are minimized. To
    start with the raw input dataset ‘DS’ are formulated in the form of a matrix vector
    called the input vector, as given below. $$ {\\text{IV}} = \\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c}
    {F_{11} } & {F_{12} } & \\ldots & {F_{1n} } \\\\ {F_{21} } & {F_{22} } & \\ldots
    & {F_{2n} } \\\\ \\ldots & \\ldots & \\ldots & \\ldots \\\\ {F_{m1} } & {F_{m2}
    } & \\ldots & {F_{mn} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right], \\,m = 684, \\,n = 36 $$
    (1) From the above input vector ‘IV’ matrix formulation as given in (1), ‘n=36’
    features are present with overall sample instances of ‘m=684’, respectively. The
    different names of the features are date, plant_stand, precip, temp, hail, crop_hist,
    area_damaged, and so on. Table 1 lists the dataset description. Table 1 Soybean
    dataset description Full size table With the above set of features, the first
    relevant features for crop disease detection are obtained. To acquire the features
    from the raw dataset, let us consider a straight line ‘\\(v = pu + q\\)’ and the
    objective remains in identifying the values of ‘\\(p\\)’ and ‘\\(q\\)’, where
    ‘\\(p,q \\in F\\)’ that minimizes the square of the distance from the feature
    values to the line. Initially, the significance and redundancy of feature is evaluated
    as $$ \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\left( {p^{\\prime} + q^{\\prime}u_{i}
    } \\right)^{2} = \\min \\left( {p,q} \\right)\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n}
    \\left( {p + qu_{i} - v_{i} } \\right)^{2} $$ (2) From Eq. (2), ‘\\(p^{\\prime}\\)’
    and ‘\\(q^{\\prime}\\)’ denotes the least square evaluation of ‘\\(p\\)’ and ‘\\(q\\)’,
    respectively. The minimization of the above equation is then formulated with rank
    regression as given below. $$ p^{\\prime} = \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} v_{i} }}{n} - q^{\\prime}\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n}
    u_{i} }}{n} = v^{\\prime} - q^{\\prime}u^{\\prime} $$ (3) $$ q^{\\prime} = \\frac{{\\mathop
    \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i} v_{i} - \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} u_{i} \\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} v_{i} }}{n}}}{{\\mathop \\sum
    \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i}^{2} - \\frac{{\\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} u_{i} } \\right)^{2} }}{n}}} $$ (4) From Eqs. (3) and (4), ‘\\(n\\)’
    denotes the number of ‘\\(\\left( {u_{i} , v_{i} } \\right)\\)’ data coordinates,
    respectively. Finally, based on the rank learning regression relevant features
    are selected on arbitrary scale where only the relative ordering between different
    feature values is significant as given below. $$ \\rho = \\frac{{\\sigma_{uv}
    }}{{\\sigma_{u} \\sigma_{v} }} $$ (5) In Eq. (5), ‘\\(\\sigma_{{{\\text{uv}}}}\\)’,
    ‘\\(\\sigma_{{\\text{u}}}\\)’ and ‘\\(\\sigma_{{\\text{v}}}\\)’, are covariance
    of ‘\\(u\\)’ and ‘\\(v\\)’, ‘\\(u\\)’ is a standard deviation and ‘\\(v\\)’ is
    a standard deviation, respectively. Finally, the measure of correlation coefficient
    with which the relevant features based on the relative ordering between different
    feature values are obtained is given below. $$ \\rho^{\\prime} = \\frac{{\\mathop
    \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i} v_{i} - \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} u_{i} \\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} v_{i} }}{n}}}{{\\sqrt {\\left(
    {\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i}^{2} - \\frac{{\\left( {\\mathop \\sum
    \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} u_{i} } \\right)^{2} }}{n}} \\right)\\left( {\\mathop \\sum
    \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{n} v_{i}^{2} - \\frac{{\\left( {\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i
    = 1}^{n} v_{i} } \\right)^{2} }}{n}} \\right)} }} $$ (6) From Eq. (6) results,
    ‘\\(\\rho^{\\prime}\\)’ represents the estimator or ‘\\(\\rho\\)’. The closer
    the value is to ‘\\(0\\)’, ‘\\(+ 1\\)’ is a perfect fit with positive indication
    and is considered as relevant feature while ‘\\(- 1\\)’ is a perfect fit with
    a negative slope and is considered as irrelevant feature and discarded for further
    processing. Table 2 lists the positive indication features. Table 2 Significant
    features [closer to 1 having positive correlation] Full size table In a similar
    manner by means of a correlation coefficient, Table 3 indicates the negative indication
    features. Table 3 Significant features [not closer to + 1 having negative correlation]
    Full size table Finally, differentiating between the positive and negative indication,
    the relevant features selected for further processing (i.e., crop disease prediction)
    are listed in Table 4. Table 4 Relevant features selected Full size table When
    retrieved features are chosen, the total pseudocode for the Rank Regressive Learning-based
    Feature Selection is shown below, In Algorithm 1, with the aim of selecting the
    computationally efficient features used to crop disease prediction, the raw dataset
    is subjected to the Rank Learning Regression function. First, with the data acquired
    in the form of an input vector matrix, the significance of each feature is determined.
    Second, based on the significance, ranking is performed based on the regression
    function to determine the optimal features for further processing. Finally, by
    applying the Rank Learning Regression function highly correlated features are
    selected for further processing in an accurate and timely manner. 3.2 Proaftn
    fuzzy classification-based crop disease prediction An exponential increase in
    the population and a repetition of prevailing universal crop yield are anticipated
    to require by 2050. Crop diseases are the most important hurdle to achieving these
    productivity results. Therefore, this necessary is designed for effective models
    for crop disease prediction at an early stage. Moreover, multi-criterion decision-making
    is also designed and has received a great deal of attention. But it failed to
    much work done in the area of crop disease prediction. To overcome this work,
    a new model used to crop disease prediction based on multi-criterion decision-making
    fuzzy classification called, Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-Based Crop Disease Prediction
    is designed. With the minimum generalization error and reduced computational complexity
    of the model, the proposed model is practically feasible to be applied in the
    domain of crop disease prediction. In order to our work is employed to Proaftn
    Fuzzy Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction model into supervised learning
    algorithms. The acronym Proaftn stands for Fuzzy Assignment Procedure for Nominal
    Sorting. The model enables determining the fuzzy indifference relations by generalizing
    the indices. To determine the fuzzy indifference relations, Proaftn employs the
    pre-classified cases called a training set. The Proaftn fuzzy classification approach
    is generally employed to forecast crop disease in a smaller time. The structure
    of the fuzzy system is easier and more understandable than other classifier approaches.
    In fuzzy classifiers, system performance is modified to attain strong ability
    and enhanced precision results. Fuzzy classifier system is simply constructed
    and these systems offer solutions to complex solutions. Figure 2 shows the structure
    of the Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction model. Fig.
    2 Structure of Proaftn fuzzy classification based on crop disease prediction model
    Full size image As shown in the above figure, let us assume that the features
    selected are described by a set of ‘n’ attributes ‘[FS]1, [FS]2,...,[FS]n’ and
    a label is ‘C’ specified to group the ‘k’ classes ‘α = {C1, C2,…, Ck}’. Then,
    a set of ‘N’ crop samples ‘S’, it is required to construct a classification model
    ‘f:S→ α’ that can accurately predict the target class of each sample. Once the
    model is constructed, it is utilized to assign the most relevant class to new
    unseen samples. The crop disease prediction model is based on employing the training
    set to compose a set of prototypes for each class. For each class ‘Ch’, the prototypes
    (Michalski 1980) are represented as ‘[Pro]i = [Pro]1h, [Pro]2h,…, [Pro]1kh’, where
    ‘1k’ is a numeral of prototypes for this class. Table 5 lists the prototypes and
    the corresponding disease classes. Table 5 Prototype description with their corresponding
    disease classes Full size table As given in Table 5 for each prototype ‘\\({\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h}\\)’
    and each attribute ‘\\({\\text{FS}}_{i}\\)’, fuzzy partial in difference relation
    ‘\\(I{\\text{Rel}}_{j} \\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right)\\)’ is defined
    to measure the degree of resemblance of the samples ‘\\(x\\)’ to ‘\\({\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h}\\)
    based on ‘\\({\\text{FS}}_{i}\\)’. This fuzzy crop disease prediction relation
    is differentiated by means of four distinct criteria, the features selected ‘\\({\\text{FS}}\\)’
    (i.e., 25 distinct features) ‘\\({\\text{FS}}_{i}^{1} \\left( {{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h}
    } \\right),\\,{\\text{FS}}_{i}^{2} \\left( {{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right)\\)’
    and the thresholds ‘\\({\\text{Th}}_{j}^{1} \\left( {{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right),\\,{\\text{Th}}_{j}^{2}
    \\left( {{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right)\\)’, respectively. After that, to classify
    a sample ‘\\(x\\)’ is the class ‘\\(C^{h}\\)’, Proaftn Fuzzy Classification evaluates
    the membership degree ‘\\(\\delta \\left( {x,C^{h} } \\right)\\)’ as $$ \\delta
    \\left( {x,C^{h} } \\right) = \\max \\left\\{ {S\\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{1}^{h}
    } \\right), S\\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{2}^{h} } \\right), \\ldots , S\\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{lk}^{h}
    } \\right)} \\right\\} $$ (7) From Eq. (7), ‘\\(S\\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{1}^{h}
    } \\right)\\)’ is a fuzzy indifference relation that is evaluated as weighted
    sum of partial in difference relations mathematically formulated as $$ S\\left(
    {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right) = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i,j = 1}^{n,k}
    W_{ij} C_{k} \\left( {x,{\\text{Pro}}_{i}^{h} } \\right),\\; {\\text{ where}}
    W_{ij} \\in \\left[ {0,1} \\right], \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} W_{ij}
    = 1 $$ (8) In Eq. (8), ‘\\(W_{ij}\\)’ represent the weight that evaluates the
    significance of the feature selected ‘\\({\\text{FS}}_{i}\\)’ of a specific class
    ‘\\(C_{k}\\)’, respectively. Finally, the sample ‘\\(x\\)’ is assigned to class
    ‘\\(C_{k}\\)’ that possess the maximum resemblance based on the following decision
    rule as $$ x \\in C^{h} \\Leftrightarrow \\delta \\left( {x,C^{h} } \\right) =
    \\max \\left\\{ {\\delta \\left( {x,C_{i} } \\right), i \\in \\left\\{ {1,..k}
    \\right\\}} \\right\\} $$ (9) With the above maximum resemblance results based
    on the decision given above and the formulated prototypes, the pseudocode representation
    of Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-Based Crop Disease Prediction is given below.
    In Algorithm 2, with the aim of predicting the crop disease in an accurate and
    error-reduced fashion, a Proaftn Fuzzy Classification is designed. With the relevant
    features selected provided as input, the algorithm creates a set of prototypes
    for each class (i.e., crop disease class). Next, to classify the given sample
    to the appropriate diseased class with a minimum error rate, the membership degree
    is evaluated. At last, the weighted sum of partial indifference relations is achieved
    by generalizing the indexes so that classifies the crop disease accurately. Finally,
    based on the maximum resemblance, the classified results are obtained. By these
    means, the accuracy of crop disease is ensured with a minimum error rate. 4 Performance
    analysis The experimental evaluation of the proposed RRL-PFC crop disease prediction
    and two existing methods Preemptive Classification using Discrete Data (PC-DD)
    (Subramani et al. 2022) and Thrips incidence prediction (Manrique-Silupu et al.
    2021) are executed in Python language. In this work, the soybean dataset is utilized
    in the proposed method to classify crop disease classes with enhanced prediction.
    By using the soybean dataset, the samples are classified with maximum accuracy
    and minimum time. While compared with other datasets, the soybean dataset is more
    advantageous for predicting crop disease. It is a vegetable food that contains
    all eight essential amino acids. Thus, it is selected for proposed and existing
    techniques in order to provide better performance for crop disease prediction.
    The soybean dataset is taken from https://datahub.io/machine-learning/soybean
    from Kaggle and used for experimental purposes. The Soybean dataset size is 168
    KB and it is an open-source data set. The considered Soybean dataset comprises
    35 attributes or features with various numbers of instances. A total of 684 sample
    data is presented in the dataset. From that, missing values are eliminated and
    600 sample inputs are considered for conducting simulation purposes. Soybean dataset
    is commonly utilized for predicting crop disease in accurate manner. With the
    utilization of various soy products namely soy flour, soy milk, cottage cheese
    like tofu, fermented products like tempeh and miso, the dataset is designed for
    prediction process. The whole experiment is conducted in an Intel Core i5-6200U
    CPU @ 2.30 GHz 4 cores with 4 Gigabytes of DDR4 RAM. An objective of the proposed
    RRL-PFC method is focused on enhancing crop disease prediction accuracy with lesser
    time and error. Based on the objective of the proposed RRL-PFC method, existing
    methods such as the Preemptive Classification using Discrete Data (Subramani et
    al. 2022) and Thrips incidence prediction method (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021)
    is taken as base paper. These two base papers are explained to understand the
    proposed method. The proposed method concept is derived by considering the problems
    of these base papers. The drawbacks of these methods are effectively convinced
    by implementing the proposed method. Based on the objective of the proposed method,
    parameters such as feature selection time, feature selection overhead, crop disease
    prediction accuracy, and error rate are selected for experimental purposes. In
    our work, Rank Regressive Learning-based feature selection is used to select relevant
    features with minimized time. With the removal of irrelevant features, overhead
    is considerably minimized. Next, the Proaftn Fuzzy Classification -based crop
    disease prediction is used to classify input data samples. This helps to improve
    the prediction accuracy and minimized the error rate. 4.1 Performance analysis
    of feature selection time (for crop disease prediction) In this section, the time
    consumed in selecting relevant and pertinent features for crop disease prediction
    is provided. As not all the features present in the dataset are of high use during
    crop disease prediction, the irrelevant features have to be discarded, and while
    performing this process, a proportionate of the total time is consumed and is
    referred to as the feature selection time. The feature selection time is mathematically
    stated as $$ {\\text{FST}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} S_{i} *{\\text{Time}}\\left[
    {\\rho^{\\prime}} \\right] $$ (10) From Eq. (10), the ‘FST’ is a feature selection
    time measured to soybean samples involved in simulation ‘Si’ and the ‘Time[ρ′]’
    is the actual time consumed in relevant feature selection based on the relative
    ordering between different feature values, respectively. It is measured in milliseconds
    (ms). Table 6 presents the performance outcome of feature selection time with
    respect to varying crop samples obtained at different time periods from the soybean
    database. The results obtained confirm that the feature selection time of the
    RRL-PFC method for crop disease prediction is improved upon comparison with the
    other existing methods (Subramani et al. 2022; Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021). Table
    6 Feature selection time measure of the proposed RRL-PFC method and other learning
    methods Full size table Figure 3 illustrates the graphical portrayal of a feature
    selection time for crop disease prediction using the three methods, RRL-PFC, PC-DD
    (Subramani et al. 2022), and Thrips incidence prediction (Manrique-Silupu et al.
    2021), respectively. From the figure, it is inferred that the feature selection
    time improved with enhanced crop samples provided in the simulation period obtained
    from different time intervals. This is due to the reason that with a larger number
    of crop samples involved during simulation, a large amount of time is said to
    be consumed during analyzing various features this, in turn, increases the feature
    selection time also. So, the feature selection time is said to be direct proportionality
    to the crop samples. Nevertheless, with simulations performed with 60 crop samples,
    construct a robust crop disease detection system, the time consumed in obtaining
    the correct type of features being ‘0.12 ms’, the overall feature selection time
    using RRL-PFC method was 7.2 ms, the time consumed in detecting the correct type
    of features being ‘0.18 ms’, the overall feature selection time using (Subramani
    et al. 2022) was 10.8 ms, the time consumed in detecting the correct type of feature
    for a crop sample being ‘0.20 ms’, the overall feature selection time using (Manrique-Silupu
    et al. 2021) was finally observed to be 12 ms using (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021).
    From this result, it is inferred that the feature selection time for predicting
    crop disease using the RRL-PFC method was observed into enhanced by when compared
    to existing methods (Subramani et al. 2022) and (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021).
    The improvement in the application of measured unreliability is done by employing
    median ranks and also referred to as rank regression via the least square regression
    function. The least square regression function is designed in such a manner so
    as to see that the straight line is fitted in such a manner that the sum of squares
    of the distance of feature values to the fitted line is minimized. Feature selection
    time using the RRL-PFC method is reduced by 23 and 36% compared to Subramani et
    al. (2022) and (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021). Fig. 3 Graphical representation
    of feature selection time Full size image 4.2 Performance analysis of features
    selection overhead (for crop disease prediction) In this section, the overhead
    incurred during the process of feature selection for categorizing into the corresponding
    disease for crop disease prediction. Feature selection overhead is said to occur
    owing while ranking regression for obtaining the least square estimates. This
    feature selection overhead is mathematically stated as given below. $$ {\\text{FSO}}
    = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} S_{i} *{\\text{Mem}}\\left[ {{\\text{FS}}}
    \\right] $$ (11) In Eq. (11), ‘FSO’ is a feature selection overhead measured.
    ‘Si’ is a sample provided at different time periods and the actual memory consumed
    during ranking via regression ‘Mem[FS]’. is measured in kilobytes (KB). Table
    7 provides the performance results of the feature selection overhead versus the
    distinct number of crop samples collected from the soybean dataset. For simulation
    purposes, the number of samples is taken in the range of 60 to 600. Upon comparison,
    the RRL-PFC NN method provides improved performance of feature selection overhead
    compared to conventional methods (Subramani et al. 2022 and Manrique-Silupu et
    al. 2021). Table 7 Feature selection overhead measure of the proposed RRL-PFC
    method and other learning methods Full size table Figure 4 illustrates the graphical
    representation of feature selection overhead involved during the prediction of
    crop disease. A steep increase in the feature selection overhead is observed using
    all three methods. This is because with the increase in the samples provided in
    the x-axis, the number of features for the corresponding samples increases, therefore
    causing a steep rise in the overhead incurred for crop disease prediction also.
    Bus comparative analysis shows betterment using RRL-PFC, compared to existing
    (Subramani et al. 2022) and (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021). The reason behind the
    development was due to the incorporation of a rank learning regression function
    that not only ranks the features based on significance but also selects the feature
    via regression. Feature selection overhead is minimized using RRL-PFC by 21 and
    31% compared to Subramani et al. (2022) and Manrique-Silupu et al. (2021), respectively.

    4.3 Crop disease prediction accuracy The accuracy involved in the prediction of
    crop disease is analyzed. While performing the action of crop disease prediction,
    due to statistical fluctuations and the presence of sound in input sample data
    values, accuracy remains one of the main factors of analysis. Crop disease prediction
    accuracy is mathematically stated as $$ {\\text{PA}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} \\frac{{S_{{{\\text{PA}}}} }}{{S_{i} }}*100 $$ (12) In Eq. (12), ‘PA’
    is crop disease prediction accuracy measured to samples provided for simulation
    ‘Si’ and the samples predicted accurately into the corresponding disease classes
    ‘SPA’. Prediction accuracy is measured in percentage (%). Table 8 presents a simulation
    of different results of crop disease prediction accuracy rate of three different
    methods with respect to different numbers of crop samples. Table 8 Crop disease
    prediction accuracy measure of the proposed RRL-PFC method and other learning
    methods Full size table Figure 5 describes the graphical representation of the
    proposed RRL-PFC, existing PC-DD (Subramani et al. 2022), and Thrips incidence
    prediction (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021) on the soybean dataset in terms of crop
    disease prediction accuracy rate. In Fig. 5, the horizontal axis represents the
    crop samples and the vertical axis indicates the measure of crop disease prediction
    accuracy rate. The crop samples are defined as the instances of the corresponding
    crop instances and employed for experimental purposes so that crop disease prediction
    accuracy can be made. The reported results from the figure show that the proposed
    RRL-PFC method outperforms other methods (Subramani et al. 2022) and (Manrique-Silupu
    et al. 2021) by 7 and 17% in terms of crop disease prediction accuracy rate. This
    is evident from the simulation with 120 crop samples involved in crop disease
    prediction accuracy (where 117 samples were found to be correctly classified into
    their corresponding disease classes) using RRL-PFC, ‘112’ amount of crop samples
    are detected by using(Subramaniet al. 2022) and ‘105’ number of crop samples were
    detected using (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021). It is because RRL-PFC method utilizes
    highly correlated features obtained via the Rank Learning Regression function
    to obtain highly correlated coefficient features. This, in turn, eliminates the
    values of each feature within an explicit range and correctly classified them
    into their corresponding types of disease classes. Crop disease prediction accuracy
    rate is increased using proposed RRL-PFC method by 7%, and 17% than (Subramani
    et al. 2022) and (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021). Fig. 5 Graphical representation
    of crop disease prediction accuracy Full size image 4.4 Error rate Error rate
    is involved when predicting crop disease is presented for distinct numbers of
    soybean samples. $$ {\\text{ER}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} \\frac{{S_{{{\\text{WP}}}}
    }}{{S_{i} }} $$ (13) In Eq. (13), the error rate ‘ER’ is analyzed by samples considered
    for simulation ‘Si’ and the samples are wrongly predicted ‘SWP’. The error rate
    is measured in percentage (%). Finally, Table 9 lists the simulation results of
    error rate using three methods, RRL-PFC, PC-DD (Subramani et al. 2022), and Thrips
    incidence prediction (Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021), respectively. Table 9 Error
    rate measure of the proposed RRL-PFC method and other learning methods Full size
    table Figure 6 shows the error rate for three different methods. The error rate
    is considered to be one of the paramount metrics during classification for crop
    disease prediction. This is due to the reason that not all the crop sample results
    are found to be accurately classified into their appropriate classes and certain
    results are also wrongly classified due to the presence of class imbalance factors
    or noisy incomplete data in the selected crop samples. From the figure, a significant
    amount of rise is found with the increase in the crop samples in all three methods
    from the soybean dataset. However, with simulations conducted with 120 crop samples,
    the error rate was observed to be 2.5, 6.66%, and 12.5% using the proposed RRL-PFC
    and the existing two methods, respectively. With this measure, the error rate
    was reduced using RRL-PFC upon comparison with the two other conventional methods.
    The motivation for improvement was owing to the application of the Proaftn Fuzzy
    Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction algorithm. Via applying this algorithm,
    conscious crop detection is made by conditional checking between the prototype
    and their corresponding disease classes partial indifference relations. Accordingly,
    five distinct disease classes were formed. Also, fifteen of three types of disease
    conditions were made. Error rate using RRL-PFC method was significantly minimized
    by 43 and 67% compared to Subramani et al. (2022); Manrique-Silupu et al. 2021).
    Fig. 6 Graphical representation of error rate Full size image 5 Conclusion In
    many crops disease detection or prediction systems, similarity functions at a
    fine-grained pattern are particularly utilized in differentiating between different
    types of diseased classes. Upon comparison with most of the prevailing crop disease
    prediction methods, a novel Rank Regressive Learning and Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based
    (RRL-PFC) method using machine learning classifier based on crop samples is designed
    to enhance the crop disease prediction accuracy as well to minimize the time and
    error rate. The main innovation of our method is obtaining a measure for different
    types of crop disease classes by proposing a Rank Regressive Learning-based Feature
    Selection algorithm. Specifically, with the processed crop sample instances, highly
    correlated features are first obtained based on the feature significance. Here,
    the correlated features are said to be acquired in a computationally efficient
    manner by performing ranking using a regression function that in turn improves
    the feature selection accuracy and with the highly correlated features using the
    Rank Learning Regression function feature selection time is also said to be reduced.
    Second, the Proaftn Fuzzy Classification-based Crop Disease Prediction algorithm
    is presented to make robust crop disease prediction with minimum error rate. In
    addition, along with the experiments, an empirical evaluation of our RRL-PFC method
    with the aid of discussion is also performed to compare to the traditional methods
    using the soybean dataset. The observed numerical results have confirmed that
    the proposed RRL-PFC method outperforms well by achieving a higher crop disease
    detection accuracy by 12% with lesser time, overhead, and error rate by 30, 26,
    and 35% than the other conventional methods. The proposed RRL-PFC method is further
    extended for crop disease prediction to obtain enhanced crop disease prediction
    accuracy by using a novel deep learning method by performing pre-processing model
    on input sample data. In addition, the sensitivity, and specificity metric is
    measured for crop disease prediction performance. Data availability https://datahub.io/machinelearning/soybean.

  description: Early prediction of winter wheat yield at the regional scale is essential
    for food policy making and food security, especially in the context of population
    growth and climate change. Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence (AI)
    are key technologies for smart agriculture, bringing cost-effective solutions
    to the agricultural sector. Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has currently
    emerged as one of the key methods for guiding agricultural production. In this
    study, we proposed a Bayesian optimization-based long- and short-term memory model
    (BO-LSTM) to construct a multi-source data fusion-driven crop growth feature extraction
    algorithm for winter wheat yield prediction. The yield prediction performance
    of BO-LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and least absolute shrinkage and selection
    operator (Lasso) was then compared with multi-source data as input variables.
    The results showed that effective deep learning hyperparameter optimization is
    made possible by Bayesian optimization. The BO-LSTM (RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha, R2 =
    0.82) model had the highest accuracy of yield prediction with the input combination
    of “GPP + Climate + LAI + VIs”. BO-LSTM and SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80)
    methods outperformed linear regression Lasso (RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76) for
    winter wheat yield estimation. There were also differences between machine learning
    and deep learning, BO-LSTM outperformed SVM. indicating that the BO-LSTM model
    was more effective at capturing data correlations. In order to further verify
    the robustness of the BO-LSTM method, we explored the performance estimation performance
    of BO-LSTM in different regions. The results demonstrated that the BO-LSTM model
    could obtain higher estimation accuracy in regions with concentrated distribution
    of winter wheat cultivation and less influence of human factors. The approach
    used in this study can be expected to forecast crop yields, both in regions with
    a deficit of data and globally; it can also simply and effectively forecast winter
    wheat yields in a timely way utilizing publicly available multi-source data.

    prediction of winter wheat yield at the regional scale is essential for food policy
    making and food security, especially in the context of population growth and climate
    change. Agricultural big data and artificial intelligence (AI) are key technologies
    for smart agriculture, bringing cost-effective solutions to the agricultural sector.
    Deep learning-based crop yield forecast has currently emerged as one of the key
    methods for guiding agricultural production. In this study, we proposed a Bayesian
    optimization-based long- and short-term memory model (BO-LSTM) to construct a
    multi-source data fusion-driven crop growth feature extraction algorithm for winter
    wheat yield prediction. The yield prediction performance of BO-LSTM, support vector

    one of the top three crops in the world and is an important source of calories,
    protein, and many micronutrients for humans [1,2]. However, there are many constraints
    in production that pose serious threats to the stable and high yield potential
    of wheat, for example, increased temperature, increased precipitation variability,
    and frequent extreme events [3,4]. Therefore, early prediction of crop yield before
    harvest is of great value for our food security and trade. Traditional crop yield
    assessment is carried out through field surveys during the crop growing season
    or based on previous experience of crop growth conditions, a method that has reliability
    issues related to sampling and non-sampling errors in data collection and data
    processing due to small samples and limited human resources to obtain the required
    sampling frequency and sample size, and the variability of the climate from year
    to year makes traditional yield forecasts inaccurate and unstable [5]. The development
    of remote sensing technology has enabled large-scale crop yield prediction. Researchers
    have widely used remotely sensed vegetation indices and crop yields to build statistical
    regression models for yield estimation. Commonly used vegetation indices (VIs)
    are normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI),
    near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv), and leaf area index (LAI) [6,7,8].
    Some researchers have also used the wide dynamic range vegetation index (WDRVI)
    and solar induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) to model crop yield estimates
    [9,10]. Researchers are now utilizing non-linear models more frequently for yield
    estimation because crop yield is intimately tied to external environmental factors;
    meteorological variables affect crop growth, development, and final yield in a
    non-linear manner and often have complicated relationships [11,12,13,14]. Machine
    learning and deep learning methods are often used to achieve accurate predictions
    of various crop yields, especially deep learning, and the application of deep
    learning to estimate crop yields has been a popular algorithm among researchers
    in recent years. Different deep learning models have so far been used to estimate
    yield for various crops, highlighting the importance of deep learning network
    frameworks. Mainstream deep learning models include convolutional neural network
    (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) [15,16,17,18]. CNN models can better
    handle the spatial autocorrelation of remote sensing images, but they cannot adequately
    consider the complex temporal correlation [19]. And RNN is a sort of neural network
    that primarily models sequence-type data by taking sequence data as input and
    using the correlation between sequence data to execute recursion in the direction
    of sequence evolution [20]. RNN, however, suffers from gradient disappearance,
    gradient explosion, and inadequate long-term memory capacity with time step iteration.
    Long short-term memory (LSTM) is an excellent variant of the RNN model, which
    not only has the characteristics of the RNN model, but also effectively avoids
    the undesirable situations such as gradient explosion and gradient disappearance,
    etc. It introduces the “gate” control structure, sets the internal gate mechanism,
    trains the weights of the input gate, forget gate and output gate, realizes the
    automatic screening and fusion of temporal features, and has better prediction
    and fitting performance for data [21,22]. HAIDER et al. [23] showed that the LSTM
    neural network model has much higher yield estimation accuracy than RNN. JIANG
    et al. [24] estimated county-level maize yields based on an LSTM neural network
    model using maize growth period as a time series by combining crop phenology information,
    meteorological data, and remote sensing data. The results showed that the LSTM
    neural network model was able to extract the implied relationships contained in
    the data series, achieve accurate county-level crop yield estimation, and provide
    robust yield estimation under extreme weather conditions. Huiren Tian et al. [25]
    used LSTM to estimate wheat yield with different time steps, evaluating the comparison
    with back propagation neural network (BPNN) and support vector machine. The results
    of this study indicated that the LSTM model outperformed BPNN and SVM in estimating
    crop yield and is robust to climate and site fluctuations. Time series data as
    deep learning samples have been extensively studied at this stage [24,26]. Therefore,
    the samples used for training deep learning models mainly include remote sensing
    data and meteorological data based on multiple fertility periods and long time
    series, which provide a basis for further improving the accuracy of yield estimation.
    The network structure of deep learning is complex with many hyperparameters, and
    many scholars use deep learning algorithms to estimate crop yield by using empirical
    methods to determine the values of these hyperparameters. The combination of hyperparameters
    is very important to the prediction accuracy effect of neural network models,
    and a good combination of hyperparameters can improve the training accuracy of
    the model and the generalization ability of the test set. In order to speed up
    the training of neural networks, save training cost, and improve network performance,
    the optimization of LSTM neural network model hyperparameters using the Bayesian
    optimization algorithm is proposed. Commonly used hyperparameter optimization
    methods include grid search [27], random search, and particle swarm optimization
    algorithms [28]. The idea of the grid search algorithm is exhaustive search; the
    search time of this method increases exponentially with the number of parameters.
    For the case of more hyperparameters, this method faces performance problems.
    The results obtained by random search vary widely each time, and there is the
    problem of poor accuracy. The particle swarm optimization calculation is easy
    to fall into local optimum, resulting in low convergence accuracy. Compared to
    other optimization algorithms, Bayesian optimization algorithms are able to find
    better hyperparameters in a shorter time, compared to other optimization algorithms,
    and are a very effective global optimization algorithm [29,30,31]. Based on the
    current status of the recent studies presented above and the limitations, we take
    winter wheat in Hengshui City as an example. A BO-LSTM neural network model is
    proposed to predict winter wheat yield using satellite meteorological data on
    the basis of crop phenology. This study’s aims are the following three objectives:
    (i) speed up the training of neural networks, save training costs, and improve
    network performance. (ii) Determine which combinations of input variables are
    best for winter wheat yield estimation based on the BO-LSTM model. (iii) Compare
    the predictive performance of machine learning (SVM), deep learning (BO-LSTM),
    and linear regression (Lasso). Finally, explore what kind of environment our proposed
    model BO-LSTM is suitable for in order to obtain the most accurate prediction.
    2. Materials and Data 2.1. Study Area The study area is located in Hengshui, Hebei
    Province, China, between 115°10′–116°34′ E longitude and 37°03′–38°23′ N latitude,
    covering two municipal districts, one county-level city, and eight counties, as
    of 2016 (Figure 1). According to the second soil census, the city’s tidal soil
    subclass covers 430,000 hectares, accounting for 62% of the total land area, which
    is widely distributed in all counties and urban areas and is the main soil type
    for agricultural land. The annual precipitation in Hengshui is 5.66 billion cubic
    metres, with an average precipitation of 642.1 mm. It belongs to the continental
    monsoon climate zone, which is warm and semi-arid, and the main types of crops
    it grows are wheat, corn, sorghum, etc. By 2021, the sown area of grain in Hengshui
    reached 7191.33 km2, of which 3333.3 km2 is occupied by winter wheat, accounting
    for about 1/2 of the sown area of grain in Hengshui. With a total yield of 4.34
    billion kg, so the yield of winter wheat has a key influence on the economic development
    of Hengshui. This study was conducted on winter wheat, which is generally sown
    in early October and matures in mid-to-late June of the following year in Hengshui.
    The phenological period of winter wheat is mainly divided into six stages, sowing
    (early October), tillering (late-November to mid-December), reviving stage (late-February–mid-March),
    jointing (mid-March–mid-April), tasseling (late-April–mid-May), and mature milking
    (late-May–mid-June) [32,33]. Figure 1. Location of the study area. 2.2. Winter
    Wheat Yield and Planting Distribution The historical county-level winter wheat
    yield data record of Hengshui City came from the 2005–2019 statistical yearbook
    sharing platform, recording yield data (unit: kg/ha). In Hengshui City, there
    are two municipal districts and one county-level city; there are 11 counties,
    since we all consider these to be county-level levels. Spatial distribution data
    of winter wheat in Hengshui at 250 m spatial resolution from 2005–2019 were provided
    by Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences [34]. The extraction results were
    evaluated in terms of area quantity and spatial location, and the average relative
    error of area quantity compared with the statistical yearbook for 20 years was
    16.1%. In terms of spatial location, the extraction results of 2015 were verified
    by selecting sample points in Google Earth high-resolution historical images,
    and the overall accuracy was 86.8% with a kappa coefficient of 0.69. The results
    indicated that the winter wheat distribution data had a high extraction accuracy.
    2.3. Remote Sensing Data The NASA Terra MODIS vegetation index (VI) products (MOD13Q1,
    Version 6.1) provide consistent spatial and temporal time series comparisons of
    global vegetation conditions that can be used to monitor the Earth’s terrestrial
    photosynthetic vegetation activity in support of phenologic, change detection,
    and biophysical interpretations. In this study, NDVI and EVI data from the NASA-produced
    MOD13Q1 dataset with a temporal resolution of 16 days and a spatial resolution
    of 250 m were used. The MOD15A2H product provides a terrestrial LAI at 500 m resolution
    every 8 days, and it has been available since 2000 and allows analysis of LAI
    time series data over multiple growing seasons over long periods of time. 2.4.
    Gross Primary Productivity Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the amount of organic
    carbon fixed by photosynthesis per unit time by organisms, mainly green plants.
    MOD17A2H offers GPP products as 8-day, 500 m resolution composite products. This
    data product uses MODIS land cover data, leaf area index, photosynthetically active
    radiation fraction, and meteorological data from DAO and is fed into a light energy
    utilisation model. It is important for crop yield estimation, global carbon, and
    carbon trade [35,36]. 2.5. Meteorological Data In this study, we collected from
    TerraClimate datasets a dataset of high spatial resolution (1/24°, ~4 km) monthly
    climate and climatic water balance for global terrestrial surfaces from 1958–2015
    [37]. TerraClimate uses climate-assisted interpolation to combine high spatial
    resolution climate normals from the WorldClim dataset with coarser resolution
    time-varying (i.e., monthly) data from other sources to generate monthly datasets
    of precipitation, maximum and minimum temperatures, wind speed, vapour pressure,
    and solar radiation. This dataset has been widely used by many scholars to calculate
    various drought indices to assess the effects of drought on vegetation physiological
    activity and yield [38,39,40,41]. The main climate variables chosen for this paper
    include precipitation (pr), maximum temperature (tmmx), downgradient surface shortwave
    radiation (srad), and the Palmer drought index (Pdsi). 2.6. Data Preprocessing
    Based on the spatial resolution of winter wheat planting area in Hengshui City
    being 250 m, in order to maintain the consistent spatiotemporal resolution of
    all data, we resampled satellite vegetation index, GPP, and meteorological data
    to 250 m and one-month intervals. Satellite and meteorological data were masked
    using the distribution of winter wheat cultivation from 2005 to 2019, and all
    variables of the county-wide monthly average were summarized. All data are pre-processed
    on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, a free geoprocessing service launched
    by Google, which provides a large number of geoprocessing algorithms and massive
    image datasets based on the Google Cloud Platform, and the summary of data is
    performed on Python and Excel. 3. Methodology 3.1. Long Short-Term Memory The
    LSTM network was proposed by Hochreiter et al. [42] in 1997 based on an extension
    of RNN, which is mainly used to solve the problems that exist in traditional RNN,
    both gradient disappearance and explosion. The most fundamental difference between
    RNN and LSTM is that the hidden layer of the LSTM network is a gated unit, where
    information is added and removed through a ‘gate’ structure that learns which
    information to keep or forget during training. The LSTM has three types of gate
    structures: forgetting gates, input gates, and output gates (Figure 2a). Figure
    2. (a) The structure of the LSTM neural network; (b) Structure of the phenology-based
    LSTM model. The forgetting gate will decide which information should be forgotten
    from the neural network unit states, which is implemented by a sigmoid function.
    The gate is determined by the previous output, Ht−1, and the new input, Xt, to
    determine which information was removed from the previous cell state, Ct−1. The
    output is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means that the information is completely
    discarded, and 1 means that the information is completely retained, and is calculated
    as in Equation (1): 𝑓 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑓 .[ 𝑋 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡−1 ]+ 𝑏 𝑓 ) (1) where σ is the sigmoid
    function, ft is the forgetting gate, Ht−1 denotes the output of the previous node,
    Xt denotes the current input, Wf is the forgetting gate weight, and bf is the
    forgetting gate bias. The input gate determines which information should be stored
    from the neural network unit states. Implementing this requires two steps: first
    the sigmoid layer generates the activation value, it, for the input gate based
    on Ht−1 and Xt. The tanh function creates a candidate vector state, ct′, which
    is the alternative to be used for the update, calculated as in (2) and (3): 𝑖
    𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑖 .[ 𝑋 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡−1 ]+ 𝑏 𝑖 ) (2) 𝑐 ′ 𝑡 =𝑡𝑎𝑛ℎ( 𝑊 𝐶 .[ 𝑋 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡−1 ]+ 𝑏 𝑐 )  (3)
    where it denotes the input gate output, ct′ denotes the current candidate node
    state, Wi and Wc denote the weights of the input gate and the input candidate
    unit, respectively, and bi and bc denote the bias of the input gate and the input
    candidate unit, respectively. The old cell state, Ct−1, is updated to the new
    cell state, Ct, using the results obtained from the first two orders, calculated
    as in (4): 𝐶 𝑡 = 𝑓 𝑡 . 𝐶 𝑡−1 + 𝑖 𝑡 .  𝑐 ′ 𝑡 (4) Finally there is the output gate,
    which determines which information in the cell state will be taken as the output
    of the current state. The sigmoid layer is first run, which determines which cell
    states are output; then the tanh value of the cell state is multiplied by the
    output of the sigmoid (normalize the output value) threshold, which ultimately
    gives the output new cell state Ht, calculated as in (5) and (6). 𝑂 𝑡 =𝜎( 𝑊 𝑜
    .[ 𝑋 𝑡 , 𝐻 𝑡−1 ]+ 𝑏 𝑜 ) (5) 𝐻 𝑡 = 𝑂 𝑡 .tanh( 𝐶 𝑡 ) (6) where Ot denotes the output
    gate output, Ht−1 denotes the output of the previous node, Xt denotes the current
    input, Wo denotes the output gate weight, and bo denotes the output gate bias.
    In this study, the deep neural network model of LSTM winter wheat yield estimation
    based on the phenological stages is shown in Figure 2b. The input layers of this
    model are VIs, LAI, GPP, pr, tmmx, srad, and Pdsi for six growing stages of winter
    wheat. Two layers of LSTM layers are set, and other hyperparameters are set according
    to the results of Bayesian optimization algorithm in Section 3, with a total of
    six times steps. To prevent overfitting of the training data a dropout layer is
    added to the network architecture. All input data need to be normalized before
    being fed into the model and, finally, back-normalised for output. The ratio of
    training data to test data is set to 8:2, where 80% is training data and 20% is
    test data. 3.2. Bayesian Optimization of LSTM Hyperparameters The process of building
    LSTM network models involves the determination of many hyperparameters, such as
    network depth, learning rate, batch size, and so on. The most intuitive way is
    to find the optimal parameters by manual trial and error, but the manual trial
    and error method is too inefficient. It lacks a certain exploration process, and
    the parameters can only be adjusted manually repeatedly for different problems
    and data. It takes a lot of time, and the final combination of model hyperparameters
    may not be optimal, which will affect the prediction of the model, including the
    degree of network fit and the generalization ability to the test set [43,44].
    Bayesian optimization, as a very effective global optimization algorithm, requires
    only a small number of iterations to obtain a desired solution by designing a
    proper probabilistic agent model and a payoff function [43,44]. The main optimized
    hyperparameters and the range of values are shown in Table 1. Table 1. LSTM hyperparameter
    setting and range. The number of hidden units corresponds to the amount of information
    remembered between time steps (the hidden state). The hidden state can contain
    information from all previous time steps, regardless of the sequence length. If
    the number of hidden units is too large, then the layer might overfit to the training
    data. Epoch indicates the number of iterations of the data set during model training.
    If the number of iterations is set too large, the training time of the model is
    longer, resulting in overfitting of the model, over-reliance on training data,
    and poor prediction of unknown data, which makes the generalization ability of
    the model lower. If the number of iterations is set too small, it will make the
    model fit poorly and affect the prediction accuracy of the model. Size of the
    mini-batch to use for each training iteration is indicated, specified as the comma-separated
    pair consisting of ‘MiniBatchSize’ and a positive integer. A mini-batch is a subset
    of the training set that is used to evaluate the gradient of the loss function
    and update the weights. If the number of iterations is set too large, the training
    time of the model is long, causing the model to be overfitted and overly dependent
    on the training data. The prediction ability of the unknown data is poor, thus
    making the generalization ability of the model lower. If the number of iterations
    is set too small, it will make the model not fit well and affect the prediction
    accuracy of the model. The initial learning rate, α, is a relatively important
    hyperparameter in the LSTM model. When the learning rate is too large, it will
    cause the parameters to be optimized to fluctuate around the minimum value, thus
    skipping the optimal solution. When the learning rate is set too small, it will
    affect the convergence speed of the model, resulting in a slow convergence rate.
    In this paper, α is set to 0.01 based on the empirical value. Dropout means that,
    during the training process of the model, for the network units, they are temporarily
    dropped from the network according to a certain probability. This hyperparameter
    plays a crucial role in preventing model overfitting and improving the generalization
    ability of the model. The key hyperparameters searched in this paper are data
    batch size, number of iterations, discard factor, and number of nodes in the hidden
    layer. The remaining hyperparameters are based on experience, the optimizer is
    selected as “adam”, LearnRateSchedule is set to “piecewise”, and the root mean
    square error is selected as the target loss function. The optimization of the
    LSTM network model hyperparameters using the Bayesian method is a five-step process
    as follows (Figure 3, the implementation of the whole process is implemented in
    matlab R2021b): Step 1: All data of six winter wheat phenological periods are
    normalized to divide the training set and validation set for parameter learning
    and model result validation of the training network model. Step 2: The LSTM hyperparameters
    to be optimized and the range are set; a random set of initialized hyperparameters
    as the initial hyperparameters of the LSTM model are generated. The training set
    is input for the training of the LSTM neural network. The RMSE is used as the
    objective function for the hyperparameter optimization of the LSTM model. Step
    3: Gaussian process is used to find the posterior probability distribution of
    the objective function. The hyperparameter sample points are selected in the modified
    Gaussian model according to the acquisition function. The acquisition function
    chosen in this paper is ‘expected-improvement-plus’, which gives preference to
    the optimal hyperparameter to achieve the update of the hyperparameter. Step 4:
    The number of iterations (40) is completed and the minimum objective function
    and the corresponding trained LSTM model hyperparameters are returned. Step 5:
    The validation set is fed into the trained LSTM model to construct an LSTM winter
    wheat yield estimation model based on Bayesian optimization algorithm. The general
    framework of this study is shown in Figure 3a. Based on the indicators required
    for winter wheat phenology calculation, the influence of different input variables
    on winter wheat yield prediction was analysed on the BO-LSTM model. Then the performance
    of different prediction models for winter wheat yield estimation was compared;
    finally, the robustness of BO-LSTM was explored. All models used were run in matlab
    R2021b environment. Figure 3. (a) A research framework of BO-LSTM neural network
    model for county-level winter wheat yield estimation; (b) Bayesian optimization
    of LSTM hyperparameters process. 3.3. Model Performance Evaluation In this study,
    coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) were used as indicators to assess the model performance
    [45]. The equations are written as follows: 𝑅 2 = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ∑( 𝑜 𝑖 − 𝑜 ̲ )( 𝑦
    𝑖− 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ ( 𝑜 𝑖 − 𝑜 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖− 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ ⎤ ⎦
    ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 2 (7) 𝑅𝑀𝑆𝐸= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝑜 𝑖− 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (8)
    𝑀𝐴𝑃𝐸= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑜 𝑖 𝑦 𝑖 | (9) where n is the number of samples, and
    yi and oi are the measured and predicted values of winter wheat yield, respectively.
    R2 is a measure of the strength of the linear relationship between the predicted
    and measured values of the model, with larger R2 indicating that the measured
    and predicted values have similar trends. RMSE is used to assess the deviation
    between measured and predicted values. The smaller the value, the smaller the
    deviation is between the measured and predicted values of the model; the higher
    R2, the smaller RMSE is and the better the model. For the MAPE range [0, +∞),
    the smaller the MAPE, the better the model simulation results are. Compared to
    RMSE, MAPE is equivalent to normalizing the error at each point, reducing the
    effect of absolute error from individual outliers. 4. Results and Analysis 4.1.
    Performance of LSTM Hyperparameter Combination Output Based on Bayesian Optimization
    This study aims to optimise the hyperparameters of the LSTM neural network model
    based on a Bayesian optimisation algorithm, evaluating both the time efficiency,
    “time”, and the accuracy, RMSE, of the model after tuning the parameters. The
    first three optimal parameter combinations were selected, along with the corresponding
    accuracy and time consumption (Table 2). The results demonstrate that the minimum
    RMSE of the Bayesian optimised LSTM model on the training set is 149.51 kg/ha,
    and the time efficiency of finding the optimal hyperparameter combination is 14
    min. The Bayesian optimisation algorithm makes full use of historical information
    when selecting the optimal hyperparameter combination, allowing the optimal hyperparameter
    combination to be found within a short time and number of iterations. Table 2.
    Output results of Bayesian optimized LSTM hyperparameters on the training set.
    4.2. Yield Estimation Performance for Different Combinations of Inputs To evaluate
    the performance of yield estimation from different data sources, we put different
    combinations of input variables in a BO-LSTM model for analysis. Figure 4 shows
    the yield estimation performance of BO-LSTM for winter wheat with five different
    input variables. We found that yield estimates using GPP (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 186.13
    kg/ha) alone were more accurate than those using LAI (R2 = 0.67, RMSE = 221.32
    kg/ha) alone. When combined with meteorological data, the accuracy of GPP combined
    with meteorological data was higher (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 180.66 kg/ha) compared
    to the remotely sensed vegetation index (R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 190.96 kg/ha), because
    GPP more directly reflects the process of organic matter accumulation by vegetation
    photosynthesis. The yield estimation accuracy of winter wheat gradually increased
    as the input data increased, indicating that the estimation accuracy of fusing
    multiple sources of data was better than the input from a single data source.
    The highest estimation accuracy was achieved by integrating all data together
    (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 177.84 kg/ha). The addition of the data improved the model’s
    ability to capture spatial heterogeneity in yield, capturing more features associated
    with winter wheat yield. In particular, the yield estimation accuracy of the LSTM
    model improved significantly when combined with meteorological data, suggesting
    that meteorological data provide unique and irreplaceable information. Figure
    4. Winter wheat yield estimation using BO-LSTM for different combinations of data
    source inputs. 4.3. Comparison with Other Methods The analysis in the previous
    section led us to conclude that the highest accuracy in winter wheat yield estimation
    can be achieved by integrating all data, so we used data with “GPP + Climate +
    LAI + VIs” as the final input data for the BO-LSTM. To further evaluate the yield
    estimation performance of the BO-LSTM, we used a machine learning SVM and a linear
    regression Lasso to estimate the yield of winter wheat. Figure 5 presents a scatter
    plot of our yield estimates and statistical annals for all county test data for
    Hengshui city using the three prediction models. Based on the R2 and RMSE values,
    it can be intuitively seen that the SVM (RMSE = 185.7 kg/ha, R2 = 0.80) and BO-LSTM
    (RMSE = 177.8 4 kg/ha, R2 = 0.82) model methods perform significantly better than
    Lasso (RMSE = 214.5 kg/ha, R2 = 0.76). The potential reason could be that SVM
    and BO-LSTM methods capture the complex and nonlinear relationships between input
    variables and winter wheat yield better than linear regression models. Further,
    it is found that the BO-LSTM model slightly outperformed the SVM method in estimating
    winter wheat yield in Hengshui City. This is largely attributed to the fact that
    machine learning non-temporal models focus on information extraction for unordered
    data and do not optimize the structure for temporal data. The LSTM is a recurrent
    neural network structure that transmits cumulative effective information during
    different growth stages. It is similar to the growth process characteristics of
    crops: crop growth and progressive developmental changes and biomass accumulation.
    The effects of environmental factors on winter wheat yield are complex and non-linear.
    The LSTM inputs the observations into the model network structure in a temporal
    order, and the gate mechanism is set internally. The weights of input gates, forgetting
    gates, and input gates are trained to achieve automatic screening and fusion of
    timing features. Figure 5. Performance of the 2005–2019 test set for winter wheat
    yield estimation in different forecasting models. Immediately afterwards, we used
    the BO-LSTM with better estimation accuracy and SVM to estimate winter wheat yield
    for all counties in Hengshui (Figure 6). In general, there was some spatial variation
    in the estimation advantage of different regions. The estimation performance of
    BO-LSTM was still slightly higher than that of SVM, regardless of the county region.
    Using the BO-LSTM model with better yield estimation accuracy, we can see that
    the RMSE is more than 300 kg/ha in RaoYang County, Jizhou City, Taocheng District,
    Anping County, and Fucheng County. The highest is in Rao Yang County with an RMSE
    of 444. 77 kg/ha and a MAPE of 6.18. The areas with RMSE between 200–300 kg/ha
    are Shecheng County, Jing County, Shenzhou City, and Zaojiang County. Areas with
    RMSE less than 200 kg/ha include Wuyi County and Wuqiang County, with the smallest
    being located in Wuyi County (RMSE = 117.30 kg/ha, MAPE = 1.64). Figure 6. BO-LSTM
    performance of yield estimation for all counties in Hengshui city: (a) RMSE; (b)
    MAPE. 5. Discussion In this study we highlight the advantages of BO-LSTM fusing
    multi-source data for winter wheat yield estimation. The results show that the
    deep learning model fusing multi-source data provides reliable winter wheat yield
    estimation at the regional scale. In general, GPP, LAI, and VIs are suitable for
    large-scale crop yield estimation. The estimation accuracy can be improved by
    combining meteorological data. The highest estimation accuracy is achieved when
    all predictors are combined and entered into the estimation model, which is very
    similar to previous studies [25,46,47]. Since this paper uses SVM, LSTM, and LASSO
    as the yield estimation models, which are regularized, we do not need to consider
    the problem of multicollinearity. The Bayesian optimizer can determine an acceptable
    value very quickly, which is especially advantageous when the time complexity
    of finding the value of any function of the black box function is high, and the
    Bayesian optimizer does not have a limit on the search fineness. The disadvantage
    is that the returned result is not necessarily the true minimum objective function
    value (grid search may not find it either), and the result of each optimization
    will vary. Therefore, several optimizations are needed when optimizing the LSTM
    hyperparameters with Bayesian, and the best optimization result is finally selected.
    For the problem of different estimation accuracies in different regions (Figure
    6), we analysed the distribution of winter wheat cultivation over 15 years and
    found that we only listed four of them (Figure 7), and the distribution of wheat
    cultivation in Taocheng, Jizhou, Anping, and Rao Yang regions was more scattered
    with less cultivated area. Among them, Taocheng District and Jizhou District are
    the city centre of Hengshui City. The marginal effects of various factors in cities
    within a certain region affect climate factors, and local climate is difficult
    to obtain accurately compared to other regions, resulting in differences between
    the meteorological data we obtained and the actual meteorological data [48]. This
    explains the large discrepancy between estimated yields and official yield records
    in these areas. Our method is therefore more suitable for areas where the distribution
    of cultivation is concentrated, far from urban building sites, and with relatively
    little human interference. Figure 7. Spatial distribution of winter wheat in Hengshui
    City, 2016–2019. In the process of analysis, we found that there are still some
    limitations. The first is that we focus on estimating county-level crop yields,
    which leads to smaller training samples due to the difficulty of obtaining data.
    The problem of data scarcity makes the learning information aspect of the LSTM
    neural network model insufficient in the training process. Second, the essence
    of deep learning is feature extraction from data to data, and neural network modelling
    converts the original input variables into high-level representations through
    nonlinear activation and squeeze functions. The description and mechanistic expression
    of the crop growth process cannot be learned, which weakens the traceability and
    interpretability of the LSTM model. The data-driven crop growth model has great
    potential. The crop growth model can take the crop, environment, and cultivation
    technology as a whole. The principles and methods of systems analysis can be applied
    to provide theoretical generalizations and quantitative analyses of the physiological
    processes of crop growth and development, photosynthetic production, organogenesis,
    and yield formation and their feedback relationships to environment and technology.
    Following that, the corresponding mathematical models are developed to carry out
    the dynamic quantitative simulation of the crop growth process. Therefore, fusing
    deep learning with crop mechanism models can improve the interpretability of deep
    learning models. To address the problems, our future work focuses on expanding
    the study area to integrate process-based models and deep learning techniques
    to develop hybrid models. The BO-LSTM model provides a data-driven approach to
    crop growth time series feature extraction by combining the crop weathering characteristics.
    The spatiotemporal scalability of the BO-LSTM model is worth exploring in future
    research. The spatial transfer learning capability of the BO-LSTM can be evaluated
    to quantify the model’s ability to estimate crop yields in areas without many
    historical yield records. A deep learning approach based on BO-LSTM to learn the
    spatiotemporal heterogeneity of crop growth can help to better understand the
    impact of global climate change on agricultural production. 6. Conclusions In
    this research, we proposed a BO-LSTM model that integrates crop phenology and
    meteorological and remote sensing data to predict county-level winter wheat yields.
    Yield estimation performance was then compared using three predictive models,
    including linear regression, machine learning, and deep learning. The conclusions
    are as follows: (1) Using Bayesian optimization of LSTM neural network model hyperparameters
    can achieve identification of the optimal combination of hyperparameters in a
    shorter period of time. (2) Multi-temporal remote sensing data based on BO-LSTM
    model combined with meteorological data can provide effective information to obtain
    more accurate yield prediction models to estimate regional scale winter wheat
    yield. (3) Among the three prediction models, BO-LSTM achieves higher yield estimation
    accuracy relative to Lasso and SVM. (4) There is some spatial variation in the
    estimated yield advantage in different areas, and our method is more suitable
    for places where crop cultivation is concentrated, far from urban building sites
    and with less residential land. Author Contributions Y.D. and M.G. designed the

    Article 10 January 2022 1 Introduction Accurate information about crop types and
    the area they occupy is essential for yield estimates [39]. It is also important
    for collecting crop production statistics [20], calculating water use or irrigation
    need [37], and mapping and forecasting stress factors that affect growth and yield
    [15], including plant diseases and pests [46]. Currently, agricultural land use
    information is updated by contacting farmers or by land surveys to identify crop
    types. However, these procedures provide accurate information but are time and
    labor-intensive. Remote sensing offers an efficient and reliable means to classify
    crop types [4] and to gather information about their properties [21]. Various
    types of remotely sensed data (e.g., optical and radar data) can be used to classify
    different crop types [21]. Each crop type has unique characteristics related to
    spatial, spectral, temporal, radiometric resolution, ground resolution, and polarization
    [45]. Remote sensing is useful in monitoring and mapping crops because of its
    ability to cover vast areas and provide repetitive coverage at various spatial
    and spectral resolutions. Their disadvantage lies in the need for large storage
    and processing time [18]. Remotely sensed images are required to be rendered interpretable
    and the information contained quantifiable. Currently, there are several parametric
    or nonparametric classification methods. A classification model that encapsulates
    data with a set of parameters of fixed size independent of the number of training
    samples is called a parametric model. Algorithms that do not make assumptions
    about the form of the mapping function are called nonparametric classification
    algorithms [2]. By not making assumptions, they are free to learn any functional
    form from the training data. Many nonparametric supervised classification methods
    have been applied in crop classification using machine-learning methods, including
    the support vector machine (SVM) [32, 43], classification regression tree (CART)
    [24], backpropagation networks (BPN) [17], and random forest (RF) [7]. However,
    their mapping accuracy will depend on the type of input and training data. Many
    research works used those machine-learning algorithms to classify specific crops
    using one source of remote sensing data. Laban et al. [26] compared different
    machine-learning algorithms to classify specific crop types using Sentinel-2 images.
    Their results estimated an overall accuracy of 94% to map different crops and
    land covers using the SVM method. The low number of crops and the large homogenous
    crop fields played an important role in the success of using the SVM method. Kumar
    et al. [25] compared SVM and spectral angle mapper (SAM) [3] for crop mapping
    using LISS IV remote sensing data [34]. Their results showed that SVM outperforms
    SAM with accuracy equal to 93.5%. Ray and Ray [33] classified farmland’s crops
    for a specific date using the Sentinel-2 data. The authors compared three classification
    algorithms (SVM, RF, and classification regression tree (CART)). Their results
    proved that RF outperformed CART and SVM with an accuracy of 93.3%. We combined
    different remote sensing techniques. Time series optical and radar images allow
    reducing temporal gaps (mostly because of clouds) and mapping crops (McNairn,
    2002). Inglada et al. [19] examined the impact of combining the time series of
    eleven Landsat scenes with nine Sentinel-1 images. They reported significant accuracy
    improvements of about 80% compared to less than 70% when using a separate series
    of either type of image. These authors used one nonparametric classification algorithm
    and they did not test Sentinel-2 images. Van Tricht (2018) combined Sentinel-2
    and Sentinel-1 to map eight crop types in Belgium using the random forest (RF)
    algorithm. The authors concluded that it increased accuracy compared to the unique
    remote sensing type. They calculated the NDVI from Sentinel-2 and then combined
    them with Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide Swath (IW) VH and VV bands to get an
    accuracy of 82% compared to 78% for optical and 76% for radar. The authors used
    NDVI instead of the real Sentinel-2 images and tested one nonparametric classification
    algorithm. Another research study combined the radar image of GF-3 PolSAR with
    Sentinel-2 optical satellite to create crop maps using SVM [16]. The accuracy
    of the created crop map was about 85%. Here again, the authors did not use Sentinel-1,
    and they tested one nonparametric classification algorithm. After reviewing the
    literature, we’ve defined the following research questions: Why there is no comparison
    of multiple nonparametric classification algorithms? Were there reasons that prevented
    the authors from using the combination of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series
    images? Was there any constraint for classifying many crop types? We assume that
    there was lacking a methodological approach to reduce the large volume of time-series
    data from multiple remote sensing sources. A specific classification algorithm
    may work for one type of data but may not work for a combination of multiple sources
    of data. Comparing different nonparametric algorithms may help in finding the
    best one for classifying several crop types. The study aimed to test and select
    reliable and efficient nonparametric crop classification algorithms (many crops)
    by comparing four known ones (SVM, RF, CART, and BPN). In addition, we aimed to
    develop and implement a methodological approach to handle the big data problem
    rising from time-series data of multiple sources. Finally, we assessed the potentialities
    of Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) satellite images in providing high spatial
    and temporal data to improve crop classification in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon.
    2 Nonparametric Classification Methods SVM, RF, BPN, and CART are nonparametric
    classification algorithms that are more robust to most of the known problems inherited
    in remote sensing images, such as noise [2]. The following subsections introduce
    these algorithms briefly. One can refer to Appendix A for more details. 2.1 Support
    Vector Machine (SVM) SVM is based on statistical learning theory [32, 43]. In
    a simple form of SVM, there is a set of (input, target) training pair samples.
    The input sample features are x1, x2…xn, and the output result is y. The output
    is a set of weights w (or wi), one for each feature, whose linear combination
    predicts the value of y. SVM uses optimization techniques to maximize the margins
    and to reduce the number of nonzero weights (support vectors) that correspond
    to the important features in deciding the separating line (hyperplane). 2.2 Backpropagation
    Artificial Neural Network In general, an artificial neural network (ANN) is a
    set of connected input/output units in which each connection has a weight associated
    with it. The weights are adjusted during the learning phase. Backpropagation network
    (BPN) [17] is a neural network algorithm for supervised classification and retrieval
    tasks that employ a method of gradient descent for adjusting the algorithmic parameters
    through a backward pass. It searches for a set of weights and biases that can
    model the data to minimize the mean-squared distance between the network’s class
    prediction and the actual class label of data tuples. 2.3 Classification and Regression
    Trees (CART) In the classification and regression tree algorithm [24], data are
    partitioned into subsets with identical values—a process represented by a decision
    tree that can make predictions from new observations. A decision tree is a hierarchically
    organized structure, with each node splitting the data space into pieces based
    on the value of a feature such that: A. Equivalent to a partition of Rd into K
    disjoint feature subspaces {R1,…, RK}, where each \\({R}_{j}\\subset {R}^{d}.\\)
    B. On each feature subspace Rj, the same decision/prediction is made for all x
    \\(\\in\\) Rj. 2.4 Random Forest Random forest (RF) is a classification and regression
    algorithm [7]. RF algorithm uses decision trees to predict solutions, and the
    best one is selected by voting. Random forest algorithm uses bootstrap aggregating
    or bagging [6]. 3 Materials and Methods 3.1 Study Area An agriculture area with
    complex terrain that encompasses richness in crops, variability in climatic conditions
    is selected to represent large similar global agricultural areas (Mediterranean
    basin, some areas in the north and south Americas, etc.). It represents an area
    in Lebanon, specifically Bekaa valley (Fig. 1a and 1b). The area is part of the
    Litani river catchment where mountain snow is a major source of its water largely
    consumed to support the irrigation of the agricultural area in the Bekaa plain.
    Normally, wheat, potatoes, alfalfa, fruit trees, and vineyards are the major crops
    that dominate the study area. Crops are irrigated using sprinkler techniques,
    and underground water is the principal source of irrigation. Fig. 1 Study area
    (a) location in Lebanon (b) large scale with details Full size image 3.2 Field
    Sample Collection The accuracy assessment is intended to estimate the accuracy
    of an image classification with field-collected samples [11]. A thematic accuracy
    considers many factors to collect samples properly: A. Accessibility to fields
    B. Climate conditions for remote sensing data C. Crop conditions It also recommends
    designing a method for sample collection based on the above-listed factors. In
    this study, sample collection took place during the development stages of the
    crops in the spring of 2018 and 2019. The surveys covered the major and minor
    crops, including wheat, potato, and vineyards (grapes) that are the most represented
    crops in the study area, with over 44% of the total samples for 2018 and over
    40% for 2019 (Tables 1 and 2). Both years included the same major crop types.
    However, year 2019 included more minor crop types than year 2018. The method of
    sample collection was random one. In some samples, chlorophyll content was collected
    using a chlorophyll meter. Table 1 The number of samples/crop 2018 Full size table
    Table 2 The number of samples/crop 2019 Full size table 3.3 Sentinel Data Sentinel-2A
    and Sentinel-2B [5, 13, 27, 30] were launched in June 2015 and March 2017, respectively.
    Sentinel-2A is an optical remote sensing satellite. It has a spatial resolution
    that varies between 10 and 60 m depending on the wavelength. Sentinel-2A has a
    temporal resolution of 10 days that can become 5 days with the combination of
    Sentinel-2B another optical satellite with the same specifications as Sentinel-2A.
    Bands 3, 4, and 8 which correspond to green, red, and near-infrared are selected
    for two reasons: A. Being the highest in spatial resolution. B. They represent
    the crop photosynthesis process. Sentinel-1 A and B satellites, launched in April
    2014 and 2016, respectively, are equipped with a synthetic aperture radar operating
    at C-band [40]. The interferometric wide swath (IW) acquisition mode is used in
    this study with an azimuth resolution of 20 m and a ground range resolution of
    5 m. The GRDH (ground range high resolution) products were provided by the Sentinel-1
    Data Hub website (https://scihub.copernicus.eu/) and processed using Sentinel
    Application Platform (SNAP) version 6 [8]. The process included three steps: (1)
    thermal noise removal; (2) calibration; and (3) terrain correction using the DEM
    SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) at 30-m resolution. Images of backscattering
    coefficients \\({{\\varvec{V}}{\\varvec{H}}}_{{{\\varvec{\\sigma}}}^{0}}\\) and
    \\({{\\varvec{V}}{\\varvec{V}}}_{{{\\varvec{\\sigma}}}^{0}}\\) are resampled at
    10-m resolution. During May, most winter crops are already developed, and the
    summer crops are just at the beginning of their cultural cycle. The main strategic
    crop management is taken at this period. Sentinel-2 satellite images are collected
    for the period that covers a complete crop season in 2018 and 2019. Sentinel-2
    can provide about 4 to 6 images per month. Many images were covered with clouds
    completely or partially. To manage this problem, images having cloud cover less
    than 10% of the total image area are selected. The images were clipped to a common
    frame of size 2407 × 1864 pixels (study area) and are corrected atmospherically
    using Sen2Cor [29] processor. Sentinel-1A and 1B images are selected for the same
    years, which correspond to Sentinel-2 images (Table 3). Table 3 Selected satellite
    images for different dates Full size table Normally, cross-polarization (VH) backscattering
    is lower in value than co-polarization (VV) over flat surfaces. VH is less sensitive
    than VV, and it is often more suitable to describe variations in volume scattering
    (from vegetation or snow) (Koppel, 2017). Another research study [36] proved that
    using VH/VV ratio could improve crop mapping and suppress noises. Based on these
    facts, cross-polarization is divided by co-polarization to create a new band in
    Sentinel-1. The Sentinel-1 cross-polarization and co-polarization ratio are combined
    with Sentinel-2 bands green, red, and NIR (same spatial resolution). 3.4 Big Data
    Reduction Strategy Dealing with numerous images for both S1 and S2 is labor-intensive
    and money- and time-consuming. To handle the big data problems, the normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) was applied to select the best image from a
    group of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images. NDVI was introduced by Tucker [41],
    and it varies between − 1 and + 1, where positive values indicate different vegetation
    densities. To calculate the NDVI, the following equation is used: $$NDVI= \\frac{(\\uprho
    NIR-\\uprho Red)}{(\\uprho NIR+\\uprho Red)}$$ (1) where \\(\\rho\\) Red = reflectance
    at red band and \\(\\rho\\) NIR = reflectance at near-infrared band. The NDVI
    for each year were estimated and layer stacked to create graphs showing the crop
    date of plantation, growth period, and finally harvesting date. These graphs can
    help in searching for crop peak values. Then the period where most peaks coincide
    was selected as the best representative period for crop classification. Equation
    2 describes this classification approach. $${Do}_{i}=Max\\left({ST}_{iN}\\right)\\mathrm{
    Where\\;i}= 1...\\mathrm{M}$$ (2) where STij = the NDVI stacked for specific crop
    i, M = the number of crop classes, Doi = the date where a specific crop i has
    the maximum NDVI value, and N = the number of images or NDVI layers. The maximum
    NDVI indicates that the crop’s biomass is large enough to cover the soil and can
    be used to distinguish vegetation from other types of land cover. The process
    in Eq. 2 is repeated to find the next maximum NDVI until the result coincides
    with the Sentinel-1 images. 3.5 A Comparison Between the Classification Algorithms
    The selection of RF, SVM, BPN, and CART algorithms was based on several criteria
    [12, 14]: A. Popularity because of the success of these algorithms in solving
    many complex problems B. Availability in every software and platform (MATLAB and
    Google Earth Engine) C. Simplicity that means no complex requirements to run these
    algorithms D. Similarity in many characteristics such as being nonparametric and
    supervised classification algorithms E. Diversity in performance such as speed
    Finally, there was no evidence in the literature that BPN had been used before
    to classify crops from remotely sensed data [28]. We use QGIS and MATLAB software
    to implement the support vector machine, the backpropagation artificial neural
    network, the classification, and regression trees, the random forest, the OA,
    and the kappa index. Before comparing the efficiency of the four classification
    algorithms (RF, SVM, BPN, and CART) to distinguish different types of crops, it
    is important to understand the differences among the technical properties of the
    four algorithms. We analyzed the classification algorithms to assess its pros
    and cons related their individual properties. We focused our analysis on classification
    properties of each algorithm, which included the number and type of required parameters,
    the complexity of the algorithm, and training requirements (Table 4). The first
    parameter helped to understand how fast or slow each algorithm was; the second
    one helped to understand their flexibility (high to low, according to the number
    of parameters) and the size of the training samples. Table 4 Assessment of the
    classification algorithms for crop mapping in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon Full size
    table By applying the RF, the complexity included the influencing factors (V)
    and the size of the samples (S). The RF required turning off two parameters (the
    number of trees and V). The SVM was slower because it is more complex and requires
    turning off many parameters such as kernel type, degree, cost, and gamma. It required
    a large training dataset to work efficiently. The CART computation complexity
    was low, similar to the RF algorithm, because it required a large training dataset
    to provide high accuracy. The CART algorithm also required setting up a maximum
    number of leaf nodes in each tree. All algorithms work by an initial random selection
    of pixel values acquired from the images. However, both SVM and CART algorithms
    work by minimizing the distances among the target classes and the training pixels.
    Both RF and BPN work by retraining the model. The RF algorithm counts on the voting
    process, and BPN works by updating weights between neurons. The previously discussed
    RF and BPN properties indicate that increasing sample size will increase the algorithm
    performances. However, it does not work for SVM and CART, which were trapped in
    the local minima by increasing sample size. Based on it, to improve the SVM and
    CART performances would require (a) increasing number of field-collected samples,
    (b) turning on the depth of the CART tree, and (c) increasing or decreasing error
    thresholds for both SVM and CART algorithms. Consequently, those algorithms showed
    to be more interpreter dependent than the RF and BNP algorithms. 3.6 Accuracy
    of the Results The accuracy of the results is computed based on the confusion
    matrix (CM) method [10]. The matrix is of size m × m associated with a classifier
    that shows the predicted and observed classification (Table 5). From this table,
    the overall accuracy (OA) for each experiment is computed based on Eq. 3. Table
    5 Confusion matrix format Full size table $$OA=\\frac{{T1}_{True}+ {T2}_{True}}{{T1}_{True}+
    {T2}_{True}+{T1}_{False}+ {T2}_{False}}$$ (3) T1 and T2 can be actual or predicted
    samples, and these samples are positive when the actual sample matches the predicted
    or negative otherwise. Kappa coefficient κ [9] is another metric method for accuracy
    assessment. The kappa coefficient is frequently used to test interrater agreement
    (Eq. 4). The coefficient value ranges from the worst agreement for value − 1 to
    the perfect one for value + 1. $${\\varvec{\\kappa}}=\\frac{{{\\varvec{p}}{\\varvec{r}}}_{0}-{{\\varvec{p}}{\\varvec{r}}}_{{\\varvec{e}}}}{1-{{\\varvec{p}}{\\varvec{r}}}_{{\\varvec{e}}}}$$
    (4) where \\({{\\varvec{p}}{\\varvec{r}}}_{0}\\) is the observed proportionate
    agreement (overall accuracy) and \\({{\\varvec{p}}{\\varvec{r}}}_{{\\varvec{e}}}\\)
    is the overall random agreement probability (Eq. 5). According to [22] Kappa values = 0
    indicates no agreement and > 0 to 0.20 as slight, 0.20–0.40 as fair, 0.40–0.60
    as moderate, 0.60–0.80 as substantial, and 0.80–1 as almost perfect agreement.

    (5) 3.7 Crop Classification Process Flow After introducing the nonparametric supervised
    classification algorithms, the different datasets, the big-data reduction process,
    and the validation method, it is important to summarize the research method steps.
    At first, specific bands are selected from the optical images taking into consideration
    the sensitivity of crops to different wavelengths. Training the classification
    algorithms to rely on selected pixel values and their corresponding field samples
    (crop labels). The above work can be summarized as follow: A. Create training
    and testing data (85% and 15%). B. Run the classification algorithms. C. Classify
    the image. D. Verify the result. The same processes explained above are used with
    the combination of the selected optical bands and the ratio of the radar polarization
    images. Further details related to the classification process and other processing
    tasks are shown in Figure 2. Fig. 2 Methodological approach for classifying different
    crop types in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon Full size image 4 Results In this section,
    we assessed accuracies and performances the random forest, support vector machine,
    backpropagation networks, and classification and regression tree algorithms to
    classify different crop types in the Bekaa valley, Lebanon. 4.1 Application of
    Big Data Reduction Process Annual NDVI images were retrieved from all Sentinel-2
    imagery, and they were layer stacked in one image. The layer-stacked image was
    used to create the graphs (Fig. 3a and 3b) to represent phenology of the major
    crops in 2018 and 2019. Based on it, we observed that all crops showed maximum
    peaks in May for both years. However, based on Eq. 2 and the date coincidence
    of Sentinel-2 with Sentinel-1, the second maximum peak was selected that is May
    11, 2018. The correspondence of the acquisition date for Sentinel-1 with that
    of Sentinel-2 is another criterion considered to select an image on a specific
    date. The final selected images from both S1 and S2 are shown in Table 6. Fig.

    using the BPN algorithm Full size image Based on the classification results, we
    observed that the RF was the only algorithm that provided complete results, followed
    by BPN with eleven land use classes, and SVM with nine land use classes. Only
    the CART classification algorithm provided five land use classes out of thirteen
    classes. The confusion matrices estimated for the classification using images
    acquired in 2018 illustrate the accuracy differences and show the missing land
    use classes (Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10), where 1 to 13 represents the following crop
    types (I, fava beans; II, grapes; III, olives; IV, onion; V, peach; VI, peas;
    VII, potato;VIII, quince; IX, wheat; X, fallow land; XI, cherry; XII, urban; and
    XIII, forests). Each classified crop by the RF algorithm has shown high accuracy.
    By investigating the results we found that four major crops (II, V, VII, and IX)
    were classified successfully by the algorithms with different accuracies as shown
    in Table 11. The highest in accuracy (average) was observed to the CART algorithm,
    followed by RF, SVM, and BPN. However, the CART algorithm reclassified all pixels
    into five classes only, which eliminated those crop types classified based on
    small sample sizes. Table 7 CM of RF classification Full size table Table 8 CM

    analysis, three optical bands (green, red, and NIR) were combined with Sentinel-1
    ratio \\(\\frac{VH}{VV}\\) bands to create a new image with four bands. The classification
    results for 2018 and 2019 are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. Fig. 7 a Optical-radar combination

    Figure 9 shows that the combination of Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 images has improved
    slightly the classification results OA of the RF algorithm and significantly of
    BPN. However, the OA of SVM and CART increased slightly, but remains below the
    expected result. The problem gets more complex (increasing number of crop type),
    leading SVM and CART to be trapped in the local minima. We also observed that
    while the RF, SVM, and BPN algorithms achieved a complete set of 13 classified
    crops (13 classes); the CART algorithm achieved a set of 5 classified crops only.
    Fig. 9 Evaluation of the classification algorithms Full size image 5 Discussion
    In this analysis, we aimed to find a reliable and efficient non-parametric crop
    classification algorithm by comparing four the SVM, RF, CART, and BPN algorithms.
    Based on our results, the RF algorithm showed the highest overall accuracy compared
    to the SVM, BPN, and CART algorithms. However, we observed that the CART and SVM
    algorithms could better classify some major crops in the study area than the RF
    algorithm. We concluded that selecting the sample sizes will affect the performance
    of the classification algorithms. However, determining the sample size is considered
    a difficult task in any research work because: A. Complexity of the classification
    algorithm that may require turning off many parameters, such as neural network
    size, tree size, kernel parameters, and number of iterations B. Complexity of
    the problem that includes the number of classes C. The size of the study area
    It was assumed that the big data problematic issue in crop classification cannot
    be solved. Yet, a method that reduces the large datasets of remote sensing images
    was implemented as our second aim. The method reduced the number of Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 images from twenty-six to four images only and proved the incorrectness
    of the assumption. Another assumption stated that no improvement was expected
    from combining both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2. However, the combination of Sentinel-1
    and Sentinel-2 images increased the OA and improved SVM and BPN performance compared
    to using Sentinel-2 only. This proved the incorrectness of the assumption and
    this completed our third objective. Different from our results, Laban et al. [26]
    observed that the SVM algorithm showed higher overall accuracy than the RF algorithm
    using Sentinel-2 imagery only. Ray and Ray [33] applied machine learning to a
    study site in a small farmland and concluded that the classification methods (RF
    and SVM) achieved similar accuracies. The authors did not compare the performance
    of ANN algorithms and they used Sentinel-2 imagery only. We have achieved better
    classification results than Van Tricht et al. [42] by combining Sentinel-1 and
    Sentinel-2. These authors created a stack of NDVI layers retrieved from Sentinel-2
    images and combined with Sentinel-1 VH image acquired in different dates in 2017.
    According to Van Tricht et al. [42], the RF classification accuracies showed a
    kappa index of 0.8, while our classification showed a kappa index of 0.94. This
    research results are promising, but there are some issues to be improved: (a)
    Field surveys can be further improved by collecting repeatedly samples based on
    specific plot sizes. (b) More wavelengths can be tested in the classification
    process. It will require larger budget, equipment, and qualified personnel. By
    enhancing, the computer processing power can help in expanding the use of all
    available remote sensing bands. 6 Conclusions Crop mapping is the most complex
    and difficult task for many experts and decision-makers. In this research, we
    used four different image classification algorithms and two different remote sensing
    image acquisition technologies to create different crop classification experiments.
    The results showed that although RF is the best classification algorithm for creating
    multi-crops map for Bekaa plane in Lebanon. RF classified successfully many major
    and minor crops with highest OA such as wheat, potato, grape, olive, lettuce,
    cherry, peas, onion. CART could be better for specific major crop classification
    such as wheat. The problematic of big data requirements to classify crops was
    solved using an innovative technique. In addition, the experiments revealed that
    combining optical and radar images improved all classification algorithms’ performance,
    compared to using optical remote sensing data only. In the future, more experiments
    will be conducted using algorithms that are more complex and advanced. Data Availability

  description: Healthy soil is the key to healthy food production and maintenance
    of the multifunctionality of the soil ecosystem. It is also the cornerstone of
    agriculture green development. Identifying the status of soil health and systematically
    carrying out soil health diagnosis are the basis of cultivating healthy soil and
    improving soil productivity. However, in the past, a large number of indicators
    and evaluations have been developed based on an individual soil function (e.g.
    soil productivity), while other soil functions were largely ignored. Soil biological
    indicators are still underrepresented in soil health assessment, and the dynamic
    monitoring of soil processes is not sufficiently conducted. In pursuit of sustainable
    development goals and with the requirement of agriculture green development, the
    indicator system and evaluation approaches of soil health have been greatly improved.
    Thus, the establishment of multi-objective coordinated soil health assessment
    has become the hotspot and the frontier. This paper summarizes the selection principle
    in the indicator system of soil health. The importance of soil biological indicators
    in soil health evaluation is analyzed. The advances, advantages, disadvantages
    and application areas of the Chinese soil health assessment method, Cornell Comprehensive
    Assessment of Soil Health, New Zealand SINDI, the framework of Soil Navigator,
    Soil Management Assessment Framework are expounded. Finally, the pathways to improve
    the soil health evaluation system are put forward. It is necessary to build a
    big data platform for integrated soil-crop management based on the regional ecological
    conditions. A multi-objective coordinated soil health assessment for different
    regions and crop systems should be established through the participation of multi-actors
    with the development of soil biological indicators. A long-term and whole-process
    dynamic monitoring system should be established in combination with rapid testing
    and intelligent information technologies. This will provide important support
    for agriculture green development.

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Colombo, Sri Lanka SECTION I. Introduction
    Sri Lanka is an agrarian society-based country. From ancient times the people
    of Sri Lanka have been closely associated with agriculture. Currently, in Sri
    Lanka, the agriculture sector contributes about 6.0 percent to the national GDP.
    However, the COVID pandemic and economic crisis that happened in 2022 affected
    the agricultural sector of Sri Lanka very negatively, diminishing the contribution
    to the national GDP considerably. Fall back in the agricultural sector in Sri
    Lanka was mainly due to decisions such as banning chemical fertilizers and the
    usage of traditional non-innovative agricultural methods by farmers. The main
    goal of any agrarian-based country is to achieve a high yield from national cultivation
    and contribute to the national GDP with a high percentage. Currently, in 2022
    Sri Lanka is facing an economic crisis and many economical experts think the best
    option to escape from this economic crisis is agriculture. But currently, the
    existing normal traditional agricultural system is not going to be a solution
    to the crisis. Because farmers used their traditional methodologies for essential
    processes such as crop selection, fertilizers selection, and fertilizer usage
    which are obsolete today. Today’s rainfall patterns and weather conditions and
    soil conditions have changed drastically than before. Hence belief in traditional
    methods is not appropriate for today and this caused huge cultivation and economic
    losses for many farmers. Inefficient import and distribution of chemical fertilizers,
    corruption, and over usage of chemical fertilizers by farmers, these reasons caused
    to impose of the ban on chemical fertilizers in Sri Lanka. The main goal government
    expect through this ban was to reduce health issues such as kidney failures and
    misuse of foreign exchange. Considering all the facts mentioned this research
    provides an innovative solution for optimizing the traditional agricultural methodologies
    and current architecture of the agricultural sector. Proposing solution is the
    “AgroPro” web application system which majorly provides solutions for 2 problems
    in Sri Lankan agriculture, the fertilizer ban issue and lacking a decision-making
    mechanism. “AgroPro” consist of 4 major components: Fertilizer Recommender, Agrochemicals
    Distribution optimizer, Suitable crop predictor, and Island-wide crop yield predictor.
    At the beginning of the 20th century, humanity faced a big challenge. A global
    food crisis and subsequent mass starvation loomed over the world. Meanwhile, Mr.
    Fritz Haber and Mr. Carl Bosch found a way to add nitrogen to the cultivation
    lands and it increased food production at a very high level. So far, people have
    been using and still using chemical fertilizers for cultivation. But the problem
    here is that the use of chemical fertilizer is increasing day by day and people
    are starting to get various that the use of chemical fertilizers is increasing
    day by day and people are starting to get various diseases. For example, the number
    of kidney patients in Sri Lanka seems to have increased rapidly in the last few
    decades. People are increasingly accustomed to adding chemical fertilizers to
    their crops in order to archive higher yields in a shorter period of time. As
    Sri Lanka is an agricultural country, this situation cannot be prevented very
    soon. Although the best solution to prevent diseases is to prevent the use of
    chemical fertilizers, stopping it all at once can lead to many problems for farmers.
    This is due to the fact that the crop yield is very low due to simultaneous cultivation
    without chemical fertilizers and farmers are not accustomed to using organic fertilizers.
    For these reasons, it is not advisable to stop the use of chemical fertilizers
    all at once. The solution is to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. But it
    is not a very easy task. This is because the number of fertilizers that needs
    to be applied to a crop varies depending on the area the soil and the climate.
    Based on these factors, the developed system recommends the amount of fertilizer
    that a farmer should apply to his crops. The system was designed based on meteorological
    and environmental information. optimizing the distribution of fertilizers can
    be performed without a delay. Farmers can get fertilizer from dealers without
    having to search for it and can prevent fertilizer shortages. This function explored
    the implementation of an optimization algorithm that gives an optimal solution
    for distributing process which means increasing the effectiveness of fertilizer
    distribution techniques. Crop prediction means accurate predictions of suitable
    crops for cultivation to improve production levels. The success of agriculture
    depends largely on the selection of the right crop. Choosing the right crop depends
    primarily on predicting future yields. Accurate harvest forecasting helps farmers
    make informed economic and management decisions. Hence farmers can prevent future
    failures. Nowadays, the crop selection process is done by an expert farmer or
    based on the previous experience of the cultivating farmer. As previously mentioned,
    hands-on expertise methods of crop selection descended from the past. This method
    worked in past climate conditions and soil conditions. But now climate change
    has begun, soil conditions are also different compared to the past and rainfall
    patterns also has changed. Hence currently farmers are unable to choose the right
    crop by using traditional manual methods according to current soil, climate conditions,
    and rainfall patterns. But with the advance of technology crop selection issue
    can be resolved using ML (machine learning algorithm) including forecasting model”.
    Today, rice is the staple food of Sri Lankans. Because the amount of rice in the
    country is not enough for the people in Sri Lanka, the government tries to import
    rice from other countries. In addition, farmers in Sri Lanka could not sell their
    yields due to the surplus of certain crops grown by them. Sri Lankan farmers swelter
    because of this issue. This issue is the major problem facing Sri Lankan farmers
    today. As the solution to this problem, a methodology for farmers to predict the
    obtainable crop yields from their fields could be represented. Using that methodology,
    farmers need to receive information such as the crop that needs to cultivate,
    the number of seeds that need to plant, the cultivation start date, etc. cultivating
    to get maximum income from their cultivation. The methodology will enable the
    farmer to earn a massive profit by identifying the crop which can grow and sell
    in a short time in the market and prioritizing them. By recognizing the required
    crop in advance, each farmer needs to predict the yield of each season. One of
    the main objectives of this research is to find a way for the Sri Lankan farmer
    to identify which growing crop is going to get high demand in the next few months.
    By considering the above factors, a district-wise data set would be built. A yield
    prediction system would be created for Govi Jana Seva officers using that dataset.
    This method will enable the farmer to earn more by preventing food wastage due
    to a shortage of certain food items that may get high demand at certain times
    and excess of certain food items. Humans mainly depend on water, food, and air.
    With human evaluation, humans started to produce foods on their own through agriculture.
    Sri Lanka is one of the countries which use irrigation agricultural technology
    for food production from the distant past. The increase in the human population
    has caused to increase the food production. Thus, the majority of farmers are
    leaning towards the use of chemical fertilizers. The use of chemical fertilizers
    provides farmers with a cost-efficient way of providing higher yields to the supply
    requirement. The use of agrochemicals in food has been a major threat to the health
    of Sri Lankans. In addition, these agrochemicals deteriorate the soil quality.
    Hence, the current government has prohibited agrochemicals usage and decreased
    the import of agrochemicals. However, now that farmers are accustomed to agrochemicals,
    the system they use has completely collapsed and GDP (Gross national product)
    has dropped. This research aims to address the current fertilizer problem in Sri
    Lanka and hopes to create an organized, efficient, and effective agriculture.
    SECTION II. Literature Review From ancient times people used fertilizers for their
    crops. But during that time, only the fertilizers found in their surroundings
    were used for further cultivation. But organic fertilizers manure alone was not
    enough to meet their growing food needs. As a result, people became accustomed
    to using chemical fertilizers. Hence, the farmers were able to get the following
    benefits from using them: ◾ Chemical Fertilizers are predictable and reliable.
    ◾ The Chemical Fertilizer can be used in poor soil to make it fertile immediately.
    ◾ They add a sufficient amount of nutrients needed by the plant. ◾ They contain
    the three essential nutrients (NPK) needed for plant growth. Due to the above
    reasons, the usage of chemical fertilizers has increased tremendously today. The
    use of these chemical fertilizers has also caused significant damage, such as
    waterway pollution, chemical burns, increased air pollution, soil acidification,
    and mineral depletion. As a result, many countries have abandoned the use of chemical
    fertilizers and resumed the use of organic fertilizers. But such a system is not
    yet operational in Sri Lanka. The reason behind this is that most farmers do not
    have much knowledge about the use of chemical and organic fertilizers. The proposed
    solution for this is to develop a system that can recommend the minimum amount
    of fertilizer required to grow a crop in a specific area. optimization algorithms
    make the fertilizer distribution process more accurate time and can be distributed
    fertilizer in most shortage areas. There aren’t many systems based on the previous
    study done in this manner for the agricultural sector. Most of the research is
    related to logistics distribution. But there is some research done for distributing
    fertilizer and they did not consider optimization for the country-wide distribution.
    The system proposed by Santosh Trimbak Warpe and Ravi Singh Pippal was based on
    a wireless sensor network [1]. It used the Newton Forward difference (NFD) method
    to automate the fertilizer distribution process based on the crop. The system
    provides fertilizer according to the on/off valve based on the threshold value
    for a particular crop. To do that, the authors consider two constraints of fertilizer
    amount and distance between each crop. Using the NFD method, this system saved
    3%, 5%, and 5% of Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium, respectively. The system
    proposed Priyanka Roy, Vikas Deep, Anugrah Pandya and Purushottam Sharma keeps
    records of properties owned by individual farmers [2]. The farmers used this application
    to send yearly or monthly plans of use of fertilizer. This list gives the record
    of farmers’ fertilizer requirements. If fertilizers are available, this system
    will notiry farmers via text message. This research used a less complex methodology
    to automate the fertilizer distribution system to increase fertilizer availability.
    The paper “Study on Distribution network optimization of Compound Fertilizer Supply
    Chain proposed by Zhang Lei and Zhou Yi, introduces supply chain,” for fertilizer
    distribution [3]. They introduce four types of network tiers. They are used to
    get an effective solution to meet the customer needs at lower cost, high quality,
    short lead times, and high flexibility. The paper “optimization Model and Algorithm
    for Ordering and Logistics Distribution of Distribution Centre,” authored by Yanqiu
    Liu, Ge Cao, Shida Xu, and Jia Li, investigates the ordering problem and logistics
    distribution of the distribution center in the supply chain [4]. This system considers
    the sum of ordering cost, penalty cost, distribution cost, and inventory cost
    for the optimization model to minimize total costs. Therefore, this system used
    a genetic algorithm to solve the problem. This helps to make the decisions quickly
    in ordering and distribution. The paper “Study on Location and Route optimization
    of Distribution Center of a Digital Company Based on Clustering Algorithm and
    Ant Colony Algorithm Method” authored by Wang Jiaojiao and Li Yueyu, is aimed
    to reduce the complex problem of logistics distribution to minimize the total
    cost, optimize the distribution routes, and ensure the shortest total distance
    from the distribution points [5]. This paper designs the logistics distribution
    network considering the factors of distribution warehouse location and path optimization.
    Using the clustering algorithm will determine the distribution, the corresponding
    supply point and the distribution point of each distribution point. To optimize
    the distribution path, the ant colony algorithm is used. The paper “Crop Yield
    Prediction and Efficient use of Fertilizers,” authored by S. Bhanumathi, M. Vineeth,
    and N. Rohit, use the random forest and backpropagation algorithms to determine
    which crop produces the most yield while using the least quantity of fertilizer
    based on the results [6]. This system comes with a model that will produce accurate
    fertilizer recommendations for given parameters. The system developed by A. Babu
    for Krishna district in India proposes a timely fertilizer distribution plan to
    deliver exact fertilizer quantity crop-wise to farmers based on their soil health
    cards [12]. The system proposed by Y. Jeevan Nagendra Kumar and members predicts
    crop production using historical data [7]. The prediction model was implemented
    using data mining techniques. As the ML algorithm, they have used the RF algorithm
    and in the research paper, they clearly mentioned that RF is the best ML algorithm
    for crop prediction mechanism. As the historical data, they have used agricultural
    facts like temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. But the mechanism predicts
    yield for a single given crop. The mechanism does not recommend suitable crops
    for cultivation. The farmer has to decide the prediction got the crop selected
    for cultivation analyzing the received yield amount from the mechanism. The crop
    prediction mechanism developed by Potnuru Sai Nishant, Pinapa Sai Venkat, Bollu
    Lakshmi Avinash, and B. Jabber by applying stacked regression gives a crop yield
    prediction according to the given crop, agricultural facts, and location details.
    But the system does not consist of a mechanism to predict suitable crops for cultivation.
    The system only predicts the yield of a certain crop. This may lead farmers to
    be unaware of other crops and the best crop for cultivation [9]. Maya Gopal P.
    S. & Bhargavi R. have analyzed and presented a preformation evaluation of other
    crop predictions for finding the best suitable subsets for crop yield prediction
    using machine learning algorithms [8]. The analysis was mainly done on models
    proposed and developed using ANN, SVR, KNN, and RF. In conclusion, the article
    suggests that the RF algorithm has the highest accuracy by means of its error
    analysis values for all the distinct feature subsets using the same training agricultural
    data. A system that suggests crops taking productivity and climate into account
    with regard to the season was proposed by S. Vaishnavi, M. Shobana, R. Sabitha,
    and S. Karthik [10]. To provide predictions and suggestions, they created and
    used a DT classification algorithm model. They used the Tamilnadu agricultural
    dataset, which has over 120.000 records, as the dataset. The dataset included
    productivity, crop year, crop name, district, season, and area cultivated. In
    this dataset, past cultivation information predominated over agricultural data.
    Also, the system produced a single crop recommendation for the inputs provided.
    Giving one single output restricts farmers’ options. One purpose of overcoming
    farmers’ failure to select the right crops and lead to suicides in India Priyadharshini
    A, Swapneel Chakraborty, and Aayush Kumar proposed a research system as “intelligent
    crop recommendation” [11]. The system consists of 3 components: a profit analysis,
    crop recommender, and crop sustainability predictor. They tested the yield forecasts’
    accuracy using DT, KNN, KNN with cross-validation NB, ANN, and SVR, among other
    data mining algorithms. SECTION III. Methodology A. Agrochemicals Distribution
    Optimizer Sri Lanka government uses three main companies to distribute fertilizer
    for the entire country. One of them were used for the purpose of the study used
    with the assumption that it has warehouses in each district. AgroPro system tracks
    every center, how they sell and buy fertilizers, and stores those data in one
    system. 1) Prediction Model This ML model is used to predict the fertilizer required
    amount district wise for next cultivating season by considering historical data.
    District extent, its fertilizer type wise usage and the current season, which
    are the major inputs required to this prediction model. The historical that needs
    to predict the fertilizer amount in this system was collected from the NFS. The
    samples were given by NFS was needed to preprocess. After end of the processing
    phrase most accurate prediction model found by testing several machine learning
    models such as random forest, decision tree, linear regression. Random forest
    algorithm gave 95% of test accuracy and 100% training accuracy then it was selected
    as the most accurate model for this dataset. 2) Optimization Model Optimization
    means making the best solution by minimizing or maximizing some constraints and
    getting the optimal solution. Knapsack optimization was used for this optimization
    when building an optimization algorithm, there are several aspects to consider.
    The following made the distribution process more accurate: ◾ Total fertilizer
    amount for a given season (Prediction model output). ◾ The ratio of fertilizer
    distribution throughout the season. ◾ Number of regional stocks and ACSs. ◾ Distance
    between regional warehouses and main warehouses. B. Suitable Crop Predictor Crop
    prediction model used in AgroPro is much similar to traditional expert farmer.
    Prediction model uses historical data (most like experiences) and by using they
    propose the crop prediction. Even though AgroPro crop prediction model much similar
    to expert farmer, AgroPro is far better than and very accurate because the model
    uses more agricultural facts like temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall climate
    and soil type etc. Necessary datasets for the research component got from agricultural
    department, National fertilizer secretariat (NFS) and Horticultural Crop Research
    and Development Institute. Then among those datasets, best dataset selected, and
    selected dataset processed and formatted. Because the dataset consisted with redundant
    values, null values and unwanted attributes that do not need to use in the model.
    By having these values may affect and harm to the prediction model and it may
    cause to the less accuracy of the prediction. Used 75% of dataset in training
    the prediction model and 25% of dataset in testing prediction model. The prediction
    model implemented with a function that included with ML algorithm. Model accuracy
    was tested with ML algorithms: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor, Gaussian NB,
    and DecisionTree. C. Island-Wide Crop Yield Predictor Two prediction models belong
    to this component. First one used to predict yield of crop and second one is used
    to predict market price. The first model obtains the expected yield from a crop
    which is expected to be cultivated in a certain season in a district and the other
    model determines the market value of that crop at the time of harvest. 1) Yield
    Calculation Dataset created by using the report containing the information about
    the crop productivity from 2000 to 2021 obtained by the Sri Lanka Department of
    Agriculture. The dataset contains with features such as predicting year, cultivating
    area, the crop, the district and the season. This dataset used to train and build
    the prediction model using ML algorithms, Linear regression algorithm, Decision
    tree algorithm, and Random Forest algorithm. Predicted yield used for further
    calculation to find out the crop is beneficial or not by considering excess yield
    demanded by agricultural department. Calculation Surplus/deficit = Excess yield
    – predicted yield Ex: Surplus/deficit = Excess yield – predicted yield Surplus/deficit
    = 22429 1412 = + 21017t (Here a value of ‘+’ is considered as deficit and a value
    of ‘-’ as surplus.) 2) High Profitable Crop Prediction To build the model needed
    information on the market prices of each crop in each season of the last few years
    was obtained from the economic centers in Sri Lanka. Then by using collected data
    consist with features such as the year and month, the crop and the district used
    to train and build the model which outputs the prices of a respective crop for
    a given time period. When building the model considered ML algorithms such as
    Linear regression algorithm, Decision tree algorithm, and Random Forest algorithm
    and the accuracy has been given the highest price from the Random Forest algorithm.
    SECTION IV. Results and Discussion A. Fertilizer Recommender This means multiple
    datasets are needed to create this system. The relevant datasets should be obtained
    by contacting institutions such as the department of Agriculture in Sri Lanka.
    These institutes have data files on how to apply fertilizer to crops. The first
    step is to request data from these organizations for our research. The second
    step is to gather information on how the nature of soil is determined. So far,
    there are several ways to do this. The first method is to make calculations using
    the data already available in the department of agriculture. This is because the
    agency already has data records that contain information about the nature of the
    soil in each area [1]. The second method is to determine the nature of the soil
    by processing a photograph of the soil. It is learned that this method is also
    an existing successful method. The third method is to use and instrument to determine
    the nature of the soil. The accuracy of this method is very high. But this is
    a somewhat difficult task. During the research selecting the most effective and
    accurate one of these three method is important. Next up is finding an out how
    to get weather information. Google provides a free weather API gateway. Because
    it is very easy to use and can be easily obtained. Once this is done, the next
    step is to find a suitable algorithm for this. Next by using the algorithm proper
    machine learning model should be created. For that it will take a considerable
    amount of time. After that by using the dataset the machine learning model should
    be trained. Which will help to create a more accurate machine learning model at
    the end of the day. B. Agrochemicals Distribution Optimizer This system is considered
    the fractional knapsack optimization which can get items partially to fill the
    knapsack. The objective function is the function that used value as the distance
    between regional warehouses and the main warehouse. It will make the distribution
    process cost-effective. In our system knapsack optimization inputs are as follows:
    C = The maximum capacity in knapsack. W = Weight V = Value of weight Weight =[w1,
    w2, w3, w4] Value [X1, X2, X3, X4] Calculation: For example, fertilizer amount
    prediction model’s inputs and outputs are as follows: Season: Yala; District:
    Kurunegala; Next cultivation area (ha): 6540 ha. The prediction model output can
    be shown as follows: Aurea= Predicted Urea (MT) ATsp= Predicted TSP (MT) AMop=
    Predicted MOP (MT) There is a ratio for every month to divide the fertilizer throughout
    the season. The ratio was built by analyzing the current usage in Sri Lanka. Amounts
    given by this ratio are the minimum fertilizer amount required for the month in
    a particular district. This quantity of manure should be distributed at a minimum
    otherwise the district cultivation may be disturbed. The facts that directly impact
    fertilizer distribution optimization are as follows: P = Ratio for a particular
    month. M = Month fertilizer required amount. Cd = District warehouse capacity.
    D = Distance between the main warehouse and regional S = Remain in space R = Knapsack
    result L = District T = Total distributable amount Above mentioned ratios need
    to apply for every month and calculate the fertilizer required amount for a particular
    month. For 1st month’s urea calculation can be define as follows: M 1_L1_urea
    = A urea ∗ P 1 % View Source After allocating 1st month’s demands for every district,
    then there can be spaces remaining in warehouses. To fill that space, need to
    consider the distance between warehouses. When the distance is maximized after
    allocating the current month’s required amount, the cost will be reduced. That
    means if fertilizers are given to distant regions first, the required amount for
    a 2nd month fertilizer amount will be reduced. After allocating 1st month required
    amount for the above district remaining warehouse spaces can be defined as follows:
    S L1 = C d − M 1_L1_urea View Source The next target is how to manage this remaining
    space for each fertilizer type. That was done by using the fractional knapsack
    algorithm. The inputs for knapsack optimization are as follows: V=[D,D,D] distance
    is not changed for same warehouse W=[ M 2_L_urea , M 2_L_tsp , M 2_L_mop ] - Next
    month required amounts C=SL1 (Remain warehouse space for location 1) R1= Knapsack
    (V, W, C) This needs to be applied to each district and needs to get the remaining
    space allocation for next month. After applying this function to each district’s
    remaining spaces, the outputs needs to be compared with the main warehouse’s available
    space. That was done by using the fractional knapsack algorithm. The inputs for
    knapsack optimization are as follows: V = [D1,D2, D3] distance from warehouses
    W=[ R 1urea_L1 , R 1urea_L2 , R lurea_L3 ] - Next month allocation amounts (R1
    knapsack outputs) C = Main warehouse availability after allocation first month
    (ex: Urea) R2 = Knapsack (V, W, C) This needs to be applied for each district
    for each fertilizer type and then system can finalize the total distribution for
    a particular location. According to the R2 results, the amount of fertilizer in
    the nearest district is reduced by some fraction, while the amount of the farthest
    district can be kept the same. According to the final output, total distributable
    urea fertilizeramounts for L1 location can be shown as follows: T urea = M 1 L
    − urea+ R 2 L − urea View Source C. Suitable Crop Predictor After checking the
    accuracy of some of these ML algorithms, as shown in the Table I, the model random
    forest regression learning algorithm gave the highest validation accuracy of 99.8%
    and the highest training accuracy of 100%. Hence, selected the model with random
    forest regression ML algorithm and used the flask connected with the front end.
    Apart from considering agricultural facts such as temperature, humidity, soil
    Ph, Rainfall, and soil NPK ratio, suitable crop predictor of the AgroPro provide
    another option for farmers to make their decision on selecting suitable crops
    for their cultivation. The mentioned option contains an ML model containing features
    such as crop, district, annual yield, annual average rainfall of the district,
    and annual average temperature. As the ML algorithm test, the model with the same
    mentioned algorithm above and when developing the model used the random forest
    classifier because of high testing accuracy. Research components consist of sensor
    devices to acquire values for considering agricultural facts, Ph, humidity, temperature,
    etc. These devices will be used by agricultural regional officers and farmers
    can get their help to receive better and more accurate result through the crop
    predictor in AgroPro. Table I ML Models with Accuracy of Suitable Crop Predictor
    D. Island-Wide Crop Yield Predictor Although several machine learning algorithms
    were used for building the 2 models, the most accurate output was given through
    the random forest algorithm. If taken as a percentage, as shown in Table II and
    Table III, the model that predict the market value gives a value between 92% -
    95% and the model that predict the yield amount gives an accuracy between 90%
    - 96%. Table II ML Models with Accuracy of Market Price Predictor Table III ML
    Models with Accuracy of Crop Yield Predictor SECTION V. Conclusion The research
    presents AgroPro as the optimal solution for current traditional farming in Sri
    Lanka. But more than an optimizer AgroPro acts as an economic assistant by providing
    systematic solutions to save foreign exchanges and reduce unnecessary costs. More
    than that AgroPro helps to reduce soil pollution and human health issues. Most
    economic experts think that the best option Sri Lanka has is to recover from the
    current economic crisis in agriculture. But with traditional farming, will be
    not easy because Sri Lankan agriculture needs an optimizer itself. Hence that
    optimizer can be “AgroPro”. As future work, instead of considering each life cycle,
    fertilizer recommender works considering the whole life cycle of a plant. Hence,
    it can be developed to recommend fertilizer according to the life cycle and age
    of the plant. In addition, a fertilizer distribution tracker can be included in
    the system. Furthermore, a plant disease recognition and treatment suggestion
    mechanism can be included as new functionalities of the system with new research
    areas. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The authors like to express their gratitude to all staff
    members of the Sri Lankan national fertilizer secretariat and the agricultural
    department of Sri Lanka for providing us with the necessary information and dataset
    to carry out the project. Authors References Keywords Metrics More Like This An

    IoT technologies collect data and relay it to data analytics and deep learning
    for in-depth analysis. The findings indicate that data assists farmers in managing
    crop variety, phenotypes and selection, crop performance, soil quality, pH level,
    irrigation, and fertilizer application quantity. The study looks at typical application
    areas and critical success factors for precision agriculture. Technological issues,
    safety, privacy, cost, and legal issues influence the adoption of these technologies.

    Location: Ireland SECTION 1. Introduction Agriculture, like many other industries,
    is undergoing a digital transformation because of population growth, climate change,
    and food security concerns, which necessitate the adoption of innovative crop
    productivity methods [32]. Agriculture’s role in climate change and global warming,
    on the other hand, has been the subject of a long-running and contentious debate
    [8]. Agriculture makes an important contribution to the global economy [28]. Farming
    also plays a role in global socio-economic activity. As a result of market growth,
    both agricultural research and industry are aiming for sustainable agricultural
    productivity [24], as well as addressing societal needs in acquiring, managing,
    analyzing, visualizing, and utilizing data and information in dealing with cross-disciplinary
    precision agriculture problems [44]. The rising trend in crop demand, combined
    with rising fertilizer and pesticide prices, has highlighted the need for resource-efficient,
    environmentally friendly agriculture [8]. Agricultural practices have long been
    unsatisfactory in terms of yield maximization and cost minimization due to an
    overreliance on traditional farming orientation. The vice has not been information-driven,
    particularly in management practices such as inputs timing or quantification.
    However, they failed to account for field variability, resulting in resource misallocations
    such as under or over-application of inputs, which had a significant impact on
    the ecosystem and harmed production sustainability [48]. The issues have an impact
    on food security, requiring farmers to adopt other productive farm practices.
    This is realized with precision agriculture and the adoption of novel technologies.
    Soil variability and crop management are critical in precision agriculture for
    achieving productivity, profitability, and environmental effluence control [15].
    Precision farming is seen as a long-term solution to the problem of food scarcity
    and unprofitable farm practices [19]. It is based on the production inputs-precision
    applied when and where they are needed to achieve the most efficient yields [34].
    In precision agriculture, thorough plant phenology tracking of agricultural plants
    transversely by deep learning at large spatial levels is critical. Governments
    can use crop-mapping information to invalidate farmer subsidies, detect fraud,
    and process insurance claims. The application’s design is similar to that of the
    IoT-based irrigation systems and sensors capable of tracking [26]. Adoption of
    IoT, predictive analytics, and deep learning in precision agriculture is important
    for 1) profitability; 2) efficiency of input cost reduction; 3) food safety; 4)
    sustainability; 5) and environmental safety [1]. The study will benefit a variety
    of stakeholders, including individual farmers, communities, government, and agricultural
    authorities. It will provide insight and understanding to facilitate economic
    impact by providing good agricultural services, important data collection, analysis,
    and insight exposure for decision-making and farming practice management. These
    will boost productivity, food security, and long-term sustainability. 1.1 Sustainable
    Agriculture Precision agriculture has the potential to significantly contribute
    to efforts to address agricultural challenges. It can also contribute to a more
    sustainable agricultural system while remaining profitable [8]. Precision agriculture
    and the concept of sustainability are inextricably linked. Sustainability is the
    economic ability to maintain consistent productivity without jeopardizing the
    needs of future generations. Sustainable agriculture improves environmental quality
    and resource-based agriculture, where agriculture is based on basic human food
    and economic viability. Sustainability has remained a comprehensive examination
    of the economic, environmental, and sociological consequences of any expansion
    [6]. Agro-technology and precision farming use data-driven approaches to increase
    agricultural productivity while minimizing environmental impacts [28]. Precision
    agriculture’s critical success is hampered by factors such as a lack of training,
    a low return on investment, high costs, and a lack of precision agriculture big
    data analytics [44]. Precision farming collects real-time data on farm elements
    such as crops, air, and soil to protect the environment while also ensuring profits
    and sustainability [1]. The incorporation of AI techniques in agricultural practices
    has advanced aspects such as crop and soil health, irrigation systems, crop disease
    identification, weed control, and recommended control measures [26]. Farming problems
    are addressed by robotics and sensing technologies. As a result, adopting a robotic
    agricultural system will have a significant impact on crop production, efficiency,
    and sustainability [22]. 1.2 Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture has recently
    received a lot of attention due to the world’s ever-increasing demand for water
    and food [20]. Precision agriculture is no exception to how information systems
    have influenced and shaped every aspect of our society [8]. Precision agriculture
    is the “collection of real-time data from farm variables and use of predictive
    analytics for smart decisions to maximize yields, minimize environmental impact,
    and reduce cost” [11]. Precision farming is the management of spatial and temporal
    variability with ICT-enabled technologies to provide food security [45]. Precision
    agriculture [14], is a strategic approach that collects, processes, and analyzes
    temporal, spatial, and individual data, integrating it with other information
    to support managerial decisions based on estimated variations to improve utilization
    efficiency, productivity, quality, profit margins, and sustainability of agricultural
    output. Precision agriculture’s goal is to understand the soil and crop qualities
    that are specific to each section of the field and to streamline production inputs
    in small sections of the field [34]. [4] articulated precision farming has the
    potential to provide both economic and environmental benefits. Thereby resolving
    both the economic and climate change issues that currently plague production agriculture
    precision agriculture is a field in which technology is used to effectively manage
    agriculture by understanding the temporal and spatial changes in soil, crop, production,
    and management via innovative techniques [44]. Smart farming necessitates the
    incorporation of sensor technologies capable of collecting data from the crop,
    soil, animal behavior, tractor status, and a variety of environmental characteristics.
    Sensor data from IoT computing and analytics can provide a farmer with valuable
    information [32]. The use of Smart greenhouses encourages crop cultivation with
    a minimum of human intervention by constantly monitoring climatic conditions such
    as humidity, luminosity, temperature, and soil moisture, generating automated
    actions based on the assessed changes, and enacting corrective mechanisms to maintain
    the most valuable conditions for development [1]. Deep Learning’s contribution
    to improving precision agriculture includes the optimal control of the agricultural
    production system; management of the agricultural economic system agriculture
    information processing and smart agriculture machinery equipment [43]. Growing
    agricultural technology has enabled use of high-precision sensors to remotely
    monitor nutrients, water, humidity, light, and temperature. The collected data
    is exposed through an advanced analysis using robust algorithms to aid in prediction
    processes and strategic decision-making. Machine learning and deep learning technologies
    are important in precision agriculture as they enable computers to become intelligent
    through development of image and video processing algorithms [9]. Agriculture
    has been influenced by IT enabling cost reduction, efficiency, and sustainability
    [26]. [13] Posit that precision agriculture is a collection of IT artifacts that
    includes information systems, smart sensors, and improved machinery with cognizance
    management for production optimization via tracking and monitoring of uncertainties
    and variability in agricultural structures. Precision agriculture employs IoT,
    deep learning, predictive analytics, and AI-based technologies to detect plant
    diseases, pests, and poor plant nutrition in the field [11]. Precision agriculture
    enables efficient observation and close monitoring of crops as they grow by using
    information collected directly from the field [31]. New technologies, such as
    wireless sensor networks, are assisting in the real-time streaming of data for
    strategic decision-making. Sensor networks are used in agriculture for a variety
    of reasons, including 1) Agriculture with pinpoint accuracy, 2) Consumer advertisement,
    3) Plant growth optimization, 4) Farm surveillance, 5) Research, 6) Farming education
    and training 7) Farm administration [27]. SECTION 2. Objectives The specific objectives
    that will guide the study include: To assess role and impact of smart technologies
    on sustainable precision agriculture. To evaluate application of IoT data analytics
    & deep learning in precision agriculture; To investigate the barriers to the adoption
    of sustainable precision farming. SECTION 3. Methodology The research was carried
    out via desktop search using Google Scholar and was guided by keywords such as
    IoT, Deep Learning, Precision Agriculture, Sustainability, and Big Data Analytics.
    SECTION 4. IoT Technologies in Agriculture The IoT entailed the connection of
    objects via RFID [35]. It is no longer a buzzword, but it is being used practically
    all over the world as a result of the technology advancement. It enables physical
    object interconnection over a network [39]. Precision farming makes use of smart
    technologies such as IoT and big data analytics. It can handle farming problems
    adequately by monitoring crops, soil, environment, irrigation, and fertilization
    with IoT sensors, RFID, and cameras. These IoT technologies collect data and relay
    it to data analytics for in-depth analysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data
    via devices such as smartphones. The data helps farmers manage crop varieties,
    phenotypes, selection, crop performance, soil quality, pH level, irrigation, and
    fertilizer application quantity [19]. Farmers will discover that agricultural
    problems are a thing of the past with the use of IoT. It plays an important role
    in gathering relevant information [31]. Drones are used in agricultural applications
    such as monitoring fields, crops, and livestock, as well as scanning large areas,
    whereas sensors on the ground collect a vast amount of data [1]. The IoT is playing
    an important role in agricultural product management in real-time data, alongside
    1) control; 2) tracking; 3) evaluating; 4) searching; 5) monitoring; 6) managing;
    and 7) logistic operations [1]. Figure 1 – IoT Sensing Platform Architecture(Adapted
    from [37] Show All Figure 2 – Applications of Smart Technologies in Precision
    Agriculture (adapted from [10]) Show All SECTION 5. Big Data Analytics (BDA) and
    Deep Learning in Agriculture 5.1 Big Data Analytics (BDA) Currently, big data
    analytics is being increasingly adopted to meet the evolving needs of big data
    technologies across a wide range of topics. Big data’s approachability, accessibility,
    and rapid emergence have fueled consistent technological developments and applications
    [17]. The BDA enables knowledgeable insights to be extracted from massive IoT
    data sets through the application of data mining approaches aimed at predicting,
    identifying patterns, correlations, trends, and decision making. The massive amounts
    of data generated by IoT have made a significant contribution to the vast field
    of big data. Big data characteristics include volume, veracity, variety, value,
    and velocity [30]. Big data provides predictive insights into farming practices,
    drives real-time effective decisions, and redesigns business processes to create
    game-changing business models [40]. The smart decision made possible by data analytics
    results in less waste of resources such as water, pesticides, and fertilizer [11].
    The BDA is responsible for capturing, storing, analyzing, searching, and identifying
    hidden patterns in the collected data. As a result, BDA necessitates the use of
    (a) tools for classification and clustering; (b) techniques for data mining, machine
    learning, and statistical analysis; and (c) technologies like Hadoop and Spark.
    It aids in accurately forecasting and decision-making in agricultural practices
    [1]. Adoption and optimization of innovation and technologies will help to ensure
    the long-term viability of precision farming through better practices and increased
    productivity. These can be realized by measuring, storing, and analyzing data
    to improve yield quality; managing cost revenues through crop risk probability
    and minimization, and adopting improved preventive care methods to increase productivity
    satisfaction [50]. Adoption of IoT Big Data is critical in farm management practices
    such as crop imaging, irrigation, soil analysis, pesticide and herbicide application,
    fertilizers, temperature, and moisture monitoring [2]. Adoption of IoT big data
    technologies can have a positive economic impact by facilitating the provision
    of good agricultural services, important data collection, analysis, and the dissemination
    of insights that assist farmers in making informed and correct decisions about
    farming practices and management. The government contributes significantly to
    the success or failure of agriculture by encouraging farmers to be risk-averse.
    Factors such as drought, heavy rain, pest and disease infestations, or poor seed
    quality contribute to the high risk. The government must provide full intervention
    to farmers, such as input subsidies, permits, rates, irrigation facilitation,
    and training and sensitization for the adoption of modern farming technologies
    for high yields and productivity [2]. The expansion of big climate data and its
    analytics has resulted in the widespread use of smart information management systems,
    precision agriculture, and intelligent automatic agriculture [17]. 5.2 Deep Learning
    [16] Ascribe that deep learning technologies are used in a variety of agricultural
    and farming systems. Autonomous weed identification can aid in weed control, resulting
    in higher yields. Weed detection in crops using imagery is a difficult task because
    weeds and crops have similar colors, shapes, and textures during the growth stage.
    Deep learning is an important branch of machine learning. Deep learning is a type
    of artificial intelligence that is trained on data sets and then learns on its
    own, and it is at the heart of many technologies [38]. Aside from image segmentation,
    object detection, and identification, deep learning algorithms have several advantages
    over previous machine learning approaches. Machine learning algorithms used in
    precision agriculture decision support tools to recognize statistical correlations
    rather than causal explanations. It takes into account a set of entities such
    as crop yields in addition to data characteristics linked to entities such as
    weather conditions and soil conditions to predict the outcome [5]. Deep learning
    is an “algorithm-assisted structure that mimics human learning” [9]. Robotic vision
    is based on machine learning from real-world datasets using methods i.e. deep
    neural networks, allowing robots to share their knowledge by learning from Big
    Data [10]. Machine Learning is an Artificial Intelligence subset that can detect
    patterns and anomalies in data generated by smart sensors [40]. Deep Learning
    algorithms have been used in agriculture in a variety of ways. Convolutional neural
    networks are Deep Learning models that interact with images by extracting features
    or objects and learning to differentiate between them [18]. Deep learning enables
    computational models with multiple layers of processing that represent multiple
    data levels of abstraction. Several Deep Learning algorithms rely heavily on the
    Back Propagation Neural Network. Weather forecasting, plant disease detection,
    image translation, fruit counting, land classification, obstacle detection, plant
    classification, weed identification, animal behavior classification, and yield
    prediction are all areas where deep learning is used in agriculture [43], [9].
    SECTION 6. Typical Application Areas Pest Management is a common application of
    smart technologies in precision agriculture. Insect pest infestation in agriculture
    has been a major issue for farmers, resulting in significant economic losses.
    These can be mitigated by the development of computerized systems that identify
    active pests and advise on control measures [3]. Modern and intelligent technology,
    such as the use of drones, can independently eradicate pests and selectively target
    agrichemicals, reducing collateral damage to the ecosystem, lowering resistance,
    and lowering costs [22]. Figure 3: Drones with Precision Sprayers (adapted from
    [22]) Show All Weed Control: The direct application of herbicides in the field
    to control weeds has had a significant impact on the environment and human health
    complications. Nonetheless, technological advancements have enabled the use of
    artificial intelligence for safe and risk-free herbicide applications. The use
    of a rule-based expert system; machine vision; neural network models and image
    analysis are among the approaches that are now taking center stage in weed identification
    and elimination [46]. Artificial intelligence sensors can detect and target weeds
    before determining which herbicides are needed and when. Machine vision can aid
    in site-specific crop management by detecting and distinguishing the presence
    of weeds and the appropriate chemical to spray [27]. Agricultural Product Monitoring:
    Food monitoring and quality control mechanisms based on proper drying, storage,
    and grading of harvested crops are critical [3]. Storage Management: Many agricultural
    products are lost as a result of poor storage management systems. Unrequired temperature,
    moisture, and other environmental factors can contribute to the toxicity of food
    products or aid in the infestation of insects, microorganisms, rodents, and other
    pests, all of which harm the quality and quantity of food products. IoT, AI, and
    data analytics improve agricultural product storage [11]. Crop disease management:
    Crop diseases reduce crop productivity yield. Precision agriculture is the adaptation
    of a computer-aided system that can assist in the identification of crop diseases
    and proposed control measures. Various systems and algorithms for predicting,
    classifying, detecting, and controlling crop diseases have been proposed. Rule-based
    systems, a fuzzy logic-based model, an artificial neural network-based model,
    an image processing model, and the k-means segmentation algorithm are among the
    techniques used [3]. Weather Monitoring: The growth of plants is dependent on
    weather conditions and factors such as sunlight and rainwater, which are now naturally
    unpredictable. The new technologies can monitor and predict the weather, providing
    farmers with useful information to help them avoid unfavorable conditions [41].
    Irrigation Management: IoT-based smart irrigation systems help improve irrigation
    efficacy by reducing water loss and conserving current water resources [1]. Yield
    Prediction: The prediction model is critical for precision agriculture analytics
    because it forecasts crop yield, which is critical for marketing strategies and
    crop cost estimation. A backpropagation learning algorithm of an artificial neural
    network has been used to forecast yield based on soil parameters, atmospheric
    inputs, and fertilizer consumption [3]. Management of Soils: Soil management is
    a critical area in agriculture that requires attention because improper soil management
    results in a loss of crop yield and quality. Soil minerals and pH levels must
    be measured and monitored for plants to grow healthier as a result of proper soil
    minerals and pH levels [41]. The use of large harvesters has greatly damaged and
    compacted soil, and the overuse of agrochemicals, such as nitrogen fertilizer,
    has harmed the environment. Aside from autonomous technologies, the use of robotics
    could be of great assistance and relief to farmers. Drone data analytics are used
    to make smarter nitrogen fertilizer applications for healthy vegetation [22].
    Artificial intelligence techniques can help with supervised activities such as
    crop and land suitability mapping, stem water intake estimation, soil water content
    management, soil moisture, and rainfall prediction [3]. Agricultural Machinery
    Management: Agricultural machinery must be managed to improve agricultural efficiency,
    competitiveness, and sustainability. Smart agricultural machines are quick, versatile,
    precise, and intelligent, with low carbon dioxide emissions and bioenergy utilization
    [1]. IoT-enabled agricultural machinery can boost crop productivity while reducing
    grain losses. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems and global navigation
    satellite systems can improve machinery because they can be driven in autopilot
    mode. Machines with vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, and robots can be controlled
    remotely, allowing farmers to map their field management practices such as fertilizing,
    irrigation, nutrition, and so on [11]. Figure 4: Autonomous Harvester (adapted
    from [10]) Show All SECTION 7. Economic Benefits Advances in technological services,
    new business models, and markets drive significant GDP growth [44]. Radical advancements
    in information systems, such as satellites, the internet, mobile phones, and social
    media, are now being used to solve agricultural challenges. Artificial intelligence
    and the IoT are revolutionizing agricultural activities, addressing productivity
    issues such as weather unpredictability, crop loss, and economic stagnation [26].
    These IoT technologies collect data and relay it to data analytics for in-depth
    analysis. Farmers receive the analyzed data via devices such as smartphones. The
    data helps farmers manage crop varieties, phenotypes, selection, crop performance,
    soil quality, pH level, irrigation, and fertilizer application quantity [19].
    Because of the popularity of IoT, it can now be used in a variety of fields (i.e.
    smart home, smart agriculture, smart city, smart health-care, smart logistics,
    smart transport, smart energy, and so on). It is estimated that the world’s population
    will reach 9.7 billion by 2050, up from 7.7 billion today [20]. This raises concerns
    about food security, in addition to global warming, which has made climatic conditions
    uncertain, scarcity of natural resources, and arid land, which are the most significant
    challenges faced by the majority of countries. This necessitates the implementation
    of novel and strategic agricultural production methods. Big data’s role is to
    extract valuable insights from massive amounts of heterogeneous data about crop
    growth and other parameters measured [30]. SECTION 8. Challenges Affecting Adoption
    of Sustainable Precision Farming The adoption of innovative technologies in precision
    agriculture has not been easy. Industrial agriculture techniques are already heavily
    criticized for harming the environment [8]. Examples of such effects include (i)
    Monocultures reduce biodiversity in plants and animals. (ii) The use of chemical
    pesticides and fertilizers pollutes the soil and groundwater. (iii) Soil degrades
    much faster than it can be replenished. (iv) Extinction of fish. (v) Excessive
    use of water and fossil fuels. (vi) The global population is expected to increase
    significantly, increasing global food demand. (vii) Fertilizer and pesticide prices
    are projected to increase. [34], pointed out the barriers to precision farming
    implementation in developing countries: a) The cultures and perceptions of users.
    b) A scarcity of technical expertise on the local level. c) Taking into account
    system heterogeneity and market imperfections. d) The availability, quality, and
    cost of data. e) A small farm size and a lack of success stories. f) Knowledge
    and technology gaps. h) Land ownership, infrastructure, and institutional constraints.
    Among the factors impeding full implementation among farmers are: Concerns about
    privacy and trust: The presence of malware attacks and data thefts is a risk factor
    for connected systems. Because of their presence in the complex IoT system, these
    malicious third-party programs are difficult to detect and remove. There is an
    urgent need for a strong security and policy framework for agricultural IoT and
    other technologies for systems to promote trust and be more acceptable to customers
    [42] [49]. Agronomical challenges include a lack of basic information, limited
    sampling and inspection procedures, information misuse, a lack of qualified agronomic
    services, and a lack of site-specific fertilizer references [25]. Profitability
    issue: The inability to demonstrate that the use of precision agriculture technology
    improves farm profitability through the strategy of “right quantity of crop inputs
    in the right location at the right time” [33]. Lack of skills: Precision agriculture
    is primarily information-intensive and technology-driven, necessitating extensive
    technical skills gained through training to analyze data and exhaustively interpret
    information derived from data mining techniques and algorithms [36] [25]. Cost
    challenge: Precision agriculture management activities and machinery such as driverless
    tractors with sensors that are suitable for large-scale farmers are not cost-effective
    for domestic farmers. Financial constraints and a lack of credit for technological
    machinery and inputs are deterring farmers from adopting precision farming [49].
    Lack of broadband infrastructure: Due to the unfavorable landscape, internet connectivity
    in remote rural areas in developing countries is unreliable. As a result, improved
    network performance and bandwidth speeds are required in these areas. Precision
    agriculture systems located in farm environments with poor connectivity cannot
    effectively share data with other systems on the same farm. The issues with GPS
    signals and agro-sensors have an impact on cloud services in terms of data transmission
    and storage [47]. Technical challenges: Any mechanical failure in technological
    equipment causes serious crop damage. For example, if a smart irrigation sensor
    fails, crops may be under-watered or over-watered, affecting crop growth. Food
    security can also be jeopardized if storage technologies fail [47] [25]. Perception
    of utilitarianism: Farmers’ negative attitudes toward the use of precision agriculture
    technologies in comparison to traditional farming methods. This has had a significant
    impact on adoption rates, necessitating the need for farmer education, sensitization,
    and awareness [25]. SECTION 9. Critical Success Factors For Implementation of
    Precision Agriculture Agricultural service providers are filling the gap in assisting
    farms in making use of the data they collect and optimizing it for strategies
    such as variable rate application, zone-based soil sampling, soil electrical conductivity
    mapping, cloud solutions, and areas-based plant tissue testing [14]. Adoption
    of new technologies: Smart devices and methods for detecting and monitoring biotic
    factors like weeds and diseases must be implemented. This technology aids in the
    management of soil moisture as well as variable irrigation applications [23].
    Transdisciplinary approach: By combining several competencies and academic fields,
    ICT can make a significant contribution to long-term sustainable development.
    These disciplines must collaborate to help develop sustainable agricultural development
    through a transdisciplinary approach that has the potential to impact society
    on multiple levels [29]. The assistance provided by governments and the private
    sectors: As a result, early adoption assistance from governments and the private
    sector is critical [34]. Training programs: Farmers must be trained in the proper
    use of innovations and consultation, particularly data, software management, and
    analysis resources. This can instill confidence that today’s precision agriculture
    tools provide the most critical insights [23]. Bringing together temporal and
    spatial data: Bringing together temporal and spatial output data can help farmers
    and advisers manage fields or farms due to differences in agricultural average
    yield and variation to improve nutrient uptake [14]. Data quality assurance is
    required because high-quality agronomic data must be handled and retrieved [23].
    SECTION 10. Conclusions and Recommendation The study assessed the application
    of various technologies in precision agriculture. Farmers will find agricultural
    problems obsolete as a result of the use of IoT, Big Data, and Deep Learning.
    Big data provides predictive insights into farming practices, drives real-time
    effective decisions, and redesigns business processes to create game-changing
    business models. Weather forecasting, plant disease detection, image translation,
    fruit counting, land classification, obstacle detection, plant classification,
    weed identification, animal behavior classification, and yield prediction are
    all areas where deep learning is used in agriculture. The study also looks at
    the typical application areas and challenges in precision agriculture adoption.
    The study examines the critical success factors for implementing precision agriculture.
    The findings indicate technological advancements, new business models, and markets
    drive significant GDP growth. The study recommends the adoption and optimization
    of innovations and technologies that will enable precision farming to be sustainable
    through quality practices and increased productivity such as the use of mobile
    devices, access to better internet speed, low-cost and dependable satellites for
    positioning and imagery, and precision agriculture-optimized agricultural machinery.
    Future research should focus on the application of appropriate decision-support
    systems for implementing precision decisions. Authors Figures References Citations

  description: Purpose. The aim of the work is to enhance the soil quality prediction
    accuracy and time by using feature selection and classification-based model. Background.
    Soil quality analysis was handled based on the farmer’s first-hand data mining
    competence and with the world population expected to increase exponentially (i.e.,
    big data), erratic changes in climate have started influenc-ing soil capitulates
    incorrectly. Big data is employed used to examine the large amount of dataset
    for soil quality analysis. It is helps to address a lot of new and significant
    farming decisions and issue. Soil quality analysis depends on fertility of the
    soil. By soil quality analysis accuracy prediction is very crucial for practical
    utilization of resources. But, the existing data mining techniques failed to select
    the correct crop based on the soil and environmental features. Material and methods.
    The study presents the data mining techniques based on smart and efficient soil

    Big data cloud application most important data storage and data analysis environment.
    The big data weather and crop forecasting is a new research agenda in modern agricultural
    structure and huge data evaluation. This is a challenging research area, as manual
    inspection of agricultural data can lead to human error. This proposed system''s
    main determination is to improve crop yield prediction accuracy from agricultural
    big data and design and develop effective programs for data classification. Preprocessing
    is then used to analyze the collected data and identify the absent values for
    the attribute. Non-existent values are filled with corresponding new values by
    checking previous and past results. The fuzzy strategy is the right dimension,
    reducing the strategy to emphasize any of the self-organizing contours. After
    reducing the measurement, the reduced dimension information is used to predict
    climate as a reasonable outcome.An advanced methodology, Fuzzy Enumeration Crop
    Prediction Algorithm (FECPA) employed for accurate crop yield prediction. Therefore,
    they can improve the productivity of various sources?(no clarity), data analysis,
    predictive analysis, crop production, and FECPA with the help of increasing farmers
    developing a system of integrated data in long trip profit margins. This method

    may be a complex development influenced by actual soil input parameters and environmental
    conditions. Big data refers to a large collection of unstructured, complex data
    in which structured and traditional processing techniques and / or algorithms
    cannot work. Its purpose is to reveal patterns and leads hidden in evolution from
    the model-driven science paradigm to the data-driven science paradigm.The input
    parameters for agriculture change from farm to farm. In large spaces, collecting
    such information can be a frustrating task. It can be used to predict the effects
    of major crops in many individual areas or locations of such knowledge sets. Developed
    globally by researchers in agriculture or related sciences everywhere, the assessment
    has completely different forecasting methods. Data mining (Fig. 1) is the process
    of extracting many useful and important pieces of information from a database.
    Mining agricultural information is a relatively new area of research. Yield forecasting
    is a very important agricultural issue. Any farmer just wants to know how much
    output is expected. Previously, yield forecasts were calculated when farmers took
    the experience in accounting for crops in specific areas. Training data classification
    in all data mining processes future publication predictions is collected based
    on past and present information that will be used in the training study. Download

    Yield Prediction using Data Mining. Crop sampling and decision making tools are
    used in agriculture to enhance production efficiency. Increase the yield of crops
    produced in combination with high technology and agriculture and what will be
    more interesting and new. Due to the high content of new technologies, crop models,
    and forecasting tools, '' rapid development can be predicted as an important factor
    in agriculture.Crop Forecast Predicts that crop yields and production yields do
    not occur in the pre-field. Pre-harvest forecasts are implemented considering
    the knowledge of selected fields and crop farmers. An organization proposes to
    implement strategies for data prediction and database analysis to use this work.
    High yields of crops with specific addresses are expected (Fig. 2). Download :

    System Block Diagram. 2. Related work The first problem is motivated by unmanned
    ground vehicles to obtain a time-consuming soil measurement scheme [1]. The context
    of this dynamic system allows us to make the most of classical tools in this field
    to perform the estimation of relevant variables. General methods and examples
    have been defined in this study based on polarized radar data to track crop groups''
    growth period [2]. The new decision-making method will be applied to solve the
    choice of the produce distribution center''s location.The results show that the
    relationship between attributes and reference points influences significant decision-making
    behavior [3]. The technical forecasts allow the direction of scientific and technological
    development of the agricultural complex to be planned and monitor its material
    support [4] in modernization. Dynamic energy seems to be a feasible way. Mathematical
    methods use curved space vectors, which greatly reduces computation—vector identification
    of cycle time and reference time [5]. The concept of supply chain management is
    used to add value to the innovation economy concept, which has great potential.
    The added value of supply chain management is the supplier selection process [6].
    Therefore, although it is worth applying mobile learning to agriculture and farming,
    stakeholders all have their genetic traits and require detailed investigation.
    This work is based on an experimental approach [6]. To improve the attractiveness
    of innovative investment activities and local agriculture, competitive situations
    must be analyzed, evaluated, and predicted based on evidence-based results [7].
    A properly functioning agricultural consulting system [8] is an extension of the
    technical outcomes proposed earlier. It is built with the aim of filling the information
    gap between farmers and agricultural knowledge workers (e.g., agricultural science
    and technology expansion personnel). A new framework for effective analysis of
    large-scale economics big data is selected based on its innovative decentralization
    capabilities to meet these challenges. In particular, the economic development
    of the framework [9] hides the patterns that select the economic aspect and the
    methods that integrate the economic model building. Developmental studies of utility
    and leisure farming are based on a current home, summary, and analysis of leisure
    tourism farming issues based on multifunctional agriculture and foreign perspective
    [10]. However, this development is not in line with regional uncertainty as climate
    change, soil, and irrigation factors are rare—reliable techniques such as implementing
    artificial intelligence requirements [11] to solve this problem. Traditional methods
    often involve the instinct of many people to fail. Therefore, it is necessary
    to use the Internet of Things (IOT) and machine learning techniques [12] for smarter
    Internet crop production methods. This is done by limiting the use of farm fertilizers,
    chemical fertilizers, such requirements as weather, suitable crops, soil types,
    rotation, moisture monitoring, analysis, control of precise dose parameters and
    You can select the type of crops involved in the realization, such as temperature
    for irrigation [13]. With the strength of plastic film ending [14], wasteful recycling
    of resources and effective governance can achieve an effective response to technological
    innovation in each city.Precision agriculture is a new rural cooperative healthcare
    system management method that [15] farmers capture and analyze data to implement
    with optimized inputs for best results. Explore batches of data analysis and design
    different predictive models. Furthermore, the straight, non-linear direct samples
    of the variables must be tested to accurately predict different regression models
    for different crops [16] for agricultural production forecasting. Big data technology
    is driving the entire economy, including the low-tech industry. For example, agriculture
    has realized a new technological paradigm under the banner of intensive cultivation
    [17]. User-centered agricultural ontology developed to publish quasi-static information
    and convert it into actionable information. Create a capacity-oriented breeding
    process with empowerment theory to motivate farmers to take action and summarize
    the situational information generated by transaction data [18]. The solution to
    this problem is to specialize in search results based on your interests and preferences.
    Furthermore, material web and multi-tool technology play an important role in
    adding web content [19]. 3. Materials and methods The crop yield forecast contains
    all the necessary parameters for crop yield iterations in big data source. In
    this proposed method toimprove the yield classification results. In general, the
    problem faced by all forecasting methods is that almost all the necessary parameters
    must be taken into account without considering the exact forecasting. It reduces
    the expected results due to the lack of proper forecasting of crop yields on turn
    leads. It''s hard to predict and is additional.Improved predictions should have
    their efficiencies taken into account in the prediction program within the range
    of enhanced input parameters. Crop Prediction is that the field before predicting
    crop yield and production yield does not occur. Pre-harvest forecasts are completed
    by considering the fields selected and the knowledge of the crop farmers. This
    work proposes a system of predicting data for use and processing strategies for
    analyzing the dataset. High yields of certain addressable crops are expected.
    Crop Prediction is that the field before predicting crop yield and production
    yield does not occur. Pre-harvest forecasts are completed by considering the fields
    selected and the knowledge of the crop farmers. This work proposes a system of
    predicting data for use and processing strategies for analyzing the dataset. High
    yields of certain addressable crops are expected. It includes a semi-input module,
    which accepts the responsibility of accepting the yield forecast sample input
    from the farmer. The input module contains a selected sample of offset crop name
    areas and functions that predict harvest year liability. Crop Details Choose from
    sub-attributes. Crop yield prediction models are used to predict yield. 3.1. Preprocessing
    Preprocessing data can be an important and extremely complex task in big data
    source. Yield information is needed for the development of Indian culture and
    heritage through agriculture and national food security. Occurrences in industries
    such as climate change, soil erosion, etc., my country''s gross domestic product,
    agriculture directly depend on the country. Ifthat fails agriculture and agriculture-dependent
    agriculture challenges, there are many. Sustainable agricultural development needs
    to balance industrial and national economic flows to maintain low inflation. Simulations
    of crop growth models help analyze crops under different manufacturing conditions
    to determine the proper crop environment. A crop growth model considers soil,
    water, climate, and many other factors, such as investigating crop growth. The
    pre-processing plays an important role in de-noising the field data through component
    reduction with a Pass Filtering algorithm. Input: Crop field dataset Output: Predicted
    weather yield for the experimental dataset are follow Step1: initialize the weights
    to small random values Data = dataset. random. init (low_integer,high_integer,size
    = number of random integer) Step2: randomly choose as input data dt Step3: here,
    dt is the total crop yield ky preprocessed data (1) The purpose of pre-processed
    data is to transform data into a properly formatted, and transformative, clean
    noise data, juice and consolidated data from various sources. Preprocessing involves
    extracting the features that correspond to the data range that combines the missing
    values. \\ Missing values and attributes are detected using the input data taken
    from the dataset. Although it is full of missing values, based on the correct
    values of previous achievements. The preprocessed data is used as an input advanced
    algorithmic Pass Filter. 3.2. Sequential Forward selection Crop forecasting plays
    an important role in weather yield forecasting, but as never known before, crop
    yield is an inevitable part of the prediction. Facility extraction should simplify
    the amount of data involved in representing large datasets. Soil and crop properties
    are in the final set of drills to be extracted from the pre-processing platform.
    These properties include the physical and chemical properties of the soil.Here,
    the feature of the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm (SFSA) has been used.
    SFSA selection is based on the feature entropy, an attribute with multiple entropy
    values selected as the key feature for yield prediction.Four rating scales were
    selected to express the performance of different models. 3.2.1. Absolute error
    Absolute error measurement is the magnitude of the error. This is the difference
    between the measured value and the “true” value. The formulation for the absolute
    error (Δa) is: (3) Where: ai is the amount, a is the true value. 3.2.2. Mean absolute
    error(MAE) Average Absolute Error Average Absolute has all errors. Formulation:
    (4) c = the amount of errors, Σ = summary symbol (which means “add them all up”),
    |xi – x| = the absolute errors. 3.2.3. Mean squared error(MSE) is: Number of MSE
    error vector samples the ratio of classes represents and defines two terms (5)
    3.2.4. Root mean squared error(RMSE) The Root Means Square Error (RMSE) represents
    the MSE square root. The RMSE residue (prediction error) is the standard deviation.
    The rest is a measure of how far a data point is from the regression line. How
    widespread is RMSE is a measure of these residues.In other words, it concentrates
    the data on the best fit line. The formula is: (6) x = forecasts (expected values
    or unknown results), y = observed values (known results). In the above formula,
    x^i is the predicted value, xi is the true value, and y is the average value.
    The MAE predictive value error is the average absolute error that can reflect
    the actual situation. The difference between the value of the MSE parameter rating
    and the value of the parameter that can be used to estimate the magnitude of changes
    in the smallest value of the prediction model with the best accuracy of the data
    is the square''s expected value. 3.3. Fuzzy Enumeration crop prediction algorithm
    based classification Fuzzy Enumeration Crop Prediction Algorithm (FECPA) is one
    of the most widely used and simplest classifications to solve problems.A FECPA
    is a graph made to sort and sort them based on their feature instances. A decision
    tree represents the instances where each node is classified and builds nodes and
    branches that represent the possible values for each branch. Inaccuracies and
    qualitative knowledge modeling and transmission and data processing uncertainty
    at different stages are possible by using fuzzy sets. The main focus of knowledge
    discovery in the database is identifying interesting patterns and describing them
    in a concise and meaningful way. Fuzzy sets rely on membership functions, primarily
    from a human perspective, so that agricultural decisions can be easily found using
    FECPA. (2) Here, in the formula, when r is any real number greater than 1, r and
    c represent rows and columns, respectively, μij is the degree of membership in
    j,xi and the ith of d-dimensional measurement data, cluster of ci is the d-dimensional
    center and ||* || are any specifications that express the similarity between any
    measured data and the center. The FECPA is used to classify the minimum and maximum
    values. 3.3.1. Maximum value and minimum value 3.3.1.1. Maximum value deffind_maxvalue
    (L): maxvalue = 0 for x in L: if x > maxvalue: maxvalue = x returnmaxvalue; 3.3.1.2.
    Minimum value deffind_minivalue (S): iflen(S) == 1: return S [0]  v1 = S [0]  v2
    = find_mini(S[1:]) if v1 > v2: return v1 else: return v2 FECPA provides low error
    rate probability and hierarchically arranged data. Basically, calculate in terms
    of the degree of attribution that the output device has a high probability or
    which data points are related to other data points and how high they are during
    the test. FECPA requires data point allocation in such a way that it obtains close
    relationships between similar data points as much as possible. 4. Result and discussion

    data crop analysis is characterized by many factors, such as crop yield, genetic
    pattern, environment, and interactions. Precise product forecasting products require
    a basic understanding of the process relationships between these interactive components
    and detailed databases and powerful techniques that reveal this relationship.These
    meteorological conditions have a direct impact on crop yield. Various studies
    have been conducted to explore the connection between large-scale climatic phenomena
    and crop yields. Data mining has proven to be a powerful tool for simulation and
    forecasting to improve its performance.Crop prediction methods are used to sense
    various soil parameters and predict suitable crops with air-related parameters.
    Reads are used as inputs to the model. FECPA provides acceptable estimation accuracy
    and higher prognostic capacity through parameters such as this year''s harvest,
    area, yield, and alternative variables such as climate, agricultural, and soil
    characteristics, such as model development.The analysis of crop yield prediction
    FECPA is to given thetime complexity 28.4 ms,and sensitivity value is 91.54%,
    and specificity 88.43%, the minimal feature set is 24.6%, analysis of accuracy

  description: Today, the world is rising in the field of technology and the basic
    need of human being is food, home, and cloths, which are directly or indirectly
    fulfilled by agriculture. Incorporation of technology with agriculture will increase
    the production and automation of process and reduce human intervention and efforts.
    There are lots of technologies that are helping us to improve the methods of agriculture
    such as intelligent system for weather forecasting and microcontroller-based equipment
    for automation of process and many more. These technologies have their advantages
    and also improving the production.Internet of things (IoT) is an emerging technology
    that incorporates intelligent system, cloud computing, and microcontroller itself.
    In this chapter, we will go through a deep drive about the things (sensors and
    actuators) that are connected with cloud system and the cloud computing platforms
    that are suitable to use for IoT projects with their features. In agricultural
    revolution, information technologies such as IoT, cloud computing, big data, and
    machine learning are playing a vital role. Different sensor modules such as soil
    sensor, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and many other sensors
    are useful for agri-culture science that measures the environment variables and
    water pump, pesticide sprinkler, cold/hot air blower, and temperature control
    units are the actuators for different types of indoor and outdoor crops. Microcontroller
    selection is the main challenge for implementation of IoT-based system. In this
    chapter, we will also cover different micro-controller and there uses as per application
    scope, power consumption, storage, and network connectivity and will implement
    IoT module on basil plant and collect the threshold data. There are different
    levels of IoT appli-cations and development methodology and IoT project design
    reference model. Depending on the levels of IoT application, we decide the location
    for storage unit and computational unit, and the design reference model is used
    make plan and prepare resources before developing and deploying an IoT system.
    Sensors and actuators are connected with microcontroller, sensor collects the
    environment data and sends to microcontroller that uses the network routers to
    transmit the data to the cloud through gateway nodes and then computational unit
    is responsible for triggering the action using actuator devices. Communication
    between microcontroller to storage and computational unit can be wired or wireless.
    There are a number of cloud platforms developed for IoT-based systems. Using cloud
    we connect the end user via mobile application, web application, or hardware controller.
    These applications provide user interface for monitoring the sensor data and also
    can trigger the actuators to perform action.

    plays a vital role mainly in developing countries for economy wellbeing; this
    is the main source of income, employment, and also, it plays a significant role
    in international trade because the most developed country is not engaging much
    in the agricultural activities; it provides the large source of revenue to the
    government by transportation (majority of trains and trucks carries the agriculture
    products; finally, a very main point is food security. Machine learning technology
    is an area of AI computer and is automatic data learning without human intervention;
    it has a greater impact on the global economy, especially machine learning made
    a huge difference in world trade mainly in communication barrier by making the
    availability of three hundred languages, banking and FinTech, (by making automatic
    communication with client and reduces the risk of abuse) and agriculture sector
    (crop management, soil management, livestock management, etc.). The research aims
    to project and review different machine learning models used in the field of agriculture;
    the paper also introduces different terminologies and abbreviations used in machine
    learning such as BM Bayesian models, DL deep learning. The paper will be helpful
    to get an outline of how machine learning can be used in agriculture, and what
    methods are available in machine learning, especially for the same field. The
    research explains the concept of machine learning and reviewed various machine
    learning techniques used in the agriculture field, to gain knowledge of AI techniques,
    and also, the paper aims to unfold the usage of IoT in agriculture to make a sustainable
    agriculture model. 1.1 Objective 1. To review various machine learning technology
    used in the agriculture field 2. To examine the application of the AI model for
    sustainable agriculture. 2 Literature Review The article is divided into two levels
    one—the explanation of algorithm limited to the field of agriculture, level two
    is segregated into three general categories; namely, crop management, water management,
    and soil management. Crop management is categorized into crop yield, crop quality,
    and weed and diseases detection; the research is searched in Scopus, Web of science
    also in pub med, article considered the period from 2000 to the current year.
    The article is structured as follows: part one explains the literature review
    of various machine learning models followed by reviews of crop management, water
    management, and soil management; part two applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in Sustainable Agricultural Practices are explained, part three discussion
    and conclusion. 3 Machine Learning In simple term, machine learning is a data
    which teach the computer human-like, and these data are known as training data,
    which makes human work accurate and easy and improves the experiences; data in
    machine learning will be in four categories, numerical data, categorical data,
    time-series data, text [1]; to measure the performances of ML, various statistical
    tools are used to predict the result (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Machine learning approach
    Full size image Machine learning is widely classified into supervised and unsupervised
    data, supervised data is manually trained data whereas unsupervised data is the
    machines interpretation. Refer Table 1. Table 1 Authors model Full size table
    3.1 Machine Learning Algorithm Models The machine learning algorithm is a code
    that runs on data and produces the decision-making output. The output or a result
    in a prediction made using the past experiences [2], e.g., in agriculture, weather
    prediction is made when the temperature is less than 17 degrees soil will get
    moist, and hence, it is not a good time to crop or yield, the research limit to
    unfold the explanation which is relevant to agriculture. 3.2 Supervised Learning
    Models—Regression Regression help to find out the relationship between two variable,
    and it is mainly used to predict the causal effect; regression is classified into
    typo types 1-single regression 2-multiple regression under which (i) linear regression
    (ii) non-linear regression is subcategorized in single the features, or variable
    will be one in case multiple variables; there will be more than one feature;,
    in machine learning regression has linear regression, polynomial, support vector,
    decision tree, random. 3.3 Classification-Bayesian Models (BM) In Bayesian models
    (BM), probability is used for the output result; the Bayesian model can be used
    both in classification and regression; some of the Bayesian model algorithms are
    Naive Bayes, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, the mixture of Gaussian, Bayesian network [3]
    (Pearl, Duda & Hart). 3.4 Artificial Neural Networks (ANNS) ANN is adopted and
    design similar to human brain neurons networks, which has an interconnection analyzing
    system or processing unit; the number of layers are arranged into (i) input layers
    (ii) hidden layers (iii) output layer [4]. A deep artificial neural network is
    also termed deep learning [5]. DL has multiple layers of processing data refer
    to Fig. 2; DL is a new algorithm in ML where data extraction is done by itself;
    this type of data is processed both in supervised, and unsupervised comprehensive
    deep learning is found in learning [6] research literature. Fig. 2 Applications
    of artificial intelligence and IoT in sustainable agricultural practices. Authors
    model Full size image 4 Machine Learning and Agriculture 4.1 Crop Management The
    method of training the machine and producing the decision is widely used for predicting
    the future; machine learning is simplified human thinking with break down the
    complexity of the problem with easy future decision-making result; in that way,
    agriculture plays a very important role in the global economy; global crop yielding
    is an important part to address for global food security, predict and reduce the
    climate changes [7]. Crop yielding forecast is a significant agricultural hitch.
    The yield depends on weather settings (rainfall, high temperature, etc.), pesticide.
    Precise information regarding the past crop yield is significantly in decisions-making
    related to managing agricultural risk Ali et al. [8]. According to [7] he classified
    the crop management into (i) Fruit picking and forecasting (ii) Automatic fruit
    picking model green citrus detecting the ingrown citrus; in this circumstances,
    machine learning will provided information for growth and help the farmer for
    maximum yield [9]. 4.2 Disease Detection The common treatment for disease plant
    is spraying chemical in the farm; the major advantage of ML is that in traditional
    method chemical pesticide is sprayed in the enter farm land in order to prevent
    the diseases, but in ML, the trackers are attached with camera and computer will
    detect the diseased crop and spray only in that area instead of spraying chemicals
    exactly. Another technique under disease detection is detection of parasites in
    strawberry and spray chemicals in the field. The method of screening the bakanae
    diseases in crops the is to detect the disease and optimize the maximum yield,
    in wheat crop, wheat is prominent source used worldwide found the health wheat
    canopies based on genetically super nature imaginary data; another study. Lastly
    [10] found the disease detection method using the algorithm with image sensory.
    Found the method in CNN-based algorithm with image sensors. 4.3 Weed Detection
    Weed is unwanted leaves grown, and it will take all the nutrients from the crops
    and plant; removing the weed is a major problem in agriculture; the first study
    of weed deduction in machine learning is found by Pantazi et al. [11] based on
    counter-based image sensor captured with drones (UAS) identify the Carduus marianus,
    and those were removed another study by Pantazi et al. [12] he categorized weed
    and main crop perfectly to be accurate in weed detection; lastly, the research
    reviews [13] weed detection by SVN in the plain crop. 4.4 Water Management Water
    plays a vital role in agriculture management; it is difficult by a traditional
    method due to accuracy in prediction in climatic changes also balance in agronomical;
    the paper explores in evaporate transpiration (it is a period between the absorption
    of water by land to atmosphere and by evaporating it other surface plants) of
    the daily and monthly forecast; this system will help farmers to manage and store
    the water and plant the field accordingly, Mehdizadeh et al. [14] in his research
    he found that dried and semi dried land evaporates faster and causes a climactic
    changes ,to read the data of those climactic change he set up the weather forecast
    station and collected the data. 4.5 Soil Management The soil is an important source
    for the continued existence on earth; the layer of the soil is used for planting,
    and other layers are used in soil fertility, microbes, etc., to predict climate
    change; soil temperature alone will play a major role in prediction. Firstly [15],
    the aim of the study is to find the soil dryness with data and evapotranspiration;
    the purpose of this study is to provide information for remote decision-making;
    another study done by Morellos et al. [16], he developed a self-evolution method
    which is called as SAE_ELM where the soil is tested with six different depth from
    5 to 100 cm; the aim of the study is accuracy in soil management. In agriculture
    AI, there are different model developed for managing farms (i) crops, (ii) water,
    (iii) soil management. Tables 2, 3, and 4 explain various models of AI in agriculture.

    learning method for soil management Full size table 4.6 Applicability of IoT and
    AI/ML in SSA practice Smart sustainable agriculture [SSA] is becoming a need of
    the hour. The present-day pollution due to the chemical-based production of crops
    is spoiling the environment. Not only the environment but also the health of human
    beings and the formal community is at risk. If this scenario continues in the
    existing period, the chances of the slowdown of the economy will upsurge. This
    is because to satisfy the need of the ever-increasing population; the government
    needs to import the food product from other countries of the world. Fortunately,
    the solution to this intense problem is known to the scientist. The applicability
    of modern technology to the field of agriculture can reduce the issue of pollution
    due to cultivation practice and will also lead to the availability of abundant
    food crops for the consumption of people. Artificial intelligence [AI] and machine
    learning [ML] along with the Internet of Things [IOT] can prove beneficial in
    reducing the adverse agriculture impact on the environment and people. Figure
    2 explains the model for sustainable agriculture by using AI, adopting the AI
    IOT model and implementing in the field of agriculture will increase the yield;
    Usage of IoT in agricultural field will reduce the labor work and labor cost requirement
    in the field. The above presentation of systematic layers is the essential component
    of SSA. The layers are described as follows: 1. Physical hardware and storage
    layer: This layer compromises of strong hardware required to store the virtual
    technology 2. AI and data management layer [DM]: This layer deals with various
    processes including in the segment of collection, from the SSA clouds. 3. Network
    layer: Networking between various components serves to fulfill the actual demand
    of the architecture. The networking panel uses the recent technologies to establish
    the connection of the flow of data from one aspect of the SSA model to other include
    Wi-Fi, Internet, and GSM/CDMA. 4. Security layers: AL algorithms are hindered
    in many cases by the security of the data inputs. The presentation layer will
    enable its functional capabilities in managing the dangers arising from malware,
    viruses, data theft related to all the SSA layers. In case of the absence of this
    layer, the entire process can give either defective conclusions or may altogether
    be unable to generate one. 5. Application layer: This comprises full or partial
    monitoring of the data flow and the implication of all the layers to the ultimate
    SSA layer. The data flow here is monitored using the integrated mechanism in agriculture
    applications including monitoring of cropping culture using a drone, disaster
    management, geographical area spread, potential acquaintance of area under cropping,
    and many more. 6. Internet of Things [IOT] and sensing layers: This is the most
    crucial layer applicable to the collection of data related to agricultural practices.
    It is using the sensor required to track the element directly or indirectly controlling
    the agriculture parameters such as sensor sensing humidity, moisture, temperature,
    and biological elements. 7. Domain SSA layer: The base layer around which all
    the layers are rotating. Various agriculture domains are included in this layer
    which has to be modified with the help of other layers. The growth of agriculture
    products in a sustainable manner is the need of the hour. Today all the possible
    experiments are carried out to come up with smart sustainable agricultural practices
    so that with putting pressure on existing natural resources and degrading the
    environment the cultivation period can be reduced along with the improvement in
    quantity, quality, volume, and variety of crops available for mass consumption.
    This can be achieved only with an integrated approach where IOT and AL/ML and
    be combined with SSA practices. 5 Discussion General discussion—total number of
    the article involved in the study is 40, the search thread covered the partial
    crop management and water management and soil management in the popular method
    used between period 2015–2021; all the methods are briefly discussed in tabulation
    format; it is slightly unlike to cover the entire paper; the review research is
    value to threat and validity [20]. Specific discussion—search strategy is thin
    downed with the relevant scope of the research; a manual search is done with using
    the word-like machine learning and yield prediction with Google scholar engine,
    Scopus, and Web of sciences exclusion category was made like publication in another
    language, article which is not available open-source, publication before the period
    2014; all those which comes before 2014 used for common algorithm terms for machine
    learning. The study discussed the sustainable agriculture model by introducing
    IoT (Internet of Things) which makes the study novel in nature, besides the study,
    reviews machine learning models until 2021 which fill the review gap of past literature.
    6 Conclusion There are many algorithm models are used; the paper summarizes eight
    models in which crop management has SVM, EM, least square regression, cluster,
    SOG/MOG, SVN for soil management models like IBM/KNN, SVM/LS-SVM, and ANN/SAE
    are used; finally, for water management, MARS, ANN/GRN ANN/ELM is reviewed. Machine
    learning is used in agriculture sector mostly in crop management predication in
    which majority study on crop yield prediction and diseases detections. Machine
    learning has shown a vast development in the field of agriculture sector like
    fruit picking, crop analysis from drones, and satellites with ninety-five percent
    accuracy weed eradication with digital imaginary camera and spraying the pesticides
    in the weed alone, real-time weather forecasting like seeing temperature, rainfall,
    and humidity with solar radiation; the prominent work ML can do to agriculture
    is autonomous tractors intelligent machines, decision-making with algorithms remote
    monitoring; the study shows that there is frequent usage of ANN, SVM for crop
    management as well as soil and water management, using machine learning in agriculture
    can develop the country as a whole for future study; the government scholar and
    experts should spread the usage of machine learning to real-time farmers and normalizing
    the machine learning like traditional study will save the farmers as well the
    impact of lands. References Grossman SR, Zhang X, Wang L, Engreitz J, Melnikov

    Introduction Big data can be defined as data that exceeds the storage capacity
    of the medium in which it is traditionally supposed to be housed. Numerous researchers
    proposed definitions and explanations that reflect the expansiveness of big data.
    From the literature studied in preparation of this study, the simplified primary
    characteristics of big data that distinguish it from ordinary data are, big data
    are data that are “too big,” “too fast,” and “too complex” [1–4]. Data that are
    “too big” relates to big data means data sizes in the realm of a terabyte, petabyte,
    zettabyte, etc. For a dataset to be considered big data, the dataset must have
    volume. An enormous amount of information is being generated from sources ranging
    from handheld devices to the Internet of Things systems. Video and audio streaming
    services, customer shopping patterns, search queries, Web site visits, satellite
    data, sensors data, and bank transactions are a few ways terabytes are generated
    daily. Logically speaking, all big data are datasets, but not all datasets are
    big [4]. Volume is just one of the characteristics of big data. Data from satellites,
    energy consumption readings from meters, the click-through rate of adverts, field
    sensor reading, etc., are generated almost in real time. Delay can be configured
    to enable delivery in batches, but such data can be useful when read in real or
    near real time or in streams. The speed of data generation is an important component
    in the classification of a dataset as big data. A more formal literal connotation
    is the velocity of data generation. With the ever-increasing barrage of devices
    generating data in different formats that are not the traditional alphanumeric
    representation of data, a new context of storage and analysis has to be devised.
    Video, audio, images, clicks, logs, etc., are unstructured datasets that cannot
    easily be organized in the conventional database management systems (DBMS). These,
    in turn, will make such data hard to organize and analyze. Even in structured
    datasets (easily representable in a DBMS), the algorithmic efficiency of traditional
    DBMS in analyzing datasets of great volume is very low [5]. A combination of structured,
    unstructured, and semi-structured characteristics of a dataset is a feature of
    big data. The above-elaborated characteristics are the most prominent recurring
    features that researchers in big data seem to have formed a consensus. Kitchin
    and McArdle [4] have suggested the inclusion of veracity (quality), volatility
    (rate of change), and value as part of the characterization of big data. Analytical
    processes are employed to derive important insight from big data. Application
    of statistical methods, data mining, artificial intelligence, natural language
    processing, predictive analytics models on big data to derive insights is termed
    big data analytics (BDA) [6]. The government uses BDA to draft policies that would
    have the widest impact and enhance processes and procedures. 2 Big Data Analytics
    At least, 2 exabytes of data are generated across all industries per day. 80%
    of that comes from IoT devices [7]. Also, with the increased proliferation of
    Internet access to more remote locations, FinTech services are increasingly being
    adopted. According to gartner.com, information gotten due to the adoption of Internet-enabled
    services could account for at least 60% of organizations'' overall human-related
    information assets. Such enormous data constitute an excellent justification for
    the adoption of BDA. Service providers can now develop customized services that
    are needed and will be adopted by demography due to the insights gotten from the
    analytics. Artificial intelligence and natural language processing have made BDA
    approachable to managers and less technical users alike. The increased ease in
    usage has a domino effect in its approachability, which in turn increases adoption.
    The increased awareness and discovery of creative application areas gradually
    change the narrative and increase confidence in BDA adoption across most portfolios
    [3, 8,9,10]. Some areas of examples of applications of BDA includes: Education:
    By adopting learning management systems, schools and institutions are increasingly
    leveraging big data technologies to monitor student engagement, teacher performance,
    track student''s performances, etc. Manufacturing: Sensors on automobile/aircraft
    engines monitor their state in real time, generating a huge amount of data. Determining
    the response to certain conditions and operations at different conditions, manufacturers
    optimize parts, discover other more efficient materials or create entirely new,
    more effective, and efficient engines. Due to the adoption of BDA, manufacturing
    processes are being enhanced; alternative materials are being discovered, and
    new alternative manufacturing methods are being developed. Government: Determining
    the individuals’ eligibility for social services, picking out projects for more
    significant economic gains, knowing the impact of certain policies are some of
    the ways governments have adopted or can adopt BDA into their operations. Insurance:
    Analyzing and predicting customers’ behavior through individuals’ social media
    profiles, CCTV footage, and GPS have greatly aided in fraud detection, management,
    and prevention. Claim management and tracking have been greatly enhanced through
    BDA. Transportation: Governments have successfully used BDA in traffic control,
    route planning, and congestion management. Private sector operators have incorporated
    BDA into logistics management and fleet management. Energy and Utilities: Incorporating
    smart meters into smart grids for energy generates lots of data almost in real
    time. Utility companies have used this data to forecast demand, schedule maintenance
    time, and perform general revenue forecasting. Healthcare: Healthcare providers
    like hospitals could predict patient volume and organize personnel shifts using
    big data. Personal historical health records are being used to hasten diagnosis
    and treatment. Also, DNA sequencing and analysis have been instrumental in developing
    personalized drugs or choosing the most effective treatment method based on the
    individuals’ genetic makeup. Agriculture: Data gathered from satellite imagery,
    GPS sensors, soil sensors, and other sources have greatly enhanced farming productivity.
    Information acquired is being used in pest control, efficient fertilizer application,
    yield prediction, etc. The above applications are by no means exhaustive. Innovative
    new areas of applications are on the rise. Due to the increasing incorporation
    of NLP, artificial intelligence, and machine learning, BDA is getting more accessible
    and easier to implement. 3 Methodology This study aims to identify accessible
    applications of big data in agriculture. Among the identified applications, those
    that could be quickly adopted, affordable, and have the most significant impact
    would be isolated and outlined. The incorporation of big data in agricultural
    practices requires acquiring some resource-intensive equipment and very technical
    procedures. These requirements are not tenable by smallholder farmers, and as
    such, governments, corporate bodies, and non-governmental organizations need to
    intervene and provide accessible interfaces for adoption. The study''s outcome
    could be used as a guide by policymakers and organizations trying to deploy big
    data services on a wider scale. To achieve the stated aim, the authors intend
    to review literature about factors affecting the yield of smallholder farmers
    and applications of big data in increasing yield. Yield maximization is the focus
    of this study. A review of other parts of the application of big data in the agricultural
    value chain can be the subject of further study. The primary demographical focus
    group is peasant farmers in developing countries with a preferential focus on
    Africa. The study’s subjects of interest include areas of intervention by the
    government to increase the farming yield of smallholder farmers, the applicability
    of big data in agriculture, affordability of big data services, and challenges
    to the adoption of BDA. The study intends to adopt a review methodology. Previous
    studies and research papers relating to the subject matter will be thoroughly
    reviewed. Findings from these studies will form the basis of analysis. Using both
    review outcome and deductive reasoning, the author intends to bring out a conceptual
    framework that outlines the findings that conform with the key constraints: affordability,
    accessibility, ease of use, and scalability. Continuous emission of greenhouse
    gases as a result of industrialization has severely altered climatic conditions
    globally. Temperature is on the rise year on year. According to the world meteorological
    organization, at least, one year between 2021 and 2025 will be the hottest on
    record. The impact of global warming varies across several regions. Drought, floods,
    and wildfires are a consequence of increasing temperature. Planting and harvesting
    seasons have all been impacted by the erratic nature of ecological phenomena due
    to global warming. In sub-Saharan Africa, wet seasons come late, and rainfall
    is erratic [11]. As a result, farmers find it hard to pick the right time to plant
    crops. Any wrong timing could result in poor yield at the end of the season. Increased
    rainfall is an enigma to flood-prone areas. All farm management processes like
    fertilizer application performed on the farm will be of no consequence in flooding.
    Weather and seasonal advisory could help in anticipating and making efforts to
    mitigate the impact of the flood. According to Che et al. [12], high temperatures
    weaken the biological defense systems of plants, making plants more susceptible
    to diseases. Such conditions also encourage mutations of diseases that are resistant
    to previous preventive measures. Adverse temperature also affects pests and pest
    control. A decrease in food availability has forced previously less harmful pests
    to seek alternative sources of nourishment. Increased evaporation and little rainfall
    have increased drought incidences across the West Africa sub-region [11]. The
    amount of rain falling on some of the driest regions cannot sustain plant growth.
    As a result, farmers in such areas have to either change the type of crops they
    produce or change livelihood entirely. The above-outlined outcomes are some of
    the ways global warming has impacted crop yield. Stopping or reducing global warming
    is a subject of intense debate and is not easy to handle. Intense research is
    presently ongoing on how to reduce emissions and find alternate sources of energy.
    On the small-scale farming stage, mitigative methods against the impact could
    be implemented by adopting and incorporating technology into farming and farming
    processes. The advanced predictive analysis could forecast the amount of rainfall
    that could fall within a season, the particular timing of the start of a season,
    the possibility of flood within the season. Also, possible is estimating the nutrient
    needs of the crops, preventing diseases, determine the fertilizer needs and location
    on the farm, the right time to harvest, and many other factors. Geographic information
    systems (GISs), remote sensing, IoT device deployment, drones, and satellite imagery
    are some technologies that could help small-scale farmers mitigate the impact
    of global warming and increase crop yield [13]. Data from all these technologies
    could be captured and analyzed using BDA processes, and the insight generated
    would be used for farmer training and process adjustments. 4 Proposed Conceptual
    Framework Setting the needed infrastructure for the data-gathering process and
    techniques above is capital intensive. The majority of the farmers in the sub-Saharan
    region of Africa are either illiterate or semi-literate [14]. These are major
    constraints when interacting with the platform or setting up an independent platform.
    The poor economic condition of the region invariably implies that most of these
    farmers are financially incapable of independently implementing these systems.
    However, with the intervention of relevant organizations, such facilities could
    be implemented and an interface provided for the farmers to interact with the
    system. The design of such a system should be so that it requires little training
    to interact with it. Tseng et al. [13] proposed an IoT solution for monitoring
    farm data. It comprises sensors monitoring environmental variables in real time,
    and an embedded system transmits the data, cleaned, stored, and analyzed using
    a custom-made system. All components involved in making the system are cheaply
    available. The sensors could easily be used as an expansion to increase the variables
    that the system could measure. Such systems are increasingly becoming popular
    in the world’s regions with higher literacy rates and financial stability. Also,
    apart from the DIY-styled systems, ready-made solutions exist that could be bought
    and installed directly [13]. Insights derived from data analysis from these systems
    are more reliable because of the specificity of information relating to the different
    farms adopting it. However, farmers in the sub-Saharan region of Africa have neither
    the technical ability nor the financial capacity to develop these systems. Despite
    the advantages of these systems, it does not fit into the constraints in this
    study. Implementing these systems as a form of intervention for smallholder farmers
    in the region will not be financially wise. Geospatial data generated by satellites
    gives insight into the environmental conditions used in agriculture and agricultural
    practices (Weersink et al. 2018). Climatic patterns are observed using satellite
    imagery, which can form the basis of disaster prediction and emergency planning.
    Satellite imagery analysis has been used in predicting pest and disease outbreaks,
    amount of rainfall, the state of crops on the farm, etc. Such information is being
    used in precision agriculture to determine the specific water requirement in irrigation,
    the fertilizer needs of sections on farms, estimate harvest times, predict crop
    yield, etc. Drones and specialized aircraft have also been deployed to enhance
    precision or as an alternative to the deployment of satellites. Drone adoption
    for other purposes such as pesticide and fertilizer application has become popular.
    The popularity could be traced to the increasing affordability of drone technology.
    The addition of specialized cameras and sensors could transform the drone into
    a significant data source for BDA. Geographical mapping based on the analysis
    of data gathered from remote sensing could be used as an advisory for the type
    of crops to plant on each mapped area. Following these guidelines, farmers can
    be confident that the types of crops they are growing are the type that is suitable
    for that area. Doing so will result in a good yield at the end of the farming
    season. Nigeria’s government has invested in about five satellite so far (one
    ill-fated) (NSRDA). Two of those are for weather monitoring and disaster prediction.
    According to WMO, satellites for weather and disaster prediction are equipped
    with remote sensing capability. Though the data obtained are for monitoring weather,
    it could be used for agricultural purposes. NigeriaSat-2 can cover two-fourth
    of the West Africa sub-region (NSRDA). The ministry of agriculture or other corporate
    entities could be given access to the data generated by the satellites. The application
    of BDA processes on the data could reveal valuable insights that the smallholder
    peasant farmers need. Due to the potential for wide-area coverage, remote sensing
    data gathering is a suitable technology for helping farmers enhance crop yield.
    Remote sensing data are reliable due to the semi-real-time nature of the data.
    Insights delivered through user interfaces could be affordable for the farmer
    on a larger scale. A weather station serves as a data-gathering point for a large
    land area that could comprise several farms (Rao 2018). Areas under the coverage
    of weather stations could be joined to form clusters. Such clusters could be interconnected
    or connected to a central station that analyzes the field data. Clusters could
    be as large as a state or as vast as a country. Given each cluster’s potentially
    large coverage area, the number of stations to be built will be relatively small.
    Temperature variations, pressure, moisture content, humidity, and other vital
    environmental factors that affect plant growth are monitored [15]. Analyzing the
    data using BDA could give insights into the area’s potential to produce a good
    yield. Insights could be delivered to the farmers using Web interfaces, mobile
    applications, SMS, or in-person delivery. Tokens given by farmers to gain access
    to the insights are a great motivator for investors. Governments could also invest
    in the infrastructure to increase farmers’ yield, which has a domino effect that
    could reduce poverty and a high tax-paying percentage of the citizens. Weather
    station data gathering means are affordable, less capital intensive, sustainable,
    and insights will be very reliable due to its closeness to the farms [16]. 5 Conclusion
    The conceptual framework developed can serve as a policy guide for the deployment
    of BDA in agriculture. Setting up the mechanisms starts with acquiring the necessary
    data-gathering infrastructure by governments or other financially capable institutions.
    Areas to be monitored are identified and the infrastructure deployed. Central
    BDA stations should be set up to receive data from the data-gathering systems
    installed on the field or deployed in space. The component systems of the BDA
    stations contain data processing and analysis packages such as Hadoop, MapReduce,
    artificial intelligence, Apache Spark, and natural language processing systems.
    Insights from the BDA are accessed by a host of interface back end-deployed applications
    on a server. For the intended user, the farmer, to have access to the insights,
    front-end interfaces are deployed. API and SMS gateway could be adopted as the
    channel by which the front-end interface retrieves data from the back end. Insights
    are delivered to the farmer on a smartphone, feature phone, or both depending
    on the coverage and preference. For extremely remote locations, however, GSM infrastructure
    might be lacking. In these situations, agricultural extension workers could be
    deployed for on-the-field information sessions. References Madden, S.: From databases

    is critical to human life. Agriculture provides a means of subsistence for a sizable

    work opportunities for inhabitants. Many farmers prefer traditional farming approaches,
    which result in low yields. Agriculture and related industries are vital to the

    waste possible. 1. Introduction Agriculture is essential to the nation’s economy
    because it feeds the whole population. It links and interacts with all of the
    country’s relevant enterprises in this regard. A country is considered socially
    and economically prosperous if it has a relatively large agricultural base. In
    most countries, agriculture is the primary source of employment. Wide farms usually
    require the hiring of additional laborers to assist with planting and the treatment
    of farm animals. Most of these major farms have nearby processing plants where
    their agricultural products are finalized and developed [ 1]. During humanity’s
    civilization, significant innovations have been made to boost agricultural productivity
    with fewer resources and human effort. Smart farming is a term that refers to
    the well-known and better approach to farm management that has become popular
    in modern agriculture. Crop health and production are monitored via the use of
    agricultural and information technologies, which include monitoring field crop
    condition and associated indicators. Ultimately, the objective of smart farming
    is to reduce the cost of agricultural inputs while still maintaining the quality
    of the end product. Fertilizers and insecticides have typically been applied in
    bulk and at a fixed pace, with the whole field being treated as a single unit
    of treatment. Despite this, the high population rate has never enabled demand
    and supply to meet during these periods. According to estimates, the global population
    will reach 9.8 billion in 2050, up around 25% of the current total [ 1]. Developing
    countries are expected to account for nearly all of the population growth stated
    [ 2]. On the other hand, urbanization is expected to intensify, with 70 percent
    of the world’s population expected to be urban by 2050 (up from 49 percent today)
    [ 3]. Furthermore, income levels will be many times higher than they are now,
    driving up food demand, particularly in developing countries. As a result, these
    countries will be more conscious of their diet and food quality. As a result,
    consumer preferences may shift away from wheat and cereals and toward legumes
    and, eventually, meat. Food production should quadruple by 2050 to feed this larger,
    more urban, and wealthier population [ 4, 5]. In particular, the current annual
    wheat production of 2.1 billion tones should increase to almost 3 billion tones,
    and yearly meat production should increase by more than 200 million tones to meet
    the demand of 470 million tones [ 6, 7]. Currently, crop planting is low, so many
    farmers prefer to employ conventional methods. Consequently, producers, governments,
    agricultural scientists, and academia are exploring innovative ways to increase
    agricultural land production. Environmental causes such as water, plants, and
    climate change impact them. The production of crops is mostly based on soil fertility.
    As a result, classifying and increasing the availability of low-nutrient crops
    for quality crops is critical [ 2]. It is tough to produce quality crops since
    soil fertility determines most of the crop productivity. In addition, the detection
    and optimization of inadequate nutrition content are required to achieve the aim.
    Disease detection in crop leaves is difficult. If it is diagnosed at the right
    time, associated pesticides may be used to suppress the disease. Crops are often
    harmed by a shortage of primary nutrients. As a result, it is essential to use
    fertilizers of the proper nature. Farmers have a rough time gathering soil nutrient
    statistics, water nutrient information, groundwater level, environmental conditions,
    and seasonal crop data concerning their farmland. Furthermore, they are having
    difficulty making better decisions based on the facts available to them. Many
    modern farms and farming-related industries make good use of modern machinery
    as well as scientific and technological principles. Many farmers are unaware that
    soil research has little useful information about their soil. Soil test reports
    allow farmers to choose the appropriate fertility and learn how to apply fertilizer
    based on soil requirements. Excessive fertilizer application is occasionally one
    of the most serious issues in the agricultural domain [ 3]. This necessitates
    correction by soil fertility analysis. Furthermore, for safe crop development,
    it is critical to identify the time of delivery, form, and quantity of fertilizers.
    Farmers also should not understand environmental conditions when selecting crops.
    It is also difficult to diagnose diseases in leaves. This results in a bad yield.
    What are the current concerns of farmers and agriculturists? The use of technology
    in agriculture can overcome most of the problems related to modern agriculture.
    In particular, the use of the Internet of Things concept, machine learning, and
    cloud storage results in providing solutions to most of the problems. 2. Literature
    Survey 2.1. Decision Support Systems in Agriculture Data generation methods for
    farm management systems, such as pesticide control, field management, and crop
    management, are employed by decision support systems (DSS) [ 4]. The effectiveness
    of these devices is weak. This might improve farmers’ decision-making processes
    on crop fertilization by using modern IoT-based solutions. Many researchers have
    analyzed data mining approaches with restricted cases. The Soil Water Balance
    decision system model takes into consideration several aspects, including the
    soil condition, temperature, channel network, and cultivation quality. Synthesis
    of Crop Environment (CERES) Wheat, which forms part of DSSAT, was deployed effectively
    in the semiarid and subtropical areas of Punjab for five crop seasons from 2000-2001
    to 2003–2005 in order to cater for wheat crop development and advancement under
    nitrogen, varying climatic conditions, and water. In Indian agriculture, the success
    of the DSS consultative is highly crucial. e-Sagu is a DSS service given under
    Media Labor, Asia, by IIIT, Hyderabad. It promotes improvement in farmhouse productivity
    by disseminating first-rate farmhouse informative agroexpert decisions in a sensible
    behavior of all farmhouse operations at the farmers’ doorsteps. This advice was
    given during all stages of seed cultivation, starting with the crop sowing stage
    and ending with the harvesting stage, and it reduced crop growing costs while
    increasing farmhouse yield with the excellence of agricultural products [ 6].
    2.2. Big Data Analytics in Agriculture Big data analysis is the process of processing
    massive volumes of data in order to uncover hidden patterns, unpredictable correlations,
    industry dynamics, customer preferences, and other types of useful business intelligence.
    Theoretical findings may lead to successful promotion, new income opportunities,
    better farming preparation, improved grower efficiency, competitive advantages
    over competitors, and other economic benefits. Throughout this generation, the
    agricultural sector must develop decision-making processes that can take advantage
    of large increases in data and knowledge from a variety of different sources,
    including soil, crops, weather, and farm management systems [ 7]. Thombare et
    al. [ 8] sought to gain insight into crop yield forecasting through big data research
    while also recognizing the socioeconomic problems involved. The analysis of this
    massive amount of data is focused on K-means clustering methods to determine which
    farming methods are better for the particular area and estimate yield using Apriori
    algorithms. This useful knowledge was once again given to farmers in order to
    improve crop yields and promote organic farming. In huge data sets with a Hadoop-based
    neural network, Victoria et al. [ 9] offered a comparable and decentralized computing
    paradigm for function discovery. They used an artificial neural network frame
    in Hadoop YARN for the implementation of five selection algorithms for attributes.
    The Hadoop binary relational memory network is combined with stability and versatility
    to identify the optimum attribute selector for quick identification of appropriate
    qualities from different and high-dimensional dimension data sets. Lin [ 10] implemented
    the MapReduce representation in Hadoop, thus using the Apriori data mining algorithm.
    In general, Association Rules algorithms compute rule scarcity when working with
    a large number of attributes. This problem is solved by the proposed MR-Apriori
    algorithm. A good crop recommendation system has been developed by Priya et al.
    [ 11]. A Naive Bayes MapReduce classifier was used to offer recommendations to
    farmers for the crop, especially for agriculture in the Telangana area. The equipment
    is adaptable so that different crops may be evaluated. Using a yield chart may
    establish the ideal period for planting, plant growth, and harvesting. Farmers
    are given an accurate agricultural model to inform them of which crop they can
    grow on the ground. Suryanarayana et al. [ 12] created a framework that uses historical
    weather data from an area and analyzes it using the MapReduce and Hadoop methods.
    Many important sectors that are influenced by the climate, such as agriculture,
    air travel, water supply, and tourism, will benefit from weather forecasting.
    Weather forecasting is a branch of meteorology that involves gathering data from
    different sources about the current state of the weather, such as rainfall, temperature,
    wind, and fog. In the Internet of Things age, the meteorological department uses
    various types of sensors to determine humidity and temperature, among other things.
    MapReduce technology is used to efficiently analyze weather data using distributed
    algorithms. The advantage of using Map Reduce with Hadoop is that it can speed
    up data collection in an environment where the amount of data is growing by the
    day. The only way to determine the important features in a data set is by feature
    selection. It has a high accuracy rating and takes less time to complete. Several
    scholars have developed feature selection algorithms. Recent research studies
    have established numerous data mining methods that have been used for the study
    of agricultural and biological datasets, resulting in valuable classification
    patterns [ 13]. Chouhan et al. [ 14] proposed a new way for the extraction of
    features from a dataset utilizing the PSO-SVM methodology and the fuzzy categorization
    of decisions trees. This proposed strategy was used for the datasets of Mushroom
    and Soja. The experimental results show that the methodology provided exceeds
    existing accurate techniques. The key characteristics contribute to wheat grain
    production as determined by the controlled feature selection algorithm [ 15].
    472 Iranian fields with a unique set of 21 features have been selected for the
    feature selection phase. As a result of the vast variety of characteristics chosen,
    the results demonstrated that the systems had greater stability. Villacampa [
    16] compared feature selection approaches such as knowledge gain, correlation-based
    feature collection, relief-F, wrapping, and hybrid methods for reducing the number
    of features in data sets. Three general classification algorithms (Decision Trees,
    K-Nearest Neighbor, and Support Vector Machines) were used as classifiers to evaluate
    the efficiency of the aforementioned methods. The relief-F system outperformed
    all other methods of choosing functions, according to the data. Ru and Kruse [
    17] suggested a novel application of a feature collection approach based on agricultural
    data. The approach included a comprehensive set of features as well as a complete
    selection technique. To associate the outcomes of the various data sets with the
    yield projection, two regression models (SVR and RegTree) were used. Both the
    regression models, SVR and RegTree, generated experiments that were significantly
    different but also comparable. Nonetheless, on the one hand, both models returned
    understandable and explainable function scores while, on the other hand, offering
    a new understanding of the data sets and their functions. 2.3. Soil Classification
    in Agriculture Gholap et al. [ 18] predicted soil fertility using a decision tree
    algorithm. They used attribute collection and boosting techniques to improve the
    efficiency of the J48 decision tree algorithm after collecting a dataset from
    a private soil testing laboratory in Pune. J48 is a Java version of the C4.5 algorithm
    that is open source. It is a mathematical classifier built on the Id3 algorithm,
    which is commonly used in machine learning. It is based on the idea of information
    entropy. C4.5 produces a decision tree in which each node divides the groups according
    to the knowledge gained. As the separating criterion, the attribute with the highest
    normalized knowledge gain is used. They forecasted soil fertility and graded it
    as extremely poor, very high, low, high, moderate, or relatively high. They also
    increased the accuracy ratio to 96.73 percent by using a selection and boosting
    algorithm. Ghosh and Koley [ 19] proposed a new approach to soil property analysis
    that is centered on neural networks for supervised learning and backpropagation.
    This research was mainly due to the effects of soil qualities such as organic
    matter, key plant nutrients, and micronutrients on crop development and to the
    determination of their percentage using the method above. These parameters are
    extremely expensive to calculate directly. The findings showed that the proposed
    approach successfully forecasted the soil parameters. The links between large-scale
    meteorological conditions and agricultural yield were examined by Dahikar and
    Rode [ 20]. The main simulation and prediction approaches for improving their
    accuracy have been created for artificial neural networks. The crop forecasting
    methodology employs the artificial neural network to predict the correct harvested
    process by detecting soil and environmental characteristics such as soil shapes,
    PHs, phosphates, phosphates, potassium, organic coal, calcium, magnesium, sulphur,
    manganese, copper, iron, depth, temperature, precipitation, and humidity (ANN).
    Kaur et al. [ 21] addressed agricultural data mining technology and practices.
    Data mining techniques such as K-means, K-Nearest Neighbor, Artificial Neural
    Networks, and Support Vector Machines are used in recent data mining approaches.
    They investigate the crop price forecasting problem. This has been a major agricultural
    concern in recent years, and it can only be resolved with the knowledge that is
    currently available. They discovered suitable knowledge models that aided in achieving
    high precision and generality in price prediction. A robot might be used to keep
    food and warehouses secure, which could be beneficial. Managing a huge warehouse
    may be exhausting, and food is often left unattended, which can result in contamination
    of the product. Robots may also be employed to guard warehouses against intruders,
    even in the most difficult of circumstances, according to the manufacturer. Utilizing
    this kind of robot would not only save money but also help to maintain the integrity
    and quality of a meal, which would help to assure food safety [ 22]. With computer
    vision, it is possible to accomplish food safety and security that is automated,
    nondestructive, and cost-effective. Extensive research has been done to determine
    how effective it is in the assessment and classification of fruits and vegetables.
    An overview of the most current innovations in the food business is provided as
    well as information on the critical components of image processing technology.
    In this paper, the various components of a computer vision system are discussed
    in further depth. In order to prevent food-borne disease and ensure food security,
    rapid and precise detection of hazardous bacteria is essential for public safety
    biomonitoring. Various ways of detecting microorganisms have been developed throughout
    time [ 23]. 3. Methodology A framework for smart crop tracking and monitoring
    is presented in this section. Sensors, IoT devices, cameras, mobile apps, machine
    learning, and big data analytics are major parts of this framework. Hardware includes
    Arduino Uno, multiple sensors, and Wi-Fi devices. Frameworks in Figure 1 consist
    of the following components: Arduino Uno: this board [ 24] features Wi-Fi, Ethernet,
    a USB port, micro-SD card space, and three reset catches in addition to an MCU
    ATMega 32u4 with Arduino compatibility. The board may also connect to an Atheros
    AR9331 to run Linux. DHT11/DHT22 humidity sensor: this is a humidity and moisture
    sensor. It is used to continuously assess the humidity and moisture levels on
    land. This sensed data is stored in the cloud via Arduino Uno [ 25]. YL-69 soil
    moisture sensor: this sensor is used to determine the water content of the soil.
    It is widely used in farming, water systems, greenhouses, and other research center
    applications that demand precise estimates of water levels in the soil. It is
    divided into two sections: an electrical board that holds the hardware and a test
    that measures dirt mugginess. The sensor operates by establishing a potential
    distinction that corresponds directly to the dielectric permittivity of water.
    Voltage variations can be translated as changes in dielectric permittivity and
    hence as changes in water levels [ 26]. Camera: it is used to capture cropped
    images and store those images into cloud storage via an IoT Arduino Uno board.
    Cloud storage: all crop-related images are stored in the cloud for further analysis
    using an SVM classifier. Soil-related details are also stored in the cloud for
    further analysis using a K-means classifier. For disease detection in crops, the
    SVM classification algorithm is used. Images related to crops are collected into
    the cloud using cameras and Arduino Uno. Then image preprocessing and feature
    extraction are executed. Then these images are classified using the SVM algorithm.
    Then the disease is predicted on the basis of a previously available training
    data set as soil details of a particular form are also available in the system.
    Then, on the basis of detected and soil quality, the system suggests the type
    and quantity of pesticides that can be used to avoid damage to crops. Mobile application:
    results are made available to farmers using a mobile application. Farmers will
    register on a mobile application, and they can see all the details related to
    their land and crops.    Figure 1  An IoT-based framework for smart farming. 4.
    Machine Learning Algorithm 4.1. Support Vector Machine Approach A support vector
    machine (SVM) is a comprehensive supervised learning approach, which is generally
    deployed for mostly solving two-class categorization problems. Besides, the SVM
    can also be utilized for analyzing the data for classification and regression
    scenarios. Further, SVM employs the kernel phenomenon for transforming the data,
    and then, depending upon these transformations, it determines an optimal borderline
    among the likely outcomes. Moreover, the decision boundary between the two classes
    on a graph needs to be widespread. SVM builds an optimal borderline that splits
    the new data point and assigns it to the correct category. Therefore, this optimal
    borderline is also known as the hyperplane [ 26]. The complexity of logistic SVM
    is as follows: n = number of training examples, K = number of support vectors,
    and d = dimensionality of the data. 4.2. Logistic Regression The method used to
    relate a dependent variable to one or more independent variable is logistic regression.
    The dependent variable is sometimes called predictors, and predictors are called
    the independent variable. Plant type prediction (c) is variable based on temperature
    and humidity disparity. Thus, soil moisture and pH rate are variable independent.
    The formula that has been established is The complexity of logistic regression
    is as follows: where n is the number of training examples and d is the dimensionality
    of the data. 4.3. Random Forest Random forests are a collection of tree predictors
    in which each tree is based on the values of a self-sampled random variable with
    the same distribution across all forest trees. The generalization error in the
    forest converges as the number of trees in the woods is at an all-time high [
    27]. A tree classifier forest’s generalization error depends on the strength of
    the specific forest trees and their comparison. Using a random selection of features
    to separate each node produces error rates that are more stable in terms of noise.
    Internal measurements calculate variance, frequency, and consistency, and these
    are used to show the response to increase the number of characteristics used in
    the splitting. External measurements are also used for parameter importance estimation.
    Specific ideas apply to regression as well [ 28]. The complexity of random forest
    is as follows: where k is the number of decision trees, n is the number of training
    examples, and d is the dimensionality of the data. 5. Result Analysis A data set
    of 500 images was created for the experimental study. This data set contains images
    related to mango leaf. 135 images had disease, and 365 images were normal images.
    In experimental analysis, three classification algorithms, namely, SVM-Support
    Vector Machine, logistic regression, and random forest classifiers, are used.
    To calculate accuracy, the following formula was used: where TP denotes True Positive,
    TN denotes True Negative, FP denotes False Positive, and FN denotes False Negative.
    The results proved that the accuracy of the SVM classifier is better than the
    random forest and logic regression algorithm. The accuracy values for these classifiers
    are shown in Table 1 and are represented through graphs in Figure 2. The graphical
    representation of the accuracy is shown in Figure 3. Also, other efficiency parameters
    like precision and recall values for these classifiers are shown in Figures 4
    and 5, respectively. Table 1  Accuracy of machine learning algorithms.    Figure
    2  Accuracy of classifiers.    Figure 3  Graphical representation of accuracy
    results of machine learning algorithms.    Figure 4  Precision of classifiers.    Figure
    5  Recall of classifiers. In this graph, SVM exceeds random forest and logistic
    regression in terms of Machine Learning Algorithm accuracy. The accuracy of SVM
    is higher than 95%, but random forest and logistic regression accuracy are less
    than 75%. 6. Conclusion The main challenges for agriculture production are decision-making,
    crop selection, and supporting systems to increase crop yield. Agriculture forecasting
    is dependent on natural factors such as temperature, soil fertility, water volume,
    water quality, seasons, and crop prices. Growing developments in agricultural
    automation have resulted in the massive production of tools and applications for
    obtaining fast knowledge. Everyone, including growers, is increasingly using mobile
    devices. A framework for smart crop tracking and monitoring is presented in this
    paper. Sensors, IoT cameras, mobile apps, and big data analytics are all included.
    A framework for disease detection in crops is proposed. This is based on SVM classification.
    It detects disease in crops and suggests suitable pesticides on the basis of previously
    available soil data of a particular land. 6.1. Future of Work This product is
    meant to tell farmers to take action right away. However, there is still a lot
    of work that needs to be done in the near future. The ESP32’s node MCU has both
    wireless Wi-Fi and Bluetooth capabilities built in. We could not make more prototypes
    because we did not have enough money. In big farmlands with a lot of different
    crops, farmers can install many prototypes like this that will be on a local network,
    connected by Bluetooth, and have a single main node that will gather data and
    send it to the cloud. Drone technology is also being looked into. By attaching
    this system to drones, it will be possible to map farmland in 3D, as well as keep
    an eye on crop production and life conditions. With the help of the GSM module
    and IoT SIM card on our laptops, we can connect this whole system to the Soracom
    Lagoon dashboard for even more in-depth analysis. As a result, smart farming has
    a bright future ahead of it. This industry has the power to change the world with
    the help of the right technology and government incentives. Data Availability

    With the increase in the global population, the agricultural sector is forced
    to use high amounts of fertilizers to produce more food while food prices are
    rising. These factors threaten global food security and a solution must be found.
    Forecasting year-to-year variability in the yields of major crops is expected
    to be useful in strengthening the ability of societies to better respond to food
    production difficulties and food price spikes influenced by climate extremes [1].
    Also, to increase food production, the agricultural sector is obliged to apply
    large amounts of fertilizers, which may adversely affect the environment [2].
    A more important issue than production is the optimal allocation and economic
    return of consumption inputs. It is not enough to increase the efficiency of input
    consumption from the economic point of view. Instead, farmers should provide a
    decent income for each unit of input [3]. Improving crop yield production and
    quality while reducing operating costs and environmental pollution is a key goal
    in precision agriculture [4]. Usually, farmers continue to use a given input until
    the income from the consumption of each unit equals the cost of consuming it [5].
    Yield prediction is an essential research topic for optimizing the use of different
    inputs, as it has an equally important point of reference for farm management
    during planning, agrotechnological intervention, and preharvest processes [6].
    However, the relationship between yield and high inputs values (such as water
    and nitrogen fertilizer) follows the law of diminishing returns. Different NPK
    fertilizer treatments can be used to affect maize yield during the relatively
    short growth of the crop. Of the different cereals, maize has considerable importance
    due to its high genetic diversity, ease of planting, growing, and harvesting,
    control of erosion and weeds, lower expectations for soil nutrients, high sugar
    content, and high starch content in comparison with other crops [7,8,9]. Grain
    yield is highly dependent on fertilizer consumption, due to the fact that chemical
    fertilizers are the fastest way to compensate for soil nutrient deficiencies.
    As a result, high yields have expanded significantly today, in many cases due
    to fertilizers [10]. In the last 40 years, the FAO has estimated that a 33 to
    60 percent increase in crop yields is due to chemical inputs, with fertilizer
    as the key to food security. However, the excessive use of chemical fertilizers
    destroys the physical and chemical properties of the soil [11,12]. Researchers
    have reported an increase in grain yield due to NPK fertilizers as a result of
    the plant’s greater access to nutrients. It has been shown that the mineralization
    of soil organic matter alone cannot fully meet the plant’s nutritional needs [13,14,15,16,17,18].
    Other researchers have reported an increase in the quantitative and qualitative
    properties of maize under the influence of NPK chemical fertilizers. Researchers
    reported that increasing the amount of fertilizer from 0 to 120% of the recommended
    amount in NPK fertilizer composition can be optimized during the growing period.
    Increasing the amount of fertilizer application efficiency causes increasing maize
    yield [19,20,21,22,23,24]. Phosphorus is one of the least active elements in the
    soil and can be fixed quickly on soil particles, which means they need appropriate
    phosphorus methods to ensure that it is available to the plant [25]. Consumption
    of potassium and trace elements increased grain protein percentage, cob length,
    cob diameter, and maize plant height [26]. Increasing nutrients as much as possible
    and improving plant performance per unit area can increase the productivity of
    nutrients by affecting the efficiency of absorption, leading to increased yield
    or dry matter per nutrient consumed. Conversely, researchers have reported increasing
    phosphorus utilization reduces its efficiency and productivity [27]. Additive
    Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis and multiplicative
    interaction analysis model provide a powerful tool for analyzing and interpreting
    large genotype matrices in the environment. The AMMI method combines ANOVA and
    PCA methods that calculate both the sum effect and the multiplicative effect.
    In this method, based on the additional linear model, the effect of genotype and
    environment is estimated using analysis of variance, then using principal component
    analysis, the amount of genotype is separated from the interaction in the environment
    (GE to the main components, justifying the interaction and the number of Residues
    or noise). In the AMMI model, genotypes and environments are localized and displayed
    on the biplot, simplifying the inference about the specific interaction of genotypes
    and environments [28,29]. The main objective of this study was to identify the
    stability of hybrids and optimized fertilizer treatments based on the multiverse
    method analysis during adaptability in precision farming systems. Furthermore,
    this study helps to clarify the interrelation-ship between the use of fertilizers
    and the yield potential of the different maize hybrids, providing hybrid- and
    site-specific precision nutrient management strategies for sustainable agriculture.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Site Description and Experimental Design The experiment
    was performed at the Látókép Crop Production Experiment Site of the University
    of Debrecen, Hungary. The site was located in the eastern part of the country,
    15 km from Debrecen in the Hajdúság loess region. This study is part of a 38-year-old
    multifactorial fertilization field experiment [30], performed to include two sources
    of fertilizer (Table 1) in ten maize hybrids (Table 2) in four replications in
    3 consecutive years (2018–2020). Sowing was performed in April. Irrigation was
    applied under rain-fed conditions, and the daily rainfall sum was measured (Figure
    1). Rainfall and temperature conditions were suitable for maize production [30,31,32].
    In total, the crop density was 72,000 plants per hectare in this study. The 3rd
    generation Infratec™ 1241 (2017-Denmark) is a whole grain analyzer using near-infrared
    transmittance technology to test multiple parameters (moisture, protein, oil,
    starch, etc.) in a broad range of grain commodities. Continental and often extreme
    conditions characterize the climatic-meteorological factors of the experimental
    area; the soil is calcareous chernozem with 80–90 cm depth topsoil and 2.7 Hu%
    humus. The soil has a pH of 6.6 (slightly acidic). In terms of its physical variety,
    it is a clayey loam with a plasticity index of KA 44, according to Arany. Figure

    Experiment Site, Hungary. Table 1. Types of the fertilizer used in this study.
    Table 2. Hybrids used in this study. 2.2. Statistical Analysis Variance analysis
    is a method which shows all changes or scatter in a data set di-vided into different
    components. There is a source of scattering for each component. In this method,
    the total variance or changes to two sources or two components of variance between
    groups indicate differences between groups and the source or component of variance
    within groups, which is called error variance and is assumed to be caused by factors
    Chance or randomly. Correlation is a statistical relationship between two random
    variables or two sets of data that does not necessarily mean they have a causal
    relationship. It examines the correlation of the relationships of variables in
    pairs and separately from the simultaneous effect of other variables. Additive
    Main effects and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) is a multivariate statistical
    method that explains the summative effects of genotype, environment, and multiplicative
    effects of genotype × environment. The AMMI formula is the following: Yijk = μ
    + Gi + Ej + GEij + Bij + εijk where μ is the overall mean of the studied traits
    (grain yield, oil content, protein content, starch content) in the population,
    Gi is the effect of the ith genotypes, Ej is the efficacy of the jth environment
    (treatments), GEij is the interaction of the ith genotypes with the jth environment,
    Bij is the effect of the kth replication in the jth environment, and εijk is the
    random error. It provides a good interpretation of the interaction of the genotype
    × environment. Before the AMMI analysis, the variance uniformity of experimental
    errors is examined using the Bartlett test. As a next step, the AMMI analysis
    was performed on the total performance of genotypes in different conditions using
    GenStat software (Copyright © 2000–2021 VSN International Ltd., Hertfordshire,
    UK). To analyse the yield stability of maize, the studied lines and hybrids used
    the AMMI model of the first components (IPCA1) and the second interactions of
    AMMI (IPCA2) as stability parameters for genotypes and treatments [33]. The response
    of genotypes in the media used biplots to identify condition-compatible genotypes
    due to the graphical representation of the reaction of genotypes and conditions
    in the interaction effect. The GGE method (genotype + genotype × environment)
    biplot is one of the new methods in studying genotype × environment interaction.
    The effect of genotype and the interaction of genotype × on the environment are
    not separated. GGE biplot is used as a suitable tool for the following three purposes:
    A. Analyze large environments and give a model of which is suitable for which
    a particular genotype; B: Evaluation of stable genotypes with moderate yield;
    C: Evaluation of environmental. 3. Results Variance analysis showed the effect
    of the genotype, year, genotype × year inter-action, and year × treatments (NPK)
    interaction were significant in grain yield, oil content, protein content, and
    starch content. The NPK treatment had a significant effect on grain yield, protein
    content, and starch content was significant at one percent (p < 0.01), and a significant
    effect on oil content at five percent (p < 0.05). Interaction of the years × genotype
    × NPK was not significant in the case of either parameter in the first treatments.
    In the second treatment (N fertilizer), variance analysis showed that the effect
    of genotypes, treatments, year, year × genotypes interaction, treatments × year
    interaction was significant on grain yield, protein content, oil content, and
    starch content. The effect of genotypes × treatments interaction was significant
    on protein content. The effect of genotypes × treatments in the year interaction
    was significant on grain yield (Table 3). Table 3. Results of variance analysis
    based on fertilizer treatments in hybrids in years. Tukey grouping showed that
    FAO 370 hybrids had a maximum performance on grain yield, FAO 340 had a maximum
    performance in oil content, FAO 350 had a maximum performance in protein content,
    and FAO 300 had a maximum performance in starch content as a result of the first
    treatment (NPK treatment). Tukey grouping showed that FAO430 had a maximum performance
    on grain yield, FAO 340 had a maximum performance in oil content, FAO350 had a
    maximum performance in protein content, and FAO 300 had the best performance in
    starch content as a result of the second treatment (nitrogen treatment) of this
    study (Table 4). Correlation analysis between performance parameters (oil content,
    protein, starch, and grain yield) of maize showed a positive correlation between
    proteins with oil content. Also, there is no correlation between the other parameters.
    (Figure 2A). Correlation analysis showed that protein content had a positive correlation
    with the oil content in this research. In addition, starch content negatively
    correlated with protein content and oil content of all examined hybrids. Figure

    Tukey grouping analysis of hybrids in fertilizer treatments. Additive Main effects
    and Multiplicative Interaction (AMMI) analysis showed a significant effect of
    the genotypes, the effect of NPK × genotype interaction, and the effect of genotypes
    × NPK interaction. The first principle component analysis (IPCA1) covered 64 percent,
    and the second principal component analysis (IPCA2) covered 30 percent of the
    total variance of data on the first treatment. The effect of the NPK treatment
    was not significant in this analysis. (Table 5). AMMI biplot showed that the protein
    content was stable in maize hybrids following NPK treatment. Grain yield and starch
    content showed yield stability as a result of the NPK × genotypes interaction.
    The oil content was stable among the different maize hybrids. FAO300, FAO420,
    FAO330, FAO350, and FAO360 had maximum stability in grain yield and protein content
    (Figure 3Y). AMMI analysis showed a significant effect of fertilizer, genotype,
    and their interaction in this analysis. The first principal component analysis
    covered 54 percent, and the second principal component analysis covered 34 percent
    of the total variance of all data on the second treatment (Table 5). AMMI biplot
    showed that oil content showed stability of performance in the case of different
    fertilizer levels, and grain yield had minimum stability due to different fertilizer
    levels. Also, FAO490, FAO380, FAO340, FAO360, FAO420, and FAO330 showed desirable
    stability on performance in this research (Figure 3Z). Figure 3. AMMI Biplot of
    yields in hybrids (Y): NPK fertilizer (Z): N fertilizer; A (FAO300), B (FAO330),

    showed that the hybrids FAO300, FAO330, and FAO420 showed maximum stability in

    starch content. FAO420, FAO300, FAO370, FAO430, and FAO490 had maximum stability
    in their grain yield. The first principal component analysis covered 61.23 percent,
    and the second principal component analysis covered 29.30 percent of the total
    data of this research. Ninety percent of the total data is covered by the GGE
    biplot figure (Figure 4). Figure 4. GGE biplot hybrids in NPK fertilizer (first

    4. Discussion The twentieth century has seen a significant increase in crop yields.
    Much of this increase has been achieved since the Second World War, and changes
    in crop potential yield and management methods have exacerbated this increase.
    However, food security and the need to provide food for the world’s population
    are projected to reach 10.4 billion by 2050. Finding the right solutions to the
    challenges mentioned above and concerns about global food security over the next
    30 years is an important reminder that crop yields must continue to increase over
    the next three decades. The consumption of sufficient nutrients was appropriate
    according to the physiological characteristics of growth, and the development
    of crops is one of the management strategies to improve yield. This research showed
    that the genotype, year, and fertilizer levels varied grain yield, oil percent,
    protein content, and starch content. FAO340 had a maximum performance in oil on
    different fertilizers (NPK and N), and FAO350 had a maximum performance in protein
    content. To gain the best performance of maize in terms of protein and oil, FAO350
    and FAO340 are potential choices in terms of protein and oil content, respectively.
    Nitrogen application has a significant effect on the quantitative and qualitative
    yield characteristics of maize. The obtained results showed different reactions
    of maize hybrids to different levels of nitrogen fertilizer. In separate studies,
    some researchers reported that nitrogen can be increasing the grain yield on maize
    [34,35]. Cui et al. [36] reported using 180 and 200 kg N/ha to achieve optimal
    maize yield. Increasing the amount of N fertilizer on maize showed the existing
    variation of parameters. For example, increasing N fertilizer amounts causes increasing
    starch content in kernels and decreasing oil percent and protein content. In this
    study, the grain yield is stable, while the oil content, protein content, and
    starch content was affected by NPK fertilization. FAO360, FAO420, and FAO320 hybrids
    showed their maximum desirable stability as a result of N fertilizer and NPK fertilizer
    in this research. The obtained results indicate that the hybrids FAO360, FAO420,
    and FAO330 hybrids showed their maximum performance in different conditions and
    situations of the fertilizer and environmental conditions. Examination of the
    effect of nitrogen on the quantitative and qualitative properties of maize showed
    that nitrogen increases dry matter production, grain yield, and yield components.
    Grain yield was significantly increasing due to the level of nitrogen fertilizer
    applied, and increasing ear length, grain number, ear weight, and grain yield
    showed a positive and significant correlation [37,38,39]. FAO360 and FAO350 hybrids
    showed the best performance on oil content as a result of N fertilizer and NPK
    fertilizer. In addition, FAO300, FAO330, FAO380, and FAO490 showed the best performance
    on starch content, and FAO300 and FAO430 had a maximum performance on grain yield
    in the case of different fertilizer levels. For this reason, this hybrid is recommended
    to farmers to reach their performance goals. Furthermore, the obtained results
    showed researchers that the protein content increases with increasing the amount
    of nitrogen, and the amount of protein increases more if phosphorus and potassium
    are also applied [40,41,42,43,44]. Based on the principle of sustainability, agriculture
    uses desirable and optimal fertilizers and hybrids with the new technical management
    method. This study showed that the yield of maize hybrids on NPK fertilizer and
    nitrogen fertilizer can improve stability and adaptability of yield hybrids. FAO
    420 showed adaptability and stability on grain yield as a result of nitrogen fertilization
    at the fifth dose level (300 Kg/ha nitrogen, 184 Kg/ha phosphorus, 216 Kg/ha potassium).
    FAO 430 showed adaptability and stability in NPK fertilizer at the fifth dose
    level (150 Kg/ha nitrogen, 115 Kg/ha phosphorus, 135 Kg/ha potassium). FAO 330
    showed adaptability and stability on starch; FAO 350 had stability on protein
    content; FAO 340 showed adaptability on oil content in fifth doses level nitrogen
    fertilizer and NPK fertilizer. It seems that, with the addition of chemical fertilizer
    to the soil, soil nitrogen increased. Consequently, the plant’s uptake of this
    element increased, and with its transfer to the grain, the percentage of grain
    nitrogen increased [45]. Mulyani et al. [46] reported that the combination of
    chemical fertilizers increased the uptake of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    in sugarcane. Nitrogen increased dry matter production, longevity, stem size and
    durability, plant size, leaf area index, and leaf area durability. In addition,
    potassium can increase the number of stomata on the leaf surface and result in
    more gas exchange and carbon dioxide uptake, increasing the intensity of photosynthesis
    and increasing growth and yield. This study showed that optimal fertilization
    could help to balance nutrients. However, increased use of fertilizer causes damage
    to the environment and changes the balance of nutrients. One of the goals of sustainable
    agriculture is to reach a balance of nutrients in the soil. Therefore, the study
    attempted to reach optimal fertilizer levels with maximum performance maize hybrids.
    5. Conclusions Sustainable agriculture acts in the interests of human beings.
    It is more efficient in using resources in balance with the environment. In other
    words, sustainable agriculture must be ecologically appropriate economically justifiable
    and socially desirable. This research showed maximum oil content in FAO340, protein
    in FAO350, and starch in FAO330 on NPK and nitrogen fertilizer. Grain yield showed
    maximum stability in FAO420 as a result of NPK fertilization and FAO430 as a result
    of nitrogen fertilization. Depending on the given fertilizer application, farmers
    can use the various hybrids to obtain a stable yield. The use of nitrogen fertilizer
    can result in the maximum grain yield in maize, but using potassium and phosphorus
    with nitrogen can also stabilize grain yield and other parameters. This study
    recommends using the complete fertilizer NPK dose with (150 Kg/ha nitrogen, 115
    Kg/ha potassium, 135 Kg/ha phosphorus) on maize hybrids. Author Contributions

  description: Food scarcity, population growth, and global climate change have propelled
    crop yield growth driven by high-throughput phenotyping into the era of big data.
    However, access to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier
    that phenomics urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant
    phenotyping platform (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems,
    can take full advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor,
    quantify, and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments,
    and it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could
    not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial,
    customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising
    numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth
    chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale
    remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments,
    as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly
    and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative
    validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first
    time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives
    on future development trends of HT3Ps. This review aims to provide ideas, thoughts,
    and insights for the optimal selection, exploitation, and utilization of HT3Ps,
    and thereby pave the way to break through current phenotyping bottlenecks in botany.

    population growth, and global climate change have propelled crop yield growth
    driven by high-throughput phenotyping into the era of big data. However, access
    to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier that phenomics
    urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant phenotyping platform
    (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems, can take full
    advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor, quantify,
    and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments, and
    it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could
    not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial,
    customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising
    numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth
    chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale
    remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments,
    as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly
    and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative
    validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first
    time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives
    on future development trends of HT3Ps. This review aims to provide ideas, thoughts,
    and insights for the optimal selection, exploitation, and utilization of HT3Ps,
    and thereby pave the way to break through current phenotyping bottlenecks in botany.
    Introduction The growth and development of plants, involving their photosynthesis,
    transpiration, flowering, and fruiting processes, are the basis of life on earth,
    and support 7.5 billion people (Pieruschka and Schurr, 2019). Unfortunately, the
    agriculture that sustains humanity is now facing three stark challenges at once:
    climate change, resource depletion, and population growth (Kim, 2020). In the
    next 30 years, the global population is expected to grow by 25% to 10 billion
    (Hickey et al., 2019). One of the greatest challenges in the twenty-first century
    will be to quickly expand crop production to meet this growing demand for food,
    clothing, and fuel. Salinization and erosion of agricultural land around the world,
    coupled to declining phosphate reserves, pose a grave threat to growth in the
    global production of crops. On April 21, 2020, the World Food Programme (WFP)
    announced that as new coronavirus pandemic spreads and batters the global economy,
    the number of people facing severe food crisis in the world could increase to
    265 million within the year. In the past decade, cheaper and faster sequencing
    methods have fostered increasing crop yields and generated an enormous increase
    in plant genomic data. The costs of sequencing have fallen dramatically, from
    $0.52 per Mb of DNA sequence in 2010 to just $0.010 in 2019, while the cost of
    sequencing a human-sized genome has decreased from $46 774 to a relatively paltry
    $942 (National Human Research Institute). Although high-throughput genotyping
    is expanding exponentially, the collection and processing of plant phenotypes
    constrain our ability to analyze the genetics of quantitative traits and limit
    the use of breeding for crop yield improvement (Mccouch et al., 2013). The phenotype
    arises from interactions between genotype and environment (Hickey et al., 2019),
    and the essence is the temporal expression of the plants'' gene map in characteristic
    geographic regions (Zhao, 2019). Phenotyping applies specific methods and protocols
    to measure morphological structural traits, physiological functional traits, and
    component content traits of cells, tissues, organs, canopy, whole plants, or even
    populations. However, traditional breeders perform artificial phenotyping based
    on the appearance, taste, and touch of the crop, undoubtedly a time-consuming,
    labor-intensive, and even destructive method that requires immense human resources
    to sample large population of crop plants. The limitation of phenotyping efficiency
    is increasingly recognized as a key constraint of progress in applied genetics,
    especially the time interval for acquiring traits in different environments (Guzman
    et al., 2015). Further, conventional phenotyping methods also make it difficult
    to capture physiological and biochemical phenotypes at the level of plant basic
    mechanisms that reveal patterns of genetics and biology. So, to alleviate this
    bottleneck, since 2000 a variety of phenotyping platforms have been developed
    which are now common tools in commercial or research teams (Granier and Vile,
    2014). An image-based, high-throughput phenotyping platform (HT3P) is defined
    as a platform that can image at least hundreds of plants daily (Fahlgren et al.,
    2015b). Given that some HT3Ps currently not only rely on images but also are based
    on contact (albeit non-destructive), “HT3P” is defined here as a platform that
    can collect massive amounts of phenotypic data from hundreds of plants every day
    with a high degree of automation. HT3P is a novel and powerful tool allowing us
    to monitor and quantify crop growth and production-related phenotypic traits in
    a non-destructive, fast, and high-throughput manner, and then to achieve genomics-assisted
    breeding (GAB) through genomic approaches of quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping,
    marker assisted selection (MAS), genomic selection (GS), and genome-wide association
    studies (GWAS), thereby assisting crop growers to adapt to changing climate conditions
    and market demand for yield. When genomics and high-throughput phenotypic data
    are robustly linked together, this fusion will also greatly promote the development
    of phenotyping. Furthermore, as Figure 1 shows, various types of HT3Ps contribute
    to the phenotyping of plant morphological structure, physiological function, and
    fractional content, and they can further promote the developments of multi-omics
    and reveal the regulatory networks and biological patterns of plants'' growth
    and development. figure 1 FIGURE 1. HT3Ps employed for phenotyping plant phenotypes
    of genotype, environment, and management (G×E×M) interactions advance phenomics;
    sequencing platforms employed for researching genotypes and transcripts assist
    in genomics and transcriptomics; mass spectrometry platforms employed for researching
    proteins, and metabolites promote proteomics and metabolomics; -omics platforms
    further progress multi-omics in systems biology. Nevertheless, because the large
    phenotyping platforms mostly are developed by professional commercial companies,
    the underlying hardware and software are protected by patents, so they cannot
    be modified to meet specific research needs (Czedik-Eysenberg et al., 2018). Consequently,
    a diversified range of commercial phenotyping platforms, as well as those either
    customized or self-developed, are continuously emerging. In this context, this
    paper reviews HT3Ps (root phenotyping not included) under three scenarios: (1)
    greenhouses and growth chambers under strictly controlled conditions; (2) ground-based
    proximal phenotyping in the field, and; (3) aerial, large-scale remote sensing,
    with an emphasis on platform novelties, sensor configurations, operation modes,
    and applications. Then, we innovatively propose ways to combine HT3Ps for their
    comparative validation or comprehensive analysis. Finally, we discuss some prevailing
    issues in current high-throughput phenotyping and also highlight the prospects
    for future development of HT3P. We hope this review enables researchers on plant
    phenotyping to make more informed choices when employing HT3P, provides fresh
    ideas and thoughts for intrepid developers of HT3P, and that ultimately hastens
    the next green revolution in crop breeding. HT3P For Indoor Phenotyping Under
    Strictly Controlled Environmental Conditions High-throughput plant phenotyping
    in the growth chamber or greenhouse entails the precise control of environmental
    factors—temperature, humidity, gas concentration, air volume, wind speed, light
    intensity, spectral range, photoperiod, and nutrient content—and a high-throughput,
    non-destructive, highly repeatable, fast, and accurate capture of the plant response
    to a specific environment. This can be done using model crops or representative
    plants as research objects, and the analysis of plants'' structure, physiology,
    and biochemical characteristics with assistance of HT3P can reveal adaptive mechanisms
    related to environmental signals, with a view to eventually elucidating their
    genetic control. Given the mechanical structure of the platform and movement mode
    between the sensors and plants, an indoor HT3P can be categorized as either a
    benchtop type or a conveyor type. Table 1 shows specific examples and details
    of these two types of HT3P. No matter which type it is, the phenotyping platform
    integrates common cameras, supplemental light sources, automatic watering, and
    weighing devices, to automatically collect plant phenotypic data. Available cameras
    include those capable of capturing RGB, infrared (IR), fluorescence (FLUO), near-infrared
    (NIR), multispectral, or hyperspectral images. For example, the FLUO imager is
    used to obtain chlorophyll or photosynthesis-related characteristics (Choudhury
    et al., 2019). Hyperspectral imaging in particular provides access to crucial
    metrics, such as those for photosynthesis, chlorophyll, and nitrogen content.
    See Figure 2 for detailed information on the diverse sensors now available to
    monitor, quantify, and evaluate key agronomic traits. table 1 TABLE 1. Overview
    of HT3Ps used in greenhouses and growth chambers under environmentally controlled
    conditions. figure 2 FIGURE 2. Sensors currently available to monitor, quantify,
    and estimate key morphological structural traits (e.g., plant height, biomass,
    canopy coverage, lodging), physiological functional traits (e.g., FAPAR, staygreen/senescence,
    light-use efficiency, disease/pests), and component content traits (e.g., chlorophyll
    content, nitrogen content, water content) of plants. Compared with field conditions,
    although indoor experiments cannot provide the authenticity of soil system and
    the complexity of biological and abiotic stress for plants, the purpose of indoor
    HT3P experiment is to study qualitatively or quantitatively the response of representative
    or interesting plants to specific environment. Environmental control platform
    avoids the unpredictable phenotypic variation caused by the interaction between
    genotype and natural environment (G × E). Therefore, considering uncontrollable
    factors in the field, HT3P deployed in greenhouse or growth chamber is widely
    used to study the response of plants to specific growth conditions, and accurately
    capture the morphological structural, physiological functional or component content
    phenotypic indicators. Conveyor-Type Indoor HT3P The conveyor-type HT3P operates
    in the “plant-to-sensor” mode. Potted plants are transported into an imaging room
    with cameras, passing through an automatic door on the conveyor that is controlled
    by computer for automatic imaging, after which plants are returned to their original
    growth positions. Cameras are typically installed on the top and side of the darkroom
    to perform this imaging, and/or the plants are rotated for data acquisition. The
    automatic door eliminates the interference of ambient light, and there are halogen
    lamps to provide illumination. Scanalyzer 3D, a typical conveyor-type HT3P developed
    by LemnaTec GmbH (Aachen, Germany), has been adopted by some international organizations,
    covering the following versions (Yang et al., 2020). The Plant Accelerator of
    the Australian Plant Phenomics Facility (APPF) is a leading international plant
    phenotyping research institution. Its conveyor HT3P can handle 2,400 plants and
    is equipped with multiple imaging stations (RGB, NIR, FLUO, and hyperspectral),
    and this has been used successfully to study the nutrient deficiency of crops
    (Neilson et al., 2015) and salt tolerance of chickpea (Atieno et al., 2017). The
    four imaging chambers are separated and function independently of each other.
    Recently, Bruning et al. (2019) used just two hyperspectral imagers in its hyperspectral
    imaging room to evaluate the concentration and spatial distribution of water content
    and nitrogen level in wheat. In another example, the conveyor belt system in the
    Smarthouse (APPF, University of Adelaide) was used to study the effects of zinc
    (Zn) and an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus upon tomato (Brien et al., 2020). Similarly,
    Scanalyzer 3D, in the Greenhouse Innovation Center of University of Nebraska-Lincoln,
    allows the phenotyping of 672 plants with a height of up to 2.5 m, being able
    to collect RGB, FLUO, IR, NIR, and hyperspectral images from the top and side
    view of plants (Choudhury et al., 2016). Each imaging room is equipped with a
    rotating elevator that permits 360 side-views of a given plant (Choudhury et al.,
    2018). There are three watering stations with balance, which can apply watering
    to meet the target weight of the pot or in specific volume, for which the amounts
    of water added are recorded. Since the imaging chamber is self-contained, this
    HT3P unit allows the employed sensors to be adjusted according to research needs.
    For example, RGB, NIR, and FLUO cameras are used to analyze the spatiotemporal
    biomass accumulation of barley under drought stress (Neumann et al., 2015). In
    studying maize, Ge et al. (2016) used RGB and hyperspectral imaging rooms to analyze
    this crop''s growth and water-use dynamics, in addition to quantifying its leaf
    water content. To measure the nutrient concentration and water content of plants,
    Pandey et al. (2017) relied solely on the hyperspectral imaging room of the Scanalyzer
    3D, this being the first time hyperspectral data was used to detect the nutrient
    content of living plants in vivo. Furthermore, Miao et al. (2020) segmented the
    generated hyperspectral images of sorghum and maize, at the organ level, to identify
    genetic associations, which let them measure plant properties more broadly. The
    bellwether phenotyping platform, at the Donald Danforth Plant Science Center,
    including a Convion (Winnipeg, Canada) growth chamber and an imaging station (LemnaTec
    Scanalyzer) (Fahlgren et al., 2015a). Plant barcodes on the pots are used for
    radiofrequency identification (RFID), to match up image data with the metadata.
    The 180-m-long conveyor belt system can accommodate 1,140 plants, which are transported
    into FLUO, VIS, and NIR imaging stations through dark adaptation channels. Interestingly,
    this conveyor system is divided into four modules that can run independently,
    or as a whole, which increases the research flexibility and scope of potential
    experiments. To sum up, as a widespread conveyor-belt HT3P for large-sized plants,
    Scanalyzer 3D is effective in studies of plant biology and plant breeding. The
    purpose of the greenhouse is to provide a uniform, controlled environment. But
    since most conveyor HT3Ps often need to transport plants to the specific imaging
    room, this introduced microclimatic heterogeneity likely influences the plants''
    growth and response to environmental changes, rendering the phenotypic data collected
    inaccurate. Fortunately, the HT3P built by Purdue University overcomes this interference
    of a differential microclimate (Ma et al., 2019), in that plants are grown on
    cyclic conveyor belts throughout their whole growth cycle, thus exposing them
    to the same heat and radiation conditions. Huazhong University of Science and
    Technology and Huazhong Agricultural University (Wuhan, China) jointly developed
    a high-throughput rice phenotyping facility (HRPF) with an image analysis pipeline,
    able to perform color imaging and X-ray computed tomography (CT); it can monitor
    15 agronomic traits of 1,920 rice plants (Yang et al., 2014). This HRPF was used
    to quantify the dynamic response of rice to drought (Duan et al., 2018). However,
    the investment cost of conveyor HT3Ps is high, and further improvement is needed
    to enhance flexibility. The CT platform can high-throughput visualize and quantify
    external and internal geometric features, which offers the opportunity to collect
    morphological and anatomical characteristics of plants. There are two general
    types of CT platforms used in plant sciences: industrial CT scanners and medical
    CT. Industrial CT scanners with a higher resolution than medical CT, also known
    as micro-CT, μCT, or nano-CT, can be applied for the subtle phenotypic traits
    of plants. For example, Tracy et al. (2017) used μCT scanning to obtain detailed
    three-dimensional phenotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana and barley, which allows
    the measurement of spike size and further accurate staging at the flower and anther
    stages. This rapid and non-destructive method overcomes the traditional tedious
    steps in cytological microscopy, such as fixation, sectioning, staining, and microanalysis.
    Compared to μCT, medical CT can faster scan larger samples and larger numbers
    of samples, despite its lower resolution. Gomez et al. (2018) used a medical CT
    platform to study the geometric characteristics of sorghum stem, finding that
    medical CT estimates were highly predictive of morphological traits and moderately
    predictive of anatomical traits. The conveyor-type HT3P (excluding CT) can carry
    samples of large size (e.g., sorghum and corn) and large capacity, but it may
    affect those plants with fragile stems due to shaking of the belt. And since spectral
    information is not collected in situ, there are environmental differences between
    the plants'' growth location and the imaging room, which may lead to inaccurate
    phenotypic data. The CT platform enables the acquisition of meticulous morphological
    and anatomical traits of plant, which has great application prospects. The future
    conveyor-type HT3P will aim for high operational stability and environmental homogeneity,
    providing smooth plant transportation and accurate climate control for plant science
    research, and enabling complete precise phenotyping of plant traits throughout
    reproductive period. Benchtop-Type Indoor HT3P In measuring phenotypic traits
    susceptible to environmental changes (temperature, wind, to name a few), especially
    for small species with fragile stems, it is a wise choice to keep plants still
    while the sensors are moving about. This is exactly how a benchtop HT3P works,
    for which the operation mode is one of “sensor-to-plant.” The imaging head is
    integrated with multiple sensors, driven by a computer-controlled mechanical arm,
    which automatically locates the position where a plant is growing and collects
    its phenotypic data in situ. In general, the benchtop HT3P also features a precisely
    controlled irrigation and weighing system, with supplemental light sources. Arabidopsis
    thaliana is a prime model plant because of its wide distribution, fast life cycle,
    and relatively small genome (Kaul et al., 2000), making an ideal study species
    for the benchtop HT3P. The platform for measuring photosynthetic parameters (PSII,
    photosystem II), named Phenovator, can accommodate 1440 A. thaliana plants (Flood
    et al., 2016). Driven by an XY camera-movement system, the imaging head carrying
    the cameras measures photosynthesis and projected leaf area (PLA) at eight wavelengths,
    via an eight-position filter wheel installed on the monochrome camera. For the
    Phenoscope platform, its imaging system consists of digital camera only (Tisne
    et al., 2013), but it can carry 735 individual pots. Its ingenious feature is
    that it can continuously rotate each pot, so the sampled plant experiences the
    same external conditions, thus minimizing micro-environmental variation at the
    individual plant level and providing high spatial uniformity. Similarly, the LemnaTec
    Scanalyzer HTS is equipped with a robotic arm that houses VIS, FLUO, and NIR cameras
    to take top views of small plants. It is has been used to study the time-dependent
    effect of water stress on A. thaliana (Acosta-Gamboa et al., 2017). Although the
    number of samples it can process is relatively small, it provides sufficiently
    rich spectral information. In mutation breeding, the phenotype discovery of many
    mutants is rapidly posing a limitation to molecular plant physiology research
    (Fraas and Lüthen, 2015). Recently, Chang et al. (2020) collected the growth images
    of 350 A. thaliana and compared the subtle morphological effects of different
    radiation dosages during its growing period, obtaining not only dynamic growth
    behavior information (such as the plant growth rate post-radiation) but also the
    phenotypic characteristics of dose effects. Plant silk is normally difficult to
    detect and quantify because of its unique features. To overcome this, Phenoarch
    (INRA, Montpellier, France) made a breakthrough, when Brichet et al. (2017) used
    it to monitor the growth dynamics of corn ears and silks. That HT3P unit has two
    imaging cabins. First, the plants are rotated at a constant speed, and RGB cameras
    determine the spatial coordinates of the ears on them. Then the robotic arm assists
    in the automatic positioning of the camera at a 30-cm distance from the ear, to
    continue collecting of high-resolution images of silks. In this way, the daily
    growth of ear and silk of hundreds of plants can be tracked. Crop 3D, developed
    by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Guo et al., 2016), takes LiDAR as the core
    sensor and integrates a high-resolution RGB camera with a thermal and hyperspectral
    imager, applying one key trigger to synchronously acquire multi-source data and
    extract plant morphology parameters. Specifically, the sensors adopt a vertical
    downward or overhead mode, to mount and shoot, carrying out single row scanning,
    multi-row scanning, and fixed-point positioning scanning. Although a low-cost
    and non-commercial platform has a small sample capacity, it could also generate
    high-throughput phenotypic data. Glyph, as a representative, consists of four
    bridge-like structures, whose drip irrigation equipment and digital camera form
    a gantry that moves on the track between pair of rows. It has been successfully
    used for predicting the field drought tolerance in soybeans (Peirone et al., 2018).
    The SITIS platform, which consists of PVC pipes with irrigation points, was used
    to evaluate water stress tolerance of cotton cultivars (Guimarães et al., 2017),
    and it also enables the evaluation of plant roots. However, this platform is not
    an image-based, non-destructive one to measure plant traits, so it still requires
    much manual operation and experimental processing. The human-like robotic platform
    is a newer method to measure plant phenotypic traits instead of doing such manual
    operations. The vivo robotic system, consisting of a four degree of freedom (DOF)
    manipulator, a time-of-flight (TOF) camera, and a gripper integrated with an optical
    fiber cable and thermistor, can be used for the automatic measurement of maize
    and sorghum leaf traits (Atefi et al., 2019). More specifically, the TOF camera
    acts as the vision system, and the gripper can measure VIS-NIR spectral reflectance
    and temperature; however, its capture speed, as well as its capture success rate
    (78% for maize and 48% for sorghum), need further improvement. The rapid development
    of such a robot system can provide reference data and supplementary support for
    image-based plant phenotyping. Strictly benchtop-type HT3Ps tend to focus on model
    plants of small size (e.g., A. thaliana) and allow for the collection of trait
    data associated with subtle phenotypic changes, and their situ extraction also
    ensures homogeneity of growth environment and undisturbed development. However,
    sophisticated commercial HT3Ps tend to be capital-intensive, while low-cost self-developed
    platforms have small sample capacity and low throughput, whose quality, credibility,
    and abundance of phenotypic data can be somewhat reduced. Fortunately, artificially
    intelligent plant growth chambers, plant factories, and rapid iterative breeding
    have opened new avenues for indoor HT3Ps. The future benchtop-type HT3P may be
    able to omnidirectionally monitor, capture, and track subtle morphological and
    physiological changes of multi-level traits in a wide range of model plants, with
    high-throughput and full-automation, to reveal functional gene expression and
    biogenetic regulation patterns. HT3P For Field Phenotyping In Notoriously Heterogeneous
    Conditions and Relatively Uncontrollable Environmental Factors Plants that grow
    naturally in the field are affected by weather (e.g., rain, frost, snow), biotic
    and abiotic stresses (e.g., drought, low-temperature, low-nitrogen, pests), as
    well as soil properties (e.g., nutrient gradients, heterogeneity, micro-environment),
    all of which are extremely distinct from the environment of greenhouse and growth
    room, making the field crop phenotype an intricate one. Whereas controlled environment,
    image-based phenotyping platforms are almost universally popularized worldwide,
    the majority of crop breeding appears in the field with little if any selection
    in controlled environments (Furbank et al., 2019). And the indoor environment
    can only simulate but not recreate the real field setting. These factors stimulated
    the exponential increase of a wide variety of HT3Ps in fields. Apparently, field
    HT3Ps operate in the “sensor-to-plant” mode. According to their usage scenarios
    and imaging distance, field HT3Ps can be categorized into ground-based and aerial
    platforms. The relationship between a platform''s characteristics and field crop
    traits determines the efficiency of the phenotype platform to a certain extent
    (Kuijken et al., 2015). Based on this, ground-based platforms can be further classified
    as pole/tower-based, mobile, gantry-based, and cable-suspended. Likewise, aerial
    platforms could be categorized further, as the unmanned aerial platform (UAP),
    manned aerial platform (MAP), and satellite platform. Figure 3 shows specific
    scenarios of various types of applied HT3Ps. figure 3 FIGURE 3. The various types
    of HT3Ps mentioned in this review (partial display) including HT3Ps in the greenhouse/growth
    chamber (i.e., benchtop-type and conveyor-type), field ground-based HT3Ps (i.e.,
    pole/tower-based, mobile, gantry-based, and cable-suspended) and aerial HT3Ps
    (i.e., UAP, MAP, and satellite). Despite the complex interactions of genotype,
    environment, and management (G × E × M), the proliferation of a wide variety of
    HT3Ps in recent years has greatly assisted researchers in understanding the genetic
    structure of crops, obtaining high-quality genetic gains, and improving the ability
    to genetically analyze crop traits related to yield and stress resistance. However,
    the diversity of HT3Ps also brings with considerations of availability, feasibility,
    standardization, big data, and reliability. Ground-Based Field HT3P Ground-based
    HT3P means proximal phenotyping that can provide higher resolution data than aerial
    remote sensing. It is convenient to collect phenotypic data of time series and
    analyze the dynamic response and time dependence of phenotypes. However, the ground-based
    HT3P is not suitable for large-scale phenotyping tasks. Table 2 shows specific
    examples and details of these four types. table 2 TABLE 2. Overview of ground-based
    HT3Ps used in the field under real uncontrolled environmental conditions. Pole/Tower-Based
    Field HT3P The pole/tower-based HT3P is formed when sensors are mounted directly
    atop a pole or tower made of aluminum, steel, or plastic fibers, which can be
    of stationary or mobile type. Although this platform is simple in structure, similar
    to a small weather station, high throughput and complexity are not necessarily
    synonymous. Friedli et al. (2016) applied a pole-based, terrestrial laser-scanning
    (TLS) platform, to monitor canopy height growth in maize, soybean, and wheat.
    The TLS is done via a laser scanner mounted upside down on a 3.8-m high aluminum
    elevator tripod. Its time and spatial resolution depend on the crop variety assessed
    and scanning distance. Combined with “Internet of Things” (IoT), CropQuant is
    equipped with RGB and No Infrared cameras to continuously monitor crop growth
    through high-resolution time-lapse photography (Zhou et al., 2017). It can be
    powered by batteries and solar panels and connected to an in-field WIFI network,
    as a mesh network node, to form an IoT-mode HT3P that quantifies crop growth and
    development. Furthermore, PhenoCam is a large phenotyping network, consists of
    a series of widely deployed digital cameras that automatically capture RGB images
    (typically, at 30 min intervals) to track biomes'' vegetation phenology (Richardson
    et al., 2018). The camera is mounted on a pole, mast, or building. Although the
    data source is only visible images, such massive time series data sets can monitor
    the dynamic changes of an ecosystem. A mobile handheld pole-based, Phenocorn,
    is integrated with a GreenSeeker (portable device), an IR thermometer, a web camera,
    and a global positioning system (GPS) receiver (Wei, 2017). This device can simultaneously
    collect normalized vegetation index (NDVI) and canopy temperature. Although the
    12 kg hand-held Phenocorn can be carried on a person''s back, it still requires
    much manual labor. Fortunately, it can modified for use in a cart that is manually
    pushed to collect phenotypic traits in the field (Crain et al., 2016). As is well-known,
    it is quite difficult to capture, track, and quantify crop lodging and crop movement.
    In tackling this, Susko et al. (2018) developed an automatic camera-tracking HT3P
    that consisted of a hemispherical video camera, a computer, and an industrial
    curve track system; its motor-driven camera moves along the track for phenotypic
    data acquisition. What makes this breakthrough so novel is that it can be used
    for dynamic imaging in video or static frequent imaging, thus allowing for the
    study of new plant phenotypes. The tower-based HT3P is similar to the stationary
    pole-based platform, with sensors installed atop the tower, but the dimensions
    and height of a tower-based platform are generally higher and larger than that
    of pole-based. In a study on photosynthetic efficiency of barley and sugar beet,
    laser-induced fluorescence transient (LIFT) instruments were placed on the top
    of a 10-m high scaffold to measure the photosynthetic performance of agroecosystems
    (Raesch et al., 2014). However, the LIFT signal in the target area introduced
    noise from plant stems and the soil. In later work, Naito et al. (2017) installed
    an improved multispectral single-lens imaging system (i.e., VIS and NIR cameras),
    on two 8-m high towers, which could collect crop images from eight angles to estimate
    rice yield-related traits. Their results showed that the system has great potential
    for yield estimation during early crop development. Both pole-based and tower-based
    HT3Ps are easy and low-cost to build and maintain, and are convenient for temporary
    use and multi-site deployments to form networks. However, phenotypic area of coverage
    and spectral information are extremely limited for a single unit, and multi-site
    trials increase the cost for large-scale field experiments. Looking ahead, being
    portable, scalable, rotatable, robust, and easy to install and remove are anticipated
    key features of pole/tower-based platforms, and phenotypic networks of economically-efficient
    distributed pole/tower-based HT3Ps will play a prominent role in the future of
    multi-site large-scale experiments and the calibration of high-dimensional phenotypic
    data. Mobile HT3P The mobile HT3P can move through the field and collect crop
    phenotypic traits in a semi-automatic or fully automatic manner, including refitted
    agricultural machinery (e.g., tractor, sprayer, or harvester), self-developed
    mechanical platform (e.g., cart or buggy), and commercial automatic platform.
    A mobile HT3P is generally composed of four subsystems: sensing system, data acquisition
    system, mechanical platform, and drive system. The sensing system covers GPS,
    environmental sensors (e.g., sunlight, wind speed), and phenotypic sensors (e.g.,
    RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal). The data acquisition system generally
    is the data acquisition software on an onboard computer. Mechanical platform is
    for load-bearing and mobility, and the drive system can be classified as electricity,
    engine, and manpower. Theoretically, any agricultural mobile platform has the
    potential to be converted into a mobile HT3P. The mobile HT3P converted from a
    tractor, sprayer, or harvester makes rational use of precision agricultural machinery
    that already exists. In the early stages, a pioneering field-based mobile was
    developed in Canberra''s High-Resolution Plant Physics Facility (Deery et al.,
    2014). It was equipped with a height-adjustable sensor array, including LiDAR,
    RGB, thermal IR, and hyperspectral cameras. Driven by the mobile, the sensors
    pick up traits'' data along the surveyed plots. A cherry picker installed a linear
    scanning bar with spectral cameras has also been applied as a mobile HT3P (Pinto
    et al., 2016); its imaging cameras aim to collect canopy radiation in a linear
    push broom mode. The temporal change of canopy photochemical activity was tracked
    by generating sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) map. A multi-sensor system
    developed by Bai et al. (2016) consists of five sensor modules, and this platform
    was used to measure canopy traits of soybean and wheat. They adopted the “stop-measure-go”
    mode, to ensure the sensors precisely aligned with the plots, collecting plot-level
    phenotypic data that were free of blurring. But to control such a HT3P, a certain
    number of operators must participate. GPhenoVision is assembled from a high-clearance
    tractor, carrying RGB-D, thermal, and hyperspectral cameras for quantitative assessment
    of cotton canopy growth and development (Jiang et al., 2018). Customizability
    and modularity are the two key characteristics of GPhenoVision, which allows researchers
    to rapidly develop and upgrade sensing modules with specific phenotyping purposes,
    reduces development effort when adding or removing modules, and prevents malfunction
    of the entire system. Jimenez-Berni et al. (2018) installed a LiDAR, an NDVI sensor,
    and a digital camera on a low-cost three-wheeled buggy, called Phenomobile Lite,
    to evaluate canopy height, ground cover, and aboveground biomass. However, to
    change its direction, a “stop” button is need to be manually pressed, and almost
    the whole process requires operator follow-up. To achieve the automatic measurement
    of yield-related traits, Bao et al. (2014) presented a mobile HT3P that could
    automatically obtain stereo images of sorghum plants. It was retrofitted from
    a garden tractor, equipped with six stereo camera heads on a vertical pole, which
    can be triggered synchronously. Three-dimensional images of two rows of crops
    can be collected in a single pass. The drawback is that before each bout of data
    collection, the platform must be driven manually through the field, stopping,
    and recording each sampling point to generate paths. Later, an agricultural mobile
    robot mounted with a 360°-view LiDAR, developed by Qiu et al. (2019), was used
    to efficiently calculate the row spacing and plant height of a maize field. Compared
    with in-row and one-by-one phenotyping methods, the 3D laser scanner sitting atop
    this robot obtains group observation of parcels. While it moves in a “stop-and-go”
    manner, the phenotypic data of parcel-level plant group could be simultaneously
    collected. Unlike the wheeled mobile platform, Stager et al. (2019) employed a
    modified crawler robot to collect sub-canopy traits at low elevation. But branches,
    tillers, or roots may hinder the movement of such crawler robots. Automated robots
    offer the prospect of unattended field operations, which likely be a major focus
    of future research of agricultural phenotyping platforms. By letting the phenotyping
    height of the mobile HT3P vary, to adapt to different growing stages of crops,
    Flex-Ro was developed to identify differences in the emergence and maturity stages
    among soybean varieties (Werner, 2016). PhenoBox of Flex-Ro mainly integrates
    data acquisition hardware, while its height-adjustable PhenoBar, located at the
    front of this mobile platform, mainly consists of three sensor units, capable
    of covering 4.5-m swath (Murman, 2019). An operator controls the machine through
    the remote box or a MATLAB application called FlexRoRun. It is worth mentioning
    that a 3D smart sensor is incorporated, for obstacle detection, which successfully
    detects pedestrian-sized objects and triggers parking. This will be a critical
    security consideration for future robotic HT3Ps. Likewise, a multi-purpose field
    robot in combination with various apps can achieve different functions. For example,
    Bonirob robotic platform with the phenotyping app, penetrometer app, and precision
    spraying app can monitor plant growth, measure soil parameters, and apply chemical
    weeding, respectively (Bangert et al., 2013). Unlike the mobile HT3P for small-sized
    or early-growing crops, Robotanist can navigate autonomously in the fields of
    tall crops, such as corn or sorghum (Mueller-Sim et al., 2017). Interestingly,
    it has a three DOF manipulator that can touch and measure the strength of plant
    stalks, which is a phenotypic innovation based on contact. A semi-automatic self-made
    mobile HT3P can reduce the development cost and soil compaction (because of lightweight
    architecture), but normally requires one or more operators to follow-up (Bai et
    al., 2016, 2018; Jimenez-Berni et al., 2018). Moreover, because of the “stop-measure-go”
    mode and slow response speed of low-cost sensors, the efficiency of crop traits''
    data acquisition cannot be guaranteed. Concerning the mobile HT3P based on the
    modified tractor, sprayer, or harvester, it often needs special personnel to drive.
    Its large volume and weight risk causing soil compaction and mechanical disturbance
    to the crops, which precludes the deployment in the field. And the faster travel
    speed than self-made cart also may not guarantee the quality of phenotypic data
    obtained. But the payload is large, so it can integrate diverse sensors to collect
    multi-source information. Robotic HT3P is capable of automatically navigating
    through the field and collecting data on crop traits, as well as doing continuous
    phenotyping throughout the day and night, but its development and maintenance
    costs are expensive. The future mobile HT3Ps will likely aim for lightness, automation,
    modularization, and customization, and the mechanical arm and emergency braking
    mechanism will offer potential applications that could greatly improve the flexibility,
    autonomy, and security. Gantry-Based Field HT3P As a gantry frame is equipped
    with a sensor box, and moves along the track and collects crop traits along XYZ
    directions, it becomes the gantry-based HT3P. When it moves back and forth on
    the track, repeated phenotyping done this way avoids the possibility of soil compaction
    and damage of crops'' normal development. LeasyScan, equipped with a set of scanners
    (PlantEye F300, Phenospex, Heerlen, the Netherlands), can perform continuous,
    synchronous and automated monitoring of plant water use and leaf canopy development,
    via linear movement above the surveyed plants (Vadez et al., 2015). The trigger
    and stop of each measurement are controlled by a mechanical barcode, which is
    also used for distance calibration from the scanner to the ground. LeasyScan was
    also utilized in a pre-breeding, genetic resource identification experiment with
    hybrid maize (Sunil et al., 2018), in which it measured plant height, 3D leaf
    area (i.e., total leaf area), and leaf area index (LAI). Similarly, Virlet et
    al. (2017) applied Field Scanalyzer (LemnaTec) to monitor and quantify morphological
    traits of wheat organs and canopy. Through the control software in the master
    computer, the gantry-based HT3P can operate in the full-automatic or manual mode.
    Unfortunately, though it can sample continuously, 24 h per day, but no two sensors
    can collect images simultaneously. Then, Field Scanalyzer also was used to determine
    wheat canopy height and further validate the potential of functional mapping analysis
    for detecting persistent quantitative trait loci (QTLs) (Lyra et al., 2020). A
    phenotypic experiment that precise management is involved in the sufficiently
    realistic field environment is ideal for deciphering G × E × M interactions. PhénoFieldR
    is the first field-based facility in the European Union, one equipped with high-throughput
    phenotyping devices on a gantry, automatic irrigating mobile rainout shelters
    on tracks, and environmental recording sensors. By controlling both irrigation
    and fertilization, this gantry-based HT3P was used to investigate water and nitrogen
    stress (Beauchene et al., 2019). Likewise, Mini-Plot, developed by Forschungszentrum
    Jülich, consists of a closed greenhouse area and an open-fenced area, containing
    90 and 30 Mini-Plots, respectively; it was used to quantify the disease severity
    of barley varieties (Thomas et al., 2018). The measuring head consisting of a
    hyperspectral sensor, a mirror-based scanning system, and an automatic positioning
    system moves over the plant for imaging. Such gantry-based HT3Ps for phenotyping,
    which can integrate genetics, field environmental factors, and management practices,
    has greatly enhanced the understanding of genetic control pattern for breeders
    and plant biologist. However, once the construction and installation of the gantry-based
    HT3P is completed, multi-site experiments can be expensive or even inoperative.
    High development, operation, and maintenance costs are also several factors that
    researchers should be aware of and bear in mind. Fortunately, gantry-based HT3Ps
    with a high degree of automation can collect time-series phenotypic data of high
    resolution. Owing to its large payload and continuous operation ability, which
    greatly improves expansibility, this approach does provide an opportunity to better
    understand the dynamics of plant circadian rhythms. Extending phenotypic area,
    shrinking volume, and reducing cost will imbue the gantry-based HT3Ps with better
    application prospects. Cable-Suspended Field HT3P A cable-suspended HT3P is mainly
    composed of sensing system, data acquisition system, mechanical transmission system,
    and drive system. Sensing system and data acquisition system are generally integrated
    in a sensor bar. Winches, cables, poles, and pulleys make up the drive and mechanical
    transmission system. Four poles are distributed in four corners of the field and
    a winch house for controlling the cables sits at the bottom of the pole. The sensor
    array with a GPS unit can be precisely positioned above the interested region
    for traits'' data acquisition through cable-driven. A typical representative of
    cable-suspended HT3P is the “FIP,” located at the ETH research station in Switzerland.
    Its sensor heads integrated with a DSLR camera, a laser scanner, and a thermal
    camera can collect crop phenotypic data from 2 to 5 m above the canopy. The feasibility
    of FIP in monitoring canopy coverage and canopy height of winter wheat, maize,
    and soybean was verified by Kirchgessner et al. (2017). Furthermore, the Nu-Spidercam
    at the University of Nebraska has a multi-sensor systems, a subsurface drip irrigation
    (SDI) system and an automatic weather station (Bai et al., 2019), which is capable
    of accurately and flexibly capturing crop traits, such as plant height, canopy
    cover, and spectral reflection. Its sensor bar integrates numerous sensors, so
    software is designed for selecting available sensors to meet particular experimental
    needs. A drawback is that it only can operate continuously for 6–8 h when fully
    charged. Phenotyping sensors of the cable-suspended HT3P is performing tasks over
    the crop canopy by cables during data collection of agronomic traits, meaning
    that the cable-suspended HT3P has lower dependence on soil conditions and less
    interference to plants than mobile HT3P. Phenotypic traits information of time
    series can still be collected within the established crop growth-monitoring period.
    And it can cover larger phenotypic region but has lower load than do gantry-based
    HT3P. In general, field HT3Ps are considerably weather-dependent and region-limited.
    Allowing stabilized imaging of plants clusters and continuous monitoring of crop
    growth at low elevation for a longer duration will be a likely future trend for
    cable-suspended HT3Ps. Aerial HT3P Vulnerable to Weather Constraints and Aviation
    Regulatory According to the imaging distance employed, aerial HT3Ps encompass
    the Unmanned Aerial Platform (UAP), Manned Aerial Platform (MAP), and satellite
    platform. UAP usually requires an operator at a ground station to remotely control
    or execute the flight task, by following a set planned path. Crop images are automatically
    acquired by onboard sensors. Nevertheless, MAP needs a dedicated person to pilot
    the aircraft and another passenger to manually capture the crop images while in
    flight. UAP and MAP typically carry global navigation satellite system (GNSS),
    but often this must be coupled with ground control points (GCPs) and calibration
    boards, for accurate georeferencing of the acquired data and for correcting its
    spatial resolution. A satellite platform collects large-scale field images from
    space, letting one access and download this satellite data as needed. Table 3
    lists the specific applications and details of the aerial HT3Ps. When compared
    with a ground-based platform, an aerial HT3P can collect broader-scale phenotypic
    regions in a shorter period. However, the aerial platform has strong weather dependence
    and relatively low spatiotemporal resolution because of its flight altitude and
    imaging distance. table 3 TABLE 3. Overview of aerial HT3Ps subject to air regulatory
    regime and weather constraints. Unmanned Aerial Platform (UAP) In recent years,
    due to the reduction of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) prices and the relaxation
    of air traffic regulations, the application of UAP in agricultural research has
    increased exponentially. This so-called UAP is a kind of aerial platform, for
    which UAV is the carrier, that integrated onboard sensors, a GPS unit, an inertial
    measurement unit (IMU), a battery and a crucial gimbal—for correcting the influence
    of pitch and roll motion—to collect phenotypic data at the plant canopy scale.
    To collect high-precision geographic position of plots, both GCPs and calibration
    boards are needed. Its successful phenotyping of plants depends on the characteristics
    of UAV and the properties of the deployed sensors (Sankaran et al., 2015). According
    to its most distinguishing feature, UAPs can be classified as multi-rotor or fixed-wing.
    UAV''s flight, however, is weather-dependent, and the ideal conditions are clear,
    windless, and dry weather, similar to those required when applying agronomic inputs.
    Because of its limited payload and endurance, UAP can only carry a finite number
    of phenotypic sensors (generally, no more than 3). A multi-rotor UAV can be a
    quadcopter, hexacopter, or octocopter. Compared with its fixed-wing counterpart,
    it has lower flight altitude and slower flight speed, but is capable of vertical
    takeoff and landing (i.e., it can hover). With respect to the multi-rotor UAP,
    the use of one sensor is most common. For example, RGB images acquired by multi-rotor
    UAPs have been widely used for researching the growth rate of wheat (Holman et
    al., 2016), carotenoid levels of inbred lettuce lines (Mascarenhas Maciel et al.,
    2019), vegetation index (Buchaillot et al., 2019), wheat height (Villareal et
    al., 2020), growth of different maize inbred lines (Wang et al., 2019), and canopy
    extraction of orchard (Wu et al., 2020). Parrot Sequoia (Parrot, France) and Micasense
    RedEdge (Micasense, US) are the more familiar multispectral cameras used with
    UAP. For example, Parrot Sequoia was used to evaluate the accuracy and spatial
    consistency of hemispherical-conical reflectance factors (HCRF) (Fawcett et al.,
    2020). Notably, cameras are fixed (at a 3-degree angle) to offset the average
    forward tilt in flight. The recent declining cost of thermal cameras has made
    airborne thermography more widely used. In addition, ICI camera was proven to
    be better than either the FLIR or thermomap camera for evaluating plants'' physiological
    and biochemical characteristics (Sagan et al., 2019a). However, atmospheric and
    emissivity calibration are remained challenges to thermal imaging. Likewise, hyperspectral
    sensors on the multi-rotor UAP were used to predict the yield of winter barley
    (Oehlschläger et al., 2018). Interestingly, for that, they used a mirror to guide
    the ground images into horizontally-positioned sensors. Compared with mere RGB
    data, collecting additional spectral data enables more robust predictions. In
    such a setting, RGB and multispectral sensors are integrated into the UAP, as
    was done to evaluate the yield of rice (Wan et al., 2020), plant height of sorghum
    (Kakeru et al., 2017), ground cover of cotton (Duan et al., 2017), and senescence
    rate of wheat (Muhammad et al., 2018). To obtain multi-source phenotypic data,
    three sensors are also employed on the multi-rotor UAP. For instance, an RGB camera,
    a multispectral camera, and an thermal IR imager were used together for cotton
    yield estimation (Feng et al., 2020). However, due to the limited payload, two
    independent flights of a multi-rotor UAP are occasionally required. For example,
    in assessing genotypic differences in durum wheat production, RGB images were
    obtained on the first flight and multispectral canopy information later collected
    on the second pass (Gracia-Romero et al., 2019). Compared to the multi-rotor,
    a fixed-wing UAP has longer flight time, higher flight altitude, greater payload,
    and faster flight speed. But the fixed-wing UAP lacks hovering capability and
    has certain requirements for its takeoff and landing (e.g., a runway). The flight
    speed may cause blurred images, a problem resolved by using imaging sensors with
    high frame rate and short exposure time (Shi et al., 2016b). Although the fixed-wing
    UAP does have a relatively large payload, it is almost always relied on a single
    sensor. For instance, an RGB camera mounted on Tuffing Mapper (Tuffing LLC, Boerne,
    USA) was used to evaluate the plant height of sorghum (Han et al., 2018). The
    fixed-wing UAP has a semi-autonomous horizontal takeoff and landing (HTOL), controlled
    by the Pixhawk controller. Similarly, an RGB camera, with an internal infrared
    filter removed for color infrared (CIR) detection, was used to assess the height
    and crown diameter of olive trees (Díaz-Varela et al., 2015). The eBee UAV (senseFly,
    http://www.geosense.gr/en/ebee/) is becoming a commonly used fixed-wing platform.
    A multispectral camera mounted on eBee was used to evaluate the yield of early
    wheat genotypes (Hu et al., 2020) and thermal camera performance (Sagan et al.,
    2019a), as well as for identifying, positioning, and mapping weedy patches of
    Silybum marianum (Tamouridou et al., 2017). Research on this platform shows that
    using its highest resolution fails to provide the highest accuracy for weed classification.
    To assess the spatial variation of maize under low nitrogen stress, Zaman-Allah
    et al. (2015) developed a fixed-wing UAP with a multispectral camera and a thermal
    camera, controlled by an automatic navigation system. Fixed-wing UAPs have enough
    of a payload to carry three sensors. The Anaconda (ReadyMadeRC, Lewis Center,
    Ohio), fixed-wing UAP equipped with two multispectral cameras and a high-resolution
    digital camera, was used to collect phenotype data of corn and sorghum (Shi et
    al., 2016a), for which it employed the traditional configuration of a twin boom
    thruster. Interestingly, an external GPS unit was added to the digital camera
    for accurate positional information. Although the 3DR Pixhawk autopilot system
    has been applied for autonomous takeoff and landing, during its flight the Anaconda
    must be controlled manually. Ingeniously, the unmanned helicopter is an alternative
    type of UAP. For example, the Pheno-Copter (gas-powered) with a visible camera,
    a NIR camera, and a thermal IR camera was applied to measure sorghum ground cover,
    sugarcane canopy temperature, and crop lodging (Chapman et al., 2014). However,
    Pheno-Copter''s flight needs to be controlled from a ground station, and this
    often requires specialized training. If accurate geo-registration accompanies
    the image acquisition process of UAP, precise micro-plot extractions should be
    greatly improved (Hearst, 2014). To achieve this goal, he sensor configuration
    pattern must also undergo improvement. The data collected by UAP requires a GNSS
    and an inertial navigation system (INS) for spatial matching and georeferencing.
    To facilitate the calculation of the camera''s actual geographic location corresponding
    to a given image acquisition, a more than 60% overlap of adjacent images is generally
    needed (Jin et al., 2017). In this context, the spatial offset (lever arm) and
    angle relationship (boresight angles) between the GNSS/INS unit and sensors are
    of great significance. Furthermore, compared with the lever arm, the boresight
    angle matters more. In view of this, Habib et al. (2018) recently employed a UAP,
    with push-broom hyperspectral sensors, to establish three boresight angle-calibration
    methods (around GCPs, tie points, and approximate means). While spatial positioning
    information may be obtained from an airborne GNSS/INS unit, its resolution is
    not high enough. Therefore, in order to carry out high-precision geographical
    referencing, establishing a proper layout of ground control points (GCPs) and
    calibration boards is necessary (Yu et al., 2016). Further, multifunctional GCPs
    were suggested for calibrating geometric and reflectance, and their usage significantly
    improved the phenotyping accuracy and also reduced manpower (Thomasson et al.,
    2019). Likewise, Han and Thomasson (2019) developed an automatic mobile GCP equipped
    with two RTK-GPS units, a navigation computer, and an integrated driving controller.
    It can reliably recognize and predict the behavior and activities of the UAP during
    the flight instead of traditional fixed GCPs, which explores the potential of
    improving the accuracy and efficiency of data collection. Since the relevant airspace
    regulations remain strict, the huge potential of UAP cannot yet be fully exploited.
    Despite being susceptible to weather, payload, endurance, and aviation regulatory
    constraints, UAPs characterized by large-scale phenotyping, efficiency, flexible
    flight plans, and relatively low cost have gradually shifted the trend in phenotypic
    missions from the ground into the air. In recent years, with policy adjustment,
    hardware optimization, commercial UAVs'' price reduction, advances in battery
    technology, and operation simplicity, UAP has come to fully display its outstanding
    abilities in plant phenotyping and plant science. Developing strategies for crop
    phenotype by remote sensing (Yang et al., 2017), improving performance such as
    endurance, payload, and stability, reducing the cost of sensors, and promoting
    data processing capabilities are the future trends of UAP. Manned Aerial Platform
    (MAP) The MAP is converted from a manned helicopter or fixed-wing aircraft, by
    mounting to it the phenotype acquisition kit, placed in a cargo pod or directly
    installed on the step (via a bracket), with a passenger(s) evaluating the images
    and giving feedback on their quality to the pilot, in real time, via a video monitor
    in the cockpit. The phenotypic equipment used for this entail sensors, GPS unit,
    gyroscopes and/or inertial measurement units. Although the MAP is capable of carrying
    multiple sensors for complicated phenotypic tasks, this has not been fully exploited,
    likely because it would depend on much manual participation. For example, just
    one radiometric calibration thermal camera in the cargo pod of a helicopter was
    employed for collecting canopy temperature (Deery et al., 2016)—and a passenger
    must be present to perform the image assessment and provide feedback. For this,
    an RGB camera can be remotely controlled and triggered by an operator, to watch
    the “real situation” through a video monitor in the cockpit (Yang and Hoffmann,
    2015). For estimating the aboveground biomass (AGB) and underground biomass (BGB)
    of maize, LiDAR was also installed on a MAP, to collect point-cloud data at the
    nominal height of 1,500 m (Li et al., 2015). High imaging heights and airspeeds
    certainly make the acquisition of phenotypic data at a high resolution and accuracy
    more challenging. Similarly, MAP can also make effective use of pre-existing agricultural
    machinery, and can overcome challenging weather conditions to a certain extent
    because of flight stability. Nevertheless, conducting phenotypic experiments with
    MAP demands a specific amount of manpower and inevitably involves high costs.
    For example, MAP requires a trained pilot with relevant qualifications to operate
    the helicopter or plane, and a passenger on board doing the monitoring, assessing,
    communicating, and manual imaging. Moreover, considering the cost and technical
    issues, the advantages of MAP have not been fully exploited (i.e., flight altitude,
    flight speed, carrying capacity). Perhaps that''s why MAP''s prominence has dropped
    sharply in crop phenotyping, precisely because of UAP''s unparalleled advantages,
    which enable it to complete the consistent phenotypic tasks and thus progressively
    supplant MAP. Satellite Platform Satellites can provide panchromatic imagery,
    multispectral imagery, or radio detection and ranging (RADAR) data. Panchromatic
    images of a single-band are displayed as gray-scale images with high resolution
    but limited spectral information, whereas multispectral images have a rich spectrum
    yet with relatively low resolution. Thus, these obtained panchromatic and multispectral
    images are usually merged by panchromatic sharpening or pan-sharpening, to obtain
    multispectral raster data having a high resolution. However, such optical satellite
    phenotyping is susceptible to uncooperative weather conditions, such as cloudy,
    rain, fog, and haze, and it also suffers from visible light saturation (Jin et
    al., 2015). In this case, RADAR and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data are able
    compensate for this defect extremely well. This is due to the unique sensitivity
    of crop structure to microwaves, which effectively improves the availability of
    the satellite platform. WorldView series, RapidEye, GeoEye-1, SPOT series, QuickBird,
    Ikonos, Planet Scope, Pleiades series, KOMPSAT series, Satellite for Earth Observation
    series, Landsat series, Gaofen series, and SkySat series are currently the main
    satellite HT3Ps that can obtain color and multispectral images (Jin et al., 2020).
    Those satellite platforms able to obtain RADAR data are mainly Sentinel-1, RADARSAT-2,
    ENVISAT, TerraSAR-X/TanDEM-X, and RISAT-2 (Zhang et al., 2020). In recent years,
    with the rapid development of satellite HT3Ps, there is increasingly more research
    on plant phenotyping done using satellite data. For example, multispectral data
    of GeoEye-1 satellite was used to evaluate the nitrogen status and spatial variability
    of different species of turfgrass (Caturegli et al., 2015), leading to an important
    guiding principle for turf fertilization management. The RapidEye satellite provides
    five bands with a spatial resolution of 5 m: blue, green, red, red-edge, and near
    infrared. Its multispectral images were used to study the variable rate of wheat
    nitrogen fertilizer effects (Basso et al., 2016). In evaluating the crop angle
    of indentation (CAI), Chauhan et al. (2020) relied on Sentinel-1 and radarsat-2
    (multi-incidence angle) data and went on to evaluate the severity of crop lodging.
    An interesting satellite platform, FLuorescence EXplorer (FLEX), is equipped with
    a single payload fluorescence imaging spectrometer (FLORIS) that combines spectral
    and spatial resolution to retrieve and interpret the full chlorophyll fluorescence
    spectra emitted by terrestrial vegetation (Drusch et al., 2017). It is scheduled
    to launch in 2022 and will fly in the same orbit as Sentinel-3; hence, the availability
    and interoperability of auxiliary information. The ability to process large-scale
    satellite phenotypic data at low cost according to international standard protocols
    is a key advantage of satellite phenotyping. Some satellites provide free data
    to would-be users, but the acquisition of high-precision commercial satellite
    data normally has a monetary charge. Fortunately, the cost of accessing to satellite
    data is now modest. Still, both panchromatic and multispectral imaging done by
    satellites remains susceptible to interference of atmospheric, clouds, and fog.
    In addition, the resolution issue—such as Pleiades-1a, 0.5 m; SPOT 6, 1.5 m; Planet
    Scope 3.0 m; Rapid Eye, 5.0 m, to name a few—and the data revisit period are also
    limiting factors. Fortunately, satellite resolution is making continuous progress
    as satellite technology advances. For instance, the Finnish technology start-up
    ICEYE has released commercial spaceborne SAR samples with the highest resolution
    (0.25 m) currently available worldwide. In the near future, low-orbiting nanosatellites
    and microsatellites with high spatiotemporal resolution may become join the prevailing
    aeronautical HT3Ps. HT3PS'' Combination for Comparative Validation or Comprehensive
    Analysis A typical comprehensive HT3P consists of four components: sensor, platform,
    analysis, and visualization. Together, these should be able to perform high-throughput
    and non-destructive acquisition of a substantial amount of data on dynamic phenotypic
    traits of cultivated plants and their environmental characteristics, as well as
    providing multi-omics analyses, completing the entire phenotyping process from
    a holistic perspective, thereby ultimately facilitating crop improvement and molecular
    breeding of plants (as shown in Figure 4). Since the various types of HT3Ps each
    have their own unique merits—Table 4 summaries the advantages and disadvantages
    of miscellaneous HT3Ps—with traditional manual measurements usually needed to
    take relative real data for comparison and verification, pursuing combinations
    of differing HT3Ps offers a way to break away from traditional phenotyping and
    obtain comprehensive high-precision phenotypic data. Several common and typical
    combinations of diverse HT3Ps are highlighted in Table 5. figure 4 FIGURE 4. Typical
    comprehensive HT3P components: (a) sensor, (b) platform, (c) analysis, (d) visualization;
    HT3P performs the entire workflow of phenotyping: (1) cultivation of plants, (2)
    extraction of phenotypic traits, (3) acquisition of environmental parameters,
    (4) data processing, (5) multi-omics analysis, and, ultimately, (6) aiding in
    crop improvement. table 4 TABLE 4. Overview of the comparison of advantages and
    disadvantages of the different types of HT3Ps. table 5 TABLE 5. Overview of typical
    applications of HT3Ps when used in combination. HT3Ps'' Combination for Comparative
    Validation Some combinations of HT3Ps seek to compare and validate the phenotypic
    performance by applying different types of HT3Ps and thereby bypass traditional
    manual measurements entirely. For instance, Andrade-Sanchez et al. (2014) modified
    a sprayer to function as a mobile platform, to simultaneously collect canopy height,
    reflectance, and temperature in four adjacent rows in a cotton field; it can carry
    four sets of sensors, including sonar sensors, IR radiometers, and multispectral
    canopy sensors. Then, to verify the data authenticity of the mobile platform,
    a MAP (helicopter) was applied to collect visible-near-infrared (VNIR) and thermal
    IR data. In other work, to evaluate the plant height of wheat, a mobile platform
    with LiDAR and a UAP with RGB cameras were jointly used to generate 3D dense-point
    clouds (Madec et al., 2017). However, because of the low resolution of RGB images
    from UAP and the strong penetrability of LiDAR of the mobile platform, plant height
    measurement based on UAP was underestimated. Similarly, Khan et al. (2018) combined
    a mobile platform and a UAP to collect RGB images, which revealed that canopy
    height obtained from the mobile platform is more accurate than UAP, whereas the
    plant vigor evaluated from the UAP is more precise. A multi-rotor UAP, with an
    RGB camera and a fixed-wing UAP with a hyperspectral push-broom scanner, was devised
    by Habib et al. (2017) to verify the feasibility of using RGB-based orthophotos
    to improve the geometric features of hyperspectral orthophotos. In addition, the
    combination of a UAP and four satellites was implemented to compare the phenotypic
    capabilities of different resolutions in dry bean (Sankaran et al., 2019), whose
    results indicated that using sub-meter resolution satellites as HT3Ps holds promising
    application prospects for field crop phenotyping. While some combinations of different
    types HT3Ps are still based on the time-consuming and laborious traditional field
    measurements, these will gradually disappear with the stabilization and improvement
    of the advanced HT3Ps. The combination of various types of HT3Ps for cross-validation
    is gradually moving forward, representing a landmark step in the field of plant
    phenotyping. HT3Ps'' Combination for Comprehensive Analysis Some HT3Ps'' performance
    aspects are combined to realize the fusion of multi-source data for collaborative
    and comprehensive phenotyping. For example, using both a mobile platform and a
    tower-based platform for canopy scale and single plant phenotyping has been proposed
    by Shafiekhani et al. (2017). As an autonomous mobile platform, Vinobot, with
    its stereo cameras installed on the robotic arm, can autonomously navigate in
    the field and collect data on individual plant traits. The tower-based Vinoculer
    can inspect a large-area canopy phenotype, and delegate specific regions to Vinobot
    for elaborate phenotyping, which greatly improves the flexibility and purposiveness.
    A robotic mobile platform and a UAP collected complementary multispectral data,
    which let investigators obtain comprehensive crop phenotypes (Ingunn et al., 2017).
    Specifically, that mobile platform provided detailed traits information of plants
    and the UAP obtained calibrated NDVI, and together they further predicted the
    heading date and yield. One multi-rotor UAP with an RGB camera, and another with
    a multispectral camera, were combined to monitor tomato crops, so as to formulate
    management measures and determine the best management scheme for specific fields
    (Marconi et al., 2019). Likewise, Anderson et al. (2020) employed a rotary-wing
    UAP and a fixed-wing UAP to monitor a track of plant height growth of an recombinant
    inbred line (RIL) maize population; hence, they could, for the first time, elucidate
    dynamic characteristics of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in real time under the
    field conditions. In addition, Deery et al. (2019) designed a MAP with airborne
    thermal IR cameras and a pole-based platform (Arducrop wireless IR thermometers)
    and used it to continuously measure crop CT (canopy temperature). To fill the
    temporal gap in the availability of satellite data and improve the usability of
    UAP, Sagan et al. (2019b) merged RGB, thermal, and multi-spectral images from
    UAP with VNIR and SWIR imagery taken by the WorldView-3 satellite, applying them
    to crop monitoring and early stress detection on a temporal scale, which contributed
    to form field-scale coordinated data of UAV and satellite virtual constellation.
    The imaging distance of various HT3Ps will engender a differing spatial resolution
    and pixel size. Taking ground coverage (GC) as an example, the pixel size of an
    RGB image has a huge impact on the accuracy of GC''s evaluation (Hu et al., 2019).
    In addition, there are significant disparities among different types of HT3Ps,
    such as their time resolution, weather dependence, experimental scale, and financial
    investment, to name a few. This means that combinations of HT3Ps ought to steer
    toward actual phenotypic requirements and concrete practical issues. Along with
    further refinement of plant phenotyping, the future HT3P portfolio is expected
    to integrate multi-site distributed platforms, single-point centralized platforms,
    and cloud-based platforms, to deeply mine and dissect multi-source phenotypic
    data from dynamic time series at multiple scales, for multiple species, and under
    multiple scenarios. Furthermore, to effectively integrate existing HT3Ps, phenotyping
    technology, phenotypic methods, data availability, and resources, to speed up
    the emergence of high-quality phenotypic achievements and accelerate crop breeding,
    while also reducing duplication of research and investment, more international
    and regional organizations, or initiatives (see Table 6) have come into being.
    table 6 TABLE 6. Overview of international organizations or regional initiatives
    contributing to plant phenotyping. Simulation HT3P The simulated HT3P aims to
    model plant growth, phenotypic expression, and phenotyping at various scales.
    It does this by integrating multi-source information in a modeling framework,
    such as that of germplasm resources, irrigation, fertilization, nutritional substance,
    spatial climate, soil environment, terrain properties and management records.
    For example, a digital plant phenotyping platform (D3P) would use environmental
    variables, crop management, and meteorological information as input, to generate
    3D virtual canopy structure. Based on this, the collection of virtual canopy phenotypic
    traits can be performed by RGB, multi-spectral, and LiDAR simulators (Liu et al.,
    2019). For whole forests with large cover areas, long-lived cycles and high heterogeneity,
    Dungey et al. (2018) provided a prototype of a landscape-scale HT3P simulator,
    by consolidating remote sensing topography, environmental impacts, spatial abiotic
    information, management records and genomics into the modeling framework. It aimed
    to eliminate some traditional limitations in tree breeding programs and provide
    genetic gains in tree fitness. By combining genomics, high-throughput phenotyping,
    and simulation modeling, we can obtain an adequate but sound understanding of
    phenotypic traits and their variation (Varshney et al., 2018). The application
    of various complex models to combine simulations with empirical methods will contribute
    markedly to accelerating the process of extracting ideal phenotypic traits for
    use in crop improvement. Future Prospects for HT3P The concept of HT3P is rather
    grand, such that the development and innovation of HT3Ps depends on the cross-disciplinary
    cooperation of agronomy, robotics, computer, automation, artificial intelligence,
    and big data, requiring the participation of experts—breeders, agronomists, plant
    scientists, mechanical engineers—and leadership from interdisciplinary talent
    of open innovation teams. Whether HT3P is phenotyping in the greenhouse or in
    the field, ground-based proximal phenotyping or aerial large-scale remote sensing,
    the future of HT3Ps lies in improving spatial-temporal resolution, sensor integration,
    turnaround time in data analysis, human-machine interaction, operational stability,
    throughput, automation, operability, and accessibility. It is worth noting that
    the development, selection, and utilization of HT3Ps should be orientated by concrete
    project requirements, specific phenotypic tasks, and practical application scenarios,
    such as the field coverage (Kim, 2020), rather than assuming that more devices,
    technologies, and funds with which the HT3P is equipped, the better; partly because
    the collection of a large amount of data does not mean all of it is useful (Haagsma
    et al., 2020). Even in some cases, the experimental effects of applying single
    and multiple sensors are identical (Meacham-Hensold et al., 2020), and the data
    obtained from multiple devices are redundant. However, the combinations of various
    HT3Ps for comparative validation and comprehensive analysis could provide broad
    application prospects for inspection, extraction, and quantification of complex
    physiological functional phenotypes. Yet the technical issues of formulating standards
    and synchronizing calibrations for these multiple combinations are daunting tasks.
    Fortunately, the involvement of meta-analysis ensures the objectivity of HT3P
    development and selection. For example, Young (2019) applied meta-analysis method
    to develop an evaluation framework that can quantitatively and objectively assess
    the complexity and utility scores of high-throughput systems. As an effective
    analytical method of quantitative, scientific synthesis of research results (Gurevitch
    et al., 2018), meta-analysis may prove especially fruitful in the near future.
    Specifically, the future conveyor-type HT3P requires consideration of operational
    stability and environmental homogeneity, and allowing phenotypic analysis for
    multi-level subtle traits of a wide variety of representative plants will be a
    key design factor to the development of the future benchtop-type HT3P. Scalability,
    rotatability and multi-site deployment will be the prospective features of pole/tower-based
    HT3Ps, and economically-efficient distributed ones will perform outstandingly
    in the calibration of high-dimensional phenotypic data. Mobile HT3Ps that can
    be transported to the experimental site are preferred by phenotypic researchers
    rather than the experiment coming to the limited platform (Roitsch et al., 2019).
    This means that the development of mobile HT3P needs to move toward flexibility
    and portability, and that modular and customizable design will be welcomed by
    the phenotyping community. The reduction of volume and cost is the major consideration
    for future gantry-based HT3P designs, and the new cable-suspended HT3P will have
    the ability to monitor continuously and consistently crop growth and development
    at low altitudes over long periods of time. As for UAP, the development of compact
    lightweight sensor configuration that is sensitive to plant-specific phenotypic
    traits will be a breakout (Xie and Yang, 2020). In addition, advanced battery
    technology is in dire need of a stage breakthrough, which can greatly improve
    the endurance, payload, and power of the UAV. For satellite phenotyping, improving
    image resolution and shortening the revisit cycle remain the focus of satellite
    platform development. Additionally, cost-effective platforms also warrant consideration,
    as smart phone, handheld portable instrument, backpack system, and wearable device
    are adopted and updated for utilization in phenotyping. High-throughput data acquisition,
    data management, data interpretation, modeling, integration, and application together
    form the core and pillar of plant phenotyping. The main challenges faced by the
    new generation of phenotyping are data handling, images processing, and traits
    analyzing (Fahlgren et al., 2015a; Campbell et al., 2018; Hickey et al., 2019).
    Fortunately, the introduction of various software, web-based tools, pipelines,
    toolkits, deep learning tools, and online repository solutions to assist phenotypic
    researchers in processing phenotypic data will break through these technical bottlenecks.
    For example, a free multi-purpose software—Coverage Tool—can semi-automatically
    quantify a wide range of visual plant traits (Merchuk-Ovnat et al., 2019). Web-based
    image analysis tools, such as Field Phenomics (Guzman et al., 2015), are considered
    by us to be a hotspot for phenotypic solutions. Kar et al. (2020) developed an
    analysis pipeline with outlier detection, missing value imputation, and spatial
    adjustment for solving the problem of inaccurate and missing phenotypic data.
    Toolkits tend to be relatively specific, such as Plant 3D (P3D), which specializes
    in analyzing 3D point cloud data of plant structures (Ziamtsov and Navlakha, 2020).
    With the advancement of HT3P, their improving high-throughput and efficiency will
    produce increasingly big data. For huge datasets, deep learning tools are needed;
    however, only when large datasets that capture shared problems become available
    can the greatest benefit be gained from the application of deep learning tools.
    Online databases, such as http://www.plant-image-analysis.org, can effectively
    bridge the gap between developers and users, but still lack comprehensive management
    platforms that cover software, web-based tools, pipelines, toolkits, deep learning
    tools, and other phenotypic solutions, which will be a milestone breakthrough
    as well as a considerable challenge. With the emergence of various HT3Ps, experimental
    designs, phenotyping methods, standardized management, both phenotype acquisition
    and its data analysis are becoming extremely prominent. Phenotypic data that costs
    substantial capital, labor, time, and energy, however, may 1 day be abandoned
    forever (Mir et al., 2019). Presently, a standard phenotyping agreement or data
    analysis methodology for plant phenotyping has yet to be established (Mahlein
    et al., 2019). The standardization of data and metadata from the HT3Ps contributes
    to an improved data utilization rate and it ensures the interoperability of data
    providers and experimental replication. Otherwise, data that is poor annotated
    and in a disorderly format may generate noise or disordered waves. Fortunately,
    relevant standard constraints are being proposed. For example, Krajewski et al.
    (2015) published a technical paper offering effective recommendations (at http://cropnet.pl/phenotypes)
    and initiatives (such as http://wheatis.org), making a further step toward establishing
    internationally practical solutions. Moreover, originating the relevant standardization
    of phenotyping can strengthen the comprehension and explanation of biological
    phenomena, contributing to the transformation of biological knowledge and establishment
    of a real coherent semantic network. Conclusions HT3P is a novel and powerful
    tool for obtaining plant-deep phenotypes (morphological structure, physiological
    function, component content) and dense phenotypes in complex field setting, which
    cannot be accomplished by traditional phenotyping approaches. This paper reviewed
    the application of HT3Ps in the growth chamber or greenhouse with strictly controlled
    environmental conditions and field phenotyping with notoriously heterogeneous
    conditions and uncontrollable environmental factors. Then, according to platform
    configuration and operation mode, further classifications were performed to provide
    comprehensive overview and description and assessment of the various types of
    HT3Ps currently available. The unique characteristics, applications, and strengths
    and weaknesses of various HT3Ps were emphasized. Going further, the simulation
    platform, various combinations of HT3Ps for comparative validation or comprehensive
    analysis, current phenotypic challenges, and the future development trends of
    HT3Ps were discussed. With the assistance of powerful HT3Ps, phenomics has arguably
    entered a new stage (Tardieu et al., 2017). At this stage, the new and pressing
    challenge of next generation phenotyping will be to reasonably combine phenotypic
    experiments, various HT3Ps, models, data processing and handling scheme, meta-analysis,
    and visualization of phenotypic information for optimizing the allocation of research
    resources, efficiently accomplishing complex phenotypic tasks, and transforming
    massive multi-source phenotypic data into statistical and biological knowledge.
    Robust phenotyping is central to plant breeding (Hickey et al., 2019), and the
    development of satisfying crop varieties with high-yielding and strong stress
    resistance is the ultimate goal of crop breeding. High-throughput sequencing activity
    underpins the fast development of genomics (Shah et al., 2018). Likewise, HT3P
    as a novel and powerful phenotyping tool will explore a new period of rapid development
    in phenomics. Further, combining morphological, physiological, and elemental phenotyping
    with multi-omics methods from the perspective of holistic omics will usher in
    a new era of botany phenotyping. Author Contributions DL and CL guided the writing

  description: Increasing food demand, with the burgeoning population worldwide is
    reaching an alarming condition along with depleting resources and unpredictable
    climatic vagaries. Thus, twenty-first century agriculture is facing a daunting
    task of developing high-yielding and multiple stress tolerant plants to ensure
    food security. Thus, in-depth analysis of crop stress response is essentially
    required. Therefore, linking phenomics with crop breeding programs can fill the
    gap between complex targeted traits and genotypic responses. Phenotyping ensures
    reliable data for predicted trait, during identification and selection of improved
    varieties in conventional breeding programs. Besides this, high-throughput phenotyping
    helps in delineating phenotypic and genotypic associations along with characterization
    of potential genomic regions for forward genetics in molecular breeding. Recent
    advancements in high-throughput automated imaging techniques provide huge amount
    of data and high-resolution images. To make precise decisions, specific tools
    are required to disentangle this huge array of data. We uncovered here a comprehensive
    overview of (1) phenomic techniques for climate smart agriculture, (2) association
    between breeding and phenomics, and (3) strategies for big data analysis for crop
    improvement programs. To conclude, automated plant phenotyping techniques are
    precise tools for in-depth analysis and identification of traits responsible for
    crop improvement.

    stress Signalling 1.1 Introduction Human population is estimated to reach from
    6.8 billion to 9.1 billion by 2050, which requires a steep incline in crop production
    to fulfil the requirements of growing population, despite accelerated urbanization
    and shrinking cultivable area (Joshi et al. 2016a; Kumar et al. 2020). However,
    global warming and unpredictable climatic vagaries posed by various biotic and
    abiotic stresses have challenged worldwide crop growth and productivity (Ramegowda
    and Senthil-Kumar 2015; Pereira 2016; Pandey et al. 2017), leading to loss of
    crop productivity worth several billion dollars (Dhankher and Foyer 2018). Unlike
    animals, plants cannot escape from unfavourable environmental conditions such
    as drought, salinity, and cold stress. With continuous changes in the global climate,
    these stresses will further aggravate in future and drastically alter the genotype–environment
    interaction, resulting in changes of plant’s basic metabolism representing its
    phenotype (Gupta et al. 2015). The potential of any genotype under any stress
    can be assessed by examining its phenotypic changes under controlled environmental,
    or in the field conditions to evaluate the regulatory elements during plant’s
    stress response (Farooq et al. 2014; Mickelbart et al. 2015). In postgenomic era,
    efficient utilization of crop genetic resources relies on precise examination
    of phenotypic response database under particular stress, which are getting more
    complex with current explosion of OMICS datasets (Singh et al. 2018a; Kumar et
    al. 2020). Wilhelm Johannsen coined the term “Phenotype” (phainein = show and
    typos = type) in 1911. From 1949 till 2013, “phenomics” was defined as high-throughput
    and accurate acquisition and multidimensional analysis of phenotypes (Davis 1949;
    Houle et al. 2010), while “phenotyping” is a set of methodologies and protocols
    for accurate measurement of plant phenotype (Fiorani and Schurr 2013). However,
    next-generation sequencing and genotyping have immensely improved functional genomics
    (Zhang et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2020), but lack of phenotypic data acquisition
    restricts crop breeding studies (Furbank et al. 2019; Yang et al. 2020). Thus,
    there is great concern regarding precise phenotyping of plant stress-associated
    traits (Yang et al. 2013). However, traditional methods of crop phenotyping are
    destructive to plants, labour intensive, time consuming and subjective (Yao et
    al. 2018). Thus, development and integration of automated phenotyping with stress
    related traits by generating precise, high-resolution, and high-throughput data
    are currently required (Maphosa et al. 2016) to help crop breeders to adroitly
    identify tolerant genotypes for development of climate change resilient crops
    (Kumar et al. 2020). This chapter focuses on recent advances and challenges in
    utilizing phenotyping techniques, along with analysing big data and their integration
    with crop breeding programs in generating climate-resilient crop plants. In addition,
    we discuss high-throughput phenotyping combined with genetic studies to provide
    our perspectives on phenotyping for crop improvement. 1.2 Prioritizing Climate-Smart
    Agriculture Severe environmental constraints adversely affect crop growth and
    productivity (Umezawa et al. 2006). The 1960’s Green Revolution results in steep
    inclination in the yield of staple food grains to fulfil the need of burgeoning
    world population. Increase in food security benefitted agricultural development,
    reduced poverty and malnourishment in several parts of the world. Future food
    security will focus on reducing crop losses due to environmental vagaries with
    transformative advances in improving crop yield. Tremendous advancements in genomics
    have advanced crop breeding to enhance trait development for improved productivity
    and climate resilience. Thus, greater understanding of plant mechanisms and designing
    novel strategies to engineer for stress tolerance in plants under variable environments
    is essential for crop improvement through genetic diversity, genome-scale breeding,
    genetic engineering, and precise agronomic practices (Gupta et al. 2015; Bailey-Serres
    et al. 2019). High-throughput phenotyping plays key role in crop breeding for
    development of robust model across multiple environments, due to their cost effectiveness
    and ease of measurement (Crossa et al. 2017). However, limited advancement in
    phenomics in comparison to genomics is responsible for its poor application in
    detecting potential of different crop genotypes. Development of high-yielding,
    climate smart varieties is restricted due to manual, slow, and subjective phenotyping.
    Thus there is a global need to develop high-throughput, high-resolution, non-destructive
    plant phenomics approaches in our breeding systems, which allow measurement of
    nonvisible phenotypic changes and integrate technologies to enable reproducible
    and regulated image analyses in both controlled and field conditions (Singh et
    al. 2018a). Precision phenotyping of abiotic stress-associated traits and their
    interrelationships provides a holistic approach for precise understanding of environmentally
    regulated traits, to precisely elucidate the adaptive mechanisms (Yang et al.
    2013). It can also identify trait–SNP relationships and allelic variations germplasm
    for breeding or introgression through crossing or genetic engineering (Bortesi
    and Fischer 2015; Furbank et al. 2019). Several QTLs have been characterized in
    different crops based on automatic plant phenotyping centres established in various
    countries (Zhang et al. 2017). 1.3 Phenomics of Abiotic Stress Tolerance Abiotic
    stresses arising due to climatic changes are the primary causal factors affecting
    crop biomass and growth, resulting in global annual yield loss (Verma and Deepti
    2016). Abiotic stresses are complex and dynamic and demonstrate osmotic and metabolic
    crosstalk. Therefore, detailed analysis for improved understanding in multifaceted
    responses of crop species against abiotic stresses requires an integrated approach
    of phenomics and genomics (Kumar et al. 2020). Phenotypic effects depend on both
    the organ and tissue affected by the stress and the duration and level of stress
    (Joshi et al. 2016b; Singh et al. 2018b). Thus, visualization of abiotic stress-responsive
    traits and its correlation with associated phenotypes is crucial for breeding
    tolerant plants, e.g., differences between green and yellow leaf areas (salinity
    stress); canopy temperature differences (drought stress); relative chlorophyll
    content and thermal imaging (Na+ exclusion and osmotic tolerance) (Munns et al.
    2010; Weirman 2010). The vegetation indices are also interrelated with different
    traits, i.e., photosynthetically active biomass, pigment content, water status,
    and stomatal closure which correlates total yield in various crops (Din et al.
    2017; Singh et al. 2018b). Similarly, phenotyping of roots still depends upon
    traditional methods, such as root excavation to determine density and length (Araus
    and Cairns 2014) which can be determined using advance root phenomics. Ex-situ
    evaluation exploits agar medium, hydroponics, aeroponics, and rhizotrons for capturing
    and visualizing images along with digital scanning and computerized image analysis
    for rapid root morphology evaluation (Vale and Fritsche-Neto 2015; Borianne et
    al. 2018; Kumar et al. 2020). Besides root phenomics, phenotyping in field, using
    non-destructive phenotyping tools such as thermal imaging and infra-red thermometry
    (IRT) are necessary to perceive and quantify the spectral reflectance, which is
    key factor towards breeding stress tolerant varieties (Fahlgren et al. 2015; Kumar
    et al. 2020). 1.3.1 High-Throughput Integrated Phenotyping Several large-scale,
    high-throughput and automated phenotyping platforms were established to screen
    different crops for quantitative genetics, reverse genetics, and forward genetics
    (Table 1.1). Automated weighing and red–green–blue (RGB) imaging systems, PHENOPSIS
    (2003) was initially used to analyse water deficit response in Arabidopsis (Granier
    et al. 2006), but lacks data integration. However, PHENOPSIS DB developed in 2011
    can store several hundred GB of metadata and images for data analysis modules
    (Fabre et al. 2011). Quantification of seedling growth dynamics under different
    light conditions was performed either through colour imaging device of GROWSCREEN
    (Walter et al. 2007) or chlorophyll fluorescence imaging system, GROWSCREEN FLUORO
    (Jansen et al. 2009). For large-scale phenotyping of shoot growth and water content,
    phenoscope rotating platform was designed to compensate environmental heterogeneity
    (Tisné et al. 2013) and phenovator utilizes high-speed system on rails to capture
    data on photosynthesis and plant growth parameters (Flood et al. 2016; Yang et
    al. 2020). Traitmill, a bioinformatics tool was developed by CropDesign (Belgium)
    for high-throughput phenotyping to determine morphometric yield related traits
    (Reuzeau et al. 2005). For analysis of phenomics data, Scanalyzer3D platform (LemnaTec
    GmbH, Germany) was developed. Similarly, to access nitrogen/water deficiency and
    salinity stress, plant accelerator (Australia) developed computer-regulated conveyor
    platform with automated weighing-watering and imaging (Neilson et al. 2015; Atieno
    et al. 2017). Table 1.1 A non-exhaustive list high-throughput phenotyping platforms
    with their modes of operation and application levels Full size table HTPheno is
    an open-source colour image-processing plugin ImageJ software, developed by the
    Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant Research (Hartmann et al. 2011).
    Similarly, Integrated Analysis Platform (IAP) is a Java based open-source program
    to derive images and models for analysis of drought response (Chen et al. 2014)
    and determination of genetic variation regulating growth dynamics (Muraya et al.
    2017). Similarly, Bellwether Phenotyping Platform developed a Scanalyzer3D system
    and PlantCV, opensource library (OpenCV, NumPy, and MatPlotLib) based platform-independent
    software for RGB, fluorescent, and NIR image processing (Fahlgren et al. 2015).
    A High-throughput Rice Phenotyping Facility (HRPF) was developed by Huazhong Agricultural
    University and Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China to analyse
    automatic controls, X-ray CT, colour imaging and analysis for plant architecture,
    leaf traits, and genetic variation (Guo et al. 2018; Duan et al. 2018; Zhang et
    al. 2017; Xiong et al. 2017; Fang et al. 2016). For cost-effective phenotyping
    and hyperspectral imaging of grass species under salt stress, an open-source and
    flexible phenotyping system, PhenoBox, was developed (Czedik-Eysenberg et al.
    2018). Further to quickly acquire data and high-resolution spatial images of large
    areas, drones (or UAVs) enabled with computer vision approaches, multi-view stereopsis,
    and photogrammetric techniques to provide a flexible platform. Thus, remote sensing
    is used to get detailed information on drought stress response, canopy colour
    and texture, leaf area index estimation, nutrient status, growth, weeds and pathogen
    detection, QTL identification (Yue et al. 2019; Yao et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2019;
    Madec et al. 2019; Zhao et al. 2018), seedling performance, and yield (Maes and
    Steppe 2019). In addition, advanced deep learning (DL) techniques can analyse
    millions of remote sensing images with high speed and accuracy (Li et al. 2020).
    For geometric morphometric analysis related to aboveground biomass and plant height,
    3D canopy modelling generates higher resolution (Maimaitijiang et al. 2019). Structure
    for motion (SFM) algorithms produce geometrically specific 3D point clouds at
    the subpixel level using 2D images generated through RGB sensors with quality
    and accuracy similar to LiDAR (Hassan et al. 2019). Thus, remote sensing using
    UAVs has demonstrated immense potential for high-throughput phenotyping to improve
    crop functional genomics and breeding (Yang et al. 2020). 1.3.2 Pocket Phenotyping
    Since long physiologists are using dedicated handheld portable tools for phenotyping
    and integral data standardization, multiple sensors with data analysis software
    combined with artificial intelligence and fifth generation mobile network for
    robust analysis under field conditions (Yang et al. 2020). Thus, next-generation
    “wearable” or “pocket” phenotyping gadgets will profoundly accelerate phenotyping.
    In addition, broad range of optical sensors will greatly enhance the portability
    and connectivity of phenotyping tools. PocketPlant3D is used to analyse whole
    canopy architecture (Confalonieri et al. 2017). Similarly, chlorophyll, a fluorescence
    kinetics can be measured with handheld Handy PEA—plant efficiency analyser(Hansatech
    Instruments, UK) under control and stress conditions in greenhouses and fields
    (Wungrampha et al. 2019). 1.3.3 Belowground Phenotyping In contrast to shoots,
    in situ phenotyping in underground root system architecture (RSA) is limited,
    which are crucial for water and nutrient absorption, directly affecting yield
    and biomass (Xiong et al. 2020). Broad range growth mediums such as transparent
    (gel-based, aeroponic, and hydroponic) and PlaRoM, enabled with RGB cameras were
    used to analyse root hair development and growth dynamics (Yazdanbakhsh and Fisahn
    2009). Initially for destructive analysis of the root system architecture at the
    field level, the roots were dig out, washed and analysed; which is termed as “shovelomics”
    (Trachsel et al. 2010). Later on non-destructive methods are also developed such
    as RADIX (a rhizoslide platform used to screen both roots and shoots; Le Marie
    et al. 2016), rhizoslides (a paper-based observation system for root growth; Le
    Marie et al. 2014), GROWSCREEN-Rhizo (for simultaneous imaging of roots and shoots
    in transparent soil-filled rhizotrons; Nagel et al. 2012), rhizoponics (a hydroponic
    rhizotron; Mathieu et al. 2015), and RhizoTubes (an automated “plant-sensing”
    platform; Jeudy et al. 2016). Further, semiautomatic (RootNav, Pound et al. 2013;
    SmartRoot, Lobet et al. 2011; RootTrace, French et al. 2009) and automatic (EZ-Root-VIS,
    Shahzad et al. 2018) softwares were developed for 2D image analysis of root system
    architecture. In addition, for 3D image reconstruction and analysis GiARoots (Galkovskyi
    et al. 2012) and RootReader3D (Clark et al. 2011) have been developed. Similarly,
    an open-source software RooTrak was developed for differential X-ray attenuation
    between roots and soil to recreate 3D root system architecture (Mairhofer et al.
    2015; Yang et al. 2020). Alternative techniques to reconstruct 3D root system
    architecture and root morphology include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; Schmittgen
    et al. 2015) and for non-destructive scanning of roots and carbon transportation
    positron emission tomography (PET; Metzner et al. 2015; Atkinson et al. 2019).
    Non-destructive root phenotyping remains a challenge till date and there is still
    need to develop breakthrough technologies for belowground imaging (Yang et al.
    2020). 1.3.4 Post-Harvest Phenotyping Economically important harvested part of
    the crop can be assessed for yield and quality through various sensors and GPS
    (global positioning system) installed in tractors and (combine) harvesters such
    as cotton (Pelletier et al. 2019), grain (Li et al. 2016) and blueberries (Farooque
    et al. 2013) yield determination. Various smart farming machines such as advanced
    farming system (AFS, Case IH, US) have been commercialized for quality assessment
    in the seed and milling industry, i.e., seed phenotyping using 2D imaging technologies
    (Gegas et al. 2010). Fully automatic machines for phenotyping of rice panicles,
    scoring yield traits (Duan et al. 2011), maize stalks (Mazaheri et al. 2019),
    kernels (Miller et al. 2017), and tassels (Gage et al. 2017) have been developed.
    In addition, user friendly and free-use image analysis software such as SmartGrain
    is used to analyse seed shape and size (Tanabata et al. 2012), PANorama (Crowell
    et al. 2014) for efficient quantification of traits related to rice panicle and
    grain, P-TRAP (AL-Tam et al. 2013) and GrainScan, for traits related to colour
    and size (Whan et al. 2014). Further, android based mobile application, SeedCounter,
    is developed to measure grain size and number (Komyshev et al. 2016). Ultimately,
    combination of multidimensional seed traits with genetic analysis tools and developing
    cost-effective photonics-based phenotyping tools will improve the extendibility
    and reliability of future crop research (Yang et al. 2020). 1.4 High-Throughput
    Phenotyping to Strengthen Trait Mapping Genetic mapping, also as linkage mapping,
    is a process to fix the locus of a gene and the relative distances between the
    genes on a chromosome (https://www.genome.gov). Genetic mapping aims to locate
    a group of DNA markers onto their respective positions on the genome, so that
    the genes in relation to phenotype can be earmarked. In 1911, Morgan first explained
    the concept of linkage map in Drosophila melanogaster (Morgan 1911). Later on,
    during meiosis, identification of recombinant gametes due to crossover enables
    genetic distance calculation between two loci (Sturtevant 1913). Genetic mapping
    requires the heritable trait, availability of polymorphic DNA markers and mapping
    populations segregating for the trait of interest. A variety of mapping populations
    are deployed to map and locate the genes or QTL in concert with phenotyping of
    the population. There are two main types of populations deployed to map the gene(s),
    viz. naturally available individuals of one species also called germplasms and/or
    synthetic population created by involving bi- or multi-parents differencing for
    the traits to be studied. The construction of synthetic population is advisable,
    where the controlled breeding and shorter life cycle in animals/plants are amenable.
    It is always preferred to take the extreme phenom expressing parents for the gene
    under target to construct mapping population. Synthetic population in plants is
    also depends on the mode of reproduction, i.e., self naturally/manually and on
    the other hand self-incompatible and inbreeding sensitive. Hence the kind of mapping
    population depends on the availability of plant material types. The mapping populations
    appropriate for self-fertilizing plants are F2 generation plants, recombinant
    inbred lines and introgression lines are popular. While, inbreeding sensitive
    or self-incompatible heterozygous parents are used only to derive mapping populations
    such as F1, double haploid lines and backcross populations are applicable to both
    the aforementioned types. In case of barley, high degree of correlation between
    images of HTP platform [“Plant Accelerator”, Adelaide, Australia] and actual biomass
    accumulation was demonstrated in 47 juveniles (6 weeks old) barley introgression
    lines during drought. Subsequently, 44 QTL for 14 traits such as water use efficiency
    and growth rate were mapped and revealed that juvenile plant phenotyping can predict
    the performance of adult plant in barley (Honsdorf et al. 2014). SmartGrain software
    for high-throughput measurement of seed shape in backcrossed inbred lines obtained
    by crossing japonica rice cultivars Nipponbare and Koshihikari detected several
    QTLs for six shape parameters (Tanabata et al. 2012). Similarly, using rice automatic
    phenotyping platform (RAP), Zhang et al. (2017) quantified 106 traits (ten plant
    morphological, 64 growth-related traits, six histogram texture, three biomass-related,
    one plant colour, and 22 leaf architecture) in maize RILs (n = 167) from sixteen
    developmental stages. For all investigated traits, 988 QTLs were identified including
    three QTL hotspots. The power of high-throughput phenotyping enabled near precision
    prediction of yield and biomass, using early stage trait combinations in maize.
    1.5 Trait Associations Breeding is a process of trait’s value addition in an individual
    through recombination and selection. Having conspicuous phenotype at field is
    difficult for most of the quantitative traits specifically for nutritional and
    stress tolerant traits. Therefore, breeding prioritization of such traits stands
    after yield. Nevertheless, the present advancement in genomics and phenomics guide
    in selection and improvement of such traits by studying various other associated
    traits. Recently, various researchers have developed successful varieties/breeds
    in different crops and dairy animals by using trait association models. Longitudinal
    traits express throughout the life cycle of an individual (Oliveira et al. 2019a,
    b). Hence, measurement of such traits helps to build the genotype specific phenotypic
    expression model for various stress responses and developmental milestones. This
    information can also be used to uncover the time specific expression of complex
    polygenic traits (Collet and Fellous 2019). In barley, various sensors captured
    images on daily basis over 58 days of variable stress treatments using visible
    light, near infra-red (NIR) and fluorescence spectrum to dissect phenotypic mechanism
    of drought (Chen et al. 2014). Likewise, Neilson et al. (2015) explored the growth
    dynamics and fertility in sorghum under different levels of water stress and capture
    images using NIR, RGB, and laser scanning cameras for traits such as leaf greenness,
    tiller number, height, shoot biomass, and leaf area. Tillering in rice was modelled
    using about 700 associated traits derived from a computed tomography (CT) based
    Red–Green–Blue (RGB) imaging system during vegetative period (Wu et al. 2019).
    1.6 Next-Generation Phenotyping and Genome-Wide Association Studies Free accessibility
    of whole genome sequence data across a number of plant species has opened exciting
    avenues to perform genome-wide scans for trait analysis. Advances in next-generation
    sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitated to harness the immense potential of
    reference genome sequence information. In the context, whole genome resequencing
    (WGRS)/skim sequencing and genotyping-by-sequencing have facilitated sequence-based
    genome-wide association study (GWAS) for gene or QTL discovery across various
    crops (Bohra et al. 2020). WGRS based studies in different crops have enabled
    access to large-scale sets of DNA markers including SNPs, InDels, etc. Potential
    of large-structural variations such as presence-absence variation (PAV) and copy
    number variation (CNV) was explored to identify marker-trait associations (MTAs)
    for significant plant traits (Varshney et al. 2017). Phenotyping plant traits
    in an accurate, precise, and high-throughput manner have been a great stumbling
    block for progress of genetic studies and crop breeding alike. However, recent
    availability of next-generation phenotyping platforms particularly based on remote
    sensing technologies has emerged as a great tool to underpin gene discovery in
    plants (Cobb et al. 2013). Besides being efficient in terms of both cost and time,
    high-throughput phenotyping (HTPP) platforms have also uncovered the inaccuracy
    associated with the measurements on plant phenotypes recorded manually or based
    on visual scoring (Araus et al. 2018). In humans, as demonstrated by Neumann et
    al. (2010), live imaging technique can successfully uncover the real-time cell
    division on genome-wide scale by using advanced image analysis tools. Yang et
    al. (2014) combined high-throughput rice phenotyping facility (HRPF) with GWAS
    for analysis of a diverse collection of 533 rice accessions including landraces
    and elite genotypes. RAP and yield traits scorer (YTS) constitute the two component
    of HRPF facility. The study elucidated a total of 141 significant associations
    for 15 traits. The HRPF allowed HTP recording of both traditional traits as well
    as novel traits, i.e., plant compactness and grain-projected area, which could
    not be scored using conventional phenotyping tools. Recently, Sun et al. (2019a)
    performed phenotyping of 80 cultivated rice accessions for Normalized Difference
    Spectral Index (NDSI) using hyperspectral technology (ASD FieldSpec4 Hi-Res Spectroradiometer).
    The panel was re-sequenced with Illumina platform. GWAS analysis on the panel
    for hyperspectral data elucidated a total of known 43 genes and 22 genes that
    were not reported previously. A strong correlation of NDSI with protein content
    encouraged authors to use NDSI as a HTP measure alternative to a biochemical trait-like
    protein content. Owing to the growing availability of multi-omics platforms, high-throughput
    analysis has now been possible for RNA transcript abundance, metabolites, proteins,
    and epigenome. GWAS has been combined with transcriptomics (TWAS; Kremling et
    al. 2019), metabolomics (MWAS; Zhou et al. 2019), proteomics (PWAS; Brandes et
    al. 2020), and epigenomics (EWAS; Quadrana and Colot 2016) to offer high-resolution
    genetic dissection of complex traits via analysis of these endophenotypes. As
    evident from the growing literature, the non-destructive high-throughput phenotyping
    has emerged as a great strength to leverage GWAS for functional genomics and gene
    discovery studies. 1.7 Enhancing Accuracy of Genomic Selection Twenty years ago,
    Meuwissen et al. 2001 proposed the concept of using genome-wide marker information
    to predict the genetic worth of individuals. The concept has accelerated genetic
    gains in animal breeding, and results from plant breeding are encouraging (Crossa
    et al. 2019). Genomic selection (GS) harnesses genome-wide linkage disequilibrium
    in comparison to the marker-assisted selection methods that rely upon selection
    of superior individuals based on a set of DNA markers significantly associated
    with the phenotypes. “Training population” and “Breeding population” constitute
    the two key components of the GS strategy. Individuals from “Training population”
    are scored at both genotypic and phenotypic levels. The genotypic and phenotypic
    information obtained from training population are then used to compute genomics-estimated
    breeding values (GEBVs) that form the basis of the selection of individuals from
    “Breeding population” that are having only genotypic data (Varshney et al. 2019).
    Therefore, the process of GS saves the time and cost invested on repeated phenotyping
    of the populations. Recent years have witnessed a surge of GS studies not only
    in major crops like rice (Huang et al. 2019), maize (Crossa et al. 2014), wheat
    (Velu et al. 2016; Sukumaran et al. 2017, 2018) but also lesser studies legume
    crops like chickpea (Roorkiwal et al. 2016, 2018), pea (Annicchiarico et al. 2017),
    etc. Accurate phenotypic data remains crucial to inform GS models, and hence HTPP
    assumes a pivotal role to accelerate GS applications in plant breeding. A recent
    study in wheat reported 146% increase in prediction accuracy for grain yield when
    GS was applied with secondary traits such as canopy temperature and normalized
    difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Sun et al. 2019b). 1.8 Bioinformatics and
    Big Data Analysis With the varying imaging sensors, the imaging data formats also
    vary widely, thus it is challenging to conclude from image analysis (Yang et al.
    2020). According to the workflow, preprocessing of the raw image, image segmentation,
    feature extraction, and trait selection to develop dynamic mechanistic models
    using deep neural networks or recurrent neural networks, huge amount of data is
    generated. In another way, major challenge of functional phenomics is acquisition
    of huge phenotypic data besides analysing it for knowledge generation (Tardieu
    et al. 2017; York 2019). To solve this challenge, on the one hand, we have to
    reduce/distill phenotypic data to traits of interest through available computational
    algorithms for mapping these traits with genotypic data (Fig. 1.1). On the other
    hand, retaining only processed information limits our current ability to convert
    data into knowledge (Furbank et al. 2019). Breeding in the “omic” era is a multidisciplinary
    blend of phenomics of various abiotic stresses with high-density genomics and
    scripting software, i.e., PYTHON and R processing pipelines (Furbank et al. 2019).
    Another challenge is to manage and share this “Big Data”. To address this question,
    in 2016, Wilkinson and co-workers coined FAIR (findable, available, identifiable,
    and reusable) principle, to help in metadata analysis such as CropSight (Reynolds
    et al. 2019) and PHENOPSIS DB (Fabre et al. 2011). Similarly, to facilitate reuse
    of metadata, development of OPEN data infrastructures is equally importantly such
    as iPlant cyber infrastructure (CI), which provides high-performance computing,
    and large data access across multidisciplines (Goff et al. 2011). Further, CGIAR
    proposed “The Crop Ontology of the Generation Challenge Program”, aiming towards
    online data management tool to integrate genotypic and phenotypic data of various
    plants (Shrestha et al. 2012). Several other integrated genomics and phenomics
    open-source softwares and databases were developed, such as BrAPI (an application
    programming interface for plant breeding; Selby et al. 2019), Phenobook (open
    software for plant breeding data collection; Crescente et al. 2017), and Planteome
    database (an integrated ontology resource; Cooper et al. 2018). Although much
    of the data available in the analytics domain of the commercial sector remains
    inaccessible, but few publicly funded agencies provide freely accessible analysis
    pipelines through web portals (Furbank et al. 2019). Dynamic and curated trait
    ontologies are essential to enable cross referencing of multiplicity in descriptions
    for either single trait or process. PODD (Phenomics Ontology-Driven Database)
    is an ontology-based method to manage and link images with phenomics metadata
    (Li et al. 2010). Phene networks are determined using network analysis (Bartsch
    et al. 2015; York 2019) and structural equation modelling (Tétard-Jones et al.
    2018). Thus, synergistic efforts are required to develop data infrastructure,
    multivariate statistics, generation of funds, integration of resources with bioinformatics
    to expedite crop breeding and functional genomics (Yang et al. 2020). Fig. 1.1
    Diagrammatic representation of the integration of phenomics with genomics for
    climate-smart agriculture. Phenomics is performed by running large set of multiple
    phenotypic assays on genetic variants along with environmental changes, quantitative
    trait loci (QTLs) analysis and their integration using bioinformatics tools. The
    big data generated is validated using algorithmic analysis, online databases,
    metadata analysis, and computational modelling. This results in prediction of
    regulatory gene expression of related phenotype leading to precision breeding
    for crop improvement Full size image 1.9 Conclusion and Future Directions In an
    era of accelerated global climate change and global population, developing “climate
    smart” crop varieties have become the need of the hour, which requires meticulous
    efforts in identifying and characterizing genes and translating the proof of concept
    to the farm gate. Therefore, ultimate desirable outcome of agriculture biotechnology
    is to develop “all-inclusive” crop varieties to ensure higher yield and nutritional
    security. Thus, integrative plant biology approach requires to correlate canopy
    performance, environmental responses, and gene function with high-resolution and
    rapid pace. The next-generation phenotyping platforms will help in widening their
    knowledge on the multitude of diverse plant stress responses. Automated phenotyping
    tools capture structural, functional, and phenotypic expression data of various
    genotypes under varied abiotic stresses and thereafter organize, analyse, and
    store information in various datasets and finally perform modelling on plant’s
    performance under varied environmental scenarios. Research advances in plant phenomics
    tools and techniques hold immense potential in the development of crop genotypes
    with improved resilience. Timely investments with collaborative efforts have provided
    innovative opportunities to deploy resilience mechanisms to provide solutions
    for improved sustainability, nutritional value, and crop yield (Table 1.2). Greater
    investment in high-throughput phenomics is required to fill the gap between genotyping
    and phenotyping to accelerate mapping genes and downstream mechanisms for “speed
    breeding” of climate-resilient and stress tolerant varieties. With rapid advancement
    in artificial intelligence (DL), cloud based technologies, fifth generation mobile
    networks, automation technology, mechanized vision, and sensor technologies, phenotyping
    have shown immense potential in fundamental research as well as breeding. Table

    Big data cloud application most important data storage and data analysis environment.
    The big data weather and crop forecasting is a new research agenda in modern agricultural
    structure and huge data evaluation. This is a challenging research area, as manual
    inspection of agricultural data can lead to human error. This proposed system''s
    main determination is to improve crop yield prediction accuracy from agricultural
    big data and design and develop effective programs for data classification. Preprocessing
    is then used to analyze the collected data and identify the absent values for
    the attribute. Non-existent values are filled with corresponding new values by
    checking previous and past results. The fuzzy strategy is the right dimension,
    reducing the strategy to emphasize any of the self-organizing contours. After
    reducing the measurement, the reduced dimension information is used to predict
    climate as a reasonable outcome.An advanced methodology, Fuzzy Enumeration Crop
    Prediction Algorithm (FECPA) employed for accurate crop yield prediction. Therefore,
    they can improve the productivity of various sources?(no clarity), data analysis,
    predictive analysis, crop production, and FECPA with the help of increasing farmers
    developing a system of integrated data in long trip profit margins. This method
    shows the final results of experiments that improve the accuracy of yield prediction.

    may be a complex development influenced by actual soil input parameters and environmental
    conditions. Big data refers to a large collection of unstructured, complex data
    in which structured and traditional processing techniques and / or algorithms
    cannot work. Its purpose is to reveal patterns and leads hidden in evolution from
    the model-driven science paradigm to the data-driven science paradigm.The input
    parameters for agriculture change from farm to farm. In large spaces, collecting
    such information can be a frustrating task. It can be used to predict the effects
    of major crops in many individual areas or locations of such knowledge sets. Developed
    globally by researchers in agriculture or related sciences everywhere, the assessment
    has completely different forecasting methods. Data mining (Fig. 1) is the process
    of extracting many useful and important pieces of information from a database.
    Mining agricultural information is a relatively new area of research. Yield forecasting
    is a very important agricultural issue. Any farmer just wants to know how much
    output is expected. Previously, yield forecasts were calculated when farmers took
    the experience in accounting for crops in specific areas. Training data classification
    in all data mining processes future publication predictions is collected based
    on past and present information that will be used in the training study. Download

    Yield Prediction using Data Mining. Crop sampling and decision making tools are
    used in agriculture to enhance production efficiency. Increase the yield of crops
    produced in combination with high technology and agriculture and what will be
    more interesting and new. Due to the high content of new technologies, crop models,
    and forecasting tools, '' rapid development can be predicted as an important factor
    in agriculture.Crop Forecast Predicts that crop yields and production yields do
    not occur in the pre-field. Pre-harvest forecasts are implemented considering
    the knowledge of selected fields and crop farmers. An organization proposes to
    implement strategies for data prediction and database analysis to use this work.

    System Block Diagram. 2. Related work The first problem is motivated by unmanned
    ground vehicles to obtain a time-consuming soil measurement scheme [1]. The context
    of this dynamic system allows us to make the most of classical tools in this field
    to perform the estimation of relevant variables. General methods and examples
    have been defined in this study based on polarized radar data to track crop groups''
    growth period [2]. The new decision-making method will be applied to solve the
    choice of the produce distribution center''s location.The results show that the
    relationship between attributes and reference points influences significant decision-making
    behavior [3]. The technical forecasts allow the direction of scientific and technological
    development of the agricultural complex to be planned and monitor its material
    support [4] in modernization. Dynamic energy seems to be a feasible way. Mathematical
    methods use curved space vectors, which greatly reduces computation—vector identification
    of cycle time and reference time [5]. The concept of supply chain management is
    used to add value to the innovation economy concept, which has great potential.
    The added value of supply chain management is the supplier selection process [6].
    Therefore, although it is worth applying mobile learning to agriculture and farming,
    stakeholders all have their genetic traits and require detailed investigation.
    This work is based on an experimental approach [6]. To improve the attractiveness
    of innovative investment activities and local agriculture, competitive situations
    must be analyzed, evaluated, and predicted based on evidence-based results [7].
    A properly functioning agricultural consulting system [8] is an extension of the
    technical outcomes proposed earlier. It is built with the aim of filling the information
    gap between farmers and agricultural knowledge workers (e.g., agricultural science
    and technology expansion personnel). A new framework for effective analysis of
    large-scale economics big data is selected based on its innovative decentralization
    capabilities to meet these challenges. In particular, the economic development
    of the framework [9] hides the patterns that select the economic aspect and the
    methods that integrate the economic model building. Developmental studies of utility
    and leisure farming are based on a current home, summary, and analysis of leisure
    tourism farming issues based on multifunctional agriculture and foreign perspective
    [10]. However, this development is not in line with regional uncertainty as climate
    change, soil, and irrigation factors are rare—reliable techniques such as implementing
    artificial intelligence requirements [11] to solve this problem. Traditional methods
    often involve the instinct of many people to fail. Therefore, it is necessary
    to use the Internet of Things (IOT) and machine learning techniques [12] for smarter
    Internet crop production methods. This is done by limiting the use of farm fertilizers,
    chemical fertilizers, such requirements as weather, suitable crops, soil types,
    rotation, moisture monitoring, analysis, control of precise dose parameters and
    You can select the type of crops involved in the realization, such as temperature
    for irrigation [13]. With the strength of plastic film ending [14], wasteful recycling
    of resources and effective governance can achieve an effective response to technological
    innovation in each city.Precision agriculture is a new rural cooperative healthcare
    system management method that [15] farmers capture and analyze data to implement
    with optimized inputs for best results. Explore batches of data analysis and design
    different predictive models. Furthermore, the straight, non-linear direct samples
    of the variables must be tested to accurately predict different regression models
    for different crops [16] for agricultural production forecasting. Big data technology
    is driving the entire economy, including the low-tech industry. For example, agriculture
    has realized a new technological paradigm under the banner of intensive cultivation
    [17]. User-centered agricultural ontology developed to publish quasi-static information
    and convert it into actionable information. Create a capacity-oriented breeding
    process with empowerment theory to motivate farmers to take action and summarize
    the situational information generated by transaction data [18]. The solution to
    this problem is to specialize in search results based on your interests and preferences.
    Furthermore, material web and multi-tool technology play an important role in
    adding web content [19]. 3. Materials and methods The crop yield forecast contains
    all the necessary parameters for crop yield iterations in big data source. In
    this proposed method toimprove the yield classification results. In general, the
    problem faced by all forecasting methods is that almost all the necessary parameters
    must be taken into account without considering the exact forecasting. It reduces
    the expected results due to the lack of proper forecasting of crop yields on turn
    leads. It''s hard to predict and is additional.Improved predictions should have
    their efficiencies taken into account in the prediction program within the range
    of enhanced input parameters. Crop Prediction is that the field before predicting
    crop yield and production yield does not occur. Pre-harvest forecasts are completed
    by considering the fields selected and the knowledge of the crop farmers. This
    work proposes a system of predicting data for use and processing strategies for
    analyzing the dataset. High yields of certain addressable crops are expected.
    Crop Prediction is that the field before predicting crop yield and production
    yield does not occur. Pre-harvest forecasts are completed by considering the fields
    selected and the knowledge of the crop farmers. This work proposes a system of
    predicting data for use and processing strategies for analyzing the dataset. High
    yields of certain addressable crops are expected. It includes a semi-input module,
    which accepts the responsibility of accepting the yield forecast sample input
    from the farmer. The input module contains a selected sample of offset crop name
    areas and functions that predict harvest year liability. Crop Details Choose from
    sub-attributes. Crop yield prediction models are used to predict yield. 3.1. Preprocessing
    Preprocessing data can be an important and extremely complex task in big data
    source. Yield information is needed for the development of Indian culture and
    heritage through agriculture and national food security. Occurrences in industries
    such as climate change, soil erosion, etc., my country''s gross domestic product,
    agriculture directly depend on the country. Ifthat fails agriculture and agriculture-dependent
    agriculture challenges, there are many. Sustainable agricultural development needs
    to balance industrial and national economic flows to maintain low inflation. Simulations
    of crop growth models help analyze crops under different manufacturing conditions
    to determine the proper crop environment. A crop growth model considers soil,
    water, climate, and many other factors, such as investigating crop growth. The
    pre-processing plays an important role in de-noising the field data through component
    reduction with a Pass Filtering algorithm. Input: Crop field dataset Output: Predicted
    weather yield for the experimental dataset are follow Step1: initialize the weights
    to small random values Data = dataset. random. init (low_integer,high_integer,size
    = number of random integer) Step2: randomly choose as input data dt Step3: here,
    dt is the total crop yield ky preprocessed data (1) The purpose of pre-processed
    data is to transform data into a properly formatted, and transformative, clean
    noise data, juice and consolidated data from various sources. Preprocessing involves
    extracting the features that correspond to the data range that combines the missing
    values. \\ Missing values and attributes are detected using the input data taken
    from the dataset. Although it is full of missing values, based on the correct
    values of previous achievements. The preprocessed data is used as an input advanced
    algorithmic Pass Filter. 3.2. Sequential Forward selection Crop forecasting plays
    an important role in weather yield forecasting, but as never known before, crop
    yield is an inevitable part of the prediction. Facility extraction should simplify
    the amount of data involved in representing large datasets. Soil and crop properties
    are in the final set of drills to be extracted from the pre-processing platform.
    These properties include the physical and chemical properties of the soil.Here,
    the feature of the Sequential Forward Selection algorithm (SFSA) has been used.
    SFSA selection is based on the feature entropy, an attribute with multiple entropy
    values selected as the key feature for yield prediction.Four rating scales were
    selected to express the performance of different models. 3.2.1. Absolute error
    Absolute error measurement is the magnitude of the error. This is the difference
    between the measured value and the “true” value. The formulation for the absolute
    error (Δa) is: (3) Where: ai is the amount, a is the true value. 3.2.2. Mean absolute
    error(MAE) Average Absolute Error Average Absolute has all errors. Formulation:
    (4) c = the amount of errors, Σ = summary symbol (which means “add them all up”),
    |xi – x| = the absolute errors. 3.2.3. Mean squared error(MSE) is: Number of MSE
    error vector samples the ratio of classes represents and defines two terms (5)
    3.2.4. Root mean squared error(RMSE) The Root Means Square Error (RMSE) represents
    the MSE square root. The RMSE residue (prediction error) is the standard deviation.
    The rest is a measure of how far a data point is from the regression line. How
    widespread is RMSE is a measure of these residues.In other words, it concentrates
    the data on the best fit line. The formula is: (6) x = forecasts (expected values
    or unknown results), y = observed values (known results). In the above formula,
    x^i is the predicted value, xi is the true value, and y is the average value.
    The MAE predictive value error is the average absolute error that can reflect
    the actual situation. The difference between the value of the MSE parameter rating
    and the value of the parameter that can be used to estimate the magnitude of changes
    in the smallest value of the prediction model with the best accuracy of the data
    is the square''s expected value. 3.3. Fuzzy Enumeration crop prediction algorithm
    based classification Fuzzy Enumeration Crop Prediction Algorithm (FECPA) is one
    of the most widely used and simplest classifications to solve problems.A FECPA
    is a graph made to sort and sort them based on their feature instances. A decision
    tree represents the instances where each node is classified and builds nodes and
    branches that represent the possible values for each branch. Inaccuracies and
    qualitative knowledge modeling and transmission and data processing uncertainty
    at different stages are possible by using fuzzy sets. The main focus of knowledge
    discovery in the database is identifying interesting patterns and describing them
    in a concise and meaningful way. Fuzzy sets rely on membership functions, primarily
    from a human perspective, so that agricultural decisions can be easily found using
    FECPA. (2) Here, in the formula, when r is any real number greater than 1, r and
    c represent rows and columns, respectively, μij is the degree of membership in
    j,xi and the ith of d-dimensional measurement data, cluster of ci is the d-dimensional
    center and ||* || are any specifications that express the similarity between any
    measured data and the center. The FECPA is used to classify the minimum and maximum
    values. 3.3.1. Maximum value and minimum value 3.3.1.1. Maximum value deffind_maxvalue
    (L): maxvalue = 0 for x in L: if x > maxvalue: maxvalue = x returnmaxvalue; 3.3.1.2.
    Minimum value deffind_minivalue (S): iflen(S) == 1: return S [0]  v1 = S [0]  v2
    = find_mini(S[1:]) if v1 > v2: return v1 else: return v2 FECPA provides low error
    rate probability and hierarchically arranged data. Basically, calculate in terms
    of the degree of attribution that the output device has a high probability or
    which data points are related to other data points and how high they are during
    the test. FECPA requires data point allocation in such a way that it obtains close
    relationships between similar data points as much as possible. 4. Result and discussion

    data crop analysis is characterized by many factors, such as crop yield, genetic
    pattern, environment, and interactions. Precise product forecasting products require
    a basic understanding of the process relationships between these interactive components
    and detailed databases and powerful techniques that reveal this relationship.These
    meteorological conditions have a direct impact on crop yield. Various studies
    have been conducted to explore the connection between large-scale climatic phenomena
    and crop yields. Data mining has proven to be a powerful tool for simulation and
    forecasting to improve its performance.Crop prediction methods are used to sense
    various soil parameters and predict suitable crops with air-related parameters.
    Reads are used as inputs to the model. FECPA provides acceptable estimation accuracy
    and higher prognostic capacity through parameters such as this year''s harvest,
    area, yield, and alternative variables such as climate, agricultural, and soil
    characteristics, such as model development.The analysis of crop yield prediction
    FECPA is to given thetime complexity 28.4 ms,and sensitivity value is 91.54%,
    and specificity 88.43%, the minimal feature set is 24.6%, analysis of accuracy
    is 95%. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no

    Location: Erode, India SECTION I. Introduction We all are living in age of big
    data and information. Use of computational technology such as machine learning
    allows machines to learn and predict the things with or without past experiences
    [1]. Nowadays, machine learning with big data has emerged to perform large computations
    and make decision support system faster and accurate [1] [2]. Combination of these
    two has wide range of applications in agriculture, healthcare, security, robotics,
    bioinformatics etc. There are a wide range of machine learning algorithms available
    which can help to design prediction model to overcome real world problems in all
    above domains. In our research, we focus agriculture sector as a target application
    domain discuss the application of machine-learning algorithms. Agriculture plays
    a vital role in economy of every country, but it faces some serious issues such
    as degradation in the land quality, degradation in land area utilized for agriculture,
    selection of inappropriate crops and inappropriate use of fertilizers and pesticides
    [3]. Use of machine learning technology and big data can help farmers and agriculture
    community to overcome above mentioned issues and improve crops yield and earnings.
    Selection of appropriate crop for given land is dependent on quality and chemical
    parameters of soil, weather condition and water requirements [3] [4]. In this
    paper we have designed soil property based crop prediction model using different
    supervised machine learning algorithm like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor,
    Random Forest, Artificial Neural Network and assess the impacts of different machine
    learning algorithm on crop prediction. For that we have utilized different parameters
    such as soil types, pH, electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), nitrogen
    (N), phosphorous (P), Sulphur (S), zinc (Zn), boron (B), iron (Fe), manganese
    (Mn) and copper (Cu) to train the machine learning model and predict crops which
    are most suitable for given land. Detail discussion of different machine learning
    algorithms is given in next section. We have organized this paper as follows.
    Introduction and objectives of machine learning in agriculture are represented
    in section I. Section II describes working of machine learning, different Machine
    learning algorithms with their comparison and background studies related to application
    of machine learning in agriculture. Section III describes four crop prediction
    models using Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and Artificial
    Neural Network machine learning algorithms [5]. Comparisons between various machine-learning
    based crop prediction modals with experimental results are discussed in section
    IV. Finally, we conclude the paper in section V. SECTION II. Machine Learning
    Algorithms Machine learning(ML) is a field of study which can allow computers
    to make decision from past experiences and data [6]. ML has wide range of applications.
    It allows machines to extract important features also called \"feature extraction\"
    from available data and information. Popular examples are fraud identification,
    diseases identification from images and x-rays, training of robot using set of
    rules, crop yield prediction and recommendation in agriculture etc. This section
    describes working of machine learning along with the classification of machine
    learning algorithms. Think about a situation where we have complex tasks with
    large amount of row data and we don’t have any equation to solve that task. In
    this case machine learning is a great option to solve that task. Machine learning
    will utilize those data to train the model and this model will be used to predict
    facts about final outcome. Fig 1 shows working of machine learning algorithm.
    With input data and algorithm, one machine learning model is created and uses
    to test or predict facts about final outcome. These predicted data are also utilized
    to improve the model [6]. Fig. 1. Working of Machine Learning Show All Machine
    Learning algorithms are categorized into two broad parts: 1) Supervised learning
    and 2) Unsupervised learning [7]. Some of the researchers also categories ML algorithm
    into two other parts which are semi-supervised and reinforcement learning [6].
    but, there are only two broad categories which are described as below: A. Supervised
    Learning Supervised learning algorithm predicts the output based on a set of known
    input data and labels. The model will predict the output based on certain evidence
    and train data. Now this model will be utilized to predict unknown labels. Classification
    and regression techniques in data mining are best examples of supervised learning
    [7] [8]. E.g. decision tree, random forest, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest
    neighbor(K-nn), naïve bayes, neural networks, logistic regression and linear regression.
    B. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised learning finds intrinsic patterns and knowledge
    from available information and design prediction model without any labeled trained
    data samples. Clustering is most common technique of unsupervised learning [7].
    E.g. k-means clustering, fuzzy c-means clustering, hierarchical clustering etc.
    Now, the question is which machine learning techniques is better? Choosing the
    right machine learning algorithm is dependent on application. But, there are certain
    things that you should kept in your mind which are described in Table I as comparison
    between above mentioned techniques. From Table I we have found that for application
    area such as weather forecasting and prediction of crops, fertilizers and pesticides;
    supervised learning gives better results than unsupervised learning. Detail background
    study about application of supervised learning algorithms are discussed in next
    paragraph. TABLE I. COMPARISON BETWEEN SUPERVISED AND UNSUPERVISED LEARNING C.
    Background study of Machine Learning in Agriculture Till now we had discussed
    working of machine learning and types of machine learning algorithm along with
    its comparison and applications. There are number of applications in which machine
    learning are useful. Hence, we are going to discuss importance of machine learning
    in agricultural domain. Agriculture is the most dominant area in terms of economy
    of every country. Use of machine learning in agriculture helps scientist and researchers
    to predict about crop yield, fertilizers and use of pesticides to increase the
    yield of crops and maximum utilization of natural resources. Number of researchers
    and scientist apply various computing techniques to predict crop yield, recommend
    crops, fertilizers and pesticides for given land. Some of them are use machine
    learning, image processing and wireless sensor network to recommend crops. We
    have referred more than 50 research articles regarding use of computing techniques
    in agriculture and we have found that very few research have been done on machine
    learning with agriculture. Here, we have represented some of the research on machine
    learning in agriculture. In [9], they have utilized support vector machine and
    neural network to maximize crop yield. One has developed prediction model based
    decision support system using machine learning techniques [10]. CART based fertilizer
    recommendation system using machine learning model are described in [11]. Artificial
    neural network (ANN) based crop yield prediction and recommendation algorithm
    is developed by [12]. Researchers of [13] have designed pesticides recommendation
    system using Naïve Bayes and decision tree classification algorithm. Authors of
    [14] uses random forest classification for crop monitoring system. SVM classification
    algorithm, Decision Tree algorithm and Logistic Regression algorithm has been
    applied to recommend crop and pest control in [15]. In paper [16], they have used
    k-nearest neighbor machine learning algorithm to recommend crop using triple exponential
    smoothing. Researchers also utilize K-NN machine learning algorithm to maximize
    crop yield in [17]. [18] Suggest pesticides recommendation techniques using big
    data. Scientist of [19] have suggested collaborative filtering recommendation
    system to predict crops using soil properties. Apart from these researches there
    are other researches which have been conducted on application of machine learning
    in agriculture sector. From all above discussion on existing research, we have
    notices that very little study has been conducted on application of machine learning
    in agriculture. Hence, in this research we have utilized machine learning technique
    to recommend crops for the same, we have implemented crop prediction algorithm
    using Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Artificial
    Neural Network. Detail discussions on implementation of machine learning based
    crop prediction model are included in next section. SECTION III. Machine Learning
    Based Crop Prediction Algorithm In this section, we have implemented four different
    machine learning based crop prediction models. For that, we have used four popular
    supervised machine learning algorithms because supervised machine learning gives
    higher accuracy as compared to unsupervised learning in prediction problems [5]
    [6]. we have designed crop recommendation models using support vector machine,
    K-nearest neighbor, random forest and artificial neural network. To implement
    crop prediction model we have utilized soil properties such as soil types, pH,
    electrical conductivity (EC), organic carbon (OC), nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P),
    Sulphur (S), zinc (Zn), boron (B), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) as
    input of machine learning algorithm and design model which will predict crop for
    given land using existing land chemical properties. Our algorithms were utilized
    existing soil properties of given land and required nutrition to grow particular
    crops and find similarity among them; crops with highest similarity are recommended
    for that land. Next few paragraphs will show working of machine learning based
    crop prediction model. Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning
    algorithm which is mostly used in classification problem with multi-dimensional
    space. Each input data is plotted in n-dimensional space where each dimension
    represents features of input data. Then classifier model will divide input samples
    into class labels [5] [20]. Fig. 2 shows SVM based crop prediction model. In this
    model, crops and required soil properties are given as input to the algorithm
    to train the SVM model now this model will be utilized to predict the crop for
    give land as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 SVM Crop Prediction Model Show All Artificial
    neural network (ANN) is neural network based supervised learning algorithm based
    on biological neural network of human brain. Weight is given to the each input
    features and training are done by calculating difference between predicted output
    and target output. Fig. 3 shows ANN based Crop prediction model. In which 13 soil
    properties are given as input to train the model to predict one output crop. Fig.
    3 ANN Crop Prediction Model Show All Random forest is an ensemble method for classification
    which design multiple decision tree and final output is the combination of output
    from individual trees [7] [21]. Fig. 4 shows Random Forest based crop predication
    model which will predict the crop using ensemble techniques based on existing
    soil properties. Fig. 4 Random Forest Crop Prediction Model Show All K-nearest
    neighbor is similarity based supervised machine learning algorithm which predicts
    the class label based on available cases. It stores all available train data samples
    and identifies best match cases to predict unknown class labels. Fig. 5 show K-NN
    crop prediction model which finds similarity between required crop property and
    soil property of land to find most suitable crop for given land. Fig. 5 K-NN Crop
    Prediction Model Show All We have discussed four popular supervised machine learning
    algorithm for agriculture crop prediction. Implementation details and results
    of experiments are discussed in next section. SECTION IV. Experiments And Results
    We have implemented above mentioned supervised machine learning based crop recommendation
    models in R-Programming language and perform experiment with 5000 land samples
    and 24 different crops. Our dataset consist of 12 soil properties to train the
    model. Based on the similarity between target land and required crop property
    algorithm will recommend crops for that land. Description of each soil properties
    and algorithm are discussed in our research paper entitled \"A state-of-the-art
    survey on recommendation system and prospective extensions\" [22]. Algorithm crop
    recommendations are implemented using four supervised machine learning models
    and comparison has been made between them in order to utilize the performance.
    Standard deviation and absolute error are used to measure accuracy of crop prediction
    model and compare it with each other. Standard deviation will calculate how given
    output if differed from target output. Absolute error will measure the error rate
    and accuracy of prediction model. Results of standard deviation are shown in Fig.
    6 and Fig. 7 shows comparison of absolute error. Finally, accuracy of all prediction
    models is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 6 Comparison of Standard Deviation Show All From
    Fig. 6 we have notice that K-NN algorithm has less standard deviation 7.00% as
    compared to other supervised machine learning model. SVM has highest standard
    deviation which is 12.45%. ANN and Random forest has 9% and 9.81% standard deviation
    respectively. Hence, from fig. 6 we have determined that k-nn gives better performance
    out of all supervised machine learning models. Fig. 7 Comparison of Absolute Error
    Show All From Fig. 7 we have found that K-NN gives less error 4.80% as compared
    to other algorithms. ANN gives highest error rate 11.45%. SVM and Random Forest
    gives error 9.00% and 6.78% respectively. Therefore, we can say that K-NN machine
    learning work better than other supervised machine leaning model for crop prediction
    in agriculture. Fig. 8 shows accuracy of Crop prediction models. K-NN has highest
    accuracy as compared to other algorithms of crop prediction. Accuracy of SVM,
    ANN and Random Forest are 90.09%, 88.55% and 93.22% respectively. Fig. 8 Comparison
    of Accuracy Show All SECTION V. Conlcusion and Future Work In this paper we have
    discussed machine learning based crop prediction models, types of machine learning
    and its comparison. We have also discussed importance of supervised learning in
    agriculture domain. We have also implemented four machine learning based algorithm
    such as support vector machine, K-nearest neighbor, random forest and artificial
    neural network for crop prediction based on soil property and measure standard
    deviation, absolute error and accuracy of four models. From experimental results
    we can concludes that K-NN supervised machine learning algorithm work more accurately
    to predict crop for given land according to soil property with accuracy of 95.20%.
    In future we are going to implement these prediction models with more input parameters
    such as water level of land, temperature condition and market demands and assesses
    the impact of the machine learning on crop prediction. Finally, we can summarize
    that machine learning based crop prediction models to recommend crops given better
    results and crop yield than traditional way of suggesting the crops. Authors Figures

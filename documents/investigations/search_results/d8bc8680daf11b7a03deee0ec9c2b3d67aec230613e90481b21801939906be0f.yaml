    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the spectrum occupancy in
    cognitive radio networks (CRNs) using different machine learning techniques. Both
    supervised techniques [naive Bayesian classifier (NBC), decision trees (DT), support
    vector machine (SVM), linear regression (LR)] and unsupervised algorithms [hidden
    Markov model (HMM)] are studied to find the best technique with the highest classification
    accuracy (CA). A detailed comparison of the supervised and unsupervised algorithms
    in terms of the computational time and the CA is performed. The classified occupancy
    status is further utilized to evaluate the blocking probability of secondary user
    for future time slots, which can be used by system designers to define spectrum-allocation
    and spectrum-sharing policies. Numerical results show that SVM is the best algorithm
    among all the supervised and unsupervised classifiers. Based on this, we proposed
    a new SVM algorithm by combining it with a firefly algorithm (FFA), which is shown
    to outperform all the other algorithms. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Vehicular

    IEEE I. Introduction A cognitive radio network (CRN) is composed of two types
    of users, namely, the licensed primary users (PUs) and the unlicensed secondary
    users (SUs). Various spectrum measurement campaigns covering a wide range of frequencies
    have been performed [1]. These spectrum measurement studies have found significant
    amount of unused frequency bands in the case of normal usage due to the static
    spectrum regulations. This has led researchers to understand the spectrum occupancy

    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the advancement
    of the Internet of Things (IoT), conventional principles of spectrum allocation
    cannot mitigate spectrum depletion so that a cognitive radio technology is proposed
    as a solution. The hidden primary user (PU) problem, however, is a critical issue
    in cognitive radio networks, because spectrum sensing nodes (SNs) can misclassify
    spectrum occupancy. To cope with this, machine learning-based cooperative spectrum
    sensing schemes (CSSs) have been proposed. The CSSs without considering the node
    placement, however, are still faced with the hidden PU problem. In this paper,
    we present how to place SNs to guarantee the performance of machine learning-based
    CSSs. We verify that the hidden PU problem makes the overlap of data distribution,
    which deteriorates the spectrum sensing ability. Based on the Kullback-Leibler
    divergence, analytical expressions for the spectrum sensing coverage of a single
    SN are derived. Then, we propose a strategy on how to place a few SNs to cover
    the whole area of the PU and prove the feasibility of our proposal by the experiment
    results. Published in: IEEE Sensors Journal ( Volume: 19, Issue: 13, 01 July 2019)

    Internet of Things (IoT) is expected as a promising solution to improve many existing
    industrial systems such as agriculture, food processing, environmental monitoring,
    etc. [1] By incorporate wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with the internet, the
    IoT enables the connected objects to communicate with others and users, mainly
    over the unlicensed industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band. While spectrum
    bands such as ISM and mobile cellular channels are highly occupied [2], [3], there
    exist spectrum bands that are underutilized [4]–[6] and this imbalance reduces
    overall spectrum utilization. To solve both the spectrum scarcity in specific
    bands and the deterioration of overall spectrum utilization, the cognitive radio
    (CR) technology has been proposed as a promising solution of the IoT demand to
    sense and access radio spectrum [7], improving the spectrum band usage by using
    the unused portions of the spectrum. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures

    Full Outline Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Footnotes Abstract:
    Nowadays, mutual interference among automotive radars has become a problem of
    wide concern. In this article, a decentralized spectrum allocation approach is
    presented to avoid mutual interference among automotive radars. Although decentralized
    spectrum allocation has been extensively studied in cognitive radio sensor networks,
    two challenges are observed for automotive sensors using radar. First, the allocation
    approach should be dynamic as all radars are mounted on moving vehicles. Second,
    each radar does not communicate with the others so it has quite limited information.
    A machine learning technique, reinforcement learning, is utilized because it can
    learn a decision-making policy in an unknown dynamic environment. As a single
    radar observation is incomplete, a long short-term memory recurrent network is
    used to aggregate radar observations through time so that each radar can learn
    to choose a frequency subband by combining both the present and past observations.
    Simulation experiments are conducted to compare the proposed approach with other
    common spectrum allocation methods such as the random and myopic policy, indicating
    that our approach outperforms the others. Published in: IEEE Transactions on Aerospace

    EPUB Formulae display:? ABSTRACT Due to exponential growth in demand for radio
    spectrum for wireless communication networking, the radio spectrum has become
    over-crowded. The fixed spectrum allocation policy of the radio spectrum leads
    to inefficient utilisation of the available spectrum, which diverted the attention
    of researchers towards different intelligent techniques to access the spectrum
    dynamically and efficiently. The concept of Cognitive Radio (CR) has been considered
    as a promising technology to solve the problem of spectrum scarcity through the
    utilisation of various unutilised spectrum bands. In a future network deployment,
    multiple radio access networks may coexist having different characteristics. Hence,
    it becomes a challenge for CR networks to select the optimal network out of available
    networks. For efficient realisation, CRs requires intelligent spectrum management
    techniques for Dynamic Spectrum Management (DSM). Till now, there does not exist
    a literature survey that addresses the spectrum management with machine learning
    techniques in an intelligent manner. Hence, this paper presents the detailed classification
    and comprehensive survey of various machine learning techniques for intelligent
    spectrum management with their paradigms of optimisation for cognitive radio networks.
    The paper also provides new directions and open issues for the research community
    to work further in CR networks. KEYWORDS: Cognitive Radiodynamic spectrum managementheterogeneous
    networksintelligent techniquesmachine learning Introduction The exponential growth
    in the demand for extra spectrum resources become more prominent to support numerous
    wireless services leads to the advent of new technologies for high-speed data
    networks (X. Zheng et al., 2008). According to Cisco, global mobile data traffic
    will increase sevenfold between 2017 to 2022 (Cisco Visual Networking Index: Global
    Mobile Data Traffic Forecast Update, 2017–2022, 2018). But radio spectrum is an
    inherently limited resource in which frequency bands are exclusively assigned
    to the licenced users called Primary User’s (PUs) for a long term basis which
    leads to spectrum scarcity in a particular spectrum band. In contrast, a survey
    of spectrum utilisation being conducted by the Federal Communication Commission
    (FCC) has indicated that many portions of the radio spectrum are not in use, called
    spectrum holes, for a significant amount of time which leads to under-utilisation
    of the assigned spectrum. To overcome this problem, FCC reforms the spectrum allocation
    policy and allows unlicensed users, also known as secondary users/Cognitive Radios
    (CRs) to borrow unused radio spectrum from licenced users through Dynamic Spectrum
    Access (DSA) (FCC, 2003). The CR as an intelligent radio that can be reprogrammed
    and reconfigured dynamically. Such intelligent radio automatically detects available
    channels in the wireless spectrum, changes accordingly its transmission and reception
    parameters to switch between available vacant spectrum bands dynamically. This
    process is known as Dynamic Spectrum Access which can be realised only with CR
    networks (Akyildiz et al., 2008). Figure 1 presents a system model showing the
    available spectrum holes of various networks such as Television, GSM, Satellite,
    and Wi-Fi. CR requires a spectrum hole for its application which requires intelligent
    techniques to access the spectrum dynamically. The intelligent spectrum management
    includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.

    CRs having multiple requirements. Display full size Figure 2. The fixed spectrum
    allocation policy. Display full size Figure 3. The dynamic spectrum allocation
    policy. Display full size Figure 2 shows the currently fixed spectrum allocation
    policy decided by governmental agencies. Due to this fixed spectrum allocation
    policy, some frequency bands are highly utilised and some are lightly utilised.
    It is observed from Figure 2 that networks 1 and 2 are lightly utilised whereas
    networks 3 and 4 are highly utilised. It is shown that there exist large numbers
    of spectrum holes of heterogeneous networks that can be utilised with dynamic
    spectrum allocation policy. Figure 3 shows a dynamic spectrum allocation policy
    where CR access the unused spectrum. Thus, the demand for extra spectrum bands
    for wireless applications can be solved with flexible usage of available spectrum
    holes. As an intelligent wireless network, CR shares the spectrum with PUs in
    an opportunistic manner to avoid interference among multiple spectrum users with
    its learning abilities to adapt and act in a dynamic environment (Xu et al., 2014).
    To address the problem of spectrum scarcity, each CR:(Akyildiz et al., 2008).
    Determine the presence of spectrum holes called spectrum sensing. Determine available
    channels including spectrum selection, routing protocol, and reconfiguration called
    spectrum decision. Allocation of resources and serve its users without causing
    interference to PUs called spectrum sharing. Vacate the channel on the arrival
    of PUs called spectrum mobility. The most important issue is how to access the
    spectrum dynamically without interference with PUs. This requires CR which is
    intelligent by nature and having learning capability to learn from past experiences,
    which is an essential part of intelligence. Haykin envisioned CR as an intelligent
    wireless communication system that is based on the methodology of understanding
    by building to achieve two goals: highly reliable communication and efficient
    utilisation of radio resources (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012). To perform these tasks,
    CRs must be equipped with intelligence like a human (Zafari et al., 2019). The
    implementation of such capabilities requires functional architecture like the
    brain to access the spectrum efficiently i.e. Cognitive Engine (CE) (Dong et al.,
    2012). The CE acts as a brain of CR to perform various cognitive functions intelligently
    and provides learning capabilities to implement the cognitive cycle by making
    use of machine learning algorithms. The CR technology is based on Software Defined
    Radio (SDR), which allows the radio to reconfigure through software, based on
    the interaction with the surrounding environment in which it operates. However,
    in recent years machine learning algorithms in CR networks gains a lot of attention
    from researchers (Kotsiantis, 2007) (Thilina et al., 2013). A look at a recent
    literature survey on CR networks reveals that various leaning techniques are proposed
    that have been applied to numerous CR applications (Yau et al., 2012)(A. He et
    al., 2010). Some authors presented machine learning techniques, particularly focused
    on spectrum sensing and decision making in CR networks (Abbas et al., 2015). Further,
    CR has to work under unknown environments where complete Channel State Information
    (CSI) is not present or only partial CSI is available but it has to estimate the
    behaviour from other CRs present in network to coordinate its actions. Another
    author surveyed machine learning techniques for decision making and feature classification
    in different environmental conditions. In general, learning becomes an indispensable
    part of CR if the input-output relation of the system is not known, or as in the
    case of CR networks, due to channel uncertainty. Thus, learning becomes a necessary
    tool to estimate that channel characteristics to reduce error probability (Zafari
    et al., 2019). In CR’s, several parameters need to be adjusted simultaneously
    such as availability of spectrum (Tripathi et al., 2011), transmit power (G. Yang
    et al., 2015), adaptive coding and modulation schemes (Zafari et al., 2019), antenna
    selection, rate control (Hanif et al., 2011), spectrum handoff (Thakur et al.,
    2017), etc., and it is not possible to identify and adjust all these parameters
    simultaneously. Thus, learning techniques can be applied to perform specific CR
    tasks with efficiency and accuracy. An overview of an existing literature survey
    is presented in Table 1. The survey reveals that most of the authors have shown
    their interest in the specific issue of spectrum management. Most of the authors
    provide different types of solutions to address the spectrum scarcity problem.
    Some of the authors specifically discuss a problem related to spectrum management
    whereas no work has been presented with machine learning techniques for dynamic
    spectrum management which includes spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum
    sharing, and spectrum mobility. In this survey, spectrum management with intelligent
    techniques, considering learning as an important parameter has been discussed.
    In particular, we provide an in-depth discussion on different types of intelligent
    techniques such as Artificial Neural Network, Metaheuristic Algorithms, Support
    Vector Machine, Bayesian Learning, Game Theory, and Hidden Markov Models. The
    pros and cons of each technique in the context of spectrum management have also
    been discussed. We firstly present a spectrum management framework. Then we introduced
    various intelligent techniques used in CR networks as well as a survey of state-of-the-art
    achievements of these techniques for dynamic spectrum management in CR networks.
    The major contributions of this paper are summarised as follows: This paper presents
    a comprehensive survey of various intelligent techniques and presents their applications
    in CR networks. The target of this paper is to provide a focused survey of these
    techniques and evaluates its performance in spectrum management as major CR tasks
    which include spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum
    mobility. This paper presented state-of-the-art achievements in applying intelligent
    techniques to CR networks along with their strength and limitations to provide
    an overview of active research in the area of CR networks. The paper discusses
    research issues and challenges that are still an open issue and need the attention
    of researchers. Table 1. Comparison with an existing literature survey Download

    the spectrum management framework for CR networks. The taxonomy of various intelligent
    techniques is presented in Section 3. The evaluation of intelligent techniques
    along with their strengths and limitations are presented in Section 4. Section
    5 presents research issues, challenges, and future directions in the area of spectrum
    management. Finally, the concluding remarks are given in Section 6. Spectrum management
    framework To address the critical challenges associated with the co-existence
    of PUs and CRs in CR networks, CRs are required with the following functions in
    spectrum management: Interference Management: The important role of CR is to resolve
    the interference issues with PUs which can be resolved in two manners: Proactive:
    In this, the CR switches its communication before the arrival of PUs. Reactive:
    CR switches its communication after the arrival of PUs. Quality of service (QoS)
    Awareness: In heterogeneous networks, the selection of an appropriate spectrum
    band is necessary to provide QoS aware communication CR technologies provide intelligent
    spectrum management capabilities that could meet the ever-increasing demand of
    spectrum, thus empowers radio with etiquette to avoid interference. The complete
    spectrum management framework is presented in Figure 4. It shows that CR spectrum
    management framework has four main steps: Figure 4. The complete spectrum management
    framework. Display full size Spectrum Sensing: The first step of spectrum management
    starts with spectrum sensing on the arrival of CR. Spectrum sensing provides the
    ability to detect the spectrum holes (in terms of the frequency band, location,
    duration of availability) and PU activity by periodically sensing the spectrum
    and use it without interference with PUs (Noorshams et al., 2010). Spectrum Decision:
    Spectrum decision includes spectrum analysis and decision making. It deals with
    the selection of appropriate spectrum bands according to the required QoS. The
    spectrum hole is characterised, with various parameters such as multipath environment,
    operating frequency, interference, link delay (Pourpeighambar et al., 2017) and
    number of PUs using the spectrum, being considered (X Liu et al., 2013). After
    spectrum analysis, the decision has been made to access the spectrum hole. Various
    optimisation techniques can be applied to obtain optimal decisions depending upon
    the radio environment whether it has to optimise single objective or multiple
    objectives (Ramzan et al., 2017). Spectrum Sharing: The main function of spectrum
    sharing is to avoid collision among the CRs as multiple users trying to access
    the spectrum while maintaining QoS. Spectrum sharing deals with coordination among
    CRs to access the shared channels, resource allocation, and spectrum access (Kour
    et al., 2018)(Akyildiz et al., 2008). The spectrum allocation includes the assignment
    of spectrum band in a cooperative (Bayrakdar, 2020). or non-cooperative manner
    using handshaking protocols of transmitter and receiver (X Liu et al., 2013).
    The spectrum access includes collision avoidance among CRs in the access phase
    Spectrum Mobility: Spectrum mobility deals with spectrum handoff and connection
    management. CRs are usually regarded as visitors which often need to switch from
    one spectrum hole to another on the arrival of PUs in a dynamic environment (Christian
    et al., 2012). Spectrum mobility utilises a reactive and proactive approach for
    the detection of PUs whereas connection management ensures that CR continuously
    transmits its data in a new spectrum hole (Thakur et al., 2017). Intelligent techniques
    in cognitive radio networks A CR as an intelligent wireless device, which is aware
    of its environment, capable of learning and adapt from its surrounding environment
    and learning considered to be an indispensable component of an intelligent system
    which is considered to be a basic tool of CRs for dynamically access the available
    spectrum without interfering with PUs. CR must have the capability to learn from
    current observations and past experiences. However, CR has to work under different
    radio environments in which CR might have full or partial CSI or sometimes under
    a completely unknown environment. However, not being idealistic, due to fluctuations
    in the wireless channel, channel estimation errors, and quantisation errors, it
    is not possible to obtain perfect CSI. Thus, CR might apply an intelligent algorithm
    to estimate its actions concerning other CRs for spectrum management. Various
    techniques in CR networks are shown in Figure 5. Intelligence with artificial
    neural networks Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) provides Artificial intelligence
    (AI) which aims to incorporate intelligence in machines so that machines can perform
    like an expert. Also, machine learning, a subclass of AI, gained a lot of attention
    from the researchers in CR networks. Learning can be classified as supervised,
    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (Jiang et al., 2017)(Duda et al., 2001).
    Supervised learning learns from the training set and requires prior information
    about the environment. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require
    any training set and it performs self-adapting actions without any prior knowledge
    about the environment. Figure 5. Intelligent techniques in CR networks. Display
    full size Reinforcement learning or learning with critic, the learning agents
    learn by observing actions of other agents, and its performance is influenced
    by learning regime and operating environment (Duda et al., 2001)(Dandurand & Shultz,
    2009). However, it is a particular point of interest here that how these intelligent
    algorithms have been applied to access the spectrum dynamically. In this section,
    we present various ANN techniques that can be applied to CR networks. Artificial
    Neural Network (ANN) Artificial Neural Network (ANN or simply NN) consists of
    several interconnected neurons, identical to the human brain, which is made up
    of real biological neurons. The first artificial neuron was introduced in 1943
    by the neurophysiologist W. McCulloch and logician Walter Pits. ANN composed of
    a large number of artificial neurons which are interconnected to each other that
    mimics the behaviour and natural processing of biological neuron .i.e., learning
    and organisation (Tsagkaris et al., 2008). The human brain can perform fast due
    to its special ability of parallel data processing and NN tries to mimic the behaviour
    of solving narrowly defined problems. As stated earlier, NN consist of a pool
    of neurons, and these neurons are configured in the form of layers and connected
    to other nodes with links defined by the weight w j k , which determines the effect
    of the signal of a neuron j on a neuron k . In NN, three types of layers are present,
    which are distinguished as the input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. The
    input layer consists of neurons, which receive data whereas output layers consist
    of neurons, which send data out from the NN layer and the hidden layer consists
    of neurons whose input, and output remain in NN. Each neuron within NN uses some
    activation function to process the input signals s k it receives from (a) neighbours
    belonging to different layers (b) external sources. The type of activation function
    used depends on the problem to be addressed. Types of NN and Machine Learning
    In this section, we describe different NN models. Supervised NNs In supervised
    NNs, the input and output are known and its objective is to discover the relationship
    between two. The two main NN models are as Feed Forward NNs (FFNNs) and Recurrent
    NNs (RNNs). FFNNs are further classified as: Single layer FFNNs (SL-FFNNs) and
    Multilayer FFNNs (ML-FFNNs). Feed Forward NNs In FFNNs, neurons feed their values
    in the forward direction. It is of two types describes as: Single-layer FFNN (SL-FFNNs):
    It consists of single-layer of neurons. Due to its single-layer network, learning
    and training mechanism is easy but it has limited utility, as it is not able to
    solve real-world complex problems. Multilayer FFNN (ML-FFNNs): It consists multiple
    layers (hidden layers) between input and output layer. These hidden layers solve
    complex problems using the activation function. As stated earlier, some activation
    function is required to process the information, and the selection of activation
    function depends on the problem to be solved. Table 2 shows various types of activation
    functions to address different problems. Table 2. Types of the activation function
    Display Table Various type of ML-FFNNs using different activation functions leads
    to slight variation in the network. (Tumuluru et al., 2010), designed a multilayer
    spectrum predictor using a neural network, which does not require prior knowledge
    of traffic characteristics of PUs. CR may predict channel status based on sensing
    history which further saves sensing energy. (Liu et al., 2015) proposed ML-FFNN
    based dynamic Chinese restaurant game for spectrum sensing, which considered CR
    as customers to learn the table state (available spectrum hole) in the restaurant
    (network). Some important examples of ML-FFNNs include Radial Basis Neural Networks
    and Convolutional Neural Networks which are described below: Radial Basis Neural
    Networks (RBNN): RBNN composed of three layers: input layer, hidden layer, and
    output layer. The hidden layer consists of neurons using a Gaussian transfer function
    gives the output as Y j = ∑ j w j exp − r x − r μ 2 σ j 2 (1) In Gaussian transfer
    function, x → is input, μ ⃗ j and σ j represents centre vector and width of j
    t h neuron in hidden layer respectively, which need to be calculated for each
    neuron, ||.|| denotes Euclidean distance. However, an initial value of the centre
    vector and width affects the prediction ability of the network. An unsupervised
    learning technique i.e. K-means clustering (K-RBF) algorithm can be used to obtain
    the values of centre vector and width of the hidden neurons associated to construct
    and train RBNN in a more accurate way. The output of the transfer function weighted
    and summed as shown in Equation (1) . Zhang (S. Zhang et al., 2013) proposed K-RBF
    for spectrum sensing based on previous information of the PU spectrum which reduced
    prediction error to one-third as compared to RBF. Researchers proposed a design
    of CE based on the RBF and Genetic Algorithm (GA) for multi-objective optimisation.
    RBF has strong learning capability while GA is good at multi-objective optimisation
    (Y. Yang et al., 2012). Convolutional Neural Networks (Conv-Nets or CNN): CNN
    is another variant of ML-FFNN that has been used effectively in the areas of image
    recognition and classification. CNN exploits spatially local correlation by enforcing
    local connectivity with adjacent layer neurons, which does not take entire data
    from preceding layers. LeNet was the very first CNN which become an important
    tool for machine learning. Key operations of CNN include convolution, non-linearity
    (ReLU), pooling (or sub-sampling), and classification (Fully connected layer).
    For example, when an image is passed to CNN, features are extracted from the image
    using convolution preserves the spatial relationship between pixels of an image
    by utilising a small square of input data. Another operation i.e. ReLU has been
    performed after convolution, which introduces non-linearity in CNN. ReLU stands
    for Rectifier Linear Unit, which is an element-wise non-linear operation (applied
    per pixel) and replaces negative pixels in feature map by zero. Pooling operation
    can be done after convolution+ReLU operation, which can be done in different ways
    such as sum, average, max, etc. This operation reduces the dimensionality of each
    feature map by only retaining important information. Finally, the classification
    process is done. The output extracted from previous operations extract high-level
    features that are used for feature classification of the input image. The term”
    Fully connected” means every neuron of the preceding stage is connected to every
    neuron of the succeeding stage that classifies and forms various classes based
    on the training dataset. Further, CNN can be trained using gradient descent and
    backpropagation (Lecun et al., 1998). Backpropagation calculates the gradients
    of error concerning all weights in the network and updates weights and parameter
    values using gradient descent to minimise an output error. Lee (Lee et al., (
    2019) cooperatively implemented the CNN spectrum sensing technique, in which optimal
    strategy is used for combining sensing results of individual CRs obtained using
    CNN. Sensing based on deep neural networks is used to learn from a large set of
    data through a backpropagation algorithm. Deep sensing provides optimised combining
    strategy based on spectral and spatial correlations of channel i.e. based on the
    location of CRs and PUs characteristics. Selim et al. ( 2018) presented the CNN
    spectrum monitoring framework for radar bands in spectrum sharing scenarios. The
    main idea behind this framework is to detect the presence of radio signals in
    the radio spectrum even when this signal is overlapped by other signals due to
    simultaneous transmission. (b) Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) The idea behind
    RNN is to make use of sequential information, with the output being dependent
    on previous computations. Here, the neurons are connected in a cyclic manner,
    which allows exhibiting dynamic temporal behaviours shown in Figure 6. Unlike
    FFNNs, RNN does not propagate information directly to the next connected layer
    but use their internal memory to process the input. Figure 6. Recurrent neural
    network. Display full size RNN are called recurrent because they perform the same
    operations for every element in the input sequence. Let X t , O t and H t be the
    input, output, and state of the hidden layer(s) on time t . In simple mathematical
    form, RNN can be expressed as O t = F ( H t , θ ) (2) H t = F ( H t − 1 , X t
    ; θ ) (3) where the parameter θ defines weight and bias for the network. Equation
    (2) states that output O t at a particular time t depends upon the state of the
    hidden layer H t and θ . Further, H t depends upon its previous states H t − 1
    and input X t at a time t as stated in Equation (3) . To train RNN, the backpropagation
    algorithm through time approach is used which ‘unfold’ RNN in time and converted
    into FFNNs consisting of identical copies of RNN. RNN consist of a large number
    of layers as compare to ML-FFNNs and also training process is based on the passage
    of information through these layers and propagation of unsuitable information
    through the network leads to the accumulation of large error which leads to inaccurate
    results. Usually, the gradient descent method is used for backpropagation training.
    Deep Recurrent Neural Network (DRNN): DRNN (Tang & Li 2017) consists of multiple
    hidden layers that enable the prediction of the spectrum of multiple time slots
    in CR networks since existing methodology only predicts the spectrum of a single
    slot. Here, the channel state is divided into slots and forming time series of
    channel state. Due to multiple hidden layers in DRNN, it is difficult to train
    using a gradient descent method, which leads to slow convergence and gradient
    disappearance. To avoid these problems, Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for estimation
    of weights is used which overcomes the problem of slow convergence and vanishes
    gradients in a gradient descent method. Unsupervised NNs As the name indicates
    unsupervised NNs only know the input and the main objective is to discover patterns
    in features of input data. The system learns using certain test dataset and allows
    a lower-dimensional representation of input data. Unsupervised ML-FFNNs (Auto-encoders)
    Auto-encoders are the type of FFNNs specially designed for dimensionality reduction.
    In other words, auto-encoders provide the same output as the input. In auto-encoders,
    encoder function learns from input to representation and decoder function back
    from representation to input i.e. reconstruction. Denoising auto-encoders (Bengio
    et al., 2013) are the extension of basic auto-encoders, which attempts to address,
    identify function risk by introducing noise. Random noise is added to the input
    in the form of percentage and then this noisy data is fed in auto-encoder, which
    finds correlations within the input data to find correct data instead of noise
    added data. In Sparse auto-encoders, a sparsity constraint on the hidden layer
    is applied for extracting interesting features from unlabelled data even if numbers
    of hidden layers are large. Authors proposed a novel modulation classification
    method using denoising sparse auto-encoder as a classifier to improve spectrum
    sensing, i.e. to avoid interference with PUs (Zhu & Fujii, 2016). Moreover, the
    denoising process improves the performance of noise suppression by training the
    network with a corrupted database. Further, Variational Auto-Encoders (VAE) emerged
    as a powerful unsupervised learning framework for generating complicated data.
    They can learn a low dimensional representation of high dimensional data (Doersch,
    2016). Contractive Auto-encoders (CAE) make use of explicit regulariser which
    learns a function even in slight variations of input values. CAE adding a well-chosen
    penalty term to cost function which enables an auto-encoder to perform better
    (Rifai & Muller, 2011). (b) Unsupervised Recurrent NNs (URNN) URNN is a complex
    type of NNs, which are inspired by ideas from statistical physics which model
    system as an energy function. RNNs are computationally powerful and learn from
    the temporal behaviour of given training data. Compared to the FFNN, RNN is more
    powerful in representing complex dynamics and having a compact size. Two main
    types of URNNs are Hopfield Network and Boltzmann Machine, which are described
    next. Hopfield NNs: Hopfield NNs is a dynamic auto-associative model, which can
    store information in a dynamically stable structure. Each Hopfield network has
    some energy function (Lyapunov function) associated with it, which always tries
    to converges to a local minimum of the function. Hopfield NNs is biologically
    plausible, as its working is similar to the human retina. Hasegawa (Hasegawa et
    al., 2014) proposed an optimisation algorithm for decision making on radio resources
    in centralised and decentralised CR networks. In a decentralised network, the
    energy minimisation dynamics of Hopfield NNs are considered. Boltzmann Machine(BM):
    BM is a stochastic RNN, like the Hopfield network, in which the network unit finds
    a global minimum of the energy function. BM is designed for discrete variables
    having the disadvantage of being slow. Another problem with BM is it stops learning
    correctly when the machine statics grows exponentially with the size of the machine
    and with the magnitude of connection strength. Other variants of BM are Restricted
    Boltzmann Machine (RBM) and Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). Restricted Boltzmann
    Machine (RBM): As the name indicates, a restriction is imposed with neurons that
    they have symmetric connection between different groups of nodes but no connections
    between the same group of nodes which allows more efficient training algorithms
    than BM. MohanaPriya and Shalinie ( 2017) presented a secure routing protocol
    for CR networks. The RBM algorithm self learns the routing procedure between source
    and destination node. Further, it provides energy-efficient routing to prevent
    flooding attacks. Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM): DBM (Salakhutdinov & Hinton, 2009)
    have the potential to learn complex internal state representations, which is useful
    in speech recognition problem. It also develops high-level representations to
    tune its model for a specific task from unlabelled data as well as from limited
    labelled data. Unsupervised competitive NNs Unsupervised competitive learning
    is a form of unsupervised training where output neurons are said to compete for
    input patterns. It employs a winner-take-all strategy since only winning neuron
    is updated. Two major techniques of unsupervised competitive learning are a. Self-Organising
    Maps/Kohenon Maps Self-Organising Maps (SOM) are the special class of ANN, which
    is inspired by the cortex of the human brain. SOM makes use of competitive learning
    in which neurons compete with each other to win and then the winner neuron displaced
    to feature space to form clusters. The competition is induced by inserting negative
    feedback between neurons, which forces neurons to organise themselves. For obvious
    reason, such a network is called self-organising maps. SOM was introduced by Kohenon
    used to assist CRs to choose among various configurations to operate by considering
    bit rate predictions (Tsagkaris et al., 2012). Khozeimeh and Haykin ( 2012) proposed
    a self-organising dynamic spectrum management technique for CR networks in which
    CRs continuously senses the environment, extract PUs and neighbouring CRs activity
    patterns, and store to obtain knowledge that significantly reduces the probability
    of collision. b. Adaptive Resonance Theory Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) is
    another class of unsupervised competitive NNs that is designed for object identification
    and recognition based on matching between observer expectations and sensory information.
    This ART matching criterion is set by vigilance parameter, ƿ (threshold of recognition).
    High vigilance permits weight updation of winning recognition neuron while low
    vigilance inhibits weight updation of recognition neuron and search procedure
    is carried out(Carpenter et al. 2016). Another variant of ART is ART 1 and ART
    2. ART 1 is the simplest type of ART which accepts an only arbitrary sequence
    of binary input patterns whereas ART 2 supports analog inputs patterns as well
    as binary input patterns (Carpenter & Grossberg, 1987). In CR networks, a channel
    sensing algorithm based on ART-2 is proposed for cognitive wireless mesh networks
    in which the spectrum is divided into disjoint sub-bands and sensing is performed
    in each sub-band. This sensed information is further fused in a fusion centre,
    which is defined as a pattern classification problem. In this algorithm, only
    pattern phase information is considered which leads to wrong pattern classification
    (Zhu et al., 2008). Further modified ART-2 is described which considers amplitude
    as well as phase information. Reinforcement learning and NNs Reinforcement Learning
    (RL) is another AI approach that enables an agent (decision maker) to observe
    its state, choose an action in a particular state to obtain rewards. The transition
    from one state to another depends on several factors such as previous state, action
    taken, and next state. The main goal is to estimate the reward function for each
    state-action pair accumulates knowledge and maximise reward function. To apply
    the RL model (single-agent approach), identified by state, action, and reward.
    In the multi-agent approach, the set of agents is enabled to learn about each
    other information to maximise its reward function. Unlike supervised NNs, it does
    not have any prior knowledge about its input and output. It learns online from
    the environment and builds the knowledge to achieve its objectives. RL in the
    context of CR networks which provides intelligence in terms of dynamic channel
    selection, spectrum sensing, routing, spectrum allocation (Y. Wang et al., 2019),
    power control mechanism (K.L.A. Yau et al., 2014). Further, enhanced RL techniques
    in CR networks have also been presented. The authors in (Saleem et al. 2015) addressed
    routing issues by clustering mechanisms using the RL approach. Further, routing
    based clustering improves network stability and scalability. Moreover, spectrum
    aware cluster-based routing is presented which overcomes the challenges of multihop
    routing. In RL, an agent maps the situation (channel state) to maximise its reward
    function on a long term basis. The agent learns continuously and the environment
    responds to the state through its action by state transition after each epoch.
    The agent uses optimal policy to decide each time while taking the next step which
    maximises its rewards. To obtain an optimal policy, the Dynamic Programming approach
    can be used when perfect information about the system is available. The system
    is modelled using Markov property which makes the RL model equivalent to Markov
    decision Process (MDP). On the other hand, when perfect system information is
    not available, but the sequence of past state, action, and rewards are available
    then the Monte-Carlo method can be applied to obtain an optimal policy. Another
    approach named Temporal Difference (TD) learning approach does not form the system
    model and obtain its optimal policy based on prediction. Q-Learning (Q-L) and
    SARSA are the most widely used TD learning techniques (Sutton & Barto, 1998).
    These schemes are implemented for resource allocation in CR networks and it is
    observed that SARSA converges slower than Q-L as shown in Figure 7. This is due
    to the reason that Q-L follows a greedy approach for action selection according
    to off-policy whereas SARSA selects its action corresponding to the current policy
    obtained. Figure 7. Comparison between the performance of Q-L and SARSA schemes.
    Display full size Lo et al., ( 2010) proposed RL based cooperative spectrum sensing
    model in which CR learns to find an optimal set of cooperative neighbours which
    reduces sensing delays. Further, RL based optimum solution is provided which improves
    spectrum sensing under the shadowing effect. The reward function depends on reporting
    time delay i.e., the time duration between CRs request of cooperation to neighbouring
    node and arrival to sensing outcome. The authors in (Li, 2009) proposed Q-Learning
    to address resource allocation problems in a multi-agent environment. Koushik
    (Koushik et al. 2018) discussed RL based spectrum handoff and issues related to
    RL during handoff. In this paper, the authors presented hardware implementation
    of RL and Transfer Learning (TL) schemes to update its Q-value table greedily
    and shown that RL takes longer time to converge than TL which has expert node
    to transfer its knowledge in form of Q-table. Figure 8. Illustration of fuzzy
    logic in CR networks. Display full size Combinational NNs Neuro-Fuzzy NNs Fuzzy
    logic is an attractive technique, particularly where it is difficult to express
    the mathematical model of real-world problems. In fuzzy Sets, elements are assigned
    a certain degree of belongingness. The numbers in the range [0,1] are used to
    represent the degree of belongings. Fuzzy logic becomes a useful scheme to represent
    uncertain data. The fuzzy logic controller consists of three main components as
    shown in Figure 8. Fuzzy Interface: Converts real-world values to suitable fuzzy
    sets. Interference Engine: Interference engine uses a knowledge base to decide
    output for a specific combination of input fuzzified variables and maps into output
    variables. Defuzzy Interface: Converts output fuzzy sets to real-world values.
    The authors (Salgado et al., 2016) proposed a fuzzy algorithm is proposed for
    decision making and particularly for backup channels for spectrum mobility. This
    proposed algorithm based on multiple criteria decision-making techniques considers
    four parameters: availability probability of channel, estimated channel time availability,
    the signal to interference plus noise ratio of the channel, and bandwidth of the
    channel. Normalised weights (describes a relative degree of importance) are assigned
    according to the importance of each criterion for the selection of a backup channel.
    The pre-selection of back up channels decreases delay during spectrum mobility.
    The authors (Matinmikko et al., 2009) proposed a fuzzy-based cooperative spectrum
    sensing technique. In this technique, spectrum sensing decision from the individual
    node is considered as input, fuses to form output based on combined sensing result.
    Spectrum sensing performance has been characterised based on the probability of
    false alarm and probability of detection in a fading environment. However, fuzzy
    logic represents uncertain data, but it is difficult to design the degree of belongingness
    set. So Fuzzy logic combined with neural networks and forms the neuro-fuzzy combinational
    model. Neuro-fuzzy based spectrum mobility technique due to its capability to
    deal with uncertain environmental conditions as well as in the heterogeneous environment.
    This technique considers interference, bit error rate, and signal strength to
    find the quality of the channel in terms of fuzzy patterns. Based on generated
    fuzzy patterns, neural .networks trained to estimate channel gain, not only for
    spectrum mobility but also for spectrum assignment in a heterogeneous network
    (Maheshwari & Singh, 2015). b. Wavelets NNs Wavelet NNs replaces standard activation
    function (like a sigmoid function) by wavelet activation function. A wavelet is
    a small function that grows and decays in a finite amount of time. Unlike Fourier
    transform, wavelet NN can distinguish between stationary and non-stationary signals.
    Figure 9. A daughter wavelet neuron. Display full size However, wavelet NNs uses
    wavelet function (called mother wavelet) to derive daughter wavelet function ψ
    λ , t ( u ) through linear translation factor, t and scale/dilation factor, λ
    as shown in Figure 9. The daughter wavelet is expressed as ψ λ , t ( u ) = ψ t
    − u λ (4) An author in (Eltholth, 2016) proposed a spectrum predictor model, which
    is based on a discrete wavelet transform nature that produces a time-frequency
    representation of the analysed signal. The analysed time series is broken into
    sub-series, which represents the previous occupancy status of a certain set of
    sub-channels. Thus, design an accurate wavelet NNs based spectrum predictor model
    with less complexity. Wavelet approach for wideband spectrum sensing is sub-divided
    into small bands and characterised by frequency irregularities. Wavelet transform
    and multiscale wavelet approach have been used to detect local irregularities
    that carry information about power spectral density and structure irregularities
    of sub-bands that identify spectrum holes (Tian & Giannakis, 2006). Other NNs
    Quantum NNs Quantum NNs (QNNs) is based on quantum mechanics exploiting quantum
    information processing to improve classical ANN. In classical ANN, much of the
    power is required due to its massively parallel, distributed information processing
    and non-linear transformation operation performed by nodes. On the other hand,
    QNN makes use of powerful quantum parallelism, which provides quantum computing
    to process huge data sets. The author (Liu, 2016) presented QNN based spectrum
    sensing algorithm in which quantum neuron with multiple energy levels is considered
    as the excitation function of hidden layer neurons. Further, the improved version
    has been presented to increase convergence speed and stability. Table 3 summarises

    (SVM) is supervised machine learning algorithms used for classification and regression
    analysis. It is based on statistical learning theory with structural risk minimisation
    (Awe et al., 2013). It is initially preferred for the classification of complex
    problems. For a given training set, the input training vector belongs to one or
    another class of two groups. These two groups are separated by an optimal hyperplane
    that has the largest distance to the nearest training set of any class (maximal
    margin classifier) that achieves good separation. It is easier to train SVM when
    the classes are linearly separable. In non-separable classification, non-linear
    SVM is obtained by introducing a kernel function. The function is said to be valid
    kernel if it satisfies Mercer’s Theorem (Hofmann, 2006), which provides necessary
    and sufficient characterisation of a function as a kernel function. A kernel represents
    a similarity measure in the form of a similarity matrix (Gram Matrix) between
    its input objects. The gram matrix fuses all the necessary information for learning
    algorithms merged in the form of the inner product. For more details, refer (Burges,
    1998). SVM to develop a real-time approach to sense PU as shown in Figure 10.
    The input composite signal includes signal and noise, which is independent of
    each other in the time domain. The sampled data is classified as PU or not based
    on testing and training of the SVM classification model. Figure 10. A diagram
    showing the basic idea of SVM for spectrum sensing. Display full size For linear
    classification, a kernel function is proposed to map input low dimensional vector
    into high dimensional features space (Zhang & Zhai, 2011). Y. Wang (Wang et al.,
    2014) proposed a spectrum mobility prediction scheme that considers time-varying
    and space varying characteristics of mobile CRs simultaneously. The joint feature
    extraction pattern is proposed which executes spectrum mobility prediction through
    the classification of SVM with fast convergence speed. The authors in Huang et
    al., ( 2009) presented an SVM based learning engine that is divided into three
    parts as environmental awareness, knowledge actuation, and decision making. The
    learning engine acquires knowledge about the environment through learning that
    puts intelligence in CRs. Table 4 summarises DSM with SVM in CR networks. Table

    with metaheuristic algorithms a. Genetic algorithm (GA) GAs are stochastic search
    algorithms, which effectively solve machine learning and image processing problems
    (Jedlicka & Ryba, 2016). The main advantage of using GA is parallelism, which
    speeds up its simulation results. The computation in GA starts with the collection
    of chromosomes, which has certain characteristics. The algorithm can be implemented
    using the following steps as shown in Figure 11 (Siddique & Azam, 2010). Initialise
    the population of chromosomes. Evaluate the fitness level of each chromosome to
    rank them. Construction of the new population until the production of next-generation
    completes using the following steps: Selection: The best chromosome is selected
    from the currently available population based on its fitness level. Crossover:
    With crossover probability, selected chromosome reproduces to generate a new individual.
    Mutation: Newly generated individuals will be mutated at a definite point in the
    chromosome. The above steps are repeated until the desired results are obtained.
    In CR networks, the GA uses biological behaviour representing each channel by
    a chromosome. Each gene of the chromosome represents specific parameters. In the
    spectrum decision process, it is all about the fair distribution and utilisation
    of available resources, and for fair resource distribution, optimal distribution
    is required. According to L.Doyle, ‘An optimization process can be defined as
    the process involved in selecting the best choice from the list of available choices
    to reach some kind of goal or at least as near as possible to goal’ (Doyle, 2009).
    In CR networks, spectrum allocation also involves an optimisation task to assign
    spectrum holes to CR found during the spectrum sensing process. Figure 11. Illustration
    of genetic algorithm for CR networks. Display full size The spectrum allocation
    scheme for CR networks using GA in which each gene of chromosome represents different
    parameters (data rate, frequency, bandwidth, error rate, and modulation/coding
    scheme) which is associated with specific weight (Siddique & Azam, 2010). The
    weight for each gene represented in binary form. Like the weight for each gene
    in the chromosome fitness point for each gene is assigned. Once the fitness of
    each gene in the chromosome is calculated, the next step is the construction of
    a new population, which involves selection, crossover, and mutation process. The
    whole process is repeated until the optimum solution among the available solution
    set is achieved. The authors in (Morabit et al., 2015) presented spectrum decisions
    based on GA to provide a new spectrum band as requested by CR in the network.
    GA defines radio in terms of genes and chromosomes and considers user quality
    of service (QoS) as an input to the GA procedure. Further, chromosome population
    size is defined by available spectrum resource size and chromosome genes define
    the efficiency of spectrum allocation. b. Ant colony optimisation (ACO) ACO considered
    as computational technique proposed by Dorigo which is based on the searching
    behaviour of Ants (Dorigo et al. 1997). Although real arts are blind, the search
    their food source via the shortest path by play on the information through a substance
    called pheromones. The ants on its transmission route release this liquid substance,
    which is accumulated on the shortest route and soon ants, start to follow the
    smallest route. The behaviour of real ant has inspired the ant system, which resolves
    many complex problems successfully. The characteristics of the ACO algorithm i.e.
    parallel computation, self-organisation, and positive feedback that can help CR
    to achieve self-adaption and learning capability to achieve global optimisation
    (Q. He et al., 2013) (Bayrakdar & Çalhan, 2018). Different steps in the ACO algorithm
    are as follows: Ant probability distribution rule: In the ant system, artificial
    ants release the solution through moving among vertex follow the principle as:
    p i j k ( t ) = [ τ i j ( t ) ] α [ η i j ( t ) ] β ∑ s ∈ C [ τ i j ( t ) ] α
    [ η i j ( t ) ] β i f j ∈ C (5) where p i j k ( t ) is state transition probability
    of ant moving from vertex i to j at the time t . C is a set of vertex and s is
    unselected vertex in the traversing process. τ i j ( t ) and η i j ( t ) are pheromone
    intensity and heuristic visibility (cost) of a direct route between the node i
    and j . The parameters α and β controls the importance of pheromone and heuristic
    information respectively. 2. Local optimisation procedure: To avoid residual pheromone
    submerging heuristic information, pheromone will keep updated after one ant finishes
    a path searching with follows the principle as: τ i j ( t + 1 ) = ( 1 − ρ ) .
    τ i j ( t ) + ρ . τ 0 (6) where τ 0 is the initial pheromone value and ρ is the
    evaporation coefficient of pheromone. 3. Global optimisation procedure: When all
    ants complete the cycle, the pheromones will be globally updated as: τ i j ← (
    1 − α ) . τ i j + α . 1 G max (7) where α is constant and G max is the maximum
    objective function. 4. Stopping procedure The procedure is stopped after completing
    a predetermined number of cycles to achieve the globally best solution. The author
    in (Jhajj, 2017) discussed the ACO technique to find the optimal sensing time
    of CR. As CR has a fixed time frame for its sensing the environment and transmission
    of data, an optimal sensing time is required that will maximise throughput with
    minimum interference with PUs. This optimal sensing time can be found by ACO which
    implements the above steps to find an optimised solution. The ACO has been proposed
    for reconfiguration decision making in CR networks (Q. He et al., 2013). Reconfiguration
    means configure terminals and network devices to intelligently adapt to environmental
    conditions, which is a challenging task. ACO deals with complex environmental
    conditions as well as target multi-objective optimisation through parallel computation.
    Moreover, ACO learns from the environment and reconfigure spectrum decision through
    self-organisation process. Three types of reconfiguration schemes have been considered
    i.e. parameter variation reconfiguration scheme, radio resource management reconfiguration
    scheme and network access reconfiguration scheme and showed the improved performance
    in the heterogeneous network. A dynamic channel assignment as an optimisation
    problem to maximise the reward of CRs is formulated in (He & Zhang, 2012). The
    algorithm also considers interference with PUs and SINR constraints of CRs to
    maximise the spectrum utilisation. Table 5 summarises DSM with metaheuristic algorithms
    in CR networks. Table 5. Summarises DSM with a metaheuristic algorithm in CR networks

    signifies the importance of prior distribution which represents knowledge of unknown
    parameters in uncertain environmental conditions. It is assumed that no prior
    information is available about the spectrum but some prior information is available
    about the status of the channel which should be explored through learning. Bayesian
    inference is an approach where Bayes’ rule is used for driving posterior distribution
    from the prior distribution which further considered as prior for another posterior
    distribution and so on. In CR networks, CRs can compute the prior distribution
    of a system parameter θ , denoted by P ( θ ) , which represents the spectrum occupancy
    status of PUs. Though spectrum sensing, data observed in n time slots X = [ x
    1 , x 2 , . . . . . . . . x n ] . The likelihood functions of the parameter θ
    , P ( X / θ ) , for observed data, conditional on parameter θ . After acquiring
    prior probability distribution and the likelihood function, Bayesian inference
    can be used to derive posterior density function, P ( θ / X ) which is conditioned
    on data X . Bayes’ Theorem can be simply expressed as P ( θ / X ) = P ( X / θ
    ) . P ( θ ) / P ( X ) (8) In CR networks, Likelihood function denotes the probability
    of busy/idle previous states for a busy/idle current state. In Baye’s theorem,
    the posterior distribution combines the information in both the prior distribution
    function and the likelihood function, which represents stronger information and
    narrower possible values for θ . The Bayesian network has 2 types of models, Bayesian
    Parametric (BP) Model, and Bayesian Non-Parametric (BNP) Model. BP model has a
    finite set of parameters θ to compute prior distribution and In the BNP model,
    it does not mean a lack of parameters but an infinite-dimensional set of parameters
    is assumed to compute prior distribution. Recently BNP model applications in CR
    networks get a lot of attention of researchers because it provides flexibility
    to model to learn in an unknown environment. A Bayesian approach based spectrum
    sensing in CR networks is presented in (Jacob et al., 2014). The authors presented
    Bayesian inferences over single and multiple sensing frames to calculate the posterior
    distributions of unknown parameters, which forms the basis of Bayesian learning
    (Manco-vásquez et al., 2014). In Bayesian inference over multiple frames, learning
    from past samples has been done using threshold-based approximation and Kullback
    Leibler based approximation. Further, A Bayesian approach based decision-making
    engine in CR networks is proposed in (Huang et al., 2010). CE learns from an environment
    and form rules to reconfigure transmission parameters (modulation, code rate)
    which ensures QoS of CRs. The reconfiguration can be achieved with parameter learning,
    structure learning, and inference algorithms that form rules to adapt to environmental
    conditions . Table 6 summarises DSM with a Bayesian approach in CR networks. Table

    Intelligence with Hidden Markov Model Hidden Markov Model (HMM) represented as
    a stochastic process that can be modelled as a Markov chain, whose actual states
    are hidden, to analyse the temporal or dynamic behaviour of PU activity pattern.
    In HMMs, several hidden states represent the probability of distribution over
    a sequence of observations. The HMM gets its name from two properties in which
    it assumes: 1) Observations at the time t generated by some process whose state
    S t is hidden from the observer. 2) State of hidden process S t satisfy Markov’s
    property which states that for a given S t − 1 , the current state S t is independent
    of all states before ( t − 1 ) i.e. For a given S t , the output Y t is independent
    of all other time indices states and observations. HMM has found remarkable applications
    in CR networks since many environmental parameters are partially observed or act
    as hidden states. Various authors proposed HMM-based spectrum sensing schemes
    (Saad et al., 2016), (Ghosh et al. , 2009). HMM-based spectrum prediction for
    industrial applications that accurately predict through multiple slots is proposed
    in (Saad et al., 2016). Large numbers of hidden layers are considered which interpret
    as different PUs activity levels and formulate the prediction problem as a maximum
    likelihood classification approach. Akbar et al., 2007 presented a Markov based
    channel prediction algorithm and considers channel state occupancy of PUs as Poisson
    distributed. Pham et al. ( 2014) presented the HMM based spectrum handoff model
    in CR networks. The proposed approach infers the efficiency of HMM in correcting
    the sensing sequence and prediction of channel status. Further, the proposed algorithm
    applied to the spectrum mobility function in CR networks. An HMM based channel
    selection framework that minimizes the delay incurred during channel selection
    is proposed in (Senthilkumar & Geetha Priya, 2016). The proposed approach achieves
    a significant reduction in data loss and an increase in transmission speed, by
    obtaining the best-matched channel for the users. Table 7 summarises DSM with
    HMM in CR networks. Table 7. Presents DSM with HMM in CR networks Download CSVDisplay
    Table Intelligence with game theory Game theory technique accounts for multi-agent
    decision making, in which the decision of each player for action is based on the
    history of actions performed by other players. This involves the learning process
    by each player, which may ultimately lead to a stable state. Every game involves
    a set of players, actions, and payoff functions (or utility function). A player
    gets more rewards if it has a higher payoff function. Mathematically, a game can
    be represented as: G = ( N , A , P ) (9) where N represents a set of players,
    A represents a set of actions, and P represents payoff functions. In CR networks,
    the players in the games are CRs, which take actions based on observations of
    its environment in which it operates. As time progresses, CR learns from past
    actions and from observing the action of other CRs and modify its actions accordingly.
    Several types of game theory approach in CR networks are shown in Figure 12. Game-Theoretic
    Approaches: Two types of game-theoretic approaches are cooperative and non-cooperative
    games. In cooperative games, a group of players can make binding commitments and
    act jointly whereas, in non-cooperative games, the individual player acts selfishly.
    In cooperative games, cooperation among the players strengthens the position of
    the player in a game. Here the group of players forms a coalition act as a single
    entity. In non-cooperative, each user takes care of its benefit and selects optimal
    actions to maximise its payoff function. The author in (Yu, 2013) presented cooperative
    games for spectrum sensing and sharing and found that the applicability of various
    games depends on several factors. A non-cooperative game can be classified based
    on information i.e. either complete information or an incomplete information game.
    In the complete information games, each player observes other players’ information
    i.e. payoff and their action. On the other hand, with incomplete information,
    the game can be modelled as Bayesian game for decision making in which outcome
    can be estimated based on Bayesian analysis (Wang et al., 2010). Several types
    of games have been adapted to model various situations in CR networks. For example,
    in repeated games, each stage is usually repeated. Let us consider N the set of
    CRs in the network and a ( k ) denotes the action taken by a player at k t h the
    stage of the game. In each stage k , players tend to maximise their payoff function,
    while considering the history of action collected in h ( k ) = ( a ( 1 ) , a (
    2 ) , . . . . . . . . , a ( k ) ) . In other words, players map their actions
    from history a i ( k ) = f i ( h ( k − 1 ) ) . In CR networks, their action is
    the selection of channel available and mapping of action depends on the history
    of PUs activity as well as activity pattern of other CRs. In dynamic/repeated
    games, players came across a similar game number of times. The cooperation among
    the players in repeated games can be introduced to get long term benefits. The
    repeated games are applied for spectrum sharing scenarios where multiple CRs exists
    in (Li et al., 2010). In this context, repeated games apply punishments to achieve
    a desirable outcome. When the PUs activity is considered as stationary with an
    unknown environment then Stochastic games, also known as Markov games, are introduced
    to model the network. The authors in (W. Wang et al., 2018) addressed the routing
    problem using stochastic games. Stochastic routing game is decomposed into several
    stages and at each stage stochastic learning is proposed to learn equilibrium
    strategy of channel selection. Figure 12. Various game theory approaches in CR
    networks. Display full size The Stackelberg game can be modelled for implementing
    spectrum sharing where PUs can involve CRs as cooperative relays (H. Wang et al.,
    2010). In auction games, PUs act as auctioneer, selling idle spectrum bands to
    CRs which are allowed to select the appropriate bidding strategy for each channel
    to maximise their utility function. The concept of auction games has been applied
    to spectrum sharing in CR networks (Khaledi & Abouzeid, 2013), as well as in spectrum
    sensing (Sendrei et al., 2015). Table 8 summarises DSM with game theory in CR

    Table Table 9. Presents the evaluation of various intelligent techniques along
    with their strengths and limitations Download CSVDisplay Table Intelligent techniques
    evaluation: strength, limitations, and challenges Intelligent techniques having
    many advantages but their implementation still facing some challenges. The intelligent
    techniques applications in CR networks, strengths, limitations, and implementation
    challenges are summarised in Table 9. Supervised NNs: Basically, supervised NNs
    accomplished its task under supervision which requires complete knowledge about
    the environment in which it has to operate. However, in the context of CR networks,
    CRs may not have complete knowledge about the radio environment in which it has
    to access the spectrum. NNs provides a high level of feature classification but
    also required data labelling. It requires training under different environmental
    conditions and outcome depends on the selection of initial parameters. Therefore,
    the selection of data for training must be task-oriented and free from noise.
    Also, with the increase of network size, the training process slows down which
    may lead to slower convergence. To improve its efficiency, multiple hidden layers
    are introduced which requires large training data which further slows down its
    training process. Unsupervised NNs: A major challenge CRs can face a lack of knowledge
    of the surrounding radio environment. Even in this situation, CRs are expected
    to adopt changes in the environment so that they may not collide with PUs. CRs
    must be able to extract knowledge about PU activities which makes unsupervised
    NNs an appealing approach in CR networks. In unsupervised NNs, learning is based
    on a correlation among input data, and no information about the correct output
    is available. So unsupervised NNs are used indirectly for spectrum management
    in CR networks like modulation classification, optimisation algorithm for spectrum
    decision, and routing algorithms. Unsupervised Competitive NNs: As the name indicates,
    it is a form of unsupervised learning where output and input neuron compete and
    employs winner take all strategy. SOM is one of the members of this class that
    make use of competitive learning in which neurons compete with each other to win
    and winner neuron displaced to feature space to form clusters. The authors in
    (Khozeimeh & Haykin, 2012) presented SOM based DSM for cognitive ad-hoc networks.
    In this proposed scheme, PU and CR activities patterns are extracted and stored
    in memory which significantly reduces the probability of collision. SOM seems
    to be more realistic as it does not require prior knowledge about the radio environment.
    Further, the application of SOM with a different type of input pattern does not
    require redesigning the existing learning mechanism. SOM can be easily interpreted
    and understood. Moreover, it requires sufficient data to form meaningful clusters.
    Another member of this category is ART which designed for object identification,
    recognition, and pattern classification problem. It has stable and self-regulating
    control structure but it does not always guarantee stability and it has to empirically
    fix its vigilance parameter. This technique is not suitable directly for DSM in
    CR networks. Reinforcement Learning: Reinforcement Learning is distinct from supervised
    and unsupervised learning as it focuses on online learning rather than offline
    learning. RL learns from positive and negative reinforcement (or rewards) to set
    its training examples. RL seems to be one of the promising intelligent techniques
    to solve the spectrum management problem in CR networks. RL is used in spectrum
    sensing, spectrum decision (in the multi-agent environment and with multiple objectives),
    spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility. One of the major drawbacks of the RL
    technique is slow convergence. The authors presented hardware implementation of
    RL and Transfer learning for spectrum handoff in (Koushik et al., 2018) and found
    that RL takes a long time to adjust its learning parameters as compare to Transfer
    learning Combinational NNs: Combinational NNs have neuro-fuzzy NNs and wavelet
    NNs in this category. Fuzzy logic is an attractive technique that uses human-understandable
    fuzzy logic instead of using complicated mathematical modelling. The main advantage
    of fuzzy logic is that it is faster to train and also it requires less computational
    resources. With fuzzy logic, the solution can be obtained when the system has
    incomplete environmental knowledge. Some disadvantages of fuzzy logic are difficult
    to create its model as with increasing dimensions may lead to inefficient results.
    Further, it is difficult to estimate its membership function according to user
    requirement and it requires more tuning. Support Vector Machine: SVM comes under
    the supervised learning category which is used for object classification, pattern
    recognition, and regression analysis problem. SVM technique provides superior
    performance in many applications due to its generalisation ability and robustness
    against noise. SVM maps input vector from low dimensional feature to high dimensional
    features which make them linearly separable. For non-linear mapping, a kernel
    function is used. In CR networks, SVM is used as a classifier for signal classification.
    The sampled data is classified as PU or not based on the training of SVM. Unlike
    ANN, it is not suffered from overfitting problem and provides good performance
    in small problems. But in complex problems, it provides poor performance and may
    require a high training set which increases its computation complexity and storage
    requirements. Also, SVM requires large labelled data for training and complete
    knowledge of the radio environment which may divert the focus of researchers.
    Metaheuristic Algorithms: These algorithms solve multi-objective optimisation
    problems through parallel computation. GA provides multi-objective optimisation
    based on a fitness function but it may not always converge to the global optimum
    in case of large performance metrics. The performance of GA highly depends on
    fitness function which may be based on prior knowledge. Wrong prior knowledge
    may lead to the generation of bad chromosomes. Thus, the selection of better genes
    (each gene represents bandwidth, modulation scheme, data rate, etc.) to generate
    the next genes are very critical. Further, GA is considered a very slow process
    since fitness function is calculated through selection, crossover, and mutation
    process. GA improves its convergence speed either by combining with RBNNs or by
    increasing the number of genes. In ACO, parallel computation, self-organisation,
    and positive feedback can help CR to achieve self-adaption and learning capability
    to achieve global optimisation. ACO algorithm involves local optimum value based
    on which global optimum value is obtained. ACO can easily adapt environmental
    changes but its performance is poor for local searches. Bayesian Approach: Bayesian
    approach relies on a probabilistic model which signifies the importance of prior
    distribution to derive posterior distribution using Baye’s theorem. The Bayesian
    approach requires prior knowledge about the radio environment. Incorrect information
    may lead to skew inferences. It has high computational complexity due to high
    dimensional integrals. Bayesian learning can combine with other techniques such
    as HMM for channel quality prediction in CR networks. Dynamic Bayesian games are
    used for decision making. Further, the Non-Parametric Bayesian model-based Dirichlet
    process mixture model for unsupervised classification techniques can be used.
    Hidden Markov Model: HMM is a stochastic model based on the Markov model which
    is highly relevant to the CR network applications as environmental parameters
    that are partially observed and act as hidden states. The selection of appropriate
    models for training is a very important task in HMM. Due to the presence of multiple
    hidden layers, it is difficult to decode the sequence. HMMs have been extensively
    used in CR networks for spectrum sensing, channel selection, and spectrum mobility.
    One of the major drawbacks while using HMM is that it requires a training sequence.
    But its training process is quite complex. It can be combined with other techniques
    such as GA to improve its training efficiency. Game Theory: Game Theory is a mathematical
    model which provides a solution for self-centred multi-agent systems where the
    decision of individual agent affects other players decision. Particularly in CR
    networks, each CR act as a player and their action may include the selection of
    parameters according to user requirements. The goal of game theory is to provide
    the best outcome (optimal solution) while considering the interest of all players.
    Game-theory has been applied in several applications in CR networks such as spectrum
    sensing, decision making, spectrum access, etc. One of the major drawback while
    using game theory is to make a model which requires statistical information about
    the radio environment. As the environment is dynamic, which leads to the shift
    optimal solution before the convergence. It is difficult to structure a game that
    always provides an optimal solution. Another drawback is a limited number of players.
    As players increases, it may decrease its convergence speed which is another important
    factor need to be considered. Further, the game theory requires complete knowledge
    of the environment and also need labelled data for training. Incomplete or imperfect
    information can lead to uncertainty. Table 9 presents the evaluation of various
    intelligent techniques along with their strengths and limitations. Research issues,
    challenges, and future directions The intelligent techniques provide a promising
    solution towards the realisation of the DSM but there are certain research issues
    and challenges in DSM that need to be addressed carefully. New radio capabilities
    breed new demands for spectrum access, which presents an open challenge in CR
    networks. Some of these research issues, challenges, and future directions are
    summarised below: Wideband and higher frequencies: With the increasing demand
    for wireless traffic and applications, not only the higher spectrum efficiency
    but also more bandwidth resources are required which presents a major challenge
    in CR networks. As the number of users increases in current wireless systems,
    scalability becomes an extremely important issue. For such purpose, novel brain
    empowered/intelligent techniques need to be designed together with reconfiguration
    capability to achieve the best performance. Interference management: Due to coexistence
    among heterogeneous networks provide a new challenge in DSM. First and foremost,
    consideration is how well the devices are coexisting together. There is also a
    need to develop adaption in modulation schemes as well as other parameters, which
    enables devices to avoid interference. Moreover, cooperation between different
    networks and among CRs further mitigate the effect of interference. The amount
    of cooperation between heterogeneous networks and among CRs is also an additional
    challenge that needs to be addressed. Privacy and security: The deployment of
    new spectrum access technologies and their realisation raises new security challenges
    that have not been studied previously. Furthermore, regulators and policymakers
    have to consider what data from spectrum usage can be collected to access spectrum
    utilisation without trespassing on the user’s privacy. There is a need to ensure
    the correct implementation of the deployed system and when they are not, enforcement
    procedures will be needed to solve the DSM problem. Intelligent techniques based
    on green CR networks: The recent exponential growth of wireless technologies used
    in daily life needs to consider issues related to health and the environment.
    Hence, the designing of the future CRs need to be energy efficient to cut carbon
    emission. There exist limited work for DSM with consideration of green communication.
    Thus, there is a need to design DSM techniques considering green communication.
    Massive MIMO with intelligence: Massive MIMO uses a large number of antennas to
    provide an extra degree of freedom and diversity to improve its performance. To
    use this extra degree of freedom efficiently, intelligence needs to be incorporated
    to improve the perception capability and reconfigurability of CRs. Regulatory
    and policy reform challenges: Beyond technical issues, there are also policy reform
    challenges in DSM. Future deployed systems may employ spectrum dynamically in
    which PUs can sell their spectrum to CRs temporarily. Thus, the service level
    agreements for spectrum sharing need to be reconsidered. Furthermore, strategies
    need to be designed for dynamic spectrum auctions and markets. Multi-objective
    optimisation: In CR networks, multi objectives are conflicting with each other
    such as minimisation of power consumption, maximisation of throughput, minimisation
    of BER, etc. The optimisation of multiple objectives is a challenging task that
    needs to be addressed carefully. Other challenges include lack of incentives for
    spectrum sharing, authorisations constraints, and hardware, software, and protocols
    related issues need to be considered which require interdisciplinary collaboration
    among researchers of diverse backgrounds to address these challenges. Conclusion
    The paper has provided a comprehensive review and the classification of intelligent
    techniques for DSM in CR networks. For efficient realisation, CRs are combined
    with intelligent techniques so that dynamic and intelligent spectrum management
    can be done. The intelligent spectrum management schemes are surveyed in the context
    of spectrum sensing, spectrum decision, spectrum sharing, and spectrum mobility.
    The main emphasis of the work is to elaborate on the role of intelligent techniques
    in CR to enhance its learning capability. We have presented state-of-art achievements
    in applying intelligent techniques for DSM along with their strength and limitations.
    It provides an overview of active research in the area of dynamic spectrum management
    in CR networks. Unluckily, available techniques for spectrum management still
    lack the ample reflection of various network parameters in real-world scenarios
    which are quite complex to model, so some model-free schemes would become increasingly
    important. In future work, eliciting and encouraging cooperative behaviour through
    rewards and mechanism design will become important and looks promising to be an
    important area of further research. Disclosure statement No potential conflict

    Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for optimizing the overall
    performance of vehicular dynamic spectrum access (VDSA) networks. Due to the high
    level of mobility for vehicles operating under highway conditions, coupled with
    spatially variant spectrum allocation across a large geographical region, we envision
    that future vehicular communications will employ a form of dynamic spectrum access
    (DSA) in order to facilitate wireless transmissions between vehicles and with
    roadside infrastructure. In particular, the VDSA concept will be enabled by a
    combination of software-defined radio (SDR) technology, spectral occupancy databases,
    and machine learning techniques for enabling network automation. A vehicular networking
    scenario is substantially different relative to a generic mobile scenario with
    respect to the high level of mobility involved, the predictable trajectories of
    the vehicular traffic, and the overall scale of the network range. Consequently,
    the proposed architecture is designed to enable VDSA in a more flexible wireless
    spectrum environment by leveraging the cognitive radio concept and existing wireless
    spectrum databases actively being developed while simultaneously being compatible
    with current spectrum regulations. Regarding practical issues for vehicular communications,
    vehicle mobility is taken into account in order to ensure primary user protection,
    databases and channel priority schemes are used in order to record temporal and
    spatial channel heterogeneity, and vehicle path prediction techniques are employed
    in order to enhance channel access in this operating environment. Specifically,
    we show the advantages of employing the proposed learning architecture via a case
    study where reinforcement learning is used in order to achieve intelligent channel
    selection within a realistic VDSA environment. Moreover, performance enhancements
    in terms of channel switching times, interference, and throughput are shown via
    computer simulations. (Show More) Published in: 2011 IEEE Vehicular Networking

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Amsterdam, Netherlands I. Introduction Vehicular
    networking possesses significant potential for enabling diverse applications associated
    with traffic safety, traffic efficiency and information provisioning [1]. Recently,
    there has been a rapid accumulation of knowledge in this exciting area propelled
    by a highly active research community consisting of both academia and industry.
    Ever since 1999, when the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC)
    allocated 75 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for dedicated short-range communications
    (DSRC) to be used by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), applications involving
    one-way and two-way vehicle-oriented communications have evolved into many various
    forms. As the automotive sector continues to evolve and electronic devices become
    smaller and more powerful, new features are being introduced into the next generation
    of vehicles. Consequently, we can expect that vehicular communications will become
    ubiquitous in the foreseeable future, resulting in a significant increase in the
    bandwidth required by various applications. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Abstract To cope up with drastically increasing demand for radio resources lead
    to raise a challenge to the wireless community. The limited radio spectrum and
    fixed spectrum allocation strategy have become a bottleneck for various wireless
    communication. Cognitive Radio (CR) technology along with potential benefits of
    machine learning has attracted substantial research interest especially in the
    context of spectrum management. However, a variety of performance attributes as
    objectives draw attention during the technological preparations for spectrum management
    such as higher spectral efficiency, lower latency, higher network capacity, and
    better energy efficiency as these objectives are often conflicting with each other.
    Hence, this paper addresses the spectrum allocation problem concerning network
    capacity and spectrum efficiency as conflicting objectives and model the scenario
    as a multi-objective optimization problem in CR networks. An improved version
    of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) which combines the
    feature of evolutionary algorithm and machine learning called Non-dominated Sorting
    Genetic Algorithm based on Reinforcement Learning (NSGA-RL) is proposed which
    incorporates a self-tuning parameter approach to handle multiple conflicting objectives.
    The numerical findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through
    the Pareto optimal set and obtain optimal solution efficiently to satisfy various
    requirements of spectrum allocation in CR networks. Previous article in issue

    learningSpectrum allocation 1. Introduction The proliferation of various wireless
    services leads to increasing demand for spectrum resources, which will expedite
    the problem of spectrum scarcity [1]. The radio spectrum is a limited resource
    and regulated by governmental bodies, which allocates the spectrum license for
    a particular frequency band over a specific area. The static spectrum allocation
    strategy leads to inefficient and under-utilization of the spectrum. As a result,
    Cognitive Radio (CR) has emerged as a promising technology to alleviate the problem
    of spectrum scarcity. In particular, the cognition ability of CR helps to improve
    the inefficient usage of available radio spectrum by dynamically accessing free
    spectrum bands (called white spaces) [2]. The coexistence of CRs (unlicensed users)
    with Primary Users (PUs) (licensed users) form CR networks that share the same
    frequency band with PUs without harming its operation. In CR networks, designing
    and implementation of CRs for spectrum allocation give rise to multiple conflicting
    objectives that need to be optimized. There exist different performance attributes
    or objectives which need to keep in mind while implementing CR technology for
    spectrum allocation. Unfortunately, these objectives are coupled and cannot be
    treated individually as there performance depends on each other. Also, these objectives
    are conflicting in such a way that improvement in one objective deteriorates the
    performance of other coupled objectives. Consider an example, higher network capacity
    can be achieved by providing more transmission resources but it effects spectral
    efficiency as utilizes the same resource concurrently with good channel conditions
    which increases mutual interference and hence degrades spectral efficiency. Further,
    complicated signal processing techniques also obtain higher network capacity but
    it increases the cost and complexity of devices [3], [4]. However, in practice,
    these conflicting objectives need careful balancing to obtain tradeoff among them
    to optimize the overall performance of CR networks. In conventional techniques,
    the most prominent performance metric formulates an optimization objective while
    other performance metrics are considered as constraints of the formulated optimization
    problem. Such a problem treated with Single Objective Optimization (SOO) problem
    which over-emphasize the importance of one objective while degrades the performance
    of other objectives [5]. The most realistic optimization formulates the problem
    as Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) which simultaneously satisfies multiple
    conflicting objectives [6]. Over the past decade, many evolutionary algorithms
    have been attracted the attention of researchers, to obtain an optimal solution
    to the MOO problem. However, it is infeasible to obtain respective optima at the
    same time for these multiple objectives. Thus, there may not be possible to obtain
    a single globally optimal solution, which obtains the best solution concerning
    all objectives. Nevertheless, there exist non-dominated solutions generating a
    set of Pareto-optimal outcomes, called Pareto front or Pareto curve. The set of
    Pareto optimal solutions are mapped to the Pareto front in the objective function
    space [7], [8]. Diverse approaches have been proposed by various researchers such
    as nature-inspired metaheuristic algorithms and scalarization methods to obtain
    Pareto front of the MOO problem. In the scalarization method [9], the MOO problem
    is formulated as an SOO problem and provides a single score which indicates the
    quality of combined objectives. A linear combination of objectives is formed which
    provides a solution in the only convex area of Pareto front. An author in [10]
    proposed a non-linear scalarization function called Weighted Chebyshev scalarization
    which discovers Pareto front regardless of the shape of the front. Scalarization
    method includes a linear Weighted Sum Method (WSM), -constraint method, and goal
    programming [11]. However, metaheuristic algorithms often provide a better solution
    to MOO problems because these algorithms are less susceptible to the shape of
    the Pareto front and able to deal with non-continuous or concave Pareto front.
    The metaheuristic algorithms include Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs)
    [12] and Swarm Intelligence-based Optimization Algorithms (SIOAs) [13]. The MOEAs
    are population-based algorithms that aim to generate several elements of the Pareto
    front in a single run. The first generation of MOEAs includes Multi-Objective
    Genetic Algorithms (MOGAs), Vector Evaluated Genetic Algorithm (VEGA), Non-dominated
    Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) and Niched-Pareto Genetic Algorithm (NPGA). Further,
    second-generation includes improved versions of first-generation algorithms such
    as Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA), Strength Pareto Evolutionary
    Algorithm II (SPEA-II), Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II),
    Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES) and Pareto Envelope-based Selection
    Algorithm-II (PESA-II) [14], [15]. In contrast to MOEAs, SIOAs seek their intelligent
    behavior from animals and insects to solve complex optimization problems. Most
    widely adopted classical SIOAs include Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm,
    Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) Algorithm
    [16]. Some new SIOAs are also explored such as Shuffled Frog Leaping Algorithm
    (SFLA), Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm (FFOA). However,
    the parameter selection corresponds to a particular application in SIOA algorithms
    that still poses a problem. Moreover, slower convergence speed and higher computational
    cost of these algorithms being an open issue in the development of SIOAs. The
    MOEAs provide better Pareto front optimal solution than SIOAs but the quality
    of the Pareto front obtained by MOEAs, as in the case of NSGA-II, highly depends
    on its parameters [17]. The tuning of these parameters are not only very hard,
    but it is also time-consuming. The manual selection of the optimal parameter set
    is highly dependent on the user’s experience on optimization and on the formulated
    MOO problem. Thus, a novel online optimization approach using NSGA-II coupled
    with a machine learning method, Reinforcement Learning (RL), called NSGA-RL [18]
    appears as an interesting tool to eliminate the need for manual tuning. An RL
    is a reward-based strategy that tunes parameters set on a trial-and-error basis
    during the evolutionary cycle. To the best of our knowledge, there is no considerable
    effort to treat the multi-objective tradeoff in the context of spectrum allocation
    in CR networks with machine learning evolutionary algorithm. Instead, considerable
    efforts are using other metaheuristic algorithms in CR networks [4]. The multi-objective
    spectrum allocation problem accompanies high time and computational complexity.
    This motivates to obtain the solution of spectrum allocation strategy concerning
    maximizing both spectral efficiency and network capacity as MOO problem, which
    incorporates learning mechanism to eliminate the need of manual parameter tuning
    with less complexity. Thus, proposed NSGA-RL algorithm seeks high performance
    in the MOO problem, which incorporates a parameter-free self-tuning approach to
    handles multiple conflicting objectives. The key contributions of this paper are
    highlighted as follows: • Investigates the spectrum allocation problem to determine

    work is presented in Section 2. Section 3 presents the system model and spectrum
    allocation problem formulation in CR networks. The multi-objective optimization
    algorithm with self-tuning capability is described in Section 4. Performance evaluation
    of the proposed scheme is presented in Section 5 and the paper concludes in Section
    6. 2. Related works In CR networks, a single objective optimization is generally
    accompanied by ignoring the performance degradation of other objectives and does
    not obtain a balanced tradeoff between multiple conflicting objectives. Thus,
    to obtain the balanced optimal performance, researchers begin to formulate MOO
    problem which considers all objectives together to achieve optimal network performance.
    To obtain optimal solutions, some researchers transform the MOO problem into an
    SOO problem [19]. The parameter optimization problem in the CR engine is formulated
    as a MOO problem, and the authors proposed the WSM to address this problem [20].
    In [21], the authors formulate joint multiple relay assignment and source/relay
    power allocation problem as MOO problem for green cooperative CR networks and
    adopted a normalized WSM to combine two conflicting objectives to obtain a single
    objective function. Monte-Carlo based cross-entropy optimization algorithm is
    used to solve this non-convex problem. The authors in [2] proposed a MOO framework
    for resource allocation algorithm and solve this problem with Weighted Tchebycheff
    Approach (WTA). The proposed framework includes three important system design
    objective: total transmit power, energy harvesting efficiency, and interference
    power leakage-to transmit power ratio. Resource allocation and optimization also
    plays vital role in Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) based CR networks where
    multiple conflicting objectives required to be jointly optimized. Since it is
    extremely difficult to obtain perfect CSI in this network [22]. The MOO resource
    allocation problem in based NOMA based CR networks has been solved as non-convex
    problem with WTA in [23]. Recently, there has been growing interest in solving
    the MOO problem with machine learning techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL)
    [24] is a powerful machine learning paradigm that aims to optimize multiple conflicting
    objectives under uncertainties. Optimal solutions obtained with Multi-Objective
    Reinforcement Learning (MORL) algorithms can be sub-divided into two classes:
    single policy MORL and multi-policy MORL approaches [25]. Single policy approaches
    obtain a single best policy that simultaneously satisfies the preferences of multiple
    objectives. The single-policy approaches include WSM, W-learning, Analytic Hierarchy
    Process, ranking, geometric approach and envelope Q-Learning [26]. In contrast
    to single policy MORL, multi-policy MORL learns more optimal policies. This allows
    users to select one policy according to preference from the set of learned policies
    but it also increases time complexity. The multi-policy approaches include Convex
    Hull value iteration, Hypervolume-based MORL and Pareto Q-Learning [19], [27].
    The author in [28] proposed RL based routing protocol for CR networks while considering
    multiple application requirements. In [29], the authors proposed a resource allocation
    algorithm leveraging MORL to manage available resources and conflicting mission-based
    goals. A WSM was adopted under different communication missions for resource allocation
    which again transforms MOO into SOO problem. The spectrum allocation with multi-objective
    optimization plays a vital role in dynamic spectrum management and has attracted
    the attention of many researchers towards evolutionary algorithms. The author
    in [30] investigated the spectrum assignment problem in underlay spectrum sharing
    networks and formulated as MOO problem to treat throughput-spectral efficiency
    tradeoff. The proposed solution obtains Pareto optimal set under the constraints
    of the predefined interference thresholds on primary and secondary links that
    maintain QoS of all users in a network. In [31], the authors proposed an adaptive
    MOO scheme for cognitive radio resource management to improve spectrum operation
    and to obtain better network performance. It includes power consumption, packet
    error rate, delay and interference, throughput and spectral efficiency as objective
    functions. A Genetic Algorithm based solution was proposed that automatically
    adapts its parameters and objective weights according to environmental conditions
    and system capabilities. In [32], the authors formulate the spectrum allocation
    problem as a MOO problem to maximize both network throughput and spectrum utilization
    in cognitive-radio based Internet of Things. An evolutionary NSGA-II algorithm
    is proposed with a multi-hop link as an elementary unit that handles high computational
    complexity and seeks the optimal solutions for the problem. But the performance
    of the evolutionary algorithm is highly dependent on its control parameter set.
    The choice of these parameters depends on the user’s experience as well as on
    the MOO problem which is still an open issue to solve. 3. System model and problem
    formulation 3.1. System model The considered system model consists of Cognitive
    Base Stations (CBSs) which are underlaid with Primary Base Stations (PBSs) as
    shown in Fig. 1. Let denotes the set of indices of PBSs, denotes the set of indices
    of CBSs and denotes the set of orthogonal spectrum bands with total bandwidth
    . There are two types of users present in the network: PUs and CRs. The PUs are
    denoted with indices and CRs are denoted with indices that are associated with
    PBSs and CBSs respectively. Consequently, there exist inter-cell interference
    among CRs associated with different BSs and mutual interference among CRs and
    PUs which shares the same spectrum band. 3.1.1. Network capacity Let represents
    spectrum band (resource) allocation with binary indicator. The value of if a spectrum
    band is allocated to CR associated with CBS. The Signal to interference and noise
    ratio (SINR) for CR served by CBS occupying spectrum band is given by (1) where
    denotes channel gain between CBS and CR on spectrum band and is the transmission
    power of   CBS allocated to CR on spectrum band, is noise power and denotes interference
    encountered which is evaluated as (2) where is the transmission power of PBS allocated
    to PU on spectrum band, denotes channel gain between PBS allocated to PU on spectrum
    band. The capacity obtained by each CRs associated with CBS over resources formulates
    objective function 1 which is expressed as (3) 3.1.2. Spectral efficiency The
    system spectral efficiency (in bps/Hz) defined as the sum of capacity obtained
    by all CRs per unit bandwidth, formulates objective function 2 which is expressed
    as (4) Download : Download high-res image (330KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. System model. 3.2. Multi-objective optimization problem formulation
    As mention above, a proper spectrum allocation can obtain higher network capacity.
    However, due to limited spectrum resources, the efficient utilization of the spectrum
    is more emphasized in CR networks. The individual maximization of network capacity
    or spectral efficiency cannot meet the system performance requirement and it is
    significant to study the tradeoff of these conflicting objectives. Furthermore,
    spectral efficiency is the ratio of total capacity obtained per unit bandwidth
    as in (4) which is maximized with higher capacity for constant bandwidth, . However,
    network capacity can be maximized either by increasing SINR or the number of spectrum
    band allocated value according to (3). But due to the dynamic environment, the
    high value of SINR is not always feasible. Hence, network capacity depends on
    the number of spectrum resources allocated to serve transmissions to satisfy CRs
    request which requires concurrent transmissions on limited available spectrum
    resources. Thus, it leads to an increase in interference and hence decreases the
    network capacity. In a dynamic environment, efficient spectrum allocation strategy
    intends to take full utilization of available spectrum resources which jointly
    maximizes network capacity as well as spectral efficiency in CR networks. The
    MOO problem is formulated as (5) In (5), the constraint C1 represents the SINR
    threshold requirement for transmission. The C2 represents the constraint for spectrum
    band allocation in the CR networks and C3 enforces that the interference power
    at PU due to CR transmission should below the threshold. A typical multi-objective
    optimization problem optimizes objectives simultaneously to attain a feasible
    solution vector which satisfies associated constraints. In contrast to the SOO
    problem, there is no single global solution that can be obtained but the set of
    optimal solutions can be obtained that all fit a predetermined definition for
    an optimum, called Pareto optimality [33]. Definition 1 Pareto Optimality For
    a MOO problem expressed in (5), having objectives, which is defined as maximizing
    all elements simultaneously A point is Pareto optimal if and only if there does
    not exist another point such that , for all . For an optimization problem formulated
    in (5), Pareto front can provide the decision-maker with the entire performance
    envelope between these conflicting objectives. 4. Proposed optimization algorithm
    4.1. Overview of NSGA-II algorithm A Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II
    (NSGA-II) [30], [34], solves the MOO problem with elitism and a crowded distance
    operator which exploits explicit diversity mechanism. The main characteristics
    of NSGA-II are summarized as: uses elitist principle, diversity preserving mechanism,
    and emphasize non-dominated solutions. All these features make NSGA-II as efficient
    algorithm to obtain both solution diversity as well as Pareto front convergence.
    The NSGA-II algorithm includes the following steps: Step 1: The algorithm begins
    with the random generation of solutions called initial population of size . Step
    2: The offspring population is first generated by the parent population of size
    using genetic operators. It includes three main operations: tournament selection,
    crossover, mutation. (1) In tournament selection, two solutions are randomly picked
    from population and better out of two is selected. (2) Then, simulated binary
    crossover is performed to obtain two offsprings from two parents as (6) where
    and are the parents, and are the offsprings and is given as (7) where represents
    the crossover index. (3) To keep the population diversity, the mutation operator
    is implemented defined as (8) where and represents upper and lower bound respectively
    and is given as (9) where represents the mutation index. Step 3: These two populations
    are combined to form a new population of size . The population sorted according
    to the level of non-domination to obtain non-dominated fronts . The non-dominated
    sorting obtains non-dominated fronts with the following procedure: (1) For each
    solution , compare with the rest of the solutions in the population and two entries
    are calculated. One is domination count corresponds to the number of solutions
    which dominate and other is , a set of solution that dominates. (2) Put each solution
    that satisfies in the first non-dominated front with rank 1. Next, for each in
    , the domination count of all solutions in the set is reduced by 1. Repeat step
    (2) until all the fronts are identified. Step 4: The new population is generated
    with different non-domination fronts. The non-dominated fronts are accommodated
    until the new population until , where represent non-dominated fronts obtained.
    Step 5: Perform crowding sort on the current front which is not included in and
    then include the most widely spread solutions to fill up the remaining slots in
    . Step 6: Then generate from using crowding distance tournament selection operator
    which selects two individuals and at random and winner is selected based on best
    rank. If both individuals have the same rank, , the winner is the individual with
    high crowding distance. To obtain more diverse solutions in each non-dominated
    front, the crowding distance is calculated between the solutions of the same front,
    . It is the average distance between two points on either side of a particular
    solution. The crowding distance values are sorted in the descending order to perform
    crowding sorting. The crowding distance is calculated as: For each objective ,
    the boundary solutions are assigned value and compute the distance for rest of
    individuals as (10) where and represents the value of next and previous neighbor
    for the individual of objective , and represents the maximum and minimum values
    for the th objective function. 4.2. Proposed NSGA-RL algorithm for optimal spectrum
    allocation In classical NSGA-II, the convergence of Pareto front highly depends
    on mutation and crossover probabilities parameters. Both these probabilities must
    be set manually before the execution of an algorithm. The high value of crossover
    probability leads to premature convergence whereas lower value delays convergence.
    Further, a small mutation rate leads to genetic drift whereas large value leads
    to loses good solutions unless there is an elitist selection. To solve the problem
    of manual tuning of these control parameters, machine learning technique, Reinforcement
    Learning (RL) scheme is coupled with NSGA-II to form NSGA-RL algorithm. This algorithm
    learns the value of control parameters during execution and hence expected to
    find near-optimal value or at least self-tuning of these control parameters. The
    NSGA-RL algorithm incorporates learning capability and consequently, knowledge
    of the population. Thus, based on the experience earned in the form of previous
    generations with their respective results, the crossover and mutation probabilities
    are adjusted. The whole structure of NSGA-RL is similar to NSGA-II. But the only
    difference exists before crossover and mutation operations. The operation begins
    with a randomly selected population of chromosomes (solutions) which is represented
    as a bit string. The bit string includes four parts as shown in Fig. 2. The first
    part is formed by a bit string, which indicates if a spectrum band is allocated
    to CR or not. The value of a bit 1 if the spectrum band is allocated and 0 elsewhere.
    The second part is formed by sequentially placing the spectrum bands to be allocated.
    These two parts are of equal length where represents the number of available spectrum
    resources. The third part indicates the optimization objectives fitness function,
    which compares the solutions of the population to obtain non-dominated fronts.
    The non-dominated fronts are ensured with ranks obtained using non-dominated sorting.

    Fig. 2. Solution composition in spectrum allocation. The last part corresponds
    to Pareto rank and crowding distance . The crowding distance measures diversity
    in solution lies in the same non-dominated front. The crowding distance is calculated
    with the same procedure described in (10). With essential factors described in
    Fig. 2, the NSGA-II algorithm is applied to obtain an optimal solution to the
    spectrum allocation problem. The NSGA-RL follows the same steps of NSGA-II along
    with learning mechanism which provides freedom from manual tuning of control set.
    4.2.1. Proposed NSGA-RL algorithm To generate new offspring, two parents randomly
    selected from the mating pool and simulated binary crossover and then polynomial
    mutation operation is performed. For each newly generated offsprings, the population
    obtains reward from feedback. The reward is generated due to the success of crossover
    and mutation operation and thereby improves the final Pareto front. Although the
    mutation process remains the same as in NSGA-II, both mutation probability and
    indices are self-tuned based on the reward received during the corresponding run.
    All these discrete values correspond to given parameters that have a probability
    of being selected; however, the probability of selection increases for high reward
    values. The reward function is calculated based on the fitness of the solution
    obtained after taking crossover and mutation as action. Each solution is assigned
    a fitness equal to its non-domination level where level 1 is considered as the
    best level. The reward corresponds to these crossover and mutation is stored in
    the form of Q-table. The Q-table is a state–action look-up table that is initialized
    during the first run. The current population forms state and mutation and crossover
    index are considered as an action expressed as: (11) To generate an offspring,
    two parents are selected from the current population using tournament selection
    and then perform crossover and mutation operators on the selected parents generate
    the offspring solutions. After the generation of offsprings, the reward is calculated
    and updated in Q-table. The update rule for Q-Learning is expressed as (12) Here,
    represents discount factor which represents the influence of future rewards and
    is learning rate governing to what extent the new Q-value overrides the current
    Q-value. Moreover, NSGA-RL algorithm uses -greedy action selection strategy to
    balance the exploration and exploitation tradeoff defined as (13) The learning
    process includes exploration and exploitation during the action selection mechanism.
    In exploration, each time new random action is explored with probability (uniform
    random number generator) whereas, in exploitation, the best action has been selected
    each time to generate maximum reward with probability . The tradeoff between exploration
    and exploitation is a very important issue which prevents the RL to stack at an
    earlier well set of parameters. The population learns on trial and error basis,
    obtains the best values for crossover and mutation probability and calculate rewards
    accordingly. The knowledge obtained is stored in the form of a Q-table. This important
    feature of NSGA-RL is that it provides the flexibility of the self-tuning of parameters
    and obtains the best solution even in a dynamic environment. The complete procedure
    of the NSGA-RL algorithm for spectrum allocation problem is illustrated in Algorithm
    1 and demonstrated by the flowchart in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    objective of proposed algorithm is to eliminate the need of manual tuning of control
    parameters. However, this is achieved by adding some extra space complexity due
    to learning process. The complexity analysis of proposed algorithm is as follows:
    • Space: The proposed algorithm requires to store the Q-table in order to obtain
    optimal Q-value. However, the current population forms state and mutation and
    crossover index are considered as an action set . Therefore, elimination of manual
    tuning of control parameters in NSGA-RL is achieved on the expense of the space
    complexity. • Computational Complexity: The computational complexity of proposed
    NSGA-RL algorithm is similar to NSGA-II algorithm as it uses same fast non-dominated
    sorting approach which leads to its computational complexity to where represents
    number of generations, is number of objectives and denotes population size. 5.
    Numerical findings and discussion In this section, the performance of the proposed
    spectrum allocation algorithm has been evaluated. The goal is to visualize tradeoffs
    between network capacity and spectral efficiency and describe how the proposed
    algorithm can be used to acquire new insights. The simulation scenario is composed
    of 4 PUs and 7 CRs. The CBSs are distributed randomly within PBS’s coverage as
    described in Section 3. The interference threshold of each PU is W. The channel
    gains are fixed as for all and represent the physical distance between CBS and
    the location of the CR and denotes the path loss factor which is assumed to be
    2. The learning rate is set to be 0.5 in order to speed up the convergence. However,
    higher value of , traps the algorithm in local optimization [35]. Further, the
    value of discount factor is set to be 0.9. Higher the value of discount factor,
    greater the importance of future rewards relative to the current reward. The -greedy
    approach has been employed for exploration. Initially, the value of exploration
    rate is chosen closer to 1 and then decays after each learning episode. Large
    exploration rate results in exploring all actions without exploiting until all
    the actions has been tested for given number of times before convergence [36].
    The rest of the evaluation and learning parameters are presented in Table 1. Table

    In order to prove that the convergence of proposed algorithm, Hypervolume indicator  [37]
    is used. The Hypervolume indicator evaluates the approximation degree of the solution
    set to the real Pareto-optimal set, of a solution set can be defined as the Hypervolume
    of the space that is dominated by the set h and is bounded by a reference point
    , it can be expressed as follows where is the Lebesgue measure of a set and is
    the dimensional hyper cuboid consisting of all points that are weakly dominated
    by the point but not weakly dominated by the reference point. Greater the value
    of , better the convergence to the real Pareto-optimal front. Both NSGA-II algorithm
    and NSGA-RL algorithm are used to solve the multi-objective optimization model
    for spectrum allocation for 10 times, and the corresponding Hypervolume indicator
    is listed in Table 2. From Table 2, it can be seen that each Hypervolume values
    of the Pareto optimal solution set obtained by NSGA-RL algorithm is greater as
    compare to NSGA-II algorithm which shows that the Pareto optimal objective domain
    obtained by the proposed algorithm is more close to the real Pareto front which
    proves its convergence. Table 2. Hypervolume indicator of NSGA-II and NSGA-RL

    flowchart. 5.2. Optimization results of the proposed algorithm The tradeoff between
    network capacity and spectral efficiency is shown in Fig. 4. The solutions obtained
    under the Pareto front depicts that the network capacity and spectral efficiency
    are conflicting objectives in spectrum allocation because the network capacity
    can be further increased with severe sacrifices in the spectral efficiency. Further,
    the tradeoff between network capacity and spectral efficiency is also shown in
    Fig. 5(a)–(c) under varying SINR thresholds (4 dB, 8 dB, 12 dB). It is observed
    that an increase in QoS requirements, the number of solutions in Pareto front
    is affected. The improvement in network capacity is obtained at the cost of spectral
    efficiency. With the increase in the SINR, the length of Pareto fronts decreases
    as shown in Fig. 5(b) and (c). This is because with an increase in the value of
    the SINR threshold, transmission becomes more sensitive to co-channel interference
    and spectrum allocation among multiple users becomes difficult. Further, Fig.
    6 shows the convergence rate of proposed scheme under varying value of learning
    rate, . It is observed that higher value of completely override the previously
    learned knowledge and thus delays convergence whereas smaller value of leads to
    slower learning and thus delays convergence. To obtain the optimum results, the
    value of is set to be 0.5. 5.3. Performance comparison of the proposed algorithm
    The performance of the proposed NSGA-RL algorithm is compared with conventional
    algorithms NSGA-II [30] and SPEA-II [32]. The considered setting for the optimization
    algorithms is given in Table 3. The performance of the proposed NSGA-RL algorithm
    compared with NSGA-II having manual tuning of crossover and mutation probability
    is shown in Fig. 7(a)–(b). It is observed that in both cases NSGA-RL achieves
    a higher cover in the objective space as compare to NSGA-II. Hence, provide more
    feasible solutions for decision makers. However, NSGA-II seemed to be more stable
    than NSGA-RL. This is because, in NSGA-II, there is no significant change occur
    in the cover between the subsequent runs but due to automatic tuning of crossover
    and mutation probability with learning process as in proposed NSGA-RL algorithm.
    Besides, it is observed that both these algorithms obtain a set of non-dominated
    solutions. Further, the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with
    the Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm-II (SPEA-II) which also deals with
    the multi-objective spectrum allocation problem and considered as an efficient
    multi-objective evolutionary algorithm as it uses an external archive mechanism
    that contains previously found non-dominated solutions. The performance comparison
    of proposed NSGA-RL technique with SPEA-II is shown in Fig. 8(a)–(c) under varying
    SINR threshold constraints (4 dB, 8 dB, 12 dB). It is observed that the proposed
    scheme reveals better performance than SPEA-II under similar conditions. The Pareto
    front obtained by the proposed algorithm exhibits its superior characteristics
    in terms of searching space as well as population diversity. The complete Pareto
    front for spectrum allocation problem is obtained at a rapid rate which is considered
    very important for spectrum allocation decision making. Additionally, Fig. 9 shows
    the computation time versus maximum generation for proposed NSGA-RL, NSGA-II,
    and SPEA-II. Table 3. Evolutionary algorithm parameter setting. Parameter NSGA-RL
    NSGA-II SPEA-II Population size 100 100 100 Archive size – – 20 Mutation – 0.1
    0.1 Crossover rate – 0.2 – Maximum generation 200 200 200 Mainly, it is observed
    that computation time grows with an increase in number of generations. It is also
    observed from Fig. 9 that NSGA-II and NSGA-RL converges faster than SPEA-II. However,
    SPEA-II converges to true Pareto front while maintaining population diversity
    increases its computation time. But, in dynamic environment, such high computation
    time leads to unsatisfactory performance. Thus, the true Pareto front with fast
    convergence is always preferred under such a dynamic environment. It can be observed
    from the box plot in Fig. 10 that SPEA-II is computationally more expensive to
    run due to archive mechanism than NSGA-II and NSGA-RL and hence more time consuming
    in the simulation runs. It is also interesting to note that the computational
    time of proposed NSGA-RL is much smaller than SPEA-II but slightly higher than
    NSGA-II due to involved learning process. Further, Table 4 represent the solution
    obtained by proposed algorithm and NSGA-II during 10 runs. It is easy to see from
    Table 4 that solution 2, solution 6 and solution 9 are corresponding to the largest
    overall network capacity, and least overall spectral efficiency. The remaining
    solutions are relatively balanced. Thus, allows decision-maker to choose solution
    from optimal solution set for spectral allocation according to different objective
    requirements in dynamic environment. Finally, the comparison of convergence rate
    of proposed NSGA-RL with NSGA-II and SPEA-II is shown in Fig. 11. It is observed
    from Fig. 11 that NSGA-RL converges faster as compare to other schemes. This is
    due to the involvement of learning process which automatically tune control parameters
    and thus leads to faster convergence. Download : Download high-res image (219KB)

    Conclusion In this paper, the spectrum allocation problem in CR networks is formulated
    as Multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem which tends to maximize network
    capacity and spectrum efficiency. The MOO problem is solved with the NSGA-RL algorithm
    to search for an optimal set of solutions. The NSGA-RL algorithm is coupled with
    the advantages of reinforcement learning to self-adapt its parameter set and hence
    provides the freedom from the manual tuning of parameters. Simulation results
    corroborate that the proposed algorithm performs well under various cases and
    provides Pareto optimal solution with less time complexity which is very important
    during spectrum allocation. The results demonstrate that the proposed NSGA-RL
    algorithm is a promising approach to obtain tradeoff among multiple conflicting
    objectives in the spectrum allocation problem under a dynamic environment. It
    is interesting to further extend this work with other conflicting objectives related
    to spectrum allocation such as fairness, Quality of Service (QoS), area data rate,
    and energy efficiency. Furthermore, to identify the best compromise solution from
    the Pareto optimal solutions, the proposed algorithm can be combined with multi-criteria
    decision making techniques such as Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity
    to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships
    that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. Acknowledgment

    Metrics Abstract: The increasing complexity of the future wireless networks leads
    to the requirement for self-organization. This is true especially in home networking
    where users are typically not networking professionals and cannot be expected
    to perform complex optimization and management tasks. In this context, cognitive
    radio concept combining cross-layer optimization and learning mechanisms is a
    promising solution. We demonstrate a cognitive home networking prototype, which
    addresses practical problems users face with the present-day wireless networks
    at home. The prototype shows how nodes using IEEE 802.11 radios and WARP boards
    operate under the Cognitive Resource Manager (CRM). The nodes achieve the desired
    performance by handling network dynamics and controlling parameters taking independent
    or cooperative decisions and operating in different layers of the protocol stack.
    This is done using multiple control loops which are supported by the CRM architecture.
    We demonstrate the use of machine learning for online estimation of network activity
    patterns to enable more efficient Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) using Hidden Semi-Markov
    Models (HSMM). The demonstration showcases dynamic spectrum allocation and policy-based
    behavioral changes in a home environment, where several multimedia streams and
    data communication flows are competing against each other and against external,
    also primary, interferers. Published in: 2011 IEEE International Symposium on

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Aachen, Germany I. Introduction The huge
    increase in user demand for wireless communication and respective application
    performance requirements made wireless environment very complex and difficult
    to manage by humans. Hence, Cognitive Radio (CR) concept is becoming a need for
    future wireless networks since it enables the deployment of self-organizing networks
    that require the minimum of human intervention. However, most of the cognitive
    radio prototyping have been focusing on either dynamic spectrum access in broadcasting
    networks such as TV or military and emergency scenarios. Sign in to Continue Reading

    The growth of wireless data is the major driving force for an exponential increase
    in wireless communication. Cognitive Radio is one of the emerging wireless technologies
    that can be used for smart utility networks. Optimum utilization of the wireless
    spectrum is the objective of Cognitive Radio. Finding a spectrum hole through
    intelligent means is essential for the success of Cognitive Radio. Dynamic spectrum
    allocation is also an efficient technique for spectrum allocation. It will lead
    to a better spectrum utilization. In this paper, some of the machine learning
    techniques are used to find a frequency range for dynamic spectrum allocation.
    Different machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector
    Machine, Adaboost Classifier, and Random Forests were used to find spectrum holes
    in skewed data. Random Forest outperforms all the other models with an accuracy
    of 91% for determining the spectrum bandwidth (i.e. hole) for Cognitive Radio
    applications. Published in: 2020 International Conference for Emerging Technology

    Location: Belgaum, India I. Introduction The growth of wireless data is the major
    driving factor for an exponential increase in wireless communication. The service
    providers are finding it difficult to match the requirement of the users for seamless
    data communication over the wireless medium. Spectrum scarcity and inefficient
    spectrum utilization are the main reasons for the underutilized wireless spectrum
    [1]. Cognitive Radio is an adaptive and intelligent next- generation wireless
    radio network that can provide a better solution to the woes of wireless communication.
    Optimum utilization of the wireless spectrum is the objective of Cognitive Radio
    [2], [3], [4]. Finding a spectrum hole through intelligent means is the primary
    goal of Cognitive Radio [5]. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors Figures References

    5 SECTIONS PDF TOOLS SHARE Abstract In recent times, spectrum sensing and spectrum
    management become a crucial design issue in cognitive radio networks (CRN). To
    improve the spectrum utilization in CRN, the secondary users (SUs) will try to
    utilize the spectrum resource when it is unoccupied by the authorized primary
    users (PUs). At the same time, blockchain principle has been introduced to efficiently
    identify the legitimate SUs and allocate the spectrum resource as per the demand
    specified by the SUs. In this view, this article presents a new machine learning
    (ML) with blockchain-based spectrum management technique in CRN. The proposed
    model undergoes three processes, namely spectrum sensing, blockchain-based spectrum
    access, and malicious user (MU) identification. Initially, ML-based extreme learning
    machine (ELM) technique is applied for spectrum sensing. Then, the presented blockchain
    approach provides secured spectrum allocation for SUs. Finally, the MUs are identified
    and to be blocked from accessing the available spectrum resource. An extensive
    simulation analysis is carried out to ensure the goodness of the proposed model.
    The obtained results indicated that the proposed model has offered better performance
    compared with other methods. The experimental outcome stated that under the presence
    of −20 dB SNR, the proposed method has attained a maximum detection rate of 0.68,
    whereas the KNN and OR rule methods have demonstrated a minimum detection rate
    of 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. 1 INTRODUCTION In past decades, rapid developments
    in wireless communication models have resulted to a wide range of wireless applications.1,
    2 Hence, the drastic enhancement in the wireless field is highly restricted by
    bandwidth scarcity. In conventional models, permanent spectrum allocation is utilized
    where the frequency bands are declared for authenticated users.1 Furthermore,
    spectrum occupancy values have exhibited authenticated bands that are vitally
    reduced. For instance, the Spectral Policy Task Force addressed that radio channels
    have consumed minimum time.1 Therefore, the constraints present inaccessible spectrum
    bands exist because of the underutilization of accessible spectrum, which results
    from ineffective constant allocation schemes. The underutilization of accessible
    spectrum resources has offered regulatory bodies for the deployment of dynamic
    spectrum allocation concepts, named as cognitive radio (CR) systems. A CR network
    detects the processing platform for vacant spectrum opportunities as well as dynamically
    applies the accessible radio sources. In the CR model, unlicensed secondary users
    (SUs) are enabled to distribute the spectrum allocated to authorized PUs. Thus,
    primary users (PUs) have the right to fill the allocated bands whenever it is
    essential. As a result, SUs have to be aware of modifications carried out in the
    environment and it has to be changed the operating attributes based on the effective
    application of spectrum.2 SUs in CR systems are maintained by offering sufficient
    to PUs. Therefore, SUs have to be employed with effective spectrum sensing models,
    which assures the Quality of Service (QoS) for PUs as well as exploiting dynamic
    spectrum distributing chances. To facilitate dynamic spectrum access in authenticated
    bands, efficient spectrum sensing methodologies are deployed wherein higher scalability
    with productive employment is accomplished. Spectrum sensing methods are typically
    assumed in CR domains such as power prediction, cyclostationary feature investigation,
    and coherent analysis. According to the advanced knowledge, a SU is composed of
    PUs, a certain model might be appropriate. For sample, when a priori data regarding
    the PU signal is learned by SUs, coherent analysis should be applied. Coherent
    prediction applies features like synchronization messages, pilots, preambles,
    midambles, and spectrum distribution series. Moreover, coherent sensing according
    to pilot prediction was executed in Reference [3]. Followed by, while CRs contains
    minimum data regarding primary signal, the prediction has been employed. An alternate
    cause for applying power investigation in spectrum sensing models is that lower
    difficulty is contributed. Hence, the function of energy prediction with respect
    to the potential to predict the primary signals are decomposed, in particular
    in lower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. In cyclostationary prediction,
    the spectral correlation function (SCF) of the modulated signal is examined to
    select the existence of primary signal in the target spectrum. Cyclostationary
    feature prediction depends on the multicycle examination as coined by Derakhshani
    et al,4 in which cyclostationarity is investigated under several frequencies.
    In orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) models, a cyclic prefix has
    been inserted and it is treated as a protection time interval, which has been
    mainly used for predicting the cyclostationarity of initial signals.5 Moreover,
    OFDM is changed to produce certain signatures at specific frequencies6 in which
    cyclic features developed by signatures are filtered through cyclostationary prediction
    to accomplish an efficient signal discovery process. For conserving the QoS for
    PUs, interference led by SUs requires a retained from a reasonable stage. Hence,
    scalable spectrum sensing should be carried out by SUs to predict the existence
    of a PU, particularly from shadowing as well as fading impacts. Collaboration
    between spatially replaced SUs reduce the impacts with no requirement of additional
    detection iterations. Here, various CR nodes apply spatial diversity gain offered
    by cooperative spectrum sensing for accomplishing maximum functions in fading
    platforms. CR users are used for monitoring the surroundings and apply the operating
    features like operating frequency, transmitting energy, and many other constraints.
    To activate CR users for learning the environment, various research works have
    developed using the ML models.7 Fading as well as shadowing makes determining
    the channel condition complexity, and thus spectrum sensing is not applicable
    to estimate the PU condition according to the present sensing slot.8 Therefore,
    ML-relied spectrum sensing is applicable to implicitly learn the atmosphere. An
    alternate benefit of ML-relied spectrum sensing is that it is stable to predict
    PU activity with no requirement for advanced knowledge of the atmosphere. In Tilina
    et al,9 researchers have presented a binary hypothesis sampling and projected
    for optimizing the distance among two classes. The limitations of this approach
    are that it is assumed as of-decision integration and applied with one-time spectrum
    sensing that is not verified over ground reality. In Tang et al,10 k-nearest neighbor
    (KNN) has been applied traditionally as a counting model for occupying the spaces
    in developing a TV white space database. Researchers have been global energy prediction
    thresholds for diverse conventional rules of decision integration. Such rules
    are applied with various classification models for classifying instance that consumes
    the signal strength named as a feature vector. Mikaeil et al11 have applied KNN
    as a measuring approach, and the global decision integration rule is not considered
    as the weight of unique CR users as well as performance history. Kanti et al12
    employed in several antennas for specific spectrum sensing, whereas in Reference
    [13] a model depends on several energy predictors and adaptive thresholds for
    cooperative spectrum sensing have been projected. In case of regional area networks,
    enhanced energy detectors have been projected. Kanti et al14 developed a two-phase
    energy detector in which decisions of detectors are merged at decision tools,
    whereas in Reference [15], various antennas have been applied for spectrum observation
    in regional networks. In Reference [], a fixed energy detection object as well
    as an adaptive double threshold was utilized for incorporative spectrum observation.
    In Bagwari and Tomar16 various antennas-dependent energy detection object was
    used for spectrum. In Reference [17], the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of
    an energy harvesting aided underlay single input multiple output CRN has been
    developed with the existence of many eavesdroppers. The outcome depicted that
    the network under the noncolluding eavesdropping scenario resulted to effective
    secrecy outage results over the colluding eavesdropping mode. Though several models
    are available in the literature, it is still needed to improve the performance
    of the CRN. This article introduces a new ML with blockchain-based spectrum management
    technique in CRN. The proposed model operates on three major processes, namely
    spectrum sensing, blockchain-based spectrum access, and MU identification. Primarily,
    ML-based extreme learning machine (ELM) technique is applied for spectrum sensing.
    Among various ML models, ELM is preferred due to the following reasons: It needs
    parameter setting of hidden neuron count and activation function. It does not
    need modifying the input weight and hidden layer bias at the time of implantation.
    So, ELM results to quick learning speed, less parameter tuning, and effective
    generalization performance. Afterward, the presented blockchain approach provides
    secured spectrum allocation for SUs. Finally, the MUs are identified and to be
    blocked from accessing the available spectrum resource. A series of experiments
    take place to validate the performance of the presented model in terms of detection
    rate and error rate. The remaining sections of the article are arranged as follows.
    Section 2 offers the proposed method, Section 10 gives the experimental validation,
    and Section 11 concludes the study. 2 THE PROPOSED MODEL Here, a network composed
    of PUs, as well as SUs, is considered. In the wireless system, PUs is considered
    as spectrum license holders and lease the assigned spectrum to enhance the spectrum
    robustness and produce extra revenue. PUs are CRs 1, 2, …, P with half-duplex
    transceivers, which refers that, it is applicable to forward or receive under
    any scenario with a certain wireless station.18 The frequency spectrum is classified
    as R orthogonal channels 1, 2, …, R which are symmetric and error-free. Finally,
    time is categorized into T T2, …, Tn equal-length blocks for simplicity, and Ti ≠ T1
    implies the overload. Moreover, it is considered that typical management is accessible
    for interchanging control messages among PUs and SUs. It is applied to broadcast
    the accessible channels and auction data are required for applying them. The control
    channel has been employed to synchronize the time bases of CRs. If the control
    channel is engaged, auction availability as well as data about time synchronization
    is accomplished by alternate models like local global positioning system receiver.
    The medium-access control frame (Figure 1) is comprised of data interchanges and
    assignment period, as opposed to traditional overhead with additional sensing
    period. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Architecture of CRN 2.1 ELM-based
    spectrum sensing For developing a classifier, the current images are classified
    and the reports are provided to the channel for adoptable (H0) or channel busy
    (H1) types, a training phase is required. Every CR user saves energy vectors of
    size W, in which W defines the length of training phases. For the training phase,
    slotted-frame infrastructure is applied. The one-time slot is composed of a sensing
    phase as well as a transmission phase. Such vectors are considered as input of
    a classifier, in which recent sensing reports are relevant with previously saved
    sensing measures for selecting H0 and H1. Here, CR users understand the nature
    of PU by mapping and quantized energy vectors, which is named as sensing reports,
    which offers the exact condition of PU. The actual state of PU has been identified
    by ACK and scalable integration of local decisions of CR users computed by using
    FC. The sensing reports are organized as sensing classes with the help of ELM.
    2.1.1 ELM model The ELM presented by G.B. Huang mainly aims in removing time-cost
    iteration for the training process and enhance the generalization function. As
    the single-hidden layer feedforward neural networks (SLFNs), ELM is composed of
    an input layer, hidden layer, and output layer. Dissimilar from previous neural
    networks (NN)19 learning models like BP method, it is fixed with network training
    variables and provides local optimal decision, and ELM sets count of hidden neurons
    of a system randomizes the weights among the input layer as well as hidden layer
    and according to the hidden neurons in implementation task,20 determines the hidden
    layer output matrix, and consequently reaches the weight from the hidden layer
    as well as output layer under the application of Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse on
    the criterion of the least-squares model. ELM is composed of simple network infrastructure
    and concise variables for processing processes, hence ELM contains the merits
    of rapid-learning speed. The actual infrastructure of ELM is represented in Figure
    2.20 FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Structure of ELM Figure 2 shows
    the ELM structure with n input layer neurons, l hidden layer neurons, and m output
    layer neurons. First, assume the training instances {X, Y} = {xi, yi}(i = 1, 2,
    …, Q), and it is composed of input feature X = [xi1xi2…xiQ] as well as required
    matrix Y = [yj1yj2…yjQ] with training instances, in which the matrix X and matrix
    Y are exhibited as: (1) where parameters n and m refers to the dimension of input
    as well as output matrix. Followed by, ELM sets the weights among the input layer
    as well as hidden layer in a random manner: (2) where wij implies the weights
    from jth input and ith hidden layer neuron. Third, ELM considers the weights from
    hidden and output layers, which are exhibited in the following: (3) where βjk
    implies the weights from jth hidden and ith output layer neuron. Followed by,
    ELM sets bias of hidden layer neurons in a random fashion: (4) Finally, ELM selects
    the network activation function. Based on Figure 2, output matrix T is represented
    as given in the following: (5) The column vector of output matrix T is provided
    below: (6) Besides, assume Equations (5) and (6), it is modeled as, (7) where
    T′ implies transpose of T and H refers simulation outcome of the hidden layer.
    To accomplish an exclusive solution with less error, least square model has been
    applied to determine the weight matrix measures of β. (8) To enhance the normalization
    capability of the system and provides a stable outcome, the regularization of
    β. While the count of hidden layer neurons is minimum than the count of training
    instances, β is exhibited as follows: (9) If the count of hidden layer nodes is
    maximum when compared with the count of training instances, β is represented as
    (10) 2.1.2 Training phase Here, the active platform is evolved from the natural
    hierarchy of CR users and change the action of PU. The ith CR user has generated
    a sensing report Ri,w, developed a local decision according to maximum value obtained
    from recent sensing slot, forward the local decision to FC, which depends on the
    consequences of FC. The power obtained in wth sensing slot at ith CR user is implied
    by Yi,w that is expressed as: (11) The local decision for ith CR user at wth sensing
    slot in training phase is implied by qi,w is provided by: (12) The local decision
    is transmitted to FC, that concatenates local decisions of CR users as well as
    the renders of a global solution. As shown in Equation (12), the local decision
    at training phase is present in quantized-hard format. For all CR users, the sensing
    slot contains a sensing report, which is expressed as Ri,w as developed, as well
    as local decisions is applied based on (12). Followed by, the global decision
    is provided for CR users. When a CR global decision is H0, then it is validated
    by ACK signal. As the overlay cognitive radio network is applied, PU actions are
    not involved. ACK signal is influenced by PU interaction if the spectrum sensing
    result is ineffective and it is a ground reality is H1. 2.1.3 Testing phase Traditionally,
    data are collected about the operating atmosphere and CR user behavior changes
    the environment. As the noisy sensing platform is involved, CR users accomplish
    partial observations of environmental attributes. Moreover, CR users have to transfer
    the data. Finally, a tradeoff between the sensing time and throughput needs to
    be achieved. Thus, partial monitoring as well as mapping the sensing time has
    made the process a complicated one. Followed by, the limitation is that a PU is
    assumed as an independent. A CR user does not have advanced data regarding PU
    hierarchy, and the operational features, and RF platform, interference levels.
    Partial monitoring is reported by embedding alternate CR users with learning operations
    by the global solution. The ACK activates CR users for better learning the operating
    atmosphere and classifies the sensing observations into corresponding classes
    in an accurate manner. The final portion of the local decision-making slot is
    named as reporting phase, in which local decision is addressed as FC, the global
    solution is provided and CR user proceeds accordingly. Besides, the present sensing
    report is divided into the training classes. ELM, ML methodologies, has been applied
    accurately to classify the recent samples as a sensing class. 2.1.4 Classification
    phase The sensing report is composed of n components which come under q. The sensing
    report (xi) should be divided into sensing classes, that has been named as neighbors
    for xi. The candidate set of neighbors for xi is implied by N(xi), where N(xi) ∈ {R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8}
    and CR user is composed of sensing classes. The recent sensing report is associated
    with sensing classes with N(xi). The membership counting vector is expressed by
    . The unit of implies the outcome of combining xi with the jth candidate of lth
    sensing class that is determined by (10). Assume as the event which a sensing
    report xi comes under the class l and be the action where sensing report xi does
    not comes under l. Moreover, defines the action of ω elements in are higher when
    compared with the threshold. Followed by, the posterior probability is a recent
    sensing report xi, which comes under the l as defined as: (13) According to the
    posterior probability, the local decision for ith CR user at rth sensing slot,
    which is implied as qi,r, is represented by: (14) where P0 indicates the count
    of posterior possibilities of sensing classes which indicates H0 and depicted
    as, (15) and P1 exhibits the number of posterior probabilities of sensing categories
    which are denoted by H1 as provided below: (16) 2.2 Blockchain in spectrum access
    Generally, it is defined as two models for SUs to accomplish Specoins: interchanging
    real currency for them as well as preparing and upgrading the blockchain. The
    key objective of blockchain is to save all transactions among SUs, like interchanging
    currency, mining, and extending the blockchain, and to lease accessible spectrum
    by an auction. When compared with the presented blockchain model with previous
    multiple-access models, the measures applied for estimating the performance.21
    Figure 3 shows the structural design of blockchain. The system demands for a report
    about a spectrum access method under the application of Specoin22-26 blockchain
    such as: Scalability: The inclusion of SUs does not reduce the quality of service
    (QoS) of a system. Massive PUs refers to the accessible channels for spectrum
    sharing and, enhance the QoS. Generally, it refers that the spectrum access scheme
    is applicable for supporting massive count of PUs and SUs. Power efficiency: These
    models support energy efficiency by enabling the CRs to obtain Specoins instead
    of participating in blockchain development. Buying the Specoins limits the data
    transmission among CRs, which are highly sensible for energy constraints. Security:
    SUs give access to spectrum, which has to be validated. Malicious users are not
    suitable to access the system with no involvement in auction. Alternatively, security
    concerning encryption has forwarded the messages as reported in a network layer.
    Distributed topology: By assigning the security validation and authorization to
    users as miners, and the requirement for a central-authority node has been eliminated.
    Finally, no firewall demand to save single entry-point attacks, such as denials
    of service. Accessibility: Under the development of direct interchanges and mining
    as models for acquiring Specoins, the systems consume a CR as a SU for accessing
    the unused spectrum. Blockchain accessibility by users permits to verify bids.
    Multicasting: The PU does not require to broadcast the accessible spectrum for
    a single entity. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Blockchain architecture
    2.3 Malicious user identification Once the required steps for spectrum detection
    have been developed, consistent users and MUs were predicted under the application
    of the presented model where digital signatures are applied for verifying participating
    nodes according to the public and private key.20 It is composed of two stages
    of errors based on binary hypothesis sample provided; miss detection as well as
    false alarm where it leads to error in predicting AU and MU. Figure 4 shows the
    flowchart of the MU detection process. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Flowchart of MU detection process Possibility of prediction, miss detection as
    well as false alarm is provided in the following: Probability of AU detection:
    It refers to the effective iterations that result in validating the AU. If Θa
    count of times AU is predicted for η number of rounds provides the feasibility
    of AU detection (Pad). (17) Probability of MU detection: It refers to the effective
    iterations that result in the validation of MU. Possibility of MU detection (Pmd)
    is provided by the ratio of Θm count of times MU is predicted by η count of iterations.
    (18) Probability of miss detection: It has exhibited the ineffective iterations
    that result in the prediction of AU. While number of times AU is not predicted
    for η number of iterations provides the probability of miss detection (Pm). (19)
    Probability of false alarm: The possibility showcases the miss detection of MU
    that results in a false alarm. It (Pf) is represented as the ratio of count of
    times MU was not applicable to predict η number of iterations. (20) 3 PERFORMANCE
    VALIDATION This section discusses the performance of the presented model in terms
    of detection rate, error rate, and missed detection rate. The proposed method
    is simulated using network simulation (NS 3). The parameter setting is illustrated
    in Table 1. The methods available in Reference [18] are employed for comparison
    purposes. TABLE 1. Parameter settings Parameter Value No of CR users 5 Iteration

    count 600 SNR −25 to −10 dB Channel AWGN, fading Figure 5 examines the detection
    rate analysis of the presented model with the presence of nonfading channels.
    The figure denoted that the presented model has offered a high detection rate
    with an increase in signal to noise ratio (SNR). At the same time, the KNN model
    has attained a slightly lower detection rate, but not exceed the detection rate
    of the proposed method. Besides, the OR rule method has exhibited ineffective
    performance and has attained the least detection rate. For instance, under the
    presence of −20 dB SNR, the proposed method has attained a maximum detection rate
    of 0.68, whereas the KNN and OR rule methods have demonstrated a minimum detection
    rate of 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. Besides, under the existence of −12 dB SNR,
    the proposed method has attained a higher detection rate of 0.99, whereas the
    KNN and OR rule methods have resulted in the lower detection rate of 0.94 and
    0.71, respectively. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Detection rate analysis
    with nonfading channels Figure 6 investigates the error rate analysis of the projected
    method under the existence of nonfading channels. The figure portrayed that the
    proposed approach has provided least error rate with an increase in SNR. Meantime,
    the KNN approach has accomplished a moderate error rate than the projected technology.
    On the other side, the OR rule model has represented an inefficient function and
    achieved a higher error rate. For sample, under the existence of −20 dB SNR, the
    presented method has obtained a lower error rate of 0.028, while the KNN and OR
    rule methodologies have illustrated low error rates of 0.3 and 0.17 correspondingly.
    Followed by, under the presence of −12 dB SNR, the newly developed model has achieved
    a minimal error rate of 0, while the KNN and OR rule schemes have provided the
    least error rate of 0.01 and 0.03 correspondingly. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Error rate analysis with nonfading channels Figure 7 determines the
    detection rate analysis of the newly developed approach with the application of
    fading channels. The figure implied that the depicted method has provided a higher
    detection rate with the maximization of SNR. Meantime, the KNN technology has
    reached a minimum detection rate, but not the detection rate of the presented
    approach. Followed by, the OR rule framework has represented the worst performance
    and achieved a lower prediction rate. For illustration, under the existence of
    −20 dB SNR, the deployed model has accomplished a higher predictive value of 0.525,
    while the KNN and OR rule frameworks have showcased the least detection rates
    of 0.467 and 0.46 correspondingly. Followed by, under the presence of −12 dB SNR,
    the developed method has attained a maximum detection rate of 0.68, while the
    KNN and OR rule schemes have ended up with low detection rate of 0.63 and 0.56,
    respectively. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Detection rate analysis
    with fading channels Figure 8 investigates the error rate analysis of the implied
    approach under the existence of nonfading channels. The figure represented that
    the proposed approach has provided a lower error rate with an enhancement in SNR.
    Meantime, the KNN technique has reached a moderate error rate than the presented
    approach. Followed by, the OR rule scheme has represented the worst performance
    and has achieved a higher error rate. For sample, under the existence of −20 dB
    SNR, the developed approach has reached the least error rate of 0.04, while the
    KNN and OR rule models have shown minimal error rates of 0.0.045 and 0.2, respectively.
    On the other hand, under the presence of −12 dB SNR, the newly deployed model
    has reached a minimum error rate of 0.055, while the KNN and OR rule technologies
    have ended up a minimum error rate of 0.08 and 0.085 correspondingly. From the
    abovementioned experimental results, it is apparent that the proposed model has
    shown better performance over the other models under the presence of fading and
    nonfading channels. The application of ELM and blockchain results in effective
    identification of MUs and thereby overall performance can be considerable increased.

    4 CONCLUSION This study has developed effective machine learning with blockchain-based
    spectrum management technique in CRN. The proposed model undergoes three processes,
    namely spectrum sensing, blockchain-based spectrum access, and MU identification.
    Initially, ML-based ELM technique is applied for spectrum sensing. Then, the presented
    blockchain approach provides secured spectrum allocation for SUs. Finally, the
    MUs are identified and to be blocked from accessing the available spectrum resource.
    A series of experiments take place to validate the performance of the presented
    model in terms of detection rate and error rate. The experimental outcome stated
    that under the presence of −20 dB SNR, the proposed method has attained a maximum
    detection rate of 0.68, whereas the KNN and OR rule methods have demonstrated
    a minimum detection rate of 0.58 and 0.5, respectively. In future, the performance
    of the projected model can be increased by the use of advanced deep learning with
    hyperparameter tuning models instead of ELM. CONFLICT OF INTEREST The authors

    SAVE TO MY LIBRARY ARTICLE MENU     Abstract In this paper, a Cognitive Radio
    Network (CRN) based on artificial intelligence is proposed to distribute the limited
    radio spectrum resources more efficiently. The CRN framework can analyze the time-sensitive
    signal data close to the signal source using fog computing with different types
    of machine learning techniques. Depending on the computational capabilities of
    the fog nodes, different features and machine learning techniques are chosen to
    optimize spectrum allocation. Also, the computing nodes send the periodic signal
    summary which is much smaller than the original signal to the cloud so that the
    overall system spectrum source allocation strategies are dynamically updated.
    Applying fog computing, the system is more adaptive to the local environment and
    robust to spectrum changes. As most of the signal data is processed at the fog
    level, it further strengthens the system security by reducing the communication
    burden of the communications network. Conference Presentation  © (2017) COPYRIGHT

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Cognitive Radios are secondary radio systems
    which can use the vacant bands of a Primary radio for communication. Cognitive
    radios are reconfigurable radios with signal processing and Machine learning capabilities.
    The spectrum usage is controlled by different spectrum regulatory authorities
    and agencies. Majority of the agencies are following a static spectrum allocation
    technique and CRs are looking for dynamic spectrum allocation. The primary objective
    of a CR is to scan the radio environment and identifying a white, black or grey
    space which is a critical and complex task. This paper discusses implementation
    of a reconfigurable spectrum sensing engine. The spectrum sensing engine includes
    an energy detection engine, Cyclostationary sensing engine and a Matched filter
    based sensing engine. Based on the advance knowledge of the primary user signal
    and noise level one of the engines will be activated. All the spectrum sensing
    engines are implemented in a Xilinx Artix 7 FPGA. Published in: 2017 International

    Thiruvananthapuram, India I. Introduction Cognitive radios are the leading next
    generation wireless communication technology which can efficiently exploit the
    under-utilized spectrum. Cognitive radio is an intelligent reconfigurable radio
    which opportunistically uses a licensed spectrum [1]. One of the main functionality
    of a cognitive radios is reliable and automatic identification of an unused licensed
    spectrum [2]. The critical factors that make spectrum sensing more difficult are
    SNR, multipath effects, shadowing effect, noise randomness etc. The two basic
    parts of spectrum sensing are cooperative and Non-cooperative spectrum sensing
    both have its own advantages and dis-advantages. The knowledge of the signal power
    and noise the sensing engine will use matched filter, Cyclostationary or energy
    sensing techniques [3]. Sensing duration and hardware requirements are another
    set of major problems as far as CRs are concerned. A high speed parallel computing
    hardware is essential to reduce the sensing duration and a high resolution ADC
    is needed. In this work all three sensing engines are implemented in ARTIX 7 FPGA
    and a register is provided for entering the signal power or noise information
    so that the engines can switch between each other. Sign in to Continue Reading

    Cognitive radio, Spectrum occupancy, Machine learning analysis, Cellular network,
    Spectrum analyzer Abstract One of the key issues of wireless communication networks
    is the spectrum crisis, and studies noted that static licensed bands are in the
    under-utilization stage. Recently Cognitive Radio Network facilitates a solution
    to minimize the spectrum crisis in which unlicensed users can utilize the licensed
    spectrum without transmission interference. To achieve this task we used Machine
    Learning techniques for analyzing spectrum occupancy which is an efficient method
    to analyze spectrum occupancy and provides high accuracy. Supervised machine learning
    algorithms namely Logistic regression, K nearest neighbor, and Naive Bayes are
    used to classify a given frequency band. In this paper we collect spectrum samples
    of GSM 900, 1800, and 2100 bands using Rohde & Schwarz FSH6 Handheld Spectrum
    Analyzer for developing a dataset, using that dataset we trained the classifiers
    and analyze their classification performance accuracy. Results have shown the
    best performance on the validation and testing partition for various Unweighted
    Average Recall (UAR) of each classifier. Here the Logistic Regression classifier
    learns the best representation from their feature vector. This research is helpful
    to measure the spectrum occupancy of different static allocated licensed bands
    for 24/7. This will give better ideas about spectrum utilization, future spectrum
    allocation and comfort to serve more users in the limited spectrum. The occupancy
    measurements of current allocated spectrums can not only provide a convincing
    basis for making future spectrum allocation policies, but also provide technical
    support for the development of new communication technologies. Cite This Paper

    applications require significant bandwidth, some of which will be provided by
    third-generation (3G) services. Even with substantial investment in 3G infrastructure,
    the radio spectrum allocated to 3G will be limited. Cognitive radio offers a mechanism
    for the flexible pooling of radio spectrum using a new class of protocols called
    formal radio etiquettes. This approach could expand the bandwidth available for
    conventional uses (e.g. police, fire and rescue) and extend the spatial coverage
    of 3G in a novel way. Cognitive radio is a particular extension of software radio
    that employs model-based reasoning about users, multimedia content, and communications
    context. This paper characterizes the potential contributions of cognitive radio
    to spectrum pooling and outlines an initial framework for formal radio-etiquette

    Spectrum sensing is a challenging task in cognitive radio network. Finding the
    vacant spectrum, adjusting the transmission parameters based on the sensed spectrum
    and transmission of secondary user data with high throughput is a demanding task.
    Heuristic approaches can adjust/adapt to these tasks within less computation time.

    IEEE Conference Location: Coimbatore, India I. Introduction The demand for spectral
    resource is exponentially increasing due to the development of new wireless technologies/devices
    and also due to user''s demand/growth. Now-a-days, users demand for high data
    rate, high capacity and massive connectivity with other devices [1]. 5G technology
    is emerging in such a way to meet all the user demand with higher satisfaction.
    For different communication purposes, the spectrum is already allotted by FCC.
    To improve the usage of allotted spectrum, cognitive radio (CR) concept was introduced
    by Joseph Mitola III [2]. Already allotted licensed spectrum can be utilized by
    any users when the spectrum is free. These users are called as secondary users

    Next-generation wireless networks are expected to support extremely high data
    rates and radically new applications, which require a new wireless radio technology
    paradigm. The challenge is that of assisting the radio in intelligent adaptive
    learning and decision making, so that the diverse requirements of next-generation
    wireless networks can be satisfied. Machine learning is one of the most promising
    artificial intelligence tools, conceived to support smart radio terminals. Future
    smart 5G mobile terminals are expected to autonomously access the most meritorious
    spectral bands with the aid of sophisticated spectral efficiency learning and
    inference, in order to control the transmission power, while relying on energy
    efficiency learning/inference and simultaneously adjusting the transmission protocols
    with the aid of quality of service learning/inference. Hence we briefly review
    the rudimentary concepts of machine learning and propose their employment in the
    compelling applications of 5G networks, including cognitive radios, massive MIMOs,
    femto/small cells, heterogeneous networks, smart grid, energy harvesting, device-todevice

    DOI: 10.1109/MWC.2016.1500356WC Publisher: IEEE Introduction Radical and sometime
    even un-orthodox next-generation networking concepts have received substantial
    attention both in the academic as well as industrial communities. One of their
    driving forces is that of providing unprecedented data rates for supporting radical
    new applications. Specifically, next-generation networks are expected to learn
    the diverse and colorful characteristics of both the users'' ambience as well
    as human behavior, in order to autonomously determine the optimal system configurations.
    These smart mobile terminals have to rely on sophisticated learning and decision-making.
    Machine learning, as one of the most powerful artificial intelligence tools, constitutes
    a promising solution [1]. As shown in Fig. 1, we may envision an intelligent radio
    that is capable of autonomously accessing the available spectrum with the aid
    of learning, altruistically controlling transmission power for the sake of conserving
    energy as well as adjusting the transmission protocols. Figure 1 Intelligent radio
    learning paradigm Show All Machine learning has found wide-ranging applications
    in image/audio processing, finance and economics, social behavior analysis, project
    management, and so on [2]. Explicitly, a machine learns the execution of a particular
    task T , with the goal of maintaining a specific performance metric P based on
    a particular experience E , where the system aims to reliably improve its performance
    P while executing task T , again by exploiting its experience E . Depending on
    how we specify T,P , and E , the learning might also be referred to as data mining,
    autonomous discovery, database updating, programming by example, and so on [3].
    Machine learning algorithms can be simply categorized as supervised and unsupervised
    learning, where the adjectives “supervised/unsupervised” indicate whether there
    are labeled samples in the database. Later, reinforcement learning emerged as
    a new category that was inspired by behavioral psychology. It is concerned with
    an agent''s certain form of reward/utility, who is connected to its environment
    via perception and action. The family of machine learning algorithms can also
    be categorized based on their similarity in terms of their functionality and structure,
    yielding regression algorithms, instance-based algorithms, regularization algorithms,
    decision tree algorithms, Bayesian algorithms, clustering algorithms, association
    rule based learning algorithms, artificial neural networks, deep learning algorithms,
    dimension reduction algorithms, ensemble algorithms, and so on. In this article,
    we will introduce the basic concept of machine learning algorithms and the corresponding
    applications according to the category of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
    learning. Machine learning can be widely used in modeling various technical problems
    of next-generation systems, such as large-scale MIMOs, device-to-device (D2D)
    networks, heterogeneous networks constituted by femtocells and small cells, and
    so on. Figure 2 portrays the family-tree of machine learning techniques and their
    potential applications in 5G. Against this background, we embark on investigating
    the family of learning techniques. Specifically, in the following sections we
    consider supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.
    Each section consists of several subsections, discussing specific learning models,
    such as regression models and the k nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm, support
    vector machines (SVM) and Bayesian learning; k -means clustering, principal and
    independent component analysis; and partially observed Markov decision processes,
    Q-learning, and the multi-armed bandit technique. Each section commences with
    the introduction of the learning model and its applications in 5G networks. Finally,
    our conclusions are drawn. Figure 2 Radio learning architecture. Show All Supervised
    Learning in Wireless Communications Regression Models, KNN and SVM: MIMO Channel
    and Energy Learning Models Regression analysis relies on a statistical process
    for estimating the relationships among variables. The goal of regression analysis
    is to predict the value of one or more continuous-valued estimation targets, given
    the value of a D-dimensional vector x of input variables. The estimation target
    is a function of the independent variables. In linear regression, the regression
    function is linear, while in logistic regression, it is a logistic function assuming
    a common sigmoid curve. The KNN and SVM algorithms are mainly utilized for classification
    of points/objects. In KNN, an object is classified into a specific category by
    a majority vote of the object''s neighbors, with the object being assigned to
    the class that is most common among its k nearest neighbors. The output may be
    constituted by a specific property of the object, such as for example the average
    of the values of its k nearest neighbors. By contrast, the SVM algorithm relies
    on nonlinear mapping, which transforms the original training data into a higher
    dimension where it becomes separable and then it searches for the optimal linear
    separating hyperplane that is capable of separating one class from another, again
    in this higher dimension. They correspond to non-linear classification methods
    relying on the family of kernel methods. It was shown that with the aid of an
    appropriate nonlinear mapping to a sufficiently high dimension, the data from
    two classes can always be separated by a hyperplane [3 p. 21, 185, 239, 349].
    Applications These models can be used for estimating or predicting radio parameters
    that are associated with specific users. For example, in massive MIMO systems
    associated with hundreds of antennas, both detection and channel estimation lead
    to high-dimensional search-problems, which can be addressed by the above-mentioned
    learning models. In order to generalize the SVM function for employment in data
    classification problems, its hierarchical version, referred to as H-SVM, was proposed
    in [4], where each hierarchical level consisted of a finite number of SVM classifiers.
    This regime was used for the estimation of the Gaussian channel''s noise level
    in a MIMO-aided wireless network having t transmit antennas and r receive antennas.
    By exploiting the training data, the H-SVM model was trained for the estimation
    of the channel noise statistics. HMM is a tool designed for representing probability
    distributions of sequences of observations. It can be considered a generalization
    of a mixture-based model, where the hidden variables, which control the specific
    mixture of the component to be selected for each observation, are related to each
    other through a Markov process, rather than being independent of each other. In
    heterogeneous networks constituted by diverse cells, handovers may be frequent,
    where both the KNN and SVM can be applied to finding the optimal handover solutions.
    At the application layer, these models can also be used for learning the mobile
    terminal''s specific usage pattern in diverse spatio-temporal and device contexts,
    as discussed in [5]. This may then be exploited for prediction of the configuration
    to be used in the location-specific interface. Given a set of contextual input
    cues, machine learning algorithms are capable of exploiting the user context learned
    for the sake of dynamically classifying the cues into a system state for the sake
    of saving energy, while maintaining a high level of user satisfaction. Donohoo
    et al. [5] also conducted experiments using five real user profiles, including
    the user-lo-cations and energy consumption, but their data is not accessible to
    the public. The experiment showed that up to 90 percent successful energy demand
    prediction is possible with the aid of the KNN algorithms. Table 1. Supervised
    machine learning algorithms. Bayesian Learning: Massive MIMO and Cognitive Radio
    Models The philosophy of Bayesian learning is to compute the a posteriori probability
    distribution of the target variables conditioned on its input signals and on all
    of the training instances. Some simple examples of generative models that may
    be learned with the aid of Bayesian techniques include, but are not limited to,
    the Gaussians mixture model (GM), expectation maximization (EM), and hidden Markov
    models (HMM) [3 p. 445]. GM is a model where each data point belongs to one of
    several clusters or groups, and the data points within each cluster are Gaussian
    distributed. EM is a generalization of maximum likelihood estimation, which iteratively
    finds the most likely solutions or parameters. It is characterized by two steps:
    the “E” step that chooses a function representing the lower bound of the likelihood,
    and the “M” step that finds the parameters maximizing the chosen function. HMM
    is a tool designed for representing probability distributions of sequences of
    observations. It can be considered a generalization of a mixture-based model,
    where the hidden variables, which control the specific mixture of the component
    to be selected for each observation, are related to each other through a Markov
    process, rather than being independent of each other. Application The Bayesian
    learning model may be readily invoked for spectral characteristic learning and
    estimation in next-generation networks. To address the pilot contamination problem
    encountered in massive MIMO systems, the authors of [6] estimated both the channel
    parameters of the desired links in a target cell as well as those of the interfering
    links of the adjacent cells, where channel estimation was carried out with the
    aid of sparse Bayesian learning techniques. Based on the observation of received
    signals, the channel component was first modeled by a GM, namely by a weighted
    sum of Gaussian distributions having different variances, and then estimated with
    the aid of the EM algorithm. Another three closely related applications may be
    found in cognitive radio networks. In [7], a cooperative wideband spectrum sensing
    scheme based on the EM algorithm was proposed for the detection of a primary user
    (PU) supported by a multi-antenna assisted cognitive radio network. This iterative
    technique first created the log-like-lihood function of both the unknown spectrum
    occupancy as well as of the channel information and of the noise in the “E” step.
    Then, it maximized the log-likelihood function for the sake of inferring the unknown
    information during the “M” step, which was carried out by jointly detecting both
    the PU signal as well as estimating the channel''s unknown frequency response
    and the noise variance of multiple subbands. In contrast to [7], the authors in
    [8] constructed a HMM relying on a two-state hidden Markov process, where the
    PUs are present or absent and a two-state observation space, indicating whether
    the PUs are present or absent. Furthermore, the EM algorithm was invoked for finding
    the true channel parameters, such as the sojourn time of the available channels,
    the inactive states of the PUs, and the PUs'' signal strength. Finally, the third
    application of Bayesian learning was advocated in [9], where a tomography model,
    belonging to the Bayesian inference framework, was proposed for conceiving and
    statistically characterizing a range of techniques that are capable of extracting
    the prevalent parameters and traffic/interference patterns for employment in cognitive
    radio networks at both the link layer and network layer. The parameters collected
    included both the path-delay as well as the proportion of successful packet receptions,
    while the estimated parameter was the link''s successful transmission probability.
    The Bayesian estimators were derived for single/multiple transmissions in single/multiple
    path scenarios. In Table 1, we summarize the basic characteristics and applications
    of supervised machine learning algorithms. Unsupervised Learning in Wireless Communications
    K -Means Clustering: Heterogeneous Networks Models K -means clustering aims for
    partitioning n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to
    the closest cluster. It defines the centroid of a cluster as the center of gravity,
    that is, the mean value of the points within the cluster. The clustering algorithm
    proceeds in an iterative manner, where an object is assigned to the specific cluster
    whose centroid is nearest to the object based on the Euclidean distance ‘similarity
    metric’, and then the in-cluster differences are minimized by iteratively updating
    the cluster-centroid, until ‘convergence’ is achieved. Explicitly, convergence
    is deemed to be achieved when the assignment becomes stable, that is, the clusters
    formed in the current round are the same as those formed in the previous round
    [3 p. 161, 317]. Applications Clustering is a common problem in 5G networks, especially
    in heterogeneous scenarios associated with diverse cell sizes as well as WiFi
    and D2D networks. For example, the small cells have to be carefully clustered
    to avoid interference using coordinated multi-point transmission (CoMP), while
    the mobile users are clustered to obey an optimal offloading policy, the devices
    are clustered in D2D networks to achieve high energy efficiency, the WiFi users
    are clustered to maintain an optimal access point association, and so on. In [10],
    the authors considered a hybrid optical/wireless network scenario, in order to
    reduce the overall wireless tele-traffic by encouraging the utilization of the
    high-capacity optical infrastructure. A mixed integer programming (MIP) problem
    was formulated to jointly optimize both the gateway partitioning and the virtual-channel
    allocation based on classic k-means clustering, which was employed to partition
    the mesh access points (MAPs) into several groups. The proposed scheme commenced
    its operation from an initial gateway access point (GAP) set, which can be plucked
    by a random selection from the set of MAPs, or can be more astutely determined
    using a meritorious initialization criterion. Next, each MAP is assigned to its
    nearest GAP. If several eligible GAPs are in the vicinity, then the specific GAP
    that has a readily available virtual channel is chosen. Finally, by using the
    classic k -means clustering algorithm, the MAPs are divided into k groups associated
    with the closest GAPs. Principal and Independent Component Analysis: Smart Grid
    and Cognitive Radio Models Principal component analysis (PCA) transforms a set
    of potentially correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated variables referred
    to as the principal components, where the number of principal components is less
    than or equal to the number of original variables. Principal component analysis
    (PCA) transforms a set of potentially correlated variables into a set of uncorrelated
    variables, referred to as the principal components, where the number of principal
    components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. Basically,
    the first principal component has the largest possible variance (i.e., accounts
    for as much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component
    in turn has the highest variance possible under the constraint that it is orthogonal
    to (i.e., uncorrelated with) the preceding components. The principal components
    are orthogonal, because they are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, which
    is symmetric. By contrast, independent component analysis (ICA) is a statistical
    technique conceived to reveal hidden factors that underlie sets of random variables,
    measurements, or signals. In the model, the data variables are assumed to be linear
    mixtures of some unknown latent variables, and the mixing system is also unknown.
    The latent variables are assumed to be non-Gaussian and mutually independent,
    and they are referred to as the independent components of the observed data, which
    can be found by ICA [3 p. 115]. Applications Both the PCA and ICA constitute powerful
    statistical signal processing techniques devised to recover statistically independent
    source signals from their linear mixtures. One of their major applications may
    be found in the area of anomaly-detection, fault-detection, and intrusion-detection
    problems of wireless networks, which rely on traffic monitoring. Furthermore,
    similar problems may also be solved in sensor networks, mesh networks, and so
    on. They can also be invoked for the physical layer signal dimension reduction
    of massive MIMO systems or to classify the primary users'' behaviors in cognitive
    radio networks. As a further example, in [11] PCA and ICA were applied in a smart
    grid scenario to recover the simultaneous wireless transmissions of smart utility
    meters installed in each home. At the power utility station, it was required to
    separate the signals received from all the smart meters before the signals can
    be decoded. The statistical properties of the signals were exploited to blindly
    separate them using ICA. This operation is capable of enhancing both the transmission
    efficiency by avoiding channel estimation in each frame, as well as data security
    by eliminating any wideband interference or jamming signals. More explicitly,
    a substantial security enhancement was achieved by a robust version of the PCA-based
    method, which exploited the sparse, low-rank nature of the auto-covariance matrices
    of the smart metering signal and of the wideband interferer, respectively, in
    order to confidently separate them prior to ICA processing. Another pertinent
    example is found in cognitive radio scenarios, where the so called Boolean ICA
    relied on the Boolean mixing of OR, XOR, and other functions of binary signals
    [12]. It was also incorporated into the PU separation problem often encountered
    in cognitive radio networks for the sake of distinguishing and characterizing
    the activities of PUs in the context of collaborative spectrum sensing. Furthermore,
    the observations of the secondary users (SUs) were modeled as Boolean OR mixtures
    of the underlying binary PU sources. An iterative algorithm, called Binary ICA,
    was developed to determine the activities of the underlying latent signal sources,
    such as the PUs. It was demonstrated that given m monitors or SUs, the activities
    of up to (2m−1) distinct PUs can be inferred. ln Table 2, we summarize the basic
    characteristics and applications of unsupervised machine learning algorithms.
    Reinforcement Learning in Wireless Communications Partially Observable Markov
    Decision Process: Energy Harvesting Models Markov decision processes (MDPs) provide
    a mathematical framework for modeling decision making in specific situations,
    where the outcomes are partly random and partly under the control of a decision
    maker, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. At each time step, the process is in some state
    s , and the decision maker may opt for any of the legitimate actions a that is
    available in state s . The process responds at the next time step by randomly
    moving into a new state s ′ , and giving the decision maker a corresponding reward
    U a (s) . The probability that the process moves into its new state s ′ is influenced
    both by the specific action chosen, as well as by the system''s inherent transitions,
    formally described by the state transition probability P a ( s ′ |s,a) . Given
    s and a , the state transition probability is conditionally independent of all
    previous states and actions, that is, the state transitions of an MDP process
    satisfy the fundamental Markov property. By contrast, a partially observable Markov
    decision process (POMDP) may be viewed as the generalization of a MDP, where the
    agent is unable to directly observe the underlying state transitions and hence
    only has partial knowledge, as shown in Fig. 3b. The agent has to keep track of
    both the probability distribution of the legitimate states, based on a set of
    observations, as well as of the observation probabilities and of the underlying
    MDP [3 p. 517]. Figure 3 Illustration of reinforcement learning: a) Markov decision
    process; b) Partially observed Markov decision process; c) Q-learning. Show All
    Table 2. Unsupervised machine learning algorithms. Applications The family of
    MDP/POMDP models constitutes ideal tools for supporting decision making in 5G
    networks, where the users may be regarded as agents and the network constitutes
    the environment. There are usually three steps associated with modeling a problem
    using MDP. The first step is to specify the system''s state space and the decision
    maker''s action space, as well as verifying the Markov property. The second step
    is that of constructing the state transition probabilities P a ( s ′ |s,a) formulated
    as the probability of traversing from state s to s''under action a . The last
    step is to quantify both the decision maker''s immediate reward U a (s) and its
    long-term reward using Bellman''s equation [13]. Then, a carefully constructed
    iterative algorithm may be conceived to identify the optimal action in each state.
    Classical applications found in the literature include the network selection/association
    problems of heterogeneous networks (HetNets), channel sensing, and user access
    in cognitive radio networks, and so on. Furthermore, energy harvesting (EH) has
    also been extensively modeled using MDP/POMDP, where the limited battery and the
    time-variant channels are usually regarded as the environment, while the users''
    channel selection or battery utilization are usually considered as the actions.
    For instance, in [13] the transmission power control problems of EH systems were
    investigated using the POMDP model, where the state space was defined by including
    the battery state, the channel state, the packet transmission/reception states,
    and an action by the node, which corresponded to sending a packet at a certain
    power level. The feedback messages implicitly provided the EH system with partial
    channel state information (CSI), which resulted in the corresponding POMDP formulation.
    Since finding exact solutions to the POMDP tends to be computationally intractable
    [13], a pair of computationally efficient suboptimal solutions, i.e. the maximum-likelihood
    heuristic policy and the voting heuristic policy, were explored. Q-Learning: FEmto/Small
    CElls Models Q-learning may be invoked to find an optimal action policy for any
    given (finite) Markov decision process, especially when the system model is unknown,
    as shown in Fig. 3c. It is a model-free reinforcement learning technique and as
    such it can be used in conjunction with MDP models. In such a case, the Q-learning
    model is also comprised of an agent, of the states S and of a set of actions A
    per state. By executing an action in a specific state, the agent gleans a reward
    and the goal is to maximize its accumulated reward. Such a reward is illustrated
    by a Q-function, where “Q” is initialized to be an (arbitrary) fixed value. Then,
    “Q” is updated in an iterative manner after the agent carries out an action and
    observes the resultant reward as well as the associated new state at each time-instant
    [3 p. 517]. Applications Q-learning has also been extensively applied in heterogeneous
    networks, usually in conjunction with the aforementioned MDP models. In [14] the
    authors presented a heterogeneous fully distributed multi-objective strategy based
    on a reinforcement learning model constructed for the self-configuration/optimization
    of femtocells. The model was supposed to solve both the resource allocation and
    interference coordination problems in the downlink of femtocell networks. The
    main objectives of the learning process are two-fold: first, to acquire spectrum
    allocation awareness and to identify the availability of unused spectral slots
    for the provision of opportunistic access; second, to select sub-channels from
    the available spectrum pool and to configure the terminals supported by femtocells
    to operate under carefully constructed restrictions to avoid interference and
    to meet the quality of service (QoS) requirements. Another example is constituted
    by dense small cell networks regarding their cell outage management and compensation
    [15]. The system''s state was constituted by the specific allocation of users
    to the resource blocks of small cells, as well as by the channel quality, while
    the actions were constituted by the downlink power control actions, with the rewards
    being quantified in terms of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) improvement.
    It was demonstrated that the compensation strategy based on the reinforcement
    learning model attained an exceptional performance improvement. Multi-Armed Bandits:
    Device-To-Device Networks Models In practice, multi-armed bandits (MAB) have been
    used to model resource allocation problems operating under a fixed budget by carefully
    proportioning resources among competing projects, whose properties are only partially
    known at the time of resource allocation, but which may become better understood
    as time passes. Since the agent has no initial knowledge about the machines, the
    crucial trade-off they confront at each instance is between the “exploitation”
    of the specific machine that has the highest expected payoff and the “exploration”
    required to glean more information about the expected payoffs of the other machines.
    The MAB problem may also be extended into a multi-player, multi-armed bandit game
    (MP-MAB), where the reward gleaned by any player depends on the specific decisions
    of other players. The key idea of the proposed approach is to enable each user
    to forecast the future actions of its opponents based on public knowledge and
    to proceed by best responding to the predicted joint action profile using some
    bandit strategy [3 p. 517]. Applications The MAB and MP-MAB models, as a family
    of emerging signal processing tools, are capable of solving challenging resource
    allocation problems in wireless scenarios, where either the channel conditions
    or some other wireless environment parameters have to be “explored,” while the
    known channels also have to be “exploited” by a group of users. Generally, these
    models may be beneficially used in multi-player adaptive decision making problems,
    where selfish players infer an optimal joint action profile from their successive
    interactions with a dynamic environment, and finally settle at some equilibrium
    point. This problem has indeed been encountered in many wireless networking scenarios,
    with a compelling one being the channel selection problem of a distributed device-to-device
    (D2D) communication system integrated into a cellular network, and another one
    in the context of emerging next-generation networks [16]. The selfish D2D users
    aimed to optimize their own performance by camping on the vacant cellular channels,
    whose statistics were unknown to the users. This distributed channel selection
    problem was in harmony with the typical MP-MAB settings, and thus it was modeled
    as an MP-MAB game. Specifically, every D2D user was modeled as a player of the
    MP-MAB game, while the channels were regarded as arms and choosing a channel corresponds
    to pulling an arm. The authors proposed a channel selection strategy consisting
    of two main blocks, namely the calibrated forecasting and the no-regret bandit
    learning strategies. In Table 3, we summarize the rudimentary characteristics
    and applications of reinforcement machine learning algorithms. Table 3. Reinforcement
    machine learning algorithms. Future Research and Conclusions A range of future
    research ideas on machine learning in 5G networks can be summarized as follows.
    The family of supervised learning techniques relies on known models and labels
    that can support the estimation of unknown parameters. They can be utilized for
    massive MIMO channel estimation and data detection, spectrum sensing and white
    space detection in cognitive radio, as well as for adaptive filtering in signal
    processing for 5G communications. They can also be applied in higher-layer applications,
    such as inferring the mobile users'' locations and behaviors, which can assist
    the network operators to improve the quality of their services. Unsupervised learning
    relies on the input data itself in a heuristic manner. It can be utilized for
    cell clustering in cooperative ultra-dense small-cell networks, for access point
    association in ubiquitous WiFi networks, for heterogeneous base station clustering
    in HetNets, and for load-balancing in HetNets. It can also be applied in anomaly/fault/intrusion
    detection and for the users'' behavior-classification. The classes of supervised,
    unsupervised, and reinforcement learning tools were investigated, along with the
    corresponding modeling methodology and possible future applications in 5G networks.
    In a nutshell, machine learning is an exiting area for artificial intelligence
    aided networking research! Reinforcement learning relies on a dynamic iterative
    learning and decision-making process. It can be utilized for inferring the mobil
    users'' decision making under unknown network conditions, for example during channel
    access under unknown channel availability conditions in spectrum sharing, for
    distributed resource allocation under unknown resource quality conditions in femto/small-cell
    networks, and base station association under the unknown energy status of the
    base stations in energy harvesting networks. Furthermore, computational intelligence
    paradigms, such as neural networks and neuro-fuzzy methods, swarm intelligence
    algorithms such as ant colony optimization, and evolutionary algorithms such as
    the competitive imperialist algorithm, may also be applied to improve the performance
    of 5G networks. Among those compelling techniques, neural networks and deep learning
    have recently become particularly popular. Generally, a neural network consists
    of a number of neurons and weighted connections among them, where the neurons
    can be regarded as variables and the weights can be viewed as parameters. The
    network should be appropriately configured with the aid of learning techniques
    to ensure that the application of a set of inputs produces the desired set of
    outputs. Explicitly, this can be achieved by iteratively adjusting the weights
    of the existing connections among all neuron pairs with the aid of learning based
    on the labeled data for supervised learning or unlabeled data for unsupervised
    learning. Neural networks have been widely utilized for spectral white state estimation
    [17], prediction [18], and handoff decisions [19] in cognitive radio networks.
    Note that the algorithms introduced in this article are only limited samples of
    the machine learning field. There are many other algorithms that can also be applied
    to the next-generation networks. For example, the family of evolutionary algorithms,
    such as genetic algorithms can solve optimization problems by mimicking a natural
    selection process, which can be utilized to solve resource allocation problems
    in HetNets [20]. By contrast, machine learning relies on two phases, the training
    phase and the testing phase, where the training phase imposes a much higher complexity
    than the testing phase. Due to the energy constraints and computational complexity
    constraints of mobil terminals, it is recommended to only implement the testing
    phase on shirt-pocket-sized mobile terminals. This article reviewed the benefits
    of artificial intelligence aided wireless systems equipped with machine learning.
    We introduced the major families of machine learning algorithms and discussed
    their applications in the context of next-generation networks, including massive
    MIMOs, the smart grid, cognitive radios, heterogeneous networks, femto/small cells,
    D2D networks, and so on. The classes of supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
    learning tools were investigated, along with the corresponding modeling methodology
    and possible future applications in 5G networks. In a nutshell, machine learning
    is an exiting area for artificial intelligence aided networking research! ACKNOWLEDGMENT

    Keywords Metrics Abstract: According to CISCO report threefold increase in the
    mobile traffic can be witnessed between 2016 and 2021. With this, there will be
    a problem of spectrum allocation and usage. So, to overcome the spectrum scarcity
    problem, new generation spectrum management focuses on spectrum sharing and the
    promising technology that assists dynamic spectrum sharing is cognitive radio
    (CR). Spectrum sensing techniques plays an important and challenging role in spectrum
    sharing by avoiding the collision occurring between the primary users (PUs) and
    the second users (SUs). It also reduces delay and energy consumption of the SUs
    and base station. Machine learning algorithms are proven to be more efficient
    than the narrow band spectrum sensing techniques in terms of speed, complexity
    etc. Hence, this paper developed an algorithm for spectrum prediction process
    in CR adapted by gradient boosting algorithm to predict the status of the channel
    as busy, idle and middle. From the results, it is shown that the proposed scheme
    can predict the channel status effectively with a high accuracy of 99%. Published

    Location: Tirunelveli, India SECTION I. Introduction Wireless communication had
    a rapid pace of revolution over the past few years. From the birth of 1G to the
    present 5G, a huge transition is observed in people''s lifestyle, work, technology
    etc. The significant increase in the amount of users, throughput and coverage
    are the primary objectives of wireless standards. “Spectrum” is the crucial resource
    required to achieve the aforementioned goals. An ever-increasing demand to access
    the radio spectrum is setting the stage for reviewing the existing radio spectrummanagement
    practices. Static spectrum assignment policy has limited the use of spectrum resulting
    in the inefficient usage of this vital resource. The survey report of Federal
    Communication Commission (FCC) [1] states that, spectrum utilization varies anywhere
    between 15% to 85 % and 90 % of the time licensed part of the spectrum is unoccupied
    (fig 1). Fig. 1. Spectrum utilization [1] Show All Although the fixed spectrumassignment
    approach served well in the past, because of remarkable rise in the number of
    users accessing the spectrumhas led to the lack of spectrum. Underutilization
    of the spectrum results in spectrum holes. Therefore potential shift from static
    to dynamic is essential to overcome the current limitation. Dynamic Spectrum Sharing
    (DSS) is the key solution for intelligent spectrum handing-over. The enabling
    technology that assists DSS is Cognitive Radio (CR). The frequency band with lesser
    density (lesser licens ed us ers) is s ens ed by CR and as signs unoccupied band
    to the SUs without producing any interference to PU. Federal Communications Commission(FCC)
    has stated: “Cognitive - radio: A radio or s ys tem that s ens es its operational
    electromagnetic environment and can dynamically and autonomously adjust its radio
    operating parameters to modify systemoperation, such as access secondary markets,
    reduce interference, increase throughput, supports interoperability”. [1]. Auto-Regressive(AR)
    spectrum prediction model in CR with particle filtering is proposed in [2]. These
    models fails in terms of multiple prediction and advantageous only for one step
    prediction. In [3] spectrum prediction rate is improved with Hidden Markov Model(HMM)
    but it requires complete prior knowledge of the channel information. Practically
    only partial information will be known and this limits the scope of HMM. An accuracy
    of 95% is obtained when studied and analyzed using support vector machine (SVM)
    [4]. Spectrum occupancy state is predicted using Multilayer Perceptron(MLP) [5].
    Inductive learning is used in ANN where as in Genetic Algorithrn(GA),deductive
    learning with objective evaluation function is used. Weight optimization in neural
    network using genetic GA is simulated in [6]. To enhance the performance of the
    mobile network, hybrid algorithm combining random forest with decision tree is
    proposed in [7]. However, there are a few limitations in narrow band sensing techniques
    such as energy detection performance degrades at low signal to noise ratio(SNR)
    and fails to distinguish between noise and signal. Cyclo-stationary detection
    is complex for large signals. Matched-filter based detection demands prior information
    of the signals for optimal detection which may not be feasible always. Computational
    complexity is high in covariance based detection and hence not suitable for real
    time application. Instead of wasting the spectrum when not used by PU, it is better
    to allocate unoccupied spectrum to SU for transmission. CR exploits the spectrum
    in such a manner that it doesn''t cause disruption to PUs. In order to save sensing
    energy and sensing time of SU, busy portion of the spectrum has to be skipped.
    To achieve this, reliable spectrum sensing mechanism is essential in CR. The channel
    status information of the channels in its coverage is collected by Base Station
    and it is used for training ML algorithm. Based on this history data, CR equipped
    with ML algorithm predicts the status of the channel to SU when it tries to acces
    s the spectrum In between if the PU tries to acces s the channel which the SU
    is using, spectrumhandoffshould take place to avoid collision and to continue
    its transmission [7]. This is illus trated in fig 2 where yellow and green rectangle
    represents primary users and secondary users respectively. The duration of each
    frame is t and to is the start of the frame. Every frame contains transmission
    duration spectrum sensing duration as well as transmission duration. At the start
    of every frame sensing must be performed. Transmission is not possible in this
    particular duration. If Ps is the sensing duration, Pd is the total frame length;
    Pd- Ps is the transmission period. The SU performs spectrum sensing in sensing
    frame before transmission to know the status of the channel. If the time taken
    for the spectrum sensing is long, then available time for transmission will be
    less. More energy is required to sensing by SU. In order to save the energy of
    SU, channel s tate information is provided in prior by ML algorithm When the channel
    is idle there is no need of spectrum sensing and SU shall carry out the transmission.
    If the channel s tate is busy then SU cannot acces s the channel. Spectrum sensing
    should be performed only when the channel is in middle s tate, and can acces s
    the channel for transmission only if the transmission duration is more and no
    PU activity is detected [8]. Therefore providing the information regarding the
    status of the channel to SU saves the energy and also increases the throughput
    of the network. Hence, Spectrum sensing plays an important role in DSS. Fig. 2.
    Channel model Show All Machine Learning (ML) is better computational technique
    when compared with other narrow band techniques because of good learning ability
    and it doesn''t require any prior threshold setting. Time taken by ML algorithms
    is also comparatively less which is an important factor in CR. Many ML algorithms
    like MLP, Naive-Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), SVM, GA, Decision-Tree (DT)
    etc are used in CR. However, deep learning algorithms like MLP demands huge number
    of datasets for learning, hence performance degrades if the datasets are small
    [5]. An accuracy of 95% is obtained when studied and analyzed using SVM [4]. Random
    forest and gradient boosting are the two boosting methods in which the base estimators
    are built sequentially as well as the bias of the combined estimator is attempted
    for minimization. The motivation is to combine several weak models to produce
    strong effective ensemble. Hence, we propose a novel algorithm which combines
    decision tree and gradient boosting algorithm for dynamic spectrum sensing in
    CR. The outline of the paper is as follows. Section 2 has detailed description
    of spectrum data set generation followed by the attributes used for the experiment.
    Section 3 describes the implementation of Gradient Boosting Algorithm for Spectrum
    sensing and results and conclusion are discussed in Section 4. SECTION II. Generation
    of Spectrum Dat Asets The generation of communication is becoming adaptive in
    nature in terms of spectrum allocation - amount of spectrum used, by which user,
    at what radio frequency etc. The training and testing data sets are needed for
    clas s ification algorithm ‘M’ number channels are allocated to primary usersystemand
    bandwidth allocated primary user system for every channel is ‘W’ Hertz. ‘N’ secondary
    users could be active in the network. Every channel has continuous frame of ‘P’
    and duration of each frame is 10msec. Users have been allotted in the channel
    using random distribution function. Entry frame and exit frame of every user is
    also randomized. To describe channel status for the secondary users, channel quality
    is demonstrated as follows: Channel Quality ‘P‘of Jth Channel is Defined as Number
    of frames user is present Toral number of frames (1) View Source where, p∈[0 1]
    . Channel quality of jth channel is bad when p is small, indicating there will
    be more chances of colliding with the PU, if the channel is allocated to SUo Due
    to this there will be increased in the chances of channel switching. Divide the
    interval [0, 1] into three small intervals in order to describe the channel quality
    clearly: p∈[0  β 1 ] - Channel j is available, remaining ON state is abundant
    and channel in idle state, where β 1 ∈(01) pϵ[ β 1 β 2 ] Remaining ON time is
    short i.e., channel is in middle s tate, where β 1 < β 2 p∈[ β 2 ] - Channel is
    occupied by the PU or busy state. Attributes The dataset used for the work is
    generated using MATLAB tool. There are total 600 data sets, which is split in
    such a way that 20% for testing purpose while the rest 80% of data is utilized
    for training purpose. The data set contains three output classes i.e., idle, middle
    and busy. The feature ranges are as shown below Channel number: 1–600 Entry Frame:
    1–1000 Exit Frame: 1–1000 Channel Quality (p):0−1 The output classes have a discrete
    value of 0 (idle), 1 (middle) and 2 (busy). Channel number indicates the active
    channel in the given frequency range. Entry and exit frame represents the frame
    in which the user had entered and left the frame. The duration between the entry
    and the exit frame is the user stay duration in the respective channel. Simulation

    shown in figure 3. Fig. 3. A sample of spectrum dataset generated. Show All Table.
    1. Simulation specifications SECTION III. Gradient Boosting for Spectrum Sensing
    Python is a popular programming language which is easy to learn and implement.
    It has efficient high -level data structures and a simple but effective approach
    to object-oriented programming. Along with its development environment, Python''s
    elegant syntax and flexible typing make it fast application creation and an excellent
    language for scripting in several other fields in many platforms. A package comprising
    of large number of common algorithms along with its efficient versions is proved
    by Scikit Learn and this feature makes Scikit Learn one of the famous recommended
    libraries. The parameter like ‘feature-importance’ is provided by Scikit-Learn
    library for ensembles of trees (such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting) and
    decision tree models. The datasets contain input features and output labels. In
    most of the situation, few input features do not have significant effect for output
    it means all the input parameter will not contribute equally in predicting the
    desired response. Therefore, it is necessary to recognize the influence of each
    and every feature in estimating the interested parameter. This operation is enabled
    by the usage of feature importance attribute provided by Scikit-Learn library.
    Gradient boosting is one among the most effective methods for building predictive
    models. An additive model in a forward stage-wise way is constructed by gradient
    boosting plus it provides for the optimization of arbitrarily differentiable loss
    functions. The concept of boosting is dependent on the idea of if weak learner
    might be improved to be much better. The performance of a weak learner is a little
    better than an arbitrary chance. Addition of many weak learners to minimize the
    loss function-Mean Square Error (MSE) or Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the process
    being comparable to gradient descent is the main objective of gradient boosting.
    In this method, the decision trees are used as weak learners. This ens emble method
    builds a stage -wise forward additive model; at each stage, a new learner is added
    leaving the exis ting weak learners unchanged. Fig 4 describes the workflow of
    gradient boosted regression trees. Let the training data set contain M samples
    of (ak, bk) in which ak and bk are the output variable and input vector for the
    kth sample, respectively. If F(a) is the predicted output, and the loss function
    L(bk, F(ak)) is defmed as the error between the actual and predicted outputs,
    then the minimal magnitude of the loss function leads to the development of most
    efficient model. Based on Equation (2), the predictable value of the loss function
    L( b k ,F( a k )) could be reduced to F ∗ . F ∗ =argmin E b i a L(b,F(a))=argmin
    E ba [(b−F(a) ] 2 (2) View Source Fig. 4. Flow chart describing the workflow of
    gradient boosted regression trees Show All In order to calculate the expected
    output, F(a), Gradient boosting algorithm assigns weights to each weak leamer,
    and output is the weighted sum of weak learners h(a; z j ) F(a,{ β i ; z j } J
    )= Σ I i=1 β i h(a;  z j ) (3) View Source . where, weight given to every weak
    learner is β and the total number of weak learners be J. h(a; z j ) is an individual
    regression tree described by a fmite set ofparameters,j z and the related leaf
    node, split variables and split locations. An additive model is built by the gradient
    boosting algorithm that is of the form of Equation (4): F j (a)= F j −1(a)+ β
    i h(a; z j ) (4) View Source where, F j-l(a) is imperfect model from the previous
    step to which es timator h(a; zj) is summed at every iteration j, to compute a
    better additive model which follows stage-wise forward approach, which is as shown
    in Equation (4). To lessen loss function of the predicted response, F j (a) as
    well as observed responses, the training of the decision tree h(a; η ˙ ) and its
    associated weight β ) is required as shown in Equation (2). There are several
    model parameters which can affect the performance of trained model. The bias -variance
    trade off should be maintained while tuning the model parameters. The parameters
    which can have recognizable influence on the performance of trained model are
    listed: ‘n-estimators'' - This value indicates the overall boosting stages count
    required to train the model. When boosting stages are increased to large number
    better performance is assured in a gradient boosting as sufficiently robust for
    overfitting cases. The magnitude of ‘n-estimators'' considered is 30. ‘learning-rate’
    - For several weak learners to fit, a clear interaction between the parameter
    ‘n -estimators ‘ and ‘learning-rate’ is required. To maintain a fixed value of
    training error, ‘learning-rate’ is expected to have smaller value and weak learners
    are required in larger numbers. For early stopping select ‘n-estimators'' once
    the learning rate is set to a smaller value (for example learning-rate less than
    or equal to 0.1) [9]. ‘n-estimators'' and ‘learning-rate’ have a tradeoff between
    them. The default magnitude of ‘learning-rate''is considered 0.1. ‘subsample’
    - At each iteration, the base model, i.e. the decision tree, is trained on a part
    dataset that is available for training. There is no replacement for those subsamples
    that are drawn. The model assures further improvement of accuracy by subsampling
    with the ‘learning-rate’(shrinkage). The value of subsample used is 0.7. ‘max-features''
    - Subs ampling the attributes that analogous to random splits is yet other effective
    strategy to decrease the variance value. This parameter is used to control the
    number of sub-sampled features. ‘max-depth’ - For every regression estimator,
    the maximum depth is represented by this parameter. The number of nodes in the
    tree is limited by max depth variable. It is known that the best value is dependent
    on the input variable''s interaction; hence this parameter is tuned to obtain
    best performance. The default magnitude ‘max-depth’ is considered 3. ‘min-samples-leaf
    - At every leaf node, it is required to have lesser samples. This minimum number
    is indicated by this variable. The training samples in every branch(both right
    and left branch) of a decision tree; for any depth, only the split point is considered
    in those scenarios where it leaves at minimal ‘min-samples-leaf. SECTION IV. Results
    and Analysis The simulation is carried out in Python version 3.7. Gradient Boosting
    is used for learning and testing process. The data set has been divided in such
    a way that 80% data is utilized for training and 20% is for testing. The various
    channel status prediction by gradient boosting is described in this section. By
    providing channel status information to the SUs, we can save the energy and sensing
    time and hence reduces the power required at the base station drastically [10].
    It also reduces the interference between the PUs and SUs and improves the performance
    of prediction accuracy. Correlations among the features can be found using ‘corr()’
    function provided in ‘Pandas'' library. To visualize the correlations in the form
    of a matrix, a heatmap is used. The correlation matrix using a heatmap method
    provided by seaborn library is shown in table 2. It can be observed that channel
    quality show a high positive correlation value of 0.88, whereas entry frame show
    a high negative correlation value of −0.53. PR is negatively correlated with all
    input features. The accuracy of predicting channel status obtained is 99.1%. Fig
    5 gives the description model evaluation parameters like precision, recall, f1
    score and support for the spectrum occupancy state. Simulation is carried out
    by increasing the number of users in the network. Increas e in accuracy rate and
    model evaluation metrics for output parameters are illustrated in fig 6. Table.
    2. Correlation matrix for features Fig. 5. Model evaluation metrics Show All Fig.
    6. Model evaluation metrics for increased number of users Show All In the Gradient
    Boosting analysis, the training set is further subdivided to obtain a validation
    set having 15% of data from the training set. For implementation of Gradient Boosting
    function, the Scoot-Learn library is utilized in Python environment. The hyper
    parameters for boosting are learning rate, sub-sample and loss function. Sub-sample
    is the fraction of training data utilized to fit individual base learners during
    boosting iteration. The default value of subsample is set to 1 (one), however
    a chosen value less than one will lead to an increment of bias and decrease invariance
    of performance metric considered. The hyper parameters are tuned to obtain smooth
    convergence of error with the number of boosting iterations. SECTION V. Conclusion
    and Futurework Predicting the channel status play a vital role in evaluating the
    performance of DSS using CR. To overcome the problems in traditional spectrum
    sensing techniques, ML algorithm is neces s ary to incorporate in CR to enhance
    the learning process. Gradient boosting algorithm has been implemented in python
    to predict the channel state as idle, middle and busy. Among 80% of the training
    set, 15% is cons idered for validation. After the simulations, from the results
    it is observed that gradient boosting performs better when compared to other algorithms.
    The simulation result shows that Gradient Boos ting performs well in prediction
    with an accuracy of 99%. As discussed, getting the channel status information
    in prior saves sensing energy and avoid interference to PUs. Next challenging
    work is to allocate the idle channel to the SUs and performspectrumhandoffto SU
    when the PUs wants to transmit the packets. Gradient boosting concentrates more
    on reducing the bias, this may leads to over fitting of the model. Therefore,
    this problem can be addressed by using the advanced ensemble methods. Authors

    Environment III. A Learning Architecture IV. Applications of Learning in VDSA
    V. Conclusion Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract:
    In this paper, we discuss various ways of incorporating machine learning techniques
    in the area of dynamic spectrum access, especially in vehicle communications,
    how learning can benefit multiple applications in vehicle communications, and
    the specific requirements on the implementation in this field. In particular,
    we describe an architecture for optimizing the overall performance of vehicular
    dynamic spectrum access (VDSA) networks. Due to the high level of mobility for
    vehicles operating under highway conditions, coupled with spatially variant spectrum
    allocation across a large geographical region, we envision that future vehicular
    communications will employ a form of dynamic spectrum access (DSA) in order to
    facilitate wireless transmissions between vehicles and with roadside infrastructure.
    Moreover, the VDSA concept will be realized via a combination of software-defined
    radio (SDR) technology, spectral occupancy databases, and machine learning techniques
    for enabling network automation. A vehicular networking scenario possesses the
    potential to be substantially different relative to a generic mobile scenario
    with respect to the particular type of mobility involved, the predictable trajectories
    of the vehicular traffic, and the overall scale of the network range. Consequently,
    this architecture is designed to enable VDSA in a more flexible wireless spectrum
    environment by leveraging the cognitive radio concept and existing wireless spectrum
    databases actively being developed while simultaneously being compatible with
    current spectrum regulations. Published in: 2011 International Symposium on Intelligent

    SECTION I. Introduction Vehicular networking possesses significant potential for
    enabling diverse applications associated with traffic safety, traffic efficiency
    and information provisioning [1]. Recently, there has been a rapid accumulation
    of knowledge in this exciting area propelled by a highly active research community
    consisting of both academia and industry [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. Ever since
    1999, when the United States Federal Communication Commission (FCC) allocated
    75 MHz of spectrum in the 5.9 GHz band for dedicated short-range communications
    (DSRC) to be used by Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) [7], applications
    involving one-way and two-way vehicle-oriented communications have evolved into
    many various forms. As the automotive sector continues to evolve and electronic
    devices become smaller and more powerful, new features are being introduced into
    the next generation of vehicles. Consequently, we can expect that vehicular communications
    will become ubiquitous in the foreseeable future, resulting in a significant increase
    in the bandwidth required by various applications. Dynamic spectrum access (DSA)
    was proposed by researchers in the wireless community in order to enable the efficient
    utilization of radio frequency spectrum, thereby preventing the significant under-utilization
    reported in several scientific studies [8], [9]. DSA enables unlicensed devices
    to temporarily “borrow” unused licensed spectrum while ensuring that the rights
    of the incumbent license holders are respected. Although several licensed frequency
    bands could facilitate DSA-based vehicular communication networks, the UHF television
    frequency range which spans across 470–698 MHz (Channel 14 through Channel 51)
    has often been identified as a primary candidate due to its relatively static
    frequency channel usage by incumbent TV broadcasters. As licensed spectrum bands,
    i.e., TV ultra-high frequency (UHF) bands, are open to whitespace devices, contention
    will become an inevitable issue among secondary users trying to access these licensed
    bands. At present, most research efforts primarily focus on opportunistic spectrum
    access involving stationary scenarios or scenarios with average moving speeds
    of less than 10 m/s [10], while the average speed limit is about 15 m/s in urban
    areas and more than 30 m/s in highways. Such high mobility makes synchronization
    an increasingly difficult problem, especially between fixed base stations and
    mobile vehicles. It is reported that an average commuter in the United States
    drives approximately 26 km per day [11]. Even for TV spectrum bands, which is
    characterized as having a stationary spectrum utilization across large distances,
    e.g., 100 km, the spectrum occupancy characteristics throughout the journey will
    probably not be invariant. Consequently, we describe the use of dynamic spectrum
    access as a possible option for certain types of vehicle communications. Vehicular
    communications can be categorized into Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle-to-Roadside
    (V2R), and Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) [12]. Applications utilizing vehicular
    communications will most likely be using the services of a complement of two or
    more of these categories. Of these, V2V scenarios are more challenging in comparison
    to V2R and V2I scenarios. For instance, V2V communications within the United States
    is supported via the 75-MHz band at 5.9 GHz allocated for DSRC. Although it is
    still too early to say whether DSRC is sufficient for the growing demand for V2V
    applications, we envision that it would be very difficult to obtain additional
    licenses for spectrum dedicated specifically for vehicle communications. Considering
    all of the above factors, dynamic spectrum access would be one possible means
    of looking for spectrum opportunities while simultaneously offloading some non-safety-related
    bandwidth demands from dedicated channels for vehicle communications. In this
    paper, we describe a vehicular communications architecture that incorporates a
    case-based reasoning approach as part of the implementation for a vehicular cognitive
    radio engine. Vehicles are one of the most sophisticated consumer goods commonly
    available to modern society, possessing a wide range of technological innovations.
    The ample power supply and various sensors make it possible for employing an onboard
    intelligence that can improve the safety and quality-of-life of the passengers.
    Due to the highly dynamic environment in which a vehicle has to operate, a vehicle
    needs to have the capability of adapting to the environment to achieve one or
    more objectives. Sometimes a searching or optimization process is needed to find
    the optimal configuration for a given environment state, or a case-based reasoning
    approach can be used that finds previous similar use cases that fit the current
    environment state. Since most vehicles are used for short-distance trips, they
    can be expected to have some frequent destinations and routes. Consequently, a
    case-based approach could be of great potential to serve vehicle communications.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we summarize the
    characteristics of vehicle communication environments and some of its current
    and potential applications. In Section III, we describe a system architecture
    of incorporating cognitive radios in vehicle communications. In Section IV, we
    enumerate how to implement machine learning for some key applications in the learning
    architecture. In Section V, we conclude and indicate future works. SECTION II.
    Understanding and Learning the Vehicle Communication Environment There is a trend
    that customer mobile communication devices are integrating multiple means of accessing
    different frequency bands and multiple wireless services, such as cellular voice
    services, data services, Internet services, personal area networks, and wireless
    local area networks. Furthermore, a vehicle has the potential of integrating more
    means of wireless access relative to a personal communication device or serve
    as an omnipotent peripheral device when integrating with personal devices such
    as cell phones. On the other hand, the high demand of wireless services has resulted
    in more open and flexible frequency regulation. It can be expected that adaptive
    channel selection will become crucial in future wireless networks. We can categorize
    the possible channel options for vehicle communications into three categories
    as shown in Fig. 1, namely dedicated channels, free access channels, and opportunistic
    access channels. The opportunistic access channels can be further divided according
    to their temporal and spatial accessibility. Dedicated channels (Ex: DSRC) Free
    access channels. Always free in all locations at all time (Ex: ISM) Opportunistic
    access channels Primary user locations are known Deterministic primary user traffic
    (Ex: TV signals) Random primary user traffic (Ex: Paging bands) Fig. 1. Different
    types of channels for vehicle communications Show All Primary user locations are
    unknown (Ex: Cellular networks) Examples of dedicated channels include the frequency
    band assigned to DSRC, which is allocated only to vehicle communications. In order
    to ensure the reliable transmission of safety-related messages, different types
    of vehicle communications are prioritized according to their corresponding level
    of importance. For example, private data communications will need to yield to
    public safety-related communications. Free access channels include the popular
    industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) radio bands that enabled the blooming
    of WiFi and Bluetooth. WiFi hotspots usually have a coverage of less than 100
    meters, making it unsuitable for wireless service responsible for provide information
    infrastructure for vehicles moving at speeds generally higher than 20 m/s. On
    the other hand, the large population of WiFi hotspots and the high congestion
    in the ISM band makes it less favorable of a choice for quality service in vehicle
    communications. TV whitespace has been recently opened to secondary wireless access
    including mobile-to-mobile communications, followed by the IEEE 802.22 standard
    published in July 2011 [13]. This could be a viable option for vehicle communication
    and an example of future flexible spectrum regulation. For instance, we have studied
    the feasibility of using TV whitespace for vehicle communications in [2]. TV whitespace
    is not limited to mobile-to-mobile communications but also between mobile and
    fixed devices and between fixed devices. It is foreseen that TV whitespace devices
    will appear on the market in order to provide Internet access for larger coverage
    than WiFi due to its allowed maximum power level of 4 watts EIRP. Although all
    of the aforementioned categories of channels can be applied to vehicle communications,
    they exhibit different channel characteristics and availability, which poses the
    problem of channel selection for vehicle communications. The average car lifespan
    is 12 years, within which time the wireless environment will definitely change,
    including the spectrum regulations and channel utilization statistics. Since the
    wireless communications among vehicles are expected to be fully automated with
    minimum driver distraction, it is necessary for the vehicle radio devices to adapt
    to the environment change automatically. Fig. 2. The architecture for applying
    learning in vehicular communications [20]. Show All SECTION III. A Learning Architecture
    Introducing machine learning techniques into cognitive radios has been widely
    studied over the past several years. Ever since the concept of cognitive radio
    was coined [14], machine learning techniques have been applied across various
    aspects of cognitive radio design, such as signal classification [15] and transceiver
    optimization [16], [17]. A conceptual architecture was proposed in [18], and an
    implementation framework with case-based reasoning was proposed in [19]. However,
    there has been noticeably little research with respect to the design of an architecture
    specifically targeting vehicle communications, which possesses the potential to
    become a very large market and may involve the deployment of cognitive radio systems.
    A vehicle is a sophisticated machine employing a wide range of technologies, such
    as sensors, batteries, navigation systems, radios, and human-machine interfaces.
    Our architecture is trying to incorporate all communication-related components
    and information sources within the context of a vehicle communication network.
    A diagram of the architecture is shown in Fig. 2. The source of policies contains
    information on nation-wide and local spectrum regulations that define the spectrum
    access rules, which are not necessarily the same at every location. The knowledge
    database is responsible for storing all forms of knowledge needed to guide the
    configuration of the vehicle communication devices. Such knowledge can be represented
    in the form of standards or previous use cases. There are other forms of information,
    such as vehicle traffic conditions and weather conditions that will help configure
    vehicle communications but they are also considered to be dynamic and instantaneous,
    thus they will not be kept in the database. These sources of information can be
    obtained via communications with other vehicles or with roadside units, while
    the information from various sensors are directly obtained from the vehicle itself.
    The cognitive engine is similar to that found in a conventional cognitive radio
    system, but with more stringent requirements on the convergence speed and quality
    of service metrics. The implementation of the cognitive engine depends on the
    application-specific task requirements. For example, support vector machines or
    artificial neural networks can be used for implementing classifiers [15], genetic
    algorithms or simulated annealing can be used for performing various types of
    searches [19], and prediction can be achieved by using hidden Markov chain as
    well as artificial neural networks. A. Case-Based Reasoning Cycle The cycle of
    case-based reasoning in Fig. 2 is composed of a knowledge base, a method of extracting
    matched knowledge, the cognitive engine, and a method to update the knowledge
    base. A typical case-based reasoning process includes retrieval, reuse, revision,
    and retention [21]. The case-based reasoning approach can avoid repeated searching
    of the best solution in similar environment states, thus possessing the potential
    of reducing the convergence time of the cognitive engine employed in vehicle communications
    when traveling in the same area during the during the same time of a day or a
    week. B. Reinforcement Learning Cycle The adaptation cycle is composed of the
    cognitive engine that generates the radio configurations, a software-defined radio
    (SDR) with possibly multiple radio interfaces to interact with the wireless environment,
    and a method of performance measurement that evaluates the performance of radio
    configurations. This is a typical reinforcement learning problem [22]. The optimal
    solution for a specific type of vehicle communication application depends on the
    physical environment, as well as the traffic conditions, both of which are dynamic
    with a vast state space. Although there is a big loop involving the user interface,
    the user interaction should be kept to a minimum so as to avoid any unnecessary
    distractions to the drivers. The role of user in this architecture is mostly offline
    planning instead of real-time learning, which should be performed automatically
    by the vehicle. In wireless ad hoc networks, it is a time-consuming action for
    a transmitter-receiver pair to perform channel switching. It usually includes
    exchanging channel availabilities between transmitter and receiver and handshaking
    on the new channel. According to an experiment of V2V communication in TV whitespace
    using USRP2s [3], the average channel switching time is 2 seconds. On the other
    hand, it only takes a negligible amount of time for a single device to change
    frequency and sense a new channel. SECTION IV. Applications of Learning in VDSA
    Employing intelligence within a VDSA network can be achieved in a variety of ways
    across multiple communication layers. We will describe how learning techniques
    can be applied to the following components of a VDSA-enabled system. Each component
    has attracted significant attention from researchers in both the machine learning
    and communication communities, and multiple solutions have been proposed. However,
    a vehicle as an integrated product often requires cross-layer system level design
    that can combine these components seamlessly together. A. Signal Classification
    and Opportunity Identification When traveling in a dynamic wireless environment,
    a vehicle needs an accurate assessment of the level of spectrum utilization in
    its immediate vicinity. A spectrum database is a promising approach for providing
    a substantial amount of information. Moreover, differentiating primary user signals
    from secondary user signals remains a problem that has not been entirely solved
    yet. Several examples of spectrum hole detectors include energy detection methods
    and cyclo-stationarity characterization [23], where the latter can also achieve
    signal classification at the expense of an increase in computational cost. However,
    the detection of spectrum holes, i.e., whitespace, is insufficient for the most
    efficient dynamic spectrum access when there are multiple secondary users. Spectrum
    whitespace is supposed to be shared by secondary users rather than being allocated
    on a first-come-first-serve basis. In addition, primary user emulators pose a
    threat on fair spectrum sharing. Consequently, it is necessary to distinguish
    a primary user signal from a secondary user signal. Classic classification tools
    such as support vector machines have been used for protecting the integrity of
    spectrum measurements [24] at centralized spectrum management agents. However,
    in order to extend this level of protection to include the scenario of a traveling
    vehicle, a substantial amount of communication overhead between the vehicle and
    a spectrum availability server is required. For localized signal classification,
    artificial neural networks can be employed based on the output of cyclostationarity
    characteristics [25] in order to provide more information on identify of signal
    sources. B. Channel Prediction and Selection Since a vehicle is traveling across
    space with usually inconsistent spectrum usage characteristics, the channel selection
    process will be a continuous adaption in relation to the surrounding environment.
    The varying channel characteristics and the large environment state space will
    rule out the option of mapping each environment state to its corresponding best-possible
    channel. Consequently, we use reinforcement learning techniques to learn the best-possible
    channel in real-time. A vehicle radio system will follow a loop of processes continuously,
    including updating channel preference, channel sensing, channel accessing, and
    performance measurements. The channel occupancies can be dynamic and stochastic.
    Information other than the time and location can be useful in determining the
    channel availability, which can significantly aid our channel decision, especially
    when traveling in unfamiliar regions. The process of prediction requires a substantial
    amount of learning. This problem becomes even more complex in a vehicular communications
    environment. An example of the relationships between sensed environment and the
    performance measurement output in a vehicle communication environment is shown
    in Fig. 3, where the dashed lines indicate weak relationships and solid lines
    indicate strong relationships. Fig. 3. An example of the relationships among sensed
    information and performance measurements in wireless environment. Green elements
    are tunable parameters. Yellow elements are constraint on performance. Show All
    Artificial neural networks have been widely used to approximate hidden relationships
    by training on sample data sets. In most cognitive radio applications, time and
    location are generally considered to be independent from other network parameters.
    Given the input of channel user densities, traffic intensities, noise, and channel
    availabilities, it is conceivable that artificial neural networks can be employed
    to make predictions on the actual throughput. When a set of neural network parameters
    are trained, it can be saved in association with a tuple of time and location
    in the knowledge base. The process of channel prediction is part of the channel
    selection process. Channel selection is a dynamic process depending on various
    factors shown in Fig. 3. Reinforcement learning is a suitable tool for achieving
    real-time learning and adaptation in channel selection [20]. Using the architecture
    in Fig. 2, we can store the learned knowledge about channels as cases in the knowledge
    base, and use the sensed location in order to extract specific cases. The FCC
    policies provide the information on what channels are available in the region.
    The reinforcement learning cycle is implemented as an adaptive channel selection
    here. Intuitively, samples of spectrum utilization at the same location during
    the same time across several days will possess a higher consistency when compared
    to spectrum utilization at different locations within a single day. Given this
    property, we can learn channel characteristics on a regional and take samples
    during the same time period across several days. This sampling approach corresponds
    well to the traveling pattern of daily commuters. We will first focus on learning
    the best-possible channel within a small region of just several kilometers. The
    overall channel selection will be composed of channel selections of regions. The
    learning approach will utilize the past experience on channel selection to generate
    channel preferences that are aware of current channel conditions as well. C. Optimizing
    Transmission Parameters Software-defined radios enable the online configuration
    of a transceiver in order to adapt to the environment and achieve optimal performance.
    Genetic algorithms have been widely used for this purpose [16], [26]. The data
    rate, transmission range, and frequency usage can be tuned with objectives such
    as mitigating congestion, minimizing delay, and maximizing throughput. However,
    as pointed out in [26], careful designs are need to for genetic algorithms to
    achieve the speed requirements in vehicle communications. In order to accelerate
    the speed of genetic algorithms, learning from past experiences can help guide
    the searching process. For example, the initial generation of solution candidates
    can be seeded using the solutions from previous searching in the similar environment.
    Another approach is to constraint the variable ranges of the solution space according
    to the environmental information. Both these two approach need to be combined
    with a case based reasoning framework that can correctly map the current environment
    state to previous experience. D. Interference Avoidance Interference avoidance
    has always been a key subject in dynamic spectrum access. It is even more important
    in vehicle communication environments due to the highly level and speed of mobility.
    In [10], an adaptive guard distance is employed to take nodes mobility into consideration
    when setting sensing threshold to avoid interference to primary users. Suppose
    the average relative speed between any secondary user and primary user is v ¯
    , and the length of a sensing-accessing epoch of a secondary user is T epoch ,
    an extra sensing distance of ε satisfying: ε v ¯ > T epoch (1) View Source is
    needed in addition to the minimum sensing distance for stationary secondary users.
    Such consideration is to make sure that a mobile secondary user has the chance
    to detect primary users before entering the keep-out range of primary users. However,
    this precaution is based on the assumption that there is zero knowledge about
    the location and mobility pattern of either the primary users or the secondary
    users, which is not the case for vehicle communications. Vehicles usually have
    pre-determined destinations and predictable speeds and locations. These information
    sources can be used to aid the reasoning of how to mitigate the impact of the
    interference to primary users. As shown in Fig. 4, when the location of primary
    user base stations are known by a vehicle via accessing spectrum ser, it is much
    easier to determine when and where interference is likely to occur. In addition
    the reasoning based on instant speed and location, past experience can also be
    utilized to make more accurate prediction of interference. In [27], the author
    proposed an approach that maps the measured received signal strength at the transmitter
    side and the channel access success ratio. Fig. 4. Speed-dependent guard distances
    are used to avoid interference of a moving vehicle to primary users. Show All
    E. Optimizing Spectrum Sharing In vehicle communications, message congestion can
    be a severe problem when then the number of vehicles are high. This is especially
    true for safety related broadcasting messages, which has a latency requirement
    of lower than 100 ms [4]. A one-channel paradigm was envisioned in [28], where
    they claimed that a distributed fast-responding network requires a common channel
    on which every user shares information of common interest. Given all of the above
    requirements, congestion can easily happen for a flooding scheme with contention-based
    MAC scheme, such as that used by the current IEEE 802.11p standard. Many adaptive
    solutions have been proposed in order to remedy the congestion problem. The most
    popular solutions are to adjust the message rate and transmission range according
    to environment information, such as road density, speed, and packet drop rates
    [29]. Location-aware flooding was also considered with dynamic virtual segmentation
    of road or user group formulation depending on traveling speed and road density
    [5]. In either solution, new parameters were introduced to adapt to the environment,
    and a smart design of learning can always enhance the adaptation performance.
    Another approach to alleviate congestion is the use of multiple radio interfaces.
    This is much easier to realize on a vehicle than on personal mobile devices or
    mobile sensor nodes. More flexible designs can be implemented by using multiple
    radio interfaces in order to effectively solve the congestion problem. For example,
    one radio interface can be configured to constantly listen on the control channel,
    while tracking neighboring vehicles on another channel. F. Transmission Routing
    In V2V communications, most applications are one-hop communication between immediate
    neighbour vehicles or information dissemination among a region [4]. This fact
    is intuitive since the majority of vehicles are selfish and has no interest in
    forwarding packages for other vehicles. Consequently, conventional point-to-point
    routing is not a crucial problem in those applications. On the other hand, broadcast
    and multi-cast routing is more important in vehicle communications. Such types
    of routing are useful in applications of the form of information dissemination,
    where the information is of common interest of multiple vehicles. Typical applications
    exist both in V2V communications, such as slow vehicle warning, and V2I communications,
    such as hazardous location warning and map downloading. In [30], a routing protocol
    based on the movement of vehicles is proposed, where vehicles having similar speed
    and direction are grouped together in which the most reliable path is formed.
    A multi-cast routing enhancement based on reinforcement learning is proposed in
    [6], where the multi-cast routing problem is formulated as a spanning tree problem,
    and the weight of each edge is constantly updated according to the relative speeds
    and directions. SECTION V. Conclusion In this paper, we described vehicular dynamic
    spectrum access networking as a viable option for future vehicle-to-vehicle and
    vehicle-to-infrastructure communications. Vehicles not only serve as a power platform
    for deploying cognitive radio and dynamic spectrum access-enabled systems, but
    also created a wireless environment that is quite different relative to conventional
    mobile wireless networks, such as high speed mobility, varying node density, and
    predictable mobility. We describe how a learning architecture can be used to better
    provide the capability of dynamic spectrum access. We also enumerate several key
    enabling functions and their appropriate implementations using machine learning
    tools. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This E-WEHP:

    networks will seek an increasing demand in the utilization of the spectrum with
    the rise in the number of users. The radio spectrum is a scarce resource that
    must be managed and exploited effectively without sacrificing the quality of service
    during operation. For this purpose, the spectrum resources can be dynamically
    shared amongst all the users wherein the unutilized licensed spectrum of the primary
    users can be allocated to an unlicensed secondary user when it is underutilized
    by the former. This concept is called Cognitive Radio in a communication network.
    In this manner, the on-demand resources can be constructively taken advantage
    of thereby, helping the unlicensed users to be part of the spectrum at regular
    intervals during unoccupied times. This task is successfully achieved through
    spectrum sensing by the unlicensed secondary user. Hence, spectrum sensing is
    an important task and proper care must be taken while choosing the schemes for
    the same. The same concept is further extended by a real-time scenario with multiple
    secondary users. Here, a central hub called the Fusion Centre connects, manages,
    and helps in the intelligent allocation of resources amongst the secondary users.
    This is called Cooperative Spectrum Sensing. The use of Machine Learning will
    be highly beneficial. So, the addition and implementation of appropriate Machine
    Learning algorithms will help in intelligently predicting the spectrum allocation
    methods. In this work, Spectrum detection methods namely the Cyclostationary method
    (for High Noise environment) and Energy Detection method (for Low Noise environment)
    have been implemented. Machine Learning Classification techniques namely Decision
    Tree Classification and Random Forest Classification have been implemented for
    predicting the spectrum sensing method by having the received signal''s Energy

    Abstract

    With the rapid development of wireless communication technology, radio technology
    has gradually come

    into people’s sight. The arrival of the information age also makes people more
    urgent to need radio

    technology. However, the allocation of traditional static wireless spectrum resources
    is extremely uneven,

    which leads to extreme scarcity of spectrum resources. Many authorized spectrum
    is idle and spectrum

    utilization is low. In order to improve the utilization of spectrum resources
    and make secondary use of

    idle spectrum, this paper studied the cognitive in¦nite agent Spectrum Allocation
    (SA) strategy based on

    Machine Learning (ML) algorithm and data science technology. This paper compared
    Cognitive Radio

    (CR) SA based on ML algorithm and data science technology with traditional methods.
    The experimental

    results showed that the average practicability of the two CR SA in the public
    mobile communication

    frequency band was 80% and 74% respectively; the average practicability in the
    terrestrial TV frequency

    band was 75% and 59.5% respectively. Therefore, CR SA based on ML algorithms and
    data science and

    technology could improve the practicability and resource utilization of spectrum.

    1. Introduction

    Wireless communication services have developed rapidly, and spectrum resources
    are becoming

    increasingly scarce. However, the traditional ¦xed allocation mode has the problems
    of low e¨ciency of

    SA, low utilization of resources and low utilization of idle spectrum. CR technology
    is proposed. This

    technology is conducive to improving the utilization of spectrum resources. Therefore,
    how to effectively

    use the spectrum resources of CR is an important topic at present. CR technology
    can obtain spectrum

    resource information without special authorization, and improve the utilization
    rate of spectrum

    resources through secondary utilization of idle spectrum resources. CR SA based
    on ML algorithm and

    data science technology can classify and process data through the characteristics
    of ML algorithm and

    data science, which can more effectively improve the utilization of spectrum resources
    and system

    e¨ciency. Therefore, this paper had research signi¦cance.

    CR is a new technology. Especially in the situation of scarce spectrum resources,
    many scholars have

    studied it. Wang Yonghua studied the SA algorithm based on reinforcement learning
    technology in CR

    networks, and analyzed each algorithm in its speci¦c practical application scenarios.
    He discussed the

    openness of dynamic SA, which might be the subject of future research [1]. Singh
    Wangjam Niranjan

    studied different SA methods and technologies in CR networks. He not only compared
    them in terms of

    allocation schemes and implementation models, but also emphasized the security
    attacks on SA. Finally,

    the challenges that should be considered in the SA technology of CR were also
    discussed [2]. Vimal S

    proposed a mode based on combinatorial auction, which allocated spectrum to secondary
    users based

    on combinatorial auction. Spectrum Sensing Data Hijack attack was mitigated by
    using neighbor

    monitoring method, and the disclosed method made it easy to allocate freely and
    improved the

    con¦dentiality rate of spectrum [3]. Teng Zhi-jun, based on the SA model of game
    theory, proposed a

    balanced SA algorithm based on potential game theory to quickly achieve Nash equilibrium
    in the game

    process between cognitive users and the balanced allocation between users in multiple
    channels, which

    Page 3/18

    could enhance the communication quality [4]. Ramchandran M proposed a multi-objective
    brain storm

    optimization algorithm to deal with the trade-off between the energy throughput
    of the CR network. In this

    work, in order to maximize throughput and minimize packet error rate, a multi-objective
    optimization

    problem was proposed and solved by applying the Multi-Objective Brain Storm Optimization
    (MBSO)

    algorithm. The experimental results showed that MBSO had higher throughput, higher
    residual energy

    and lower residual energy. This enhanced the spectrum sensing performance with
    higher detection

    probability [5]. CR SA technology could effectively improve spectrum utilization,
    but it lacked analysis of

    the actual situation.

    The use of ML algorithms and data science and technology can better carry out
    the research of CR SA

    strategy. Relevant researchers have proposed many methods. Lin Kai used Arti¦cial
    Intelligence (AI)

    technology for data analysis, and he used cognitive technology for dynamic SA.
    In data analysis, AI

    technology was applied to feature extraction, data dimension, and data correlation
    calculation between

    users. Lin Kai applied the data analysis results to SA. Combined with deep learning,
    a SA algorithm based

    on data analysis driven by AI was proposed [6]. Kaur Amandeep carried out a detailed
    classi¦cation and

    comprehensive investigation of various ML technologies of intelligent spectrum
    management and their

    CR network optimization paradigm, which provided a new direction and open question
    for the research

    community to further work in the CR network [7]. Through ML algorithms and data
    science and

    technology, CR SA could be better performed, but it was not compared with traditional
    methods.

    The introduction of CR technology can effectively improve the spectrum utilization
    of the network. CR can

    take full advantage of the dynamic spectrum access and variety on the broadband
    spectrum to ease the

    problem of spectrum scarcity, which can also meet the huge connection demand of
    the Internet of

    Things. This has aroused widespread concern in the past few years. The SA of CR
    based on ML

    algorithm and data science and technology was compared with the traditional allocation
    method. The

    use of ML algorithm and data science could improve the utilization of spectrum
    resources.

    2. CR Spectrum Allocation Strategy

    2.1 Cognitive Radio

    CR is a radio device that can change transmitter parameters by interacting with
    the working environment.

    Its main body may be software radio, but it has neither software nor on-site programmable
    requirements

    [8]. Perception and recon¦gurability are the basic characteristics of CR. It can
    learn independently to

    adapt to the perceived wireless environment, and recon¦gure its operation mode
    to maximize the utility of

    available resources [9]. The model of CR is shown in Fig. 1.

    As shown in Fig. 1, a model diagram of CR is described. In the ¦gure, the CR is
    brie§y summarized. The

    dynamic SA of CR is described as spectrum sensing, spectrum evaluation, spectrum
    decision and

    spectrum access. CR technology can sense each spectrum in real time. When a transmitted
    signal is

    Page 4/18

    detected in a certain spectrum, spectrum excitation is carried out. The spectrum
    information is obtained

    through spectrum sensing for spectrum evaluation, and then spectrum decision is
    made.

    With the increasing demand for wireless communication, people have higher and
    higher requirements for

    wireless communication technology. CR technology has been proposed, and its main
    starting point is to

    realize resource sharing among users.

    2.2 Spectrum Allocation of CR

    The traditional ¦xed spectrum distribution mode makes the current spectrum resource
    utilization very low,

    so it must be improved. Due to the increasing requirements of users on spectrum
    resources, this has led

    to the emergence of wireless communication technology. At present, CR technology
    is the most effective

    spectrum shortage technology. The spectrum distribution model of CR includes graph
    coloring model,

    auction model, game model and interference temperature model.

    The graph theory coloring model abstracts the SA problem into a simple graph.
    The graph in graph theory

    is composed of connected lines and points. The most important class of combinatorial
    optimization

    problems is graph coloring. This general problem has several variants involving
    additional constraints on

    vertices or edges. CR is a prospective option to address the lack of spectrum
    and spectrum ine¨ciency in

    today’s communication networks [10]. Graph coloring can better solve the problems
    in CR spectrum. The

    graph theory coloring model is given, as shown in Fig. 2.

    As shown in Figs. 2, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 represent cognitive users; authorized user
    (1, 2, 3, 4) represents four

    authorized users; channel (A, B, C) are three channels. Three authorized users
    occupy three channels

    respectively. The dotted line is the area that can be covered by the authorized
    user’s signal, and the vertex

    is 5 cognitive users. If the channel is occupied by authorized users, the channel
    cannot be shared by all

    cognitive users within the scope of the message. For example, user 1 cannot use
    channel A to avoid

    affecting authorized users due to cognitive user access.

    The pricing auction model is a SA model based on auction theory. The introduction
    of auction principle is

    one of the effective methods to solve the SA problem in CR. Auction can offer
    bene¦ts for primary and

    secondary users and improve spectrum utilization [11].

    The main research problem of the game theory model is how to make decisions and
    the equilibrium of

    such decisions when the behaviors of both parties interact. It is mainly used
    in distributed networks in CR.

    In real life, there are many ¦elds of competition, and even game theory has developed
    rapidly, which has

    important theoretical guidance in many ¦elds.

    The Federal Communications Commission of the United States introduced the concept
    of interference

    temperature in 2003 to “quantify and manage all kinds of interference”. It is
    proposed to manage and

    quantify interference, and its de¦nition is similar to noise temperature. It is
    the ratio of the interference

    power to the corresponding bandwidth. The interference temperature is a threshold
    reference value for

    SA.

    2.3 Data Science and Technology

    Data science and technology is a technology that studies data, and enable data
    to generate value, so as

    to extract in§uential forecasts and insights to assist decision-making. Through
    data science and

    technology, spectrum resource data is collected and analyzed.

    Data science has ¦ve stages of life cycle, namely capture, maintenance, process,
    analysis and

    communication.

    Capture includes data acquisition, data input, signal reception and data extraction.
    It can be used to

    collect and extract spectrum resource information.

    Maintenance is data warehouse, data cleaning, data temporary storage, data processing
    and data

    architecture, which can store spectrum resources.

    The process includes data mining, clustering/classi¦cation, data modeling, and
    data aggregation.

    Analysis and communication have exploratory, predictive analysis, regression,
    text mining, qualitative

    analysis, data reporting, data visualization, business intelligence and decision-making
    functions.

    The progress of computing and data science in data management, integration, mining,
    classi¦cation,

    ¦ltering and visualization, as well as the storage and classi¦cation of CR SA
    data have played a great

    role. The spectrum in wireless communication network is limited, and the use of
    spectrum is optimized.

    One of them is the use of CR networks [12]. The e¨ciency of CR SA can be further
    improved through data

    science and technology.

    2.4 Machine Learning Algorithm

    ML is the scienti¦c investigation of algorithms and statistical models used by
    computer systems to carry

    out speci¦c tasks without explicit programming. The research of CR network aims
    to maximize spectrum

    utilization by providing access to increased users with the help of dynamic SA
    strategy [13]. By using ML

    algorithms, once the algorithm has learned how to process data, it can automatically
    complete the work.

    Arti¦cial Neural Network (ANN) is a branch of ML, with hundreds of algorithms.
    Since the 1980s, AI has

    been a hot topic. From the perspective of information processing, the neural network
    of human brain can

    build different networks according to different connections.

    Dynamic spectrum access based on CR technology is an effective way to solve the
    problem of “spectrum

    scarcity” [14]. ANN is a ML algorithm. Its inspiration comes from biological neurons
    in the brain and

    central nervous system, and the input of behavior is usually fed to arti¦cial
    neurons in one or more hidden

    layers. By using ANN algorithm to predict the channel spectrum, the spectrum utilization
    can be

    enhanced.

    Page 6/18

    Due to the dynamic adaptive ability, it can be used to identify and predict signals.
    The structure of the

    ANN is shown in Fig. 3.

    It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the basic structure of the ANN is three layers,
    namely the input, the hidden

    and the output layer. The hierarchical structure of ANN includes neurons, layers
    and networks [15].

    After obtaining the network input, the neuron should give appropriate output.
    Therefore, after the input,

    the nonlinear formula needs to be transformed into the output to perform the transformation
    of the

    network input, which is called the activation function. The expression is as follows:

    Activation function can also be called excitation function and conversion function,
    which can realize

    nonlinear transformation of input information.

    There is an error between the actual and expected output. The weight is adjusted
    to minimize the error

    between output and target, and its loss function is as follows:

    Among them δi, represents the deviation between the ith element of the output
    vector and the ith element

    of the label vector, thus solving the ¦tting or regression problem.

    The sum of error squares of all output layer nodes of the network is taken, and
    its objective function is as

    follows:

    Li is the error of sample i.

    Page 7/18

    The error signal is transmitted from the back to the front and propagated back
    to form the modi¦ed

    connection weight. The weight expression is as follows:

    3. CR Spectrum Allocation Strategy Investigation Experiment

    3.1 Data Source

    Radio spectrum is a valuable natural resource. CR SA required investigation and
    analysis of radio

    frequency bands. In order to effectively analyze the current use of radio and
    make the survey data

    authoritative and accurate, this paper divided the current radio frequency spectrum
    through the data in

    the online database. The division of radio frequency band was mainly counted,
    as shown in Table 1.

    Table 1

    Frequency band used

    9kHz to 400GHz

    3

    Military

    Below 40GHz

    4

    Civilian

    Below 3GHz

     

    In Table 1, the frequency band ranges of the four radios were calculated. In theory,
    the electromagnetic

    spectrum below 3000GHz was called radio spectrum. However, in fact, humans only
    divided the use

    frequency band from 9kHz to 400GHz. Among them, the military frequency band was
    concentrated below

    40GHz, while the civil frequency band was mainly concentrated below 3GHz. Although
    there were many

    radio spectrum in the above indicators, only a few bands could be used.

    In the few available frequency bands, the utilization of spectrum was extremely
    unbalanced. Some

    unauthorized frequency bands were crowded, while some authorized frequency bands
    were often idle. In

    order to effectively analyze the current utilization of different frequency bands,
    this paper made a

    statistical survey of the current known frequency band utilization, and the survey
    results were shown in

    Table 2.

    Page 8/18

    Table 2

    0.5%

    3

    Above 4GHz

    0.2%

     

    In Table 2, the usage of the three frequency bands was analyzed. Globally, even
    in the frequency band

    with good signal transmission characteristics and large demand from 300 MHz to
    3GHz, the spectrum

    utilization rate was less than 6%; in the range of 3–4 GHz, its spectrum utilization
    rate decreased to 0.5%;

    when it exceeded 4 GHz, its frequency of use would be very low. Therefore, how
    to effectively improve the

    spectrum e¨ciency of wireless communication became an urgent matter.

    3.2 CR Spectrum Allocation Experiment

    SA in CR was to enhance the utilization of spectrum resources. Therefore, ¦nding
    the best way to allocate

    CR spectrum was conducive to improving the existing spectrum utilization. In order
    to accurately analyze

    the effect of CR spectrum based on ML algorithms and data science and technology,
    this paper would

    compare and analyze the SA of CR with traditional algorithms.

    CR SA based on ML algorithm and data science was used for information processing
    through ANN in ML

    algorithm, and data science and technology was used for storage, which was recorded
    as ML method.

    The CR recording under the traditional algorithm was the traditional method.

    In order to make a comprehensive comparison between the two CR SA methods, the
    utilization ratio, user

    satisfaction, system e¨ciency and time cost of CR SA under the two methods would
    be compared. The

    spectrum utilization rate evaluation showed that the public mobile communication
    frequency band

    occupied more than 80%, while the terrestrial television frequency band occupied
    10%-40%. Therefore, the

    use of different types of frequency bands was different. This paper selected the
    public mobile

    communication frequency band and the terrestrial television frequency band for
    experimental analysis.

    4. Investigation Results of CR Spectrum Allocation Strategy

    4.1 Practicality

    The purpose of CR SA was to improve spectrum utilization. CR SA should be as practical
    as possible and

    reduce unnecessary things. The human-computer interaction interface should be
    easy to understand and

    operate, which also had certain guidance function. Through the comparative analysis
    of the practicability

    of the two CR SA, the experimental data of the increase in the number of users’
    use was used to improve

    Page 9/18

    the practical comparison effect of the two SA. The practical comparison results
    of the two CR SA were

    shown in Fig. 4.

    As shown in Fig. 4, the differences between the two methods of CR SA in the two
    frequency bands were

    described. In Fig. 4 (a), the comparison results of CR SA methods in the public
    mobile communication

    frequency band were described. The practicability of CR SA based on ML algorithms
    and data science

    and technology steadily increased. When the number of uses was 60, the practicability
    reached 88%, and

    the average practicability was 80%. The SA of CR based on traditional algorithms
    had a slow rise and a

    trend of decline in the later stage. When the number of uses was 60, the practicability
    was 78%, and the

    average practicability was 74%. In Fig. 7 (b), the comparison results of two CR
    SA methods in the

    terrestrial television frequency band were analyzed. The practicability of CR
    SA based on ML algorithms

    and data science and technology was on the rise, with an average practicability
    of 75%. In the traditional

    method, when the frequency of CR SA was 60, the practicability was 72%, and the
    average practicability

    was 59.5%. Therefore, CR SA based on ML algorithm could improve practicability.

    4.2 User Satisfaction

    In addition to improving the utilization of spectrum resources, CR SA also needed
    to provide users with

    satisfaction. The improvement of user satisfaction was conducive to the development
    of CR SA. The user

    satisfaction of CR SA in the public mobile communication frequency band and terrestrial
    television

    frequency band under the two methods was statistically analyzed and compared.
    The detailed

    comparison results were shown in Fig. 5.

    In Fig. 5 (a), the comparison of user satisfaction of CR SA between the two methods
    in the public mobile

    communication frequency band was described. In the public mobile communication
    frequency band, the

    user satisfaction of CR SA based on ML algorithm and data science and technology
    reached 84% when

    the number of users was 60, and the average user satisfaction during the experimental
    period was 62.3%.

    Under the traditional method, the highest user satisfaction was 74%, and the average
    user satisfaction

    was 54.2%. In Fig. 5 (b), the user satisfaction comparison of two CR SA terrestrial
    television frequency

    bands was analyzed. Among them, CR SA based on ML algorithms and data science
    and technology had

    the highest satisfaction of 80%, and the average user experience was 56.8%. In
    the traditional method, the

    highest user satisfaction was 74%, and the average user satisfaction was 46.5%.
    Therefore, CR SA based

    on ML algorithm could improve user satisfaction.

    4.3 System Bene¦ts

    The bene¦ts of CR SA system could make people intuitively feel the advantages
    of CR SA. This paper

    compared and analyzed the SA of CR based on ML algorithm and traditional methods.
    The system

    bene¦ts would be counted for every 10 increase in the number of spectrum. The
    bene¦t comparison

    results of the two CR SA systems were shown in Fig. 6.

    It could be seen from the ¦gure that when the number of spectrum was gradually
    increasing, the system

    bene¦ts available were generally increasing. In Fig. 6 (a), the system bene¦t
    comparison results of two CR

    Page 10/18

    SA were described. Among them, the e¨ciency of CR SA based on ML algorithms and
    data science and

    technology was generally higher than that of CR SA based on traditional methods.
    When the number of

    spectrum was 40, the bene¦t reached 46%, and the average bene¦t was 33.5%. The
    overall effect of SA

    based on traditional algorithms was that the system bene¦ts would increase with
    the increase of the

    number of spectrum, but it was relatively §at. When the number of spectrum was
    40, the maximum

    system bene¦t was 36%, and the average bene¦t was only 25%. In Fig. 6 (b), the
    bene¦ts of terrestrial

    television frequency band systems were compared. Among them, the bene¦ts of CR
    SA system based on

    ML algorithms and data science and technology were growing slowly. The highest
    bene¦t was 46%, and

    the average system bene¦t was 35.25%. In SA using traditional algorithms, the
    overall system bene¦ts

    remained between 30% and 40%, and it was di¨cult to grow. The maximum bene¦t was
    38%, and the

    average system bene¦t was 29.25%. Therefore, it was more convenient to use big
    data to analyze user

    experience.

    4.4 Time Cost

    Operational e¨ciency was a very important issue in SA of CR. It took less time
    and ran less, which was

    an important reason for its popularity. CR should improve its operation e¨ciency
    as much as possible

    and achieve its goal in the least time. This paper compared and analyzed the time
    cost of two kinds of

    CR SA. In the process of the experiment, the length of the time it took was analyzed
    by increasing the

    number of iterations. The experimental data of the interface was used to improve
    the comparative effect

    of SA between the two CR systems. The comparison results of the two CR SA time
    costs were shown in

    Fig. 7:

    It could be seen from Fig. 7 that the time cost of the algorithm was gradually
    increasing with the increase

    of the number of iterations. Figure 7 showed the time cost comparison results
    of two CR SA. Among

    them, the time cost based on ML algorithm and data science technology was signi¦cantly
    less than that

    of CR SA under traditional algorithms, and the growth was slow. At 100 iterations,
    the time was 38

    seconds. In traditional algorithms, the time cost increased rapidly. When the
    number of iterations was

    100, the time reached 45 seconds.

    5. Conclusions

    CR technology is the key technology to solve the low utilization of spectrum resources.
    With the rapid

    development of CR technology and the increasing demand for spectrum resources,
    it is very vital to

    investigate the spectrum distribution strategy of CR. In this paper, the CR SA
    strategy was studied by

    using ML algorithm and data science technology. In this way, CR SA was better
    carried out. The scope of

    radio division and the utilization rate of each frequency band were investigated
    through the data

    statistics of the online database, and the SA of CR based on traditional algorithms
    was compared with

    that based on ML and data science and technology. The results showed that the
    practicability, user

    satisfaction, system e¨ciency and overhead time of CR SA based on ML and data
    science and

    technology were better than those of traditional methods, which could further
    improve the e¨ciency of

    CR SA. In recent years, CR SA involved all aspects of human life and became a
    research hotspot.

    Page 11/18

    However, this paper only compared CR SA in the public mobile communication frequency
    band and

    terrestrial television frequency band, and its analysis was not comprehensive.
    Therefore, the comparison

    of SA in various aspects of extended CR would be the direction of future research.

    This paper presents a comprehensive literature review on applications of deep
    reinforcement learning (DRL) in communications and networking. Modern networks,
    e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) and unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, become
    more decentralized and autonomous. In such networks, network entities need to
    make decisions locally to maximize the network performance under uncertainty of
    network environment. Reinforcement learning has been efficiently used to enable
    the network entities to obtain the optimal policy including, e.g., decisions or
    actions, given their states when the state and action spaces are small. However,
    in complex and large-scale networks, the state and action spaces are usually large,
    and the reinforcement learning may not be able to find the optimal policy in reasonable
    time. Therefore, DRL, a combination of reinforcement learning with deep learning,
    has been developed to overcome the shortcomings. In this survey, we first give
    a tutorial of DRL from fundamental concepts to advanced models. Then, we review
    DRL approaches proposed to address emerging issues in communications and networking.
    The issues include dynamic network access, data rate control, wireless caching,
    data offloading, network security, and connectivity preservation which are all
    important to next generation networks, such as 5G and beyond. Furthermore, we
    present applications of DRL for traffic routing, resource sharing, and data collection.
    Finally, we highlight important challenges, open issues, and future research directions
    of applying DRL. Published in: IEEE Communications Surveys & Tutorials ( Volume:

    Agency: I. Introduction Reinforcement learning [1] is one of the most important
    research directions of machine learning which has significant impacts to the development
    of Artificial Intelligence (AI) over the last 20 years. Reinforcement learning
    is a learning process in which an agent can periodically make decisions, observe
    the results, and then automatically adjust its strategy to achieve the optimal
    policy. However, this learning process, even though proved to converge, takes
    a lot of time to reach the best policy as it has to explore and gain knowledge
    of an entire system, making it unsuitable and inapplicable to large-scale networks.
    Consequently, applications of reinforcement learning are very limited in practice.
    Recently, deep learning [2] has been introduced as a new breakthrough technique.
    It can overcome the limitations of reinforcement learning, and thus open a new
    era for the development of reinforcement learning, namely Deep Reinforcement Learning
    (DRL). DRL embraces the advantage of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to train the
    learning process, thereby improving the learning speed and the performance of
    reinforcement learning algorithms. As a result, DRL has been adopted in numerous
    applications of reinforcement learning in practice such as robotics, computer
    vision, speech recognition, and natural language processing [2]. One of the most
    famous applications of DRL is AlphaGo [3], the first computer program which can
    beat a human professional without handicaps on a full-sized board. Sign in to

    3 Altmetric Explore all metrics Abstract Wireless multimedia applications require
    significant bandwidth, some of which will be provided by third-generation (3G)
    services. Even with substantial investment in 3G infrastructure, the radio spectrum
    allocated to 3G will be limited. Cognitive radio offers a mechanism for the flexible
    pooling of radio spectrum using a new class of protocols called formal radio etiquettes.
    This approach could expand the bandwidth available for conventional uses (e.g.,
    police, fire and rescue) and extend the spatial coverage of 3G in a novel way.
    Cognitive radio is a particular extension of software radio that employs model-based
    reasoning about users, multimedia content, and communications context. This paper
    characterizes the potential contributions of cognitive radio to spectrum pooling
    and outlines an initial framework for formal radio-etiquette protocols. Article

    Networks” Ekram Hossain, University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, Canada Vijay Bhargava,
    University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada Introduction Cognitive radio
    has emerged as a promising technology for maximizing the utili- tion of the limited
    radio bandwidth while accommodating the increasing amount of services and applications
    in wireless networks. A cognitive radio (CR) transceiver is able to adapt to the
    dynamic radio environment and the network parameters to maximize the utilization
    of the limited radio resources while providing ?exibility in wireless access.
    The key features of a CR transceiver are awareness of the radio en- ronment (in
    terms of spectrum usage, power spectral density of transmitted/received signals,
    wireless protocol signaling) and intelligence. This intelligence is achieved through
    learning for adaptive tuning of system parameters such as transmit power, carrier
    frequency, and modulation strategy (at the physical layer), and higher-layer protocol
    parameters. Development of cognitive radio technology has to deal with technical
    and pr- tical considerations (which are highly multidisciplinary) as well as regulatory
    - quirements. There is an increasing interest on this technology among the researchers
    in both academia and industry and the spectrum policy makers. The key enabling
    techniques for cognitive radio networks (also referred to as dynamic spectrum
    - cess networks) are wideband signal processing techniques for digital radio,
    advanced wireless communications methods, arti?cial intelligence and machine learning
    te- niques, and cognitive radio-aware adaptive wireless/mobile networking protocols.

    Metrics Footnotes Abstract: The radio research community has aggressively embraced
    cognitive radio for dynamic radio spectrum management to enhance spectrum usage,
    e.g., in ISM bands and as secondary users in unused TV bands, but the needs of
    the mobile wireless user have not been addressed as thoroughly on the question
    of high quality of information (QoI) as a function of place, time, and social
    setting (e.g. commuting, shopping, or in need of medical assistance). This paper
    considers the evolution of cognitive radio architecture (CRA) in the context of
    motivating use cases such as public safety and sentient spaces to characterize
    CRA with an interdisciplinary perspective where machine perception in visual,
    acoustic, speech, and natural language text domains provide cues to the automatic
    detection of stereotypical situations, enabling radio nodes to select from among
    radio bands and modes more intelligently and enabling cognitive wireless networks
    to deliver higher QoI within social and technical constraints, made more cost
    effective via embedded and distributed computational intelligence. Published in:

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction When introduced in 1998–1999 [1], [2],
    cognitive radio emphasized enhanced quality of information (QoI) for the user,
    with spectrum agility framed as a means to an end and not as an end in itself.
    The first research prototype cognitive radio (CR1), for example, learned to turn
    on Bluetooth to exchange business cards wirelessly when the user''s speech dialog—sensed
    via (simulated) speech recognition—exhibited the characteristics of a prototypical
    setting of “introductions”, meeting new people. This intelligent agent embedded
    in the personal digital assistant (PDA) was unique in that it had not been programmed
    to do this, but rather learned this behavior via case-based reasoning (CBR) from
    its user''s prior manual exchange of electronic business cards. CR1 associated
    the user''s prior manual use of the PDA''s Bluetooth radio to exchange business
    cards with cues in the speech domain such as phrases like, “May I introduce”,
    and “Very pleased to meet you.” CR1 thus synthesized a CBR template to [<Power-up
    Bluetooth/>, <Exchange Business-cards/>, <Power-down Bluetooth/>] autonomously
    and could learn by being told (not via rules previously programmed into it) etiquettes
    for sharing radio spectrum with legacy radios. Intelligent agents like CR1 observe
    the environment in which they are embedded in order to learn to formulate plans
    and execute actions that respond intelligently to the user in the environment.
    These early contributions stimulated many ideas for cooperative spectrum sharing
    [3], capturing the imagination. During the past five years, the world''s radio
    research and engineering communities have been developing software defined radio
    (SDR) and cognitive radio (CR) for dynamic radio spectrum sensing, access, and
    sharing [4]–[6], revealing many regulatory, business, market, and open architecture
    needs implicit in the broad potential that cognitive radio architecture (CRA)
    introduces1 [7]. Radio architectures—from wearable nodes and radio access points
    to the larger converged networks—have evolved from the niche market of single-band
    single-mode car phones of the 1970s to today''s ubiquitous multiband-multimode
    fashion statements. This paper characterizes architecture evolution, including
    the near-term multimedia heterogeneous networks that converge traditional cellular
    architectures with Internet hot spots. This paper also looks ahead towards the
    establishment of sentient spaces [8]–[10], integrated wireless environments that
    merge wireless technologies with increasing interplay of radio engineering with
    related information services of computer vision [11] and human language technologies
    (HLTs) [12]. SECTION II. Organization This paper first reviews the concept of
    architecture in Section III, including prototypical architectures for dynamic
    spectrum and embedded agents. It then describes the apparent lack of a comprehensive
    metalevel architecture for distributed heterogeneous networks and their related
    metalevel superstructures, including regulatory rule-making and spectrum auctions.
    Section IV characterizes the changes in use case that drive wireless architecture,
    showing how the historically significant striving for ubiquity and high data rate
    is beginning to give way to evolved value propositions in which appropriately
    high quality of service (QoS) is merely the starting point for QoI. Section V
    therefore develops the potential for greater integration of cross-discipline information
    sources like video surveillance and human language technology in future cognitive
    radio architectures. To help guide this evolution, QoI is characterized along
    its several dimensions in Section VI, while Section VII offers a review of challenges
    and opportunities before the conclusion of Section VIII. SECTION III. Cognitive
    Radio Architectures Radio architecture is a framework by which evolving families
    of components may be integrated into an evolving sequence of designs that synthesize
    specified functions within specified constraints (design rules) [13]. A powerful
    architecture facilitates rapid, cost-effective product and service evolution.
    An open architecture is available to the public, while a proprietary architecture
    is the private intellectual property of an organization, government entity, or
    nonpublic consortium. Fig. 1 illustrates functional components integrated to create
    an SDR device, which may be wearable, mobile, or a radio access point in a larger
    network. Fig. 1. Set theoretic model of SDR architecture [14]. Show All The set
    of information sources of Fig. 1 includes speech, text, Internet access, and multimedia
    content. Today''s commercial radio-frequency (RF) channel sets have typically
    four chip sets [GSM 900, GSM1800, code-division multiple access (CDMA), and Bluetooth,
    for example], evolving in the near term to a dozen band-mode combinations with
    smart antennas and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) emerging [15]. In addition,
    a channel-set may include a cable interface to the public switched telephone network
    (PSTN) (IP or SDH) as well as a radio access point. Any functions may be null
    in any realization, eliminating the related components and interfaces from a given
    product for product tailoring and incremental evolution. With the continued progress
    of Moore''s law, increasingly large fractions of such functionality are synthesized
    in chipsets with software-definable parameters; in the field-modifiable firmware
    of field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs); in software for niche instruction set
    architectures (e.g., digital signal-processing chips); and increasingly on blade
    server(s) and single-chip arrays of general-purpose processors like IMEC Belgium''s
    SIMD4 [16]. Today''s SDRs often are synthesized from reusable code bases of millions
    of lines of code [17], the deployment, management, and maintenance of which poses
    configuration challenges. The SDR software typically is organized as radio applications
    objects layered upon standard infrastructure software objects for distributed
    processing such as the SDR Forum''s software communications architecture (SCA)2
    which originally was based primarily on CORBA3 [18]. The Object Management Group''s
    evolved SCA has a platform independent model with platform specific models for
    software-based communications.4 Infrastructure layers of such architectures are
    illustrated in the larger context of Fig. 2. Prior to circa 2005, such architecture
    was overkill for handsets, but radio access networks have grown to millions of
    lines of code consisting of the kinds of software objects with the types of layering
    illustrated in the figure, and now applicable to handsets and systems on chip
    (SoC). As Mähönen (RWTH, Aachen, Germany) was among the first to clearly differentiate
    [19], software radio and cognitive radio are “interlinked and are family members,
    but they also have distinctive roadmaps” as the evolution of cognitive radio architecture
    illustrates. Again from Mähönen, “There are still formidable hardware and algorithm
    development problems (such as AD/DA-converters …) before full (ideal) all-in-one
    software radio can be built.” However, “the basic paradigm in the cognitive radios
    is to provide technologies, which enable radio to reason about its resources,
    constraints, and be aware of users/operators'' requirements and context.” Fig.
    2. Software complexity of wireless devices and infrastructure leads to object
    and API layering [13]. Show All What are the resources and constraints? Arguably
    since the early 1900s, conventional radio architecture has been constrained by
    government regulatory frameworks accurately characterized as lanes in the road:
    bands large and small allocated to specific uses, in the public interest. That
    regulatory regime addressed the public interest within the constraining economics
    of radio devices and related infrastructure (such as large, expensive television
    broadcast towers). This was economically efficient (arguably Pareto efficient)
    from the “transistor radio” and television era to the deployment of first- and
    second-generation cellular radio. However, today''s low-cost multiband multimode
    wearable wireless fashion statements; the proliferation of cellular infrastructure;
    the gigabit per second core IP networks; and wireless local-area network (WLAN)
    consumer products have proliferated wireless access points of all sorts in the
    home, workplace, and, seemingly, just about everyplace else in developed economies.
    The new wireless ubiquity and heterogeneity offers rapidly emerging alternatives
    to the lanes in the road that include dynamic spectrum access. A. Dynamic Spectrum
    Access Briefly, dynamic spectrum access is the process of increasing spectrum
    efficiency via the real-time adjustment of radio resources, e.g., via a process
    of local spectrum sensing, probing, and the autonomous establishment of local
    wireless connections among cognitive nodes and networks. As originally proposed,
    cognitive radio envisioned real-time spectrum auctions among diverse constituencies,
    using for one purpose, such as cellular radio, spectrum allocated and in use for
    another purpose, such as public safety, and vice versa, in order to multiply the
    number of radio access points for public safety and to more efficiently use public
    safety spectrum commercially during peak periods [1]. Although that initial example
    has yet to be fully realized, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission encouraged
    the application of that technology to the secondary use of underutilized television
    spectrum, such as in an ad hoc, short-range WLAN in spectrum that is allocated
    to another primary purpose, such as broadcast television. In addition, the principles
    of cognitive radio for dynamic spectrum also apply to enhance the efficiency of
    use within and across each “lane in the road”, such as via the intelligent selection
    among multiple alternative physical (PHY) media access control (MAC) layers (alternative
    lanes in the spectrum road) by cognition across network, transport, and application
    layers of the protocol stack [20]. Researchers characterize the advantages of
    short-term localized dynamic spectrum auctions [21], [22], including rigorous
    and comprehensive treatments in the European Community (EC)''s precompetitive
    End to End Reconfigurability program [23]. In spite of commercial proposals [24],
    only long-term large-capacity anonymous leasing appears to be established in the
    marketplace.5 The endorsement of the FCC for cognitive radio in secondary markets
    offered opportunities for improved spectrum utilization [25]. In addition, the
    National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT), Yokosuka,
    Japan, have characterized SDR and cognitive radio from technical [26], [27] and
    regulatory [28] perspectives. Ofcom, the regulatory body of the United Kingdom,
    remains appropriately skeptical of the economics of dynamic spectrum [29]. On
    the other hand, the Commission for Communications Regulation, Ireland, imposes
    constraints [30] but also encourages innovation such as by allocating over 100
    MHz of spectrum for experiments and demonstrations during the IEEE Dynamic Spectrum
    (DySPAN) Conference in 2007 in Dublin. Guatemala6 employs Titulos de Usurfrucato
    de Frecuencias, specifying spectrum use parameters in great detail, which establishes
    a strong reference point for the liberalization of spectrum allocation towards
    dynamics [31]. In Europe, countries including Austria, Sweden, and the United
    Kingdom apparently have sanctioned de facto transfers of spectrum rights among
    spectrum licensees, while a recent EU Framework Directive empowers all European
    Commission countries to introduce secondary trading of spectrum usage rights [18].
    The SDR Forum''s CR working group (CRWG) and the inclusion of CR in its annual
    academic challenge promotes the global interchange among academic research and
    industry development of cognitive radio in SDR. 7 DARPA''s XG program [32], [33]
    put substantial emphasis on the near-term potential of smart radios to share the
    radio spectrum dynamically, leading, among other things, to the success of the
    IEEE Dynamic Spectrum (DySPAN) conferences in 2005 and 2007, where XG research
    results were demonstrated [34]. XG simplified the ideal cognitive radio architecture
    (iCRA [35]) to a simple rule-engine that controls the radio''s air interfaces
    to conform to spectrum use policies expressed in a rule-based policy language.
    This yields a simple, flexible, near-term dynamic spectrum access (DSA) architecture
    clearly articulated by Haykin [36]. B. The Haykin Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA)
    Architecture The ubiquity of wireless today is more of a fact than a goal even
    in many developing economies. In most developed economies, evolved GSM and CDMA
    networks are both competing and cooperating with an Internet gone wireless for
    the revenue from voice and Internet traffic, with voice over Internet Protocol
    (VoIP) growing. Integral to this evolution is the potential for some adjustment
    to the protocol stack. As illustrated in Fig. 3(a), Haykin''s DSA emphasizes the
    need for cognitive radio to be aware of the many occupants of a radio environment
    by analyzing the radio scene to avoid interference, to operate in spectrum holes,
    and to provide channel state information that enhances the transmission. One implication
    for the protocol stack is the integration of cognitive nodes into cognitive networks
    via the universal control channel of some sort, as shown in Fig. 3(b), supplemented
    by group control channels. Spectrum sensing emerges in this architecture as the
    key enabler for greater agility in the use of spectrum for best possible QoS.
    Such a cognitive radio can quantify channel occupancy and identify opportunities
    for RF chip set selection, signal in space transmission control [37], and other
    high-performance spectrum management features in the physical layer such as MIMO
    operation. Fig. 3. Haykin DSA architecture. (a) DSA architecture and (b) implications.
    Show All C. The ideal CRA (iCRA) Self-awareness, user awareness, and machine learning
    differentiate what has become known as the ideal cognitive radio architecture
    [2] from the DSA. The cognition cycle developed for the research prototype cognitive
    radio CR1 [2] is shown in Fig. 4. This cycle implements the full embedded agent
    and sensory perception capabilities required of an iCR, differentiating proactive
    planning from reactive behaviors and learning. Sensory stimuli enter the cycle
    via sensory perception (e.g., RF, location, motion, temperature, vision, speech,
    etc.). Object-level change detection initiates the cognition cycle. Fig. 4. Ideal
    cognition cycle: Observe-Orient-Plan-Decide-Act-Learn (OOPDAL) of the iCRA embeds
    self-awareness, user awareness, and RF awareness for QoS and QoI. Show All Such
    an iCR continually observes (senses and perceives) the environment; orients itself;
    creates plans; makes decisions on its own and in conjunction with the user and
    external networks; and then acts. Actions may be physical, such as transmitting
    a signal, or virtual, such as associating a user''s action with the current situation.
    The iCR may observe user actions (e.g., via keystroke capture) to form a macrosequence
    to be applied in similar situations, such as searching for wireless business card
    when introductions are detected via voice in some future setting. Actions of intelligent
    agents include movement in the environment in order to improve the likelihood
    of achieving a goal. Early planning systems used rule bases to solve simple planning
    problems like the monkey and the bananas [38], stimulating the development of
    an entire subculture of planning technologies now integrated into a broad range
    of applications from factory automation to autonomous vehicles [39] and RoboCup
    Soccer [40], integrating learning with planning [41]. These planning technologies
    apply to radio domains for further architecture evolution. The processes illustrated
    in the figure are called the wake epoch because the reasoning components react
    to changes in the environment. The iCR might analyze speech or text of radio broadcasts,
    e.g., checking the weather channel, stock ticker tapes, etc., for changes of interest
    to the user. Any RF-LAN or other short-range wireless broadcasts that provide
    environment awareness information may be also analyzed for relevance to the user''s
    needs inferred by the iCR via machine learning, e.g., assisted via a library of
    behavior stereotypes. In the observation phase, a CR also reads location, temperature,
    light level sensors, etc., to infer the user''s communications context. Since
    the iCRA was based on agent technology, it leverages the continuing advances in
    Agent Communications Language, the Java Agent Development Environment8 and multiagent
    systems [42]. During the wake epoch, the detection of a significant change such
    as the presence of a new radio network in the RF domain or of a new physical object
    in a visual scene, or the detection of a topic in the speech domain, initiates
    a new cognition cycle. For example, IMEC Belgium developed low-power burst signal
    detection and presynchronization techniques to characterize changes in the RF
    scene [43]. Sleep epochs allow for computationally intensive pattern analyses,
    self-organization, and autonomous learning. A prayer epoch during sleep provides
    autonomous interaction with higher authorities such as cognitive networks and
    regulatory authorities for constraints, advice, and solutions to problems unavailable
    locally. D. Networking and CRA Evolution Unfortunately, neither the DSA nor the
    iCRA provide a comprehensive architecture for cognitive wireless networks (CWNs).9
    At the Dagstuhl workshop in 2003, a consensus emerged that CWN significantly expands
    the research framework and architecture evolution possibilities to a mix of ad
    hoc and fixed wireless networks with self-awareness and greater spectrum efficiency;
    to mobile device awareness; to substantial memory-in-the-network [44]; and to
    distributed machine learning [45]. The DSA and iCRA per se do not provide such
    a rich research and development framework for legacy and cognitive devices and
    heterogeneous networks with regulatory policy constraints. In addition, without
    a supportive distributed network architecture, policy language, and methods of
    payment, short-term real-time spectrum auctions over small geographic areas seem
    unlikely to emerge, in spite of much research (e.g., [36], [46]) and position
    papers before regulatory bodies [47]. Fitzek (Aalborg University) and Katz (Samsung)
    bring together ideas for CWN CRA characterized by cooperation among intelligent
    entities [3]. Cooperation results from not just game theoretic considerations
    [48] but also from considerations of power optimization [49], [49]; relays [51]
    and ad-hoc discovery and routing [52]; diversity [53]; cross-layer optimization
    [54]; stability and security [55], [56]; and spectrum efficiency considerations
    [44]. Distributed antennas [57], [58], cooperative header compression [59] and
    coding [60], and distributed spatial channel control [61], among others, result
    from such a focus on cooperation in cognitive wireless networks. Mahmoud (Canada),
    similarly, brings together ideas for CRA migration towards self-awareness [62].
    In this context, researchers at Osaka University, Japan, point out that biological
    systems from molecular processes and immune systems and from social insects to
    predator–prey relationships exhibit robustness in the face of catastrophe, a property
    desired in communications networks. Architectural properties of such biological
    systems include (group) membership perception, network awareness, buffer management
    (pheromone decay), and message filtering [63]. Also in this context, Strassner
    and his group in Waterford, Ireland, report a refined autonomic network architecture,
    in some sense a distributed networked version of the iCRA [64]. Strassner makes
    a strong case for cognitive network architecture to address network semantics
    more completely, using the Border Gateway Protocol10 as a motivating example.
    There is no lingua franca for networking that bridges vendor-specific syntax and
    semantics, modalities, functions, and side-effects, as Strassner dramatically
    illustrates. He shows the potential contributions of autonomic networking in future
    cognitive networks via a framework of (user) experience and (wireless and wire
    line) connectivity architectures with FOCALE [65]. Although there have been many
    research investigations into the role of semantic Web technologies in CRA evolution
    [66], [67], none as yet appears to address Strassner''s key issues in a sufficiently
    intuitive, computationally feasible, compact, and efficient way as to have become
    widely adopted. In part because of the shortfalls of the XML and semantic Web
    technologies alone, the IEEE 802.21 and P1900.5 standards committees are pursuing
    behavior modeling of cognitive radio nodes and networks in their policy language
    deliberations [68]. In addition, Manoj et al.''s cognition plane organizes cross-layer
    reasoning of a joint layer optimization module by placing cognition and control
    modules in the PHY, MAC, network, transport, and applications layers. The cross-layer
    cognition bus applies the Observe, Orient, Decide, and Act loop of the iCRA with
    get/set access to the networks to bypass intervening layers, such as direct linkage
    from the application to the MAC, e.g., analyzing the MAC layer to avoid default
    wireless channels during congestion. This CogNet AP can, for example, identify
    a preferred channel based on expected traffic during any hour of the weekday.
    They analyze Neel''s game-theoretic treatment of cognitive networks [69] to characterize
    challenges of sustaining Nash equilibriums in myopic, s-modular games and potential
    games, showing how potential games may be realized in practice. In spite of such
    promising work, apparently as yet there is no widely accepted comprehensive architecture
    (functions, components, and design rules) within which the potential for fair,
    stable dynamic spectrum (potentially including microscale space-time-RF auctions)
    is being realized in the marketplace in spite of positive regulatory rule making.
    A deeper understanding of the related technical, social, and economic factors
    seems to be an important open metalevel issue for CRA evolution. Clearly, the
    Haykin DSA, cooperative and self-aware networks research, and cross-layer cognition
    provide crucial foundations for cognitive radio architecture evolution. Where
    power management remains important, simplifications of the DSA bring cognitive
    behavior in the RF domain closer to practice. The pace with which systems evolve
    from the practical focus of the current architectures to address the larger issues
    may be driven by evolved use cases. SECTION IV. Architecture Evolution and use
    Case Evolution Commercial wireless use cases continue to evolve. The use cases
    that have captured market share and propelled radio engineering to its current
    levels of success have been based on the proliferation of cellular wireless networks
    on the one hand and the affordability of fiber-optic core networks and short-range
    WLAN of the Internet on the other. Ubiquity has brought with it a shift of use
    case from mere ubiquity towards affordable differentiated multimedia services
    in purely commercial markets as well as greater integration of historically distinct
    market segments such as commercial and public safety wireless, e.g., Block D in
    the U.S. 700 MHz wireless auctions. Block D challenges have been characterized
    by the SDR Forum [70] as “meeting the divergent needs of commercial and public
    safety users, coverage, shared operational control, robustness, adaptability,
    and spectrum use in the absence of network buildout.” Such public commentary reflects
    an evolution of use case that drives wireless architectures from the relatively
    monolithic cellular radio networks with gateways to the PSTN towards greater integration
    with the Internet, as characterized in Table 1. Table 1 Wireless use Case Parameters
    Drive Radio Architecture Evolution The lines of Table 1 without italics have been
    well established during the past few years and thus need little elaboration, but
    set the stage for the more speculative use case projections in italics. A. Product
    Differentiation With ubiquity in developed economies, wireless service providers
    have suffered profit erosion and are beginning to compete for multimedia services
    integration across the broad domains of personal information (voice, text, personal
    games, Internet access, and e-mail) and entertainment (digital radio and TV broadcast,
    network games, and Internet broadcast modalities like YouTube and MySpace), with
    many forms of infotainment taking shape. Wireless has been both a perpetrator
    and a beneficiary of the infotainment megatrends. To remain relevant, cognitive
    radio architectures must make it easier (and more affordable) for the service
    provider to deliver highly user-specific (differentiated) services whether at
    home, at work, traveling, or on holiday. This need, along with other factors,
    tends to drive the CRA from today''s DSA''s towards greater use of technical parameter
    profiles that are tailored to each particular user''s infotainment practices,
    e.g., learned by a recommender system embedded in the radio [75]. In fact, semantic
    Web technologies11 are making it increasingly easy to represent computationally
    and reason with ever more subtle and sophisticated aspects of the needs, habits,
    and preferences of individual users. This leads one to postulate an emerging value
    proposition founded on QoS, but expanded to reflect ubiquitously high QoS across
    service providers with QoI as an increasingly central driver of wireless architecture
    evolution. B. Protocol Stacks Although asynchronous transfer mode [76] established
    transport efficiency with predictable QoS for its high value in core networks
    of the foundational era, IP seems to be the ultimate beneficiary of efficiency
    and QoS in the era of network convergence. This applies both in the current transitional
    patchwork of IP with network address translation (NAT), VoIP via session initiation
    protocol, and, in the longer term, towards IPv6 perhaps. This expectation sets
    some characteristics of the networking layers of the protocol stacks of handsets,
    vehicular radios, and radio access network infrastructure, and thus of CRA evolution
    as well. C. OA&M Self-awareness is not evident in the DSA, but the costs of operations,
    administration, and maintenance are moving self-awareness for autonomous configuration
    management towards center stage in the EC''s End to End Efficiency (E3) wireless
    initiative [77], [78]. Self-awareness and self-examination properties of agent-based
    evolved CRAs may help address the challenges of configuring software stacks for
    mobile device and infrastructure releases, as well as offer additional protection
    from inadvertent misconfiguration. The iCRA incorporates the necessary self-awareness,
    and its mathematical theory [11] draws on Gödel theory to establish the basis
    in computability for the self-referential but computationally stable self-examination.
    Thus, the DSA provides an appropriately simplified transitional architecture that
    is now beginning to evolve towards the iCRA''s promise of autonomous OA&M. D.
    Location Awareness A microcosm of evolution from QoS to QoI has occurred in location-based
    services. During the early foundational era, location seemed to be potentially
    useful, but did not rise to the status of “killer app” on its own. Government
    mandates for ∼ 150 m accurate location information for the delivery of emergency
    services to cell phone users helped to transition location awareness from niche
    to mainstream. But at the same time, inventions for routing as a function of location
    [79] and services like GEOPRIV [80], [81] made it possible to customize access
    to knowledge about personal location, so the role of location information in wireless
    architectures continued to grow. Today, wireless location-based services are differentiated
    based on ease of use (e.g., Google Maps versus MapQuest) and QoI parameters [2]
    rather than on mere availability (a QoS parameter) or time delay of the results
    (another QoS parameter). Multimedia services may also undergo such a transition
    from QoS to QoI as wireless multimedia coverage continues to expand, soon becoming
    expected even in developing economies. Thus, the ability of cognitive radio architectures
    to enhance multimedia in terms of both cost of availability (cost of a QoS service
    level agreement) via spectrum efficiency with QoI as a mobile user value proposition
    may propel cognition for either or both purposes into a more central role in architecture
    evolution. E. Spectrum Awareness Spectrum awareness now too is beginning to move
    to center stage, as suggested in Table 1. Historically, a commercial wireless
    device had to be aware of the network, but not much else. The network told the
    radio what to do and that was that. Today''s handsets, PDAs, and even some laptops
    are armed with multiple chip sets capable of accessing GSM (ideal for global roaming)
    and CDMA (e.g., for medium data rates in a larger coverage area) as well as for
    accessing 54 Mbps WiFi hot spots. Today''s user puts up with the tedium of picking
    the WiFi network, with whatever security risks that entails, while host cellular
    networks deal with most of the other choices of radio band and mode for the user.
    However, regulatory rulings on dynamic spectrum and the commercial success of
    Internet alternatives to cellular wireless and the PSTN (e.g., Skype over WiFi)
    render the autonomous mediation of radio bands and modes into an opportunity for
    CRA evolution. As something like the U.S. 700 MHz Block D rules emerge, it will
    become useful for wireless devices of the future to autonomously recognize prototypical
    emergency situations without being told to by a network that is inoperative because
    of the emergency. This raises the performance bar for DSA and places the autonomous
    determination of the user''s situation at center stage: is the user a victim who
    has priority for assistance; or a first responder authorized to assist in the
    emergency; or a bystander who should yield spectrum to those who need it most?
    Integration of diverse sensor modalities may be needed to effectively address
    such situations [2]. F. Spectrum Auctions In the foundation era, radio spectrum
    has been allocated in relatively large blocks—the lanes in the road—that raise
    substantial government revenue. Within the past few years, private enterprise
    has offered Web-based tools and services for incumbent spectrum licensees to anonymously
    cross-license relatively small slices of spectrum for relatively short periods
    of time—notionally, a few megahertz for a few months at a time [82]. As Jondral''s
    group at TU Karlsruhe has characterized in some detail [83], the sale of chunks
    of primary spectrum as small as 5 s in duration for prices as low as a few cents
    per chunk for enhanced e-mail services and Web browsing could provide an increase
    in spectrum utilization of between 15 and 25%. Thus, CRA could improve secondary
    markets from today''s megahertz-months towards the more efficient kilobits/second-seconds,
    although just where the revenue breakpoints might be is yet to be determined.
    Doyle''s group at Trinity College, Ireland, has shown that what is feasible still
    appears to be orders of magnitude from theory [84]. Indeed, the government of
    Ireland dedicated more than 100 MHz of spectrum to the experimental characterization
    of the potential for IEEE DySPAN 2007. To characterize performance in spectrum
    overcrowding, DySPAN 2008 has intentionally smaller spectrum allocations [85].
    G. User Expectations The way users value QoS parameters like coverage (probability
    of mobile dial tone) and data rate may also change with the agility of spectrum
    access. Users readily recognize that megabit per second data rates are available
    in WiFi hot spots, but not in remote areas, so they adjust their expectations
    and plans for the use of a flexible PDA accordingly. Today, mobile data rates
    are expressed in a framework that reflects the mobility of the user within fully
    built-out and relatively monolithic cellular infrastructure: stationary users
    have a higher data rate than users who are walking, and they have higher data
    rates than those in moving vehicles. 3G recognizes data rate differentiation indoors,
    reflecting additional nonhomogeneity of the networks. During the next few years,
    most homes and businesses could become multimegabit/second wireless hot spots,
    potentially via B3G femtocells or Internet WLANs or both, accelerating CRA evolution.
    The identification of a specific hot spot may be based in part on GPS, but in
    complicated urban settings, other sensor modalities like computer vision, speech,
    and other human language technologies may play a role [2]. For example, Fig. 5
    shows the entrance to the Royal Viking Hotel in Stockholm facing from a revolving
    door towards the street. The glass foyer provides great GPS and GSM coverage,
    but the GPS does not establish whether the radio is inside or outside of the hotel.
    In addition, GSM fades deeply when one traverses the entrance, and most cell phones
    lose a call in progress here. If instead of merely reacting to a deep fade the
    cell phone were aware of the user''s precise location and direction, then a more
    aggressive adaptive equalizer could be invoked for the transit through the tunnel
    so that the call is not lost. Fig. 5. SAS Royal Viking facing street. Show All
    Generally, it is impractical to operate a GSM network-handset pair with the high-performance
    equalizer and network compensation that would be required to transit such a tunnel.
    That is, you cannot operate a network profitably if constantly configured for
    such worst case situations. However, if the cell phone autonomously detects the
    lobby and reliably predicts the tunnel transit, it may employ expensive measures
    autonomously (its high-performance equalizer), coordinating with the network to
    maintain connectivity affordably. The resulting perception of never dropping a
    call (exceptional QoS via multisensory CRA) could be a market differentiator.
    Although consumers are not likely to wear a cell phone camera to gain such a minor
    advantage, the information prosthetic value of such a camera might create market
    value. A first responder might wear such a camera phone to transmit images to
    the incident commander. Location fine structure includes altitude, trajectory,
    indoors/outdoors, weather, and other characteristics of location. Thus, a CRA
    that enables higher radio performance by the opportunistic exploitation of larger
    situation information (such as the visual cues to the transit of the tunnel) may
    facilitate smoother transition to higher QoS for emerging applications, like the
    commingling of public safety and commercial services in the recent 700 MHz spectrum
    auctions in the United States. H. First Responder Situation Awareness Public safety
    and military users refer to the detailed knowledge of physical state as situation
    awareness [86], [87]. With DSA, a cognitive radio bases its actions on little
    more than GPS and instantaneous fade data. However, by taking advantage of the
    video surveillance streams that public safety incident commanders are employing
    in increasing numbers to manage major incidents, the cognitive radio of the future
    may be able to optimize its use of radio resources to reflect finer grain aspects
    of the user''s situation: specific location, surroundings (e.g., in dense smoke),
    movement (e.g., trapped), and, potentially, intent (trying to rescue a victim
    versus trying to escape a cleared area). The value to the radio of greater awareness
    of the user''s physical setting in space and time may reduce uncertainty and promote
    better situation-based radio resource management, such as which of the first responders
    gets MIMO resources for video to assist rescue versus, perhaps, location-only
    low-power low-data-rate radio resources, e.g., when on standby in an assembly
    area. Historically, such needs have not been met with corresponding financial
    resources, but governments around the world may be more inclined to invest for
    the evolution era of Table 1 than they were during the foundation era. I. Commercial
    Sentient Spaces Spatial spectrum confluence domains may be defined as the radio
    environments that are created (usually unintentionally) where a wide diversity
    of commercial and other wireless products, services, and networks are brought
    together in a single location such as a home, business, apartment building, factory,
    or other social space, becoming the venue for a variety of broadcast (e.g., HDTV,
    DBS), WLAN (e.g., 802.11a/b/g, WiFi, HomeRF/Zigbee, Bluetooth, UWB), cellular
    (e.g., 3G femtocells), and broadband radio resources (e.g., WiMAX). Confluence
    domains create a combinatorially explosive set of opportunities for interference,
    as is often true today, or for cognitive load balancing and cooperative power
    management [88] as architectures evolve. Elder care may be an emerging market
    where such tight integration of space, time, and RF makes economic sense during
    the evolution era of Table 1. The sentient home of the future may include video
    cameras and voice interaction to assist elderly residents in remembering whether
    they took their prescription drugs, removing a shoe from the stairs, turning off
    the stove, and performing other tasks that promote health and avoid accidents
    [89]. Other sentient space applications include child care [2], infotainment,
    and interactive games, where the wireless devices situated in the sentient space
    enhance the interactive experience. Usually in the United States, there is a wireless
    point of sale terminal to check-in your rental car at the airport. Although the
    parking lot with only such devices falls short of the sentient space vision, the
    application shows how wireless technologies move sensors and data entry from a
    desk, where it is convenient for the administrator, to the parking lot, where
    it is convenient for the user. The iCR architecture''s emphasis on the user enables
    more aggressive redeployment of sensing, such as cognitive replacement of data
    entry and fiducials with machine vision to reduce costs and enhance commercial
    customer experience. Wireless networks meet several needs in commercial spaces,
    including low-cost deployment and removal, high mobility for the users, and modular
    evolution of the sentient space as medical and wireless technologies continue
    to advance. In part in response to industry interest in sentient spaces for elder
    care and agricultural robotics [90], the Object Management Group (OMG) has developed
    specifications that facilitate the deployment of embedded intelligence. So far
    the OMG has released specifications for smart transducers and superdistributed
    objects, logical representations of hardware/software components that perform
    well-known functionality and services.12 The architecture appears to rely on autonomy
    and cooperation among a massive number of such objects, where the very number
    of interacting objects reduces the effectiveness of conventional plug and play
    technologies. Superdistributed objects may include wireless devices, software
    modules for radios, transducers, video cameras, servers, smart light bulbs and
    switches, electric motors, and other massively distributed components. In such
    applications, radio is a means for distributed control among hardware–software
    artifacts, and the need for trustable wireless connectivity is substantial. Although
    it is far too early to tell, there may be a transition during the evolution period
    of Table 1 where the majority user of wireless becomes IPv6-enabled devices instead
    of people. The potential disruption could be significant in an evolution to autonomous
    networked devices as the primary wireless user. People may interact with a house
    full of smart devices via ubiquitous computer vision and HLT, both spoken and
    written. These technologies may proliferate for the commercialization of sentient
    spaces apart from radio applications, but the information about the user''s situation
    that results could be used by cognitive radios to autonomously adjust radio resource
    priorities to changing needs. SECTION V. Sensory Perception in the Evolving Cra
    Characterizing the potential for evolution towards commercially viable sentient
    spaces requires a brief review of computer vision and human language technologies.
    Each of these technologies is so broad that there is no hope of providing even
    a survey of the state of the art in this brief treatment. The intent instead is
    to identify important aspects of these technologies for future cognitive radios
    to interact with users, peer radios, and external sensory-perception networks
    (such as a cognitive video surveillance network), including speaker identification
    via voice biometrics, context-aware voice commands, and keyword extraction from
    e-mail to detect stereotypical situations for proactive wireless services synthesis.
    A. Computer Vision Computer vision includes video analytics13 that reliably identify
    people and objects in complex scenes and that reliably detect events of interest
    such as an illegal turn via a traffic camera. Cognitive vision [91] systems continuously
    observe a video scene in order to perform such event detection tasks. Video analytics
    applications programmer interfaces (APIs) have evolved for video surveillance14
    and for Internet retrieval15 among others. Video analytics products offer few
    open-architecture standards suited for CRA evolution, but as video object APIs
    and interface standards emerge, CRs may interact with cognitive video systems,
    such as a surveillance network in a snowy, deserted parking lot where the user
    has a serious fall after hours, injured and unable to call for aid. In this use
    case, autonomous collaboration between the users'' CR and the wireless video surveillance
    network could yield an accurate diagnosis of the user''s state and timely emergency
    response for enhanced QoI as the cognitive PDA acts as an agent for the injured
    user [92]. An important cognitive vision/cognitive radio API research issue is
    the rapid characterization of visual scenes with fidelity (granularity and accuracy)
    appropriate to radio use cases. The video scene API should assist the CR in connecting
    with a data rate and priority appropriate to the user''s situation and larger
    context of others contending for spectrum access. For example, radio access may
    be expedited for a small number of users in and near a traffic accident until
    first responders arrive, but such simple priority schemes may be counterproductive
    in a tsunami-class event. Thus, the exchange of situation information with CWNs
    seems to be important in the evolution towards interdisciplinary integration with
    cognitive vision towards the sentient networked CRA. B. Human Language and Machine
    Translation Computer processing of human language includes both real-time speech
    recognition and high-performance text processing, as well as machine translation.
    During the evolution period of Table 1 CRs may perceive spoken and written human
    language (HL) with sufficient reliability to detect, characterize, and respond
    appropriately to stereotypical situations, unburdening the user from the counterproductive
    tedium of identifying the situation for the radio. Machine translation in the
    cell phone may assist global travelers with greetings, hailing a taxi, understanding
    directions to the restaurant, etc. Such information prosthetics may augment today''s
    native language facilities. With ubiquity of coverage behind, CRA evolves towards
    more accurately characterizing the user''s information needs, e.g., via speech
    recognition and synthesis to interact with wearable wireless medical instruments,
    opening new dimensions of QoI. 1. Computer Speech Computer speech technology offers
    opportunities for machine perception of content in well-structured audio channels
    such as 800 directory assistance.16 Although deployed with all Windows XP laptops,
    speech recognition does not appear to be in wide use for interaction with personal
    electronics or for machine dictation. However, the technology now is mature enough
    to transcribe carefully spoken speech in benign acoustic environments, such as
    a (quiet) home office17 with 3–10% raw word error rates, reduced in structured
    utterances such as dictation to less than 2%. In situations where the speech is
    emotional, disfluent, heavily accented, or focused on a rare topic, the word error
    rates increase to about 25%. But even with these high word error rates, topic
    spotting for geographical topics can yield 14.7% precision, improved by an order
    of magnitude during the past five years [93]. Speaker identification technology
    [94] has equal error rates (equal probability of false dismissal and false alarm)
    of < 10% for relatively small collections of speakers ( < 100). Such algorithms
    are influenced (usually corrupted) by acoustic backgrounds that distort the speaker
    models. Speaker recognition may be termed a soft biometric since it could be used
    to estimate a degree of belief that the current speaker is authorized to access
    private data. Such speaker modeling could contribute to multifactor biometrics
    to deter the theft of personal information from wireless devices. 2. Text Understanding
    Business intelligence markets are deploying text understanding technology that
    typically focuses on the quantitative assessment of metrics of text documents,
    e.g., to assess and predict the performance of a business organization. Quantitative
    analyses of databases and spreadsheets often do not clearly establish the causal
    relationships needed for related business decision making. Causal cues typically
    are evident in the unstructured text of business documents like customer contact
    reports, but the extraction of those relationships historically has been excessively
    labor intensive. Therefore businesses, law enforcement, and government organizations
    are employing text analytics to enhance their use of unstructured text for business
    intelligence [95], with a rapidly growing markets. These products mix word sense
    disambiguation, named entity detection, and sentence structure analysis with business
    rules for more accurate business metrics than is practicable using purely statistical
    text-mining approaches on relatively small text corpora. Google depends on the
    laws of very large numbers, but medium to large businesses may generate only hundreds
    to thousands of customer contact reports in a time interval of interest. For example,
    IBM''s Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA)18 text analytics
    analyzes small samples of text in ways potentially relevant to cognitive radio
    architecture evolution such as product defect detection. In addition, Google''s
    recent release of the Android open handset alliance software 19 suggests a mix
    of statistical machine learning with at least shallow analyses of user input (e.g.,
    for intent in the Android tool box). Google has become a popular benchmark for
    text processing. For example, a query tool based on Artificial Linguistic Internet
    Computer Entity (ALICE) is reported to improve on Google by 22% (increasing proportion
    of finding answers from 46% to 68%) in interactive question answering with a small
    sample of 21 users. Of the half of users expressing a preference, 40% preferred
    the ALICE-based tool (FAQchat) while only 10% preferred Google [96]. This is not
    to disparage the planet''s most commercially successful search engine but to show
    how the commercial success of text retrieval stimulates research and productization
    in directions increasingly relevant to cognitive radio architecture evolution.
    Unstructured comments in wireless network service and maintenance records, for
    example, can yield early insight into product defects and service issues before
    they become widespread, for quicker resolution and lower after-market service
    and recall costs. Communities of cognitive radios might analyze their own maintenance
    records to discover operations, administration, and maintenance issues with less
    human oversight [97], enhancing the cost-effectiveness of cognitive devices and
    infrastructure compared to conventionally maintained wireless products and networks
    and complementing current research in functional description languages (FDL) such
    as the E3 FDL [38], [98]. Global mobility of the foundation era of Table 1 spurred
    the creation of world-phones such as GSM mobile phones that work around the world.
    During the evolution era, text analytics, real-time speech translation [99], text
    translation [100], image translation [101], and automatic identification of objects
    in images [102] will propel CRA evolution. C. Situation Perception Architectures
    With a set of APIs for cognitive vision, video analytics, speech recognition and
    synthesis, and text analytics, individual cognitive radios and CWNs may evolve
    towards the organization of machine perception illustrated in Fig. 6. Fig. 6.
    Comprehensive situation perception architecture. [adapted with permission from
    J. Mitola, III, Cognitive Radio Architecture (New York: Wiley 2006)]. (a) Self-,
    RF, and user perception and (b) media stream contributions. Show All Perception
    of the self and the user in a specific situation may be aided by the recognition
    of stereotypical interchanges between the user and the wireless networks in which
    the user employs the radio more or less directly, as is the case today while the
    cognitive agent observes the dialog. In addition, text, speech, or visual cues
    to situation changes may be reinforced in one of the other domains. Different
    participants perceive such situations differently as a function of role and information
    need [103], as illustrated in Fig. 7. Fig. 7. The complexity of situation assessment.
    Show All The complexity of such situations must be fully addressed with the user
    as the eighth layer of the protocol stack—fully characterized in machine readable
    form—to reach the next level of QoI. SECTION VI. Quality of Information QoS concerns
    the availability, data rate, and timing of bitstreams, addressing user needs at
    the physical through network layer of the protocol stack. QoI concerns the information
    that meets a specific user''s need at a specific time, place, physical location,
    and social setting, climbing the protocol stack through the applications layer
    to a postulated user layer, the eighth layer of the protocol stack. QoI may augment
    QoS to help guide the evolution of radio architecture from SDR and DSA towards
    the iCRA. One expression for the QoI metric [2] is as follows: QoI=Quantity∗Precision∗Recall∗Accuracy
    ∗Detail∗Timeliness∗Validity. View Source There are many possible valid forms for
    each of the parameters of this equation. The only requirements for the purposes
    of characterizing QoI are the following. Each parameter is real, occurring in
    the range [1.0, 0]. Each parameter reflects the best QoI at its maximum of 1.0.
    Parameters monotonically approach zero in proportion to degradation of QoI. The
    parameters need not be linear. Given the product form, any term that reaches zero
    reduces net QoI to zero, so the forms most helpful in decision support would retain
    nonzero value in all terms where potentially useful information is provided. Each
    term is briefly discussed. A. Quantity The quantity term represents the information
    displayed or provided by the wireless device or network via the device to the
    user. If the device has no information for a given situation, then quantity is
    zero. Information provided to a user in response to a need does not have to be
    provided in real time but may be made available from cache or a priori knowledge.
    Thus, while QoS measures the quality of a connection, QoI measures the service
    provided to the user in terms that matter to the user. QoS metrics do not ascribe
    value to cached data, but QoI ascribes value to autonomous caching of data that
    the CR infers might be helpful at some point in time (and for which space is available).
    Users know that if the most current information is not available, then older information
    may be better than nothing and may be as good as real-time information if it has
    not changed. Maps, for example, may be safely cached for relatively long periods
    of time since roadways change relatively infrequently. As CRs learn user preference,
    the ability to cache relevant data may increase, and if that is the case, then
    QoI characterizes the value to the user of such proactive caching. Proactive management
    of quantity may shape network traffic as well. A cognitive radio that displays
    a cached street map, advises the network of the date of its cached map, and thus
    avoids downloading a megabyte of data has provided the user with accurate information
    nearly instantaneously and has offloaded a megabyte of traffic from a potentially
    busy network. In the foundation era, when revenue was based to a first-order approximation
    on increasing the use of the network, this might not be such a smart thing for
    a profit-making network to do. However, in the evolution era, when revenue is
    based on market share through product differentiation, instantaneously accurate
    information valued by the consumer might capture market share without burdening
    the network. Thus, the quantity term in the QoI metric expresses value not just
    in terms of connectivity and data rate but also in terms of information made available
    without using the network unnecessarily. On the other hand, suppose sufficient
    information is present, so that Quantity =1.0 . Precision, recall, and accuracy
    further characterize the quality of the quantity provided. B. Precision and Recall
    Precision and recall reflect the degree to which the information corresponds to
    the user''s need. In information retrieval, recall is the fraction of relevant
    documents retrieved from a corpus by a query. Precision is the fraction of documents
    retrieved that are relevant. Recall of 1.0 indicates that all relevant documents
    are retrieved, while precision of 1.0 indicates that no irrelevant documents have
    been retrieved. Adapting this well-known metric to QoI, one may apply precision
    and recall to items provided to a user by a wireless device, with or without the
    assistance of one or more networks and with or without prior caching. Users may
    provide feedback by obtaining more items or rejecting or not using the items retrieved.
    C. Accuracy Accuracy characterizes the quantitative aspects of the information
    provided. Accuracy is reduced by errors such as lack of factual correctness (e.g.,
    spelling the president''s name wrong). Numerical accuracy in QoI reflects any
    numerical error, whether from the original source, via transmission, or via misformatting
    the results. Numerical precision may limit accuracy. If the accuracy required
    by the user is met, then accuracy =1.0 . The rate of degradation of the accuracy
    metric from 1.0 may depend on the situation and may take any form (linear, quadratic,
    exponential, fractal, defined by table lookup, etc.). D. Timeliness Timeliness
    is defined in terms of the user''s timeline along which the information is to
    be employed. If the information is needed immediately, then the quality may be
    characterized as inversely proportional to excessive time delay. To avoid division
    by zero, one may consider timeliness to be 1.0 if the information is available
    before a minimum delivery time Tmin(time,place,social-setting,topic). View Source
    Situations include time, place, and social setting, such as shopping or needing
    medical attention. Suppose the shortest time delay in such a setting is varepsilon
    so the maximum contribution of timeliness to QoI would be 1 /ε . If timeliness
    is normalized by varepsilon , then maximum timeliness would be 1.0. In medical
    situations, there typically is a window after which the information is of marginal
    value, if any, so the timeliness parameter may fall off sharply after such a window.
    Similarly, in some situations, timeliness may be decremented from 1.0 if the delivery
    time is less than varepsilon . There is value in meeting users'' exact timelines
    in the same sense that a wakeup call should be delivered when requested, and a
    user is not happy if the wakeup call is 15 minutes early. E. Validity Validity
    is 1.0 if the information provided is true and approaches zero if false with fuzzy
    set membership, for validity values in [1.0, 0.0]. F. Detail Lastly, if sufficient
    detail is provided that the user regards the information provided as complete,
    then Detail=1.0 , gradually dropping towards zero if insufficient elaborating
    detail is provided. The representation of the user as the eighth layer of the
    protocol stack becomes a computational reality in what may be called the value
    plane [104] to the degree that the user''s preferences in the QoI dimensions are
    made computationally accessible via semantic Web, computational ontology, user
    modeling, and other languages for expressing user needs. QoI has cross-layer implications.
    Given the intermittent connectivity of wireless devices, QoI can guide a cognitive
    radio in its choice among a collection of candidate wireless access points. User
    preference modeling guides the CR in proactive caching when connectivity and data
    rate are available, particularly in a future where there is no additional cost
    to such caching (such as from WiFi and the Internet service provider at home).
    To the degree that a cognitive radio can independently estimate user state or
    can infer that state from a CWN or a collaborating network, such as a wireless
    video surveillance network, the embedded cognitive agent may be able to manage
    radio resources so as to maximize the QoI for its own user whose needs and preferences
    it has learned. SECTION VII. Challenges and Opportunities There are many challenges
    and opportunities in cognitive radio architecture evolution. For example, many
    spectrum measurements reported in the literature do not fully caveat the feasibility
    of spectrum sharing. Measurements that show 5% occupied spectrum often do not
    account for GPS and other navigation aids that cannot be detected via spectrum
    scanning, but require cross-correlation receivers. Other measurements do not reflect
    the duty cycles of the radar bands where a pulsed radar listens for most of its
    duty cycle, contributing 0.1% to spectrum occupancy but 100% to airport surveillance.
    Pulsed radar spectrum therefore may not be shareable in a meaningful way, but
    often radar bands are included in the spectrum scan statistics without clear caveats.
    Space communications typically require high gain receiving antennas—some 60 ft
    across—and the signals from the spacecraft are not detected in the spectrum scans
    either. Ad hoc networking in the apparently unoccupied downlink band would raise
    havoc with space systems. Important counterexamples to the unintentional oversimplification
    of spectrum occupancy characterization include the rigorous spectrum sensing campaigns
    of Tuttlebee''s Virtual Center of Excellence (VCE) conducted by Beach''s group
    at the University of Bristol, U.K.20 [105] and the data sets of the Crawdad site.
    21 Lastly, even in the evolution era of Table 1, emergency channels simply must
    be kept clear for the relatively infrequent emergency communications to experience
    maximum SNR, so they should in fact show no occupancy most of the time. Analog
    AM voice is audible 6 dB below the 0 dB tangential noise floor because of the
    sinusoidal nature of voice, but if that emergency broadcast channel is full of
    ad hoc network traffic, then the safety officer may not hear “Mayday.” The business
    implications of overstating the case for spectrum sharing ultimately cause problems
    for the dynamic spectrum community. The opportunity, then, is to include in the
    evolving CRA sufficient computational intelligence about navigation aids, radar,
    and emergency communications that cognitive radios know how to listen to legacy
    communications as a function of band type and know how to avoid jamming location
    services, creating hot clutter in radar tracks, and generating other spectrum
    artifacts that detract from the trust of the evolving cognitive radio architectures.
    Radio propagation is notoriously ragged in its spatial extent, even in the sweet
    spot between 300 MHz and 3 GHz because of multipath, knife edge diffraction, Fresnel
    zones, and other well-known phenomena. Yet the potential contributions of communities
    of cognitive radios to space-time fine structure of the radio spectrum may not
    be fully realized until the CRAs come to include high-performance spatial knowledge.
    A technical paper on the compact representation of such spatial knowledge was
    deemed best paper at DySPAN 07, for example [106]. There have been several proposals
    for general spectrum auction frameworks [107], [108] and many technical papers
    on this topic (e.g., [109]), with at least one commercial Web site that offers
    anonymous rental of underused spectrum today [42]. Yet at present, there is no
    technical architecture deployed for real-time small space-time-RF spectrum auctions.
    SECTION VIII. Conclusion Radio engineering is undergoing exciting transformations.
    The introduction of SDR indeed has put greater demands on analog devices to access
    spectrum in increasingly larger chunks, to generate increasingly pure transmissions
    with increasingly efficient power conversion. The technologies, products, networks,
    and related systems are increasing in complexity to meet rising expectations.
    Cognitive radio architecture provides an evolving series of frameworks for research,
    development, and product deployment. As users transition from the question of
    “Can you hear me now?” to “What have you done for me lately?” the radio engineering
    community may transition from QoS as the coin of the realm towards metrics more
    like QoI and QoS ∗QoI. Architectures will evolve greater QoI for lower cost via
    interdisciplinary information integration, where radio engineers will be better
    able to leverage information about the user''s location, preferences, and current
    situation to deliver multimedia infotainment in one instant and emergency response
    in the next. High value-added and profitability is needed to transition smoothly
    to continue to balance market needs and public interest. During this evolution,
    the radio research community will continue to lead the way with mathematical foundations,
    focused use cases, sensory-perception integration, and radio engineering evolution,
    towards ultimate realizations of the cognitive radio value proposition: better
    use of radio spectrum for the user. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The author wishes to acknowledge

    Abstract: Internet of everything (IoE)-based smart services are expected to gain
    immense popularity in the future, which raises the need for next-generation wireless
    networks. Although fifth-generation (5G) networks can support various IoE services,
    they might not be able to completely fulfill the requirements of novel applications.
    Sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems are envisioned to overcome 5G network limitations.
    In this article, we explore recent advances made toward enabling 6G systems. We
    devise a taxonomy based on key enabling technologies, use cases, emerging machine
    learning schemes, communication technologies, networking technologies, and computing
    technologies. Furthermore, we identify and discuss open research challenges, such
    as artificial-intelligence-based adaptive transceivers, intelligent wireless energy
    harvesting, decentralized and secure business models, intelligent cell-less architecture,
    and distributed security models. We propose practical guidelines including deep
    Q-learning and federated learning-based transceivers, blockchain-based secure
    business models, homomorphic encryption, and distributed-ledger-based authentication
    schemes to cope with these challenges. Finally, we outline and recommend several
    future directions. Topic: Edge Intelligence for Internet of Things 6G wireless

    I. Introduction The remarkable upsurge of Internet of everything (IoE)-based smart
    applications has paved the way for the evolution of existing wireless networks.
    The term IoE refers to bringing together things, data, people, and process, via
    emerging technologies to offer a wide variety of smart services [1]. The emerging
    IoE services include autonomous connected vehicles, brain–computer interfaces,
    extended reality (XR), flying vehicles, and haptics [2]–[4]. These services are
    mostly based on ultra-high reliability, high data rates, unmanned mobility management,
    and long-distance communication. Fifth-generation (5G) wireless networks are envisioned
    to enable a wide variety of smart IoE-based services. The 5G targeted tactile
    network is accessed via different approaches, such as simultaneous use of unlicensed
    and licensed bands, intelligent spectrum management, and 5G new radio, to enable
    different smart applications [5]–[8]. However, 5G has several inherent limitations
    and difficulties to completely fulfill its target goals until now. The development
    of different data-centric, automated processes are proving to exceed the capabilities
    defined by key performance indicators of 5G [9]. For instance, several applications,
    such as haptics, telemedicine, and connected autonomous vehicles, are intended
    to use long packets with ultra-high reliability and high data rates. Such applications
    violate the notion of generally using short packets for ultra-reliable low-latency
    communication (URLLC) in 5G [2]. The next generation of virtual and augmented
    reality-based applications, such as holographic teleportation will require microsecond-level
    latency and Tbps-level data rates [10]. Such a type of requirements seem difficult
    to be fulfilled by 5G networks. Furthermore, the 5G connectivity density of 10
    6 /k m 2 [11] might not be able to meet the growing demands of next-generation
    smart industries. Therefore, sixth-generation (6G) wireless systems must be developed.
    6G will use artificial intelligence (AI) as an integral part that has the capability
    to optimize a variety of wireless network problems [12]. Typically, mathematical
    optimization techniques are used to optimize wireless network problems. To solve
    these mathematical optimization problems, we can use convex optimization schemes,
    matching theory, game theory, heuristic, and brute force algorithms. However,
    these solution approaches might suffer from the issue of high complexity which
    in turn degrades the capacity of a system. Machine learning is capable of optimizing
    various complex mathematical problems including the problems that cannot be modeled
    using mathematical equations. Rethink Technology Ltd. Research indicates several
    challenges in the deployment of advanced wireless networking technologies: guaranteed
    robustness, and management and pricing of virtual network functions due to their
    uncertain nature [13]. Other main problems include fronthaul cost issue and vendor
    hostility. Although an open interface between remote radio unit and baseband unit
    has been proposed, the true evolved common public radio interface is difficult
    to experience. Therefore, a novel 6G architecture must be developed to tackle
    these challenges. Fig. 1 presents an overview of 6G wireless system and illustrates
    its key requirements in terms of capacity, uplink data rate, downlink data rate,
    localization precision, reliability in terms of frame error rate, latency, jitter,
    and energy per bit [14]. Several enabling technologies and use cases are also
    illustrated. Furthermore, overview of different wireless mobile technologies with
    their commencement year and other features is presented in Fig. 2 [15]. On the
    other hand, comparison of 5G and 6G for different parameters is given in Table
    1 [2], [14], [16]. TABLE 1 Comparison of 5G and 6G FIGURE 1. 6G wireless systems

    A. 6G Market Statistics and Research Activities Although 5G wireless systems are
    not fully deployed yet, 6G wireless systems are envisioned by much research to
    fulfill the needs of expected novel IoE smart services in the foreseeable future.
    According to statistics, the 6G market will grow at a compound annual growth rate
    of 70% from 2025 to 2030 and reach 4.1 billion US dollars by 2030 [17]. Among
    various components of 6G, such as edge computing, cloud computing, and AI, communication
    infrastructure will offer the largest market share of up to 1 billion US dollars.
    Another key component of 6G; namely, AI chipsets, will be more than 240 million
    units in number by 2028. Different organizations have started 6G projects [18]–[21].
    The 6G Flagship research program [18] is supported by the Academy of Finland and
    led by the University of Oulu to carry out the co-creation of an ecosystem for
    6G innovation and 5G adoption. The vision of the 6G flagship program is a data-driven
    society with unlimited, instant wireless connectivity. Initially, five organizations;
    namely, VTT Technical Research Center of Finland Ltd., Oulu University of Applied
    Sciences, Nokia, Business Oulu, and Aalto University, joined the program as collaborators.
    Later, InterDigital and Keysight Technologies joined the program. An agreement
    was signed between the South Korean government and the University of Oulu, Finland
    for the development of 6G technology [19]. Furthermore, LG has established its
    first research laboratory at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology
    to carry out 6G research activities [20]. SK Telecom started joint research on
    6G with Samsung, Nokia, and Ericsson [21]. Research on 6G has started in China,
    as officially announced by the Ministry of Science and Technology [22]. Moreover,
    the Chinese vendor Huawei has already started 6G research at its research center
    in Ottawa, Canada [23]. Several 6G research programs have been started in the
    US, as announced by the US president [24]. Additionally, the NYU WIRELESS research
    center, which comprises nearly 100 faculty members and graduate students, is working
    on communication foundations, machine learning, quantum nanodevices, and 6G testbeds
    [25]. Existing 6G tutorials and surveys are discussed next. B. Existing Surveys
    and Tutorials Several studies surveyed 6G wireless systems [2], [4], [9], [10],
    [13], [16], [26]–[29]. Saad et al. presented applications, enabling technologies,
    and few open research challenges [2]. They discussed applications, metrics, and
    new services for 6G. Moreover, 6G driving trends and performance matrices were
    presented. Letaief et al. presented the vision of AI-empowered 6G wireless networks
    [4]. They discussed 6G network architecture with key enablers and 6G applications
    for various AI-enabled smart services. The authors in [26] focused on 6G use cases,
    enabling technologies, and open research challenges. The study conducted in [9]
    discussed the evolution of wireless communication systems towards 6G and presented
    its use cases. Primarily, the authors presented 6G key enabling technologies with
    their associated challenges and possible applications. Finally, they discussed
    the integration of intelligence in 6G systems. Another study discussed enabling
    technologies, architecture, requirements, and key drivers of 6G [13]. The authors
    in [27] surveyed potential technologies for 6G wireless networks. First, the authors
    provided an overview of 6G based on time-frequency-space resource utilization.
    Second, key techniques for the evolution of wireless networks to 6G are presented.
    Finally, the authors presented future issues regarding 6G deployment. Zhang et
    al. mainly discussed the key technologies and vision of 6G [28]. The authors discussed
    the 6G use cases and their requirements in terms of peak data rate, user-experienced
    data rate, over-the-air latency, energy efficiency, and connectivity density.
    Kato et al. discussed various machine learning schemes and presented 10 challenges
    regarding intelligentization of 6G wireless systems [29]. Akyildiz et al. [10]
    presented detailed discussions on key enabling technologies for 6G. They presented
    key performance indicators and use cases of 6G. Terahertz communications with
    its applications, devices, physical layer modeling, and open problems are discussed
    in detail. Furthermore, intelligent communication environments with its layered
    architecture are described. Finally, several open research challenges are presented.
    Chen et al. presented vision, requirements, applications, and technology trends
    in 6G [16]. Furthermore, they discussed open research challenges and orbital angular
    momentum (OAM) as new resource for modulation in 6G. C. Our Survey The work presented
    in [2], [4], [9], [10], [13], [16], [26]–[29] focused on key enabling technologies,
    requirements, and use cases of 6G. By contrast, we are the first to discuss state-of-the-art
    advances and taxonomy for 6G wireless systems to the best of our knowledge, as
    given in Table 2. We also present novel open research challenges and future research
    directions. TABLE 2 Summary of the Existing Surveys and Tutorials With Their Primary
    Focus Our contributions are as follows: We explore and discuss state-of-the-art
    advances made toward enabling 6G systems. We devise a taxonomy of 6G wireless
    systems based on key enablers, use cases, emerging machine learning schemes, communication
    technologies, networking technologies, and computing technologies. We discuss
    several open research challenges and their possible solutions. We provide an outlook
    for future research. The rest of our survey is organized as follows. Section II
    presents state-of-the-art advances toward enabling 6G systems. Moreover, a summary
    of features and merits with critical discussions is provided. Section III presents
    the devised taxonomy using key enablers, use cases, emerging machine learning
    schemes, communication technologies, networking technologies, and computing technologies
    as parameters. Open research challenges with guidelines are presented in Section
    IV. Section V presents potential future research directions and finally, paper
    is concluded in Section VI. SECTION II. 6G:State-of-the-Art This section presents
    state-of-the-art advances that enable 6G, as summarized in Table 3. TABLE 3 Summary
    of State-of-the-Art Khan et al. reviewed federated learning at the network edge
    [30]. Resource optimization and incentive mechanism design for federated learning
    at the network edge was considered. First, key design aspects for enabling federated
    learning at the network edge were presented. These key design aspects are resource
    optimization, incentive mechanism design, learning algorithm design, and hardware–software
    co-design. Second, a Stackelberg-game-based incentive mechanism was proposed.
    Additionally, a few numerical results were presented to validate their Stackelberg-game-based
    incentive mechanism. Finally, several open research challenges and future research
    directions were presented. Although the Stackelberg game-based incentive mechanism
    provides reasonable results, it is recommended to further propose contract theory-based
    incentive mechanism. Wang et al. proposed a framework; namely, In-Edge AI, to
    enable intelligent edge computing and caching via machine learning [31]. Deep
    Q-learning agents are placed at the edge nodes in the proposed framework to offer
    intelligence. An improved version of deep Q-learning; namely, double deep Q-learning
    network (DDQN), was used in the paper for two cases of edge caching and computational
    offloading. Centralized DDQN and federated learning-based DDQN were proposed to
    train the DDQN. Although federated-learning-based DDQN has a generally slightly
    degraded performance than centralized DDQN, it offers a substantially lower consumption
    of communication resources for training the learning agent at the network edge.
    The In-Edge AI framework showed promising results for caching and edge computing,
    there is a need to propose an incentive mechanism and business model for the proposed
    framework. The In-Edge AI framework has a large number of mobile users, service
    providers, and different operators. Therefore, enabling their successful interaction
    requires effective incentive mechanism design. Stackelberg game and contract theory-based
    incentive mechanisms can be proposed for successful interaction between a variety
    of players. Mozaffari et al. introduced the concept of 3D cellular networks mainly
    based on drones [33]. They integrated cellular-connected drone users with drone
    base stations considering the two problems of 3D cell association and network
    planning. They introduced a new scheme using truncated octahedron cells to compute
    the minimum number of drone base stations and their feasible locations in a 3D
    space. They also derived an analytical expression for frequency planning. Finally,
    they presented an optimal-latency-aware 3D cell association scheme. Mumtaz et
    al. provided an overview of challenges and opportunities for terahertz communication
    in vehicular networks [34]. They discussed different available bands in the terahertz
    communication range. The authors discussed different standardization activities
    regarding terahertz communication. However, 6G is currently in initial phases
    and significant efforts are needed to turn its vision of 6G using terahertz band
    into reality. There is a need to define novel standards for 6G to incorporate
    terahertz communication in addition to other emerging communication and computing
    technologies. Nawaz et al. presented the vision of quantum machine learning for
    6G [32]. The authors reviewed state-of-the-art machine learning techniques intended
    for use in next-generation communication networks. Moreover, they discussed state-of-the-art
    quantum communication schemes and few open research challenges, and proposed a
    quantum-computing-assisted machine learning framework for 6G networks. Finally,
    they discussed open research issues related to the implementation of quantum machine
    learning in 6G. Salem et al. considered the nanosensor network using blood as
    a medium for terahertz communication to enable smart healthcare applications [35].
    They proposed an electromagnetic model for blood using effective medium theory.
    An advantage of the proposed model is the flexibility of specifying red blood
    cell volume fraction and particle shape. Another advantage of their work is finding
    the relation of molecular noise and path loss with the concentration of red blood
    cells. Molecular noise and path loss decrease with an increase in concentration
    of red blood cells, and vice versa. Finally, the authors concluded that the particle
    shape of red blood cells has no effect on blood, although it is considered a medium
    for terahertz communication. Canovas-Carrasco et al. [36] proposed an architecture
    using terahertz communication for hierarchical body area nanonetworks. They conceptually
    designed two kinds of devices for the proposed architecture; namely, nanonodes
    and nanorouters. They proposed a novel communication scheme to enable communication
    between nanonodes using the terahertz band. They carried out communications using
    the human hand and mitigated molecular absorption noise and path loss. Another
    advantage of the proposed architecture is coping with the issue of the decrease
    in transmission rate due to energy limitations. They proposed using energy harvesting
    from the blood stream and external sources to improve transmission rate. Although
    the proposed architecture for body area nanonetworks offers significant advantages
    and mainly considered communication between nano-router and nano-nodes, it is
    preferable to analyze the communication model between the external devices and
    body area nanonetworks to enable dispatching of sensor data to end-users. SECTION
    III. Taxonomy We consider key enablers, emerging machine learning schemes, communication
    technologies, networking technologies, and computing technologies, to devise the
    taxonomy, as shown in Fig. 3. Further discussion is provided in the following
    subsections. FIGURE 3. Taxonomy of 6G wireless systems. Show All A. Key Enablers
    A 6G system will use a wide variety of computing, communication, networking, and
    sensing technologies to offer different novel smart applications. The key enablers
    of 6G wireless systems are edge intelligence, homomorphic encryption, blockchain,
    network slicing, AI, photonics-based cognitive radio, and space-air-ground-integrated
    network. Although network slicing was proposed in 5G as a key enabling networking
    technology, its true realization is expected in 6G. Network slicing based on software-defined
    networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV) employs shared physical
    resources to enable slices of different applications. The process of network slicing
    involves the optimization of a variety of network parameters. One way is to model
    them using mathematical optimization problem that can be solved using different
    schemes, such as convex optimization schemes, game theory, and iterative schemes.
    However, mostly the later schemes are highly complex. Therefore, there is a need
    to propose new solutions (e.g., machine learning-based solutions) with low complexity.
    Over 2,000 configurable parameters are expected in a typical 6G smart device [31].
    Therefore, using smart devices based on effective machine learning schemes is
    indispensable. Photonics-based cognitive radio assisted by machine learning will
    enable intelligence in 6G radio and offer features of scalability, ultra-reliability,
    low latency, and ultra-broadband features. Blockchain is a distributed ledger
    that will enable secure, robust exchange of data among smart citizens [37]–[39].
    Therefore, it can be considered one of the key technologies for 6G to enable smart
    supply chain, smart grid, and smart healthcare [40]–[42]. Although blockchain
    will be considered to be one of the key enabling technologies of 6G systems, it
    has few challenges. Mainly, these challenges are simultaneous scalability and
    reliability, high-latency, and high energy consumption for running consensus algorithm
    [43], [44]. 6G systems are envisioned mainly to enable extremely low latency (i.e.,
    less than 1ms), low energy consumption (i.e., 1pJ/b), and reliability (i.e., 1−
    10 −9 ). Therefore, significant efforts for designing blockchain with low-latency,
    ultra-high scalability and reliability, are required to truly enable its existence
    into 6G. On the other hand, ubiquitous sensing involves machine vision and 3D-range
    imaging using video-captured information to enable sensing automation and smart
    decision making [45], [46]. Ubiquitous sensing will serve as a key technology
    of smart cyber–physical systems for enabling novel 6G applications [47]. Space-air-ground
    integrated network (SAGIN) consists of terrestrial communication networks, aerial
    networks, and satellite networks, which can be considered to one of the key enablers
    of 6G [2]. One of the many advantages of SAGIN is to provide coverage to scarce
    infrastructure areas by drones-based BSs. Other advantages of SAGIN are strong
    resilience, high throughput, and large coverage [48]. Although SAGIN offers several
    benefits, it suffers from the challenge of how to effectively perform end-to-end
    quality of service management, mobility management, load balancing, power control,
    and spectrum allocation, among all network segments. Therefore, we must design
    novel schemes for SAGIN-enabled 6G to enable optimal end-to-end performance among
    all the network segments. B. Use Cases Although 5G wireless networks were conceived
    to provide a wide variety of smart services, several services disrupt the vision
    of 5G design. Generally, 5G use cases have three main classes, such as URLLC,
    enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), and massive machine-type communication (mMTC).
    However, several new applications are disrupting the vision of 5G use cases and
    we need new use cases. For instance, consider XR (i.e., combining mixed reality,
    augmented reality, and virtual reality [49]) and brain-computer interaction that
    requires 5G-eMBB high data rates, low-latency, and high reliability. Therefore,
    we must define new use cases for these emerging applications. The novel 6G services
    are haptics, autonomous connected vehicles, massive URLLC (mURLLC), human-centric
    services, bioInternet of things (B-IoT), nanoInternet of things (N-IoT), and mobile
    broadband reliable, low-latency communication [2], [9], [28]. Novel 6G use cases
    are provided below: Massive URLLC: mURLLC denotes IoE applications based on application-dependent
    scaling of classical URLLC [2]. mURLLC will be based on merging massive machine-type
    communication and 5G URLLC. This use case will offer a trade-off between reliability,
    scalability, and latency. Examples of mURLLC are smart factories and smart grids,
    which require ultra-reliability and low-latency communication. In addition, we
    expect a massive number (more than 10 6 /k m 2 ) of nodes for cyber-physical system-enabled
    smart factories and smart grids in the future [10]. Therefore, we must scale the
    classical 5G URLLC to a massive URLLC to meet the requirements of these new applications.
    Human-centric services: Although 5G offers numerous advantages, such as basic
    augmented and virtual reality services, high-definition video streaming, internet
    protocol television, among others, there is a need to propose services that are
    more human-centric. In contrast to 5G use cases, the human-centric services use
    case represents a service that is intended to fulfill new user-centric metrics
    (i.e., quality of physical experience) [2], [50]. A common example is brain–computer
    interface whose performance can be measured via human physiology. Haptics communication:
    Haptic communication, a form of non-verbal communication, deals with enabling
    sense of touch from a remote place [51]. However, enabling this type of real-time
    interactive experience using 6G requires substantial design efforts. Holographic
    communication based services: This use case is based on a remote connection with
    an ultra-high accuracy [9]. Holographic communication will be based on multiple-view
    camera image communication that requires substantially higher data rates (Tbps)
    [14]. Unmanned Mobility: This use case deals with fully autonomous connected vehicles
    that offer complete unmanned mobility, safe driving, smart infotainment, and enhanced
    traffic management [9]. Nano-Internet of Things: N-IoT uses nanodevices for communication
    over a network. For instance, nanocommunication in a smart factory can be used
    to monitor carbon emissions, water quality, gaseous fumes, and humidity. As N-IoT
    mainly uses molecular communication which seems difficult to enable by 5G. We
    should consider 6G for molecular communication-based N-IoT [52]. Nano-networks
    use terahertz band for better performance [10], which falls in 6G [2]. Therefore,
    we can say that N-IoT can be better enabled by 6G. The key requirements for N-IoT
    must be specified based on 6G because N-IoT is in its infancy. The N-IoT has several
    implementation challenges, such as physical layer schemes for macro and micro-scale
    molecular communication (i.e., detection and channel estimation), standardization
    of layered architecture, design of nano-things, and development of application-oriented
    testbeds. Bio-Intenet of Things: B-IoT is based on the communication of biodevices
    (nanobiological devices) using IoT. This use case represents the variety of smart
    healthcare applications using biocommunication. Similar to N-IoT, the key performance
    requirements for B-IoT must be specified. The works in [35] and [36] used the
    terahertz band, which is one of the key enablers of 6G. Therefore, we can say
    that B-IoT can be effectively enabled by 6G. C. Emerging Machine Learning Schemes
    Machine learning (ML) is considered one of the key drivers of 6G. ML recently
    elicited great attention in enabling numerous smart applications. In 6G, ML is
    expected to not only enable smart applications but also provide intelligent medium
    access control schemes and intelligent transceivers [29], [53], [54].Thus, ML
    can be one of the fundamental pillars of the 6G wireless network. Generally, we
    can divide ML into several types: traditional machine learning, federated learning,
    meta learning, and quantum machine learning. Traditional machine learning is based
    on the migration of data from end devices to a centralized server for training
    the machine learning model. However, this approach suffers from issues of privacy
    concerns and high overhead in the migration of data to a centralized server [55].
    Furthermore, centralized machine learning generally suffers from high power consumption
    during the training process for large datasets. Coping with this issue, one can
    use distributed machine learning. Distributed machine learning can lead to high-performance
    computing by enabling parallel computation of machine learning models at distributed
    locations [56]. There can be two possible ways, such as the data-parallel approach
    and model-parallel approach, to distribute the machine learning tasks. The data-parallel
    approach is based on a division of data among nodes, with all nodes running the
    same machine learning model. On the other hand, the model-parallel approach is
    based on training portions of the machine learning model which are distributed
    across many nodes, with every node having an exact copy of the data. However,
    this approach might not be feasible for many machine learning models that cannot
    be split up into parts. To deploy distributed machine learning models using data-parallel
    approach, there can be many possible ways. These ways include centralized, tree-based
    decentralized, parameter server-based decentralized, and fully distributed [56].
    In a centralized ensemble-based distributed learning, a strict aggregation fashion
    at one central location is adopted. Tree-based decentralized learning allows intermediate
    aggregation at child nodes before a central aggregation takes place [57]. Parameter
    server-based decentralized learning is based on storing all the client’s updates
    on a shared parameter server. In case of fully distributed, all nodes directly
    communicate with each other for the model sharing. On the other hand, federated
    learning can be considered as a special type of distributed machine learning.
    Federated learning was recently adopted for edge networks to tackle these prominent
    challenges of traditional machine learning [30], [31]. Federated learning enables
    machine learning in a distributed manner by enabling on-device machine learning
    without migrating data from end devices to the edge/cloud server. However, federated
    learning has its inherent challenges including communication and computation resource
    optimization, incentive mechanism design, and local device learning algorithm
    design. Quantum machine learning combines quantum physics and machine learning
    to enable fast training of machine learning models. Meta learning enables the
    machine learning models to learn, but has complexity in design because various
    machine learning models have different natures. D. Communication Technologies
    A 6G system will use novel communication technologies to enable various smart
    applications. These communication technologies are terahertz communication, quantum
    communication, 3D wireless communication, visible light communication, nanoscale
    communication, and holographic communication. Recently, 3GPP has developed a new
    radio access technology; namely, 5G new radio using sub-6 GHz and mmWave bands
    for enabling high data rates [58]. To enable further higher data rates, 6G will
    use terahertz bands in addition to mmWave bands. Generally, terahertz communication
    uses frequencies from 0.1 to 10 terahertz and is characterized by short-range,
    medium-power consumption, high security, and robustness to weather conditions
    [59]–[61]. Terahertz communication offers several advantages, but several challenges
    must be resolved to enable its use in 6G. These challenges involve the design
    of efficient transceivers with advanced adaptive array technologies to increase
    its range. Another important aspect of 6G is the use of 3D communication which
    involves the integration of ground and airborne networks. Unarmed aerial vehicles
    and low-orbit satellites can be used as base stations for 3D communication [62].
    In contrast to 2D (ground) communication, 3D communication has a substantially
    different nature because of the introduction of altitude dimension. Therefore,
    novel schemes are necessary for resource allocation and mobility handling for
    3D communication networks. Nanoscale communication is a new communication technology
    that uses an extremely short wavelength for communication and is suitable for
    a distance of 1 m or cm. Key challenges of nanoscale communication are nanoscale
    transceiver design and channel modeling. Visible light communication can be used
    to enable several 6G applications using a visible light spectrum that ranges from
    430 THz to 790 THz [63], [64]. The main advantage of visible light communication
    is the use of illumination sources for lighting and communication. Moreover, visible
    light communication offers a substantial large bandwidth and interference-free
    communication from radio frequency waves. However, visible light communication
    with low-range, novel transceivers (acting as illumination source and communication
    source) must be designed to enable different visible light communication-based
    applications. Furthermore, several other challenges must be resolved to enable
    6G with visible light communication. Such challenges include connectivity of light-emitting
    diode to the Internet, inter-cell interference, mobility and coverage, among others
    [63]. To enable 6G with a high capacity, one can deploy light-emitting diodes
    for visible light communication in a dense fashion. However, it will suffer from
    inter-cell interference which must be given proper attention. To enable seamless
    connectivity to users using visible light communication, it is essential to the
    handle mobility problem. In a typical visible light communication cell, there
    exists significant variations in signal-to-interference-ratio. Therefore, we must
    effectively handle the mobility issues using visible light communication. Quantum
    communication has the inherent feature of high security, which makes it preferred
    for 6G [65], [66]. The simultaneous achievement of long-distance and high rates
    is contradictory in quantum communication [67]. Therefore, repeaters must be used
    to enable secure long-distance, high-data-rate quantum communication. However,
    current repeaters cannot be used for quantum communication, and new repeaters
    must be designed. E. Networking Technologies Novel networking technologies for
    6G are nanonetworking, bionetworking, optical networking, and 3D networking [68].
    The operation of the N-IoT is based on molecular communication. Different materials,
    such as graphene and meta materials can be used to build nanometer-range devices.
    B-IoT using biological cells are used for communication using IoT [69], [70].
    B-IoT and N-IoT are seemingly integral parts of future 6G smart services but have
    several implementation challenges. The design of physical layer technologies for
    molecular communication is a challenging task. Apart from physical layer techniques,
    novel routing schemes must be proposed because of the substantially different
    nature of B-IoT and N-IoT compared with traditional IoT. Efficient nanodevices
    and biodevices must be developed for N-IoT and B-IoT because they are in infancy.
    However, 3D networking uses drone-based user devices and drone-based base stations
    to enable communication networks. Thus, novel models must be devised for a 3D
    communication network due to its substantially different nature compared with
    a 2D network. F. Computing Technologies A 6G system involves a wide variety of
    sources of different smart applications that generate an enormous amount of data.
    High-performance computing and quantum computing must be used to enable intelligent
    data analytics. Quantum computing is expected to revolutionize the field of computing
    by enabling higher speeds that users have never experienced until now [71], [72].
    The key feature of quantum communication is secure channels, where every channel
    carries its distinct security protocols constructed into encrypted data. These
    features of security in addition to ultra-high speed make quantum computing preferable
    for secure 6G smart applications. Other than quantum computing, intelligent edge
    computing is required for 6G to provide intelligent on-demand computing and on-demand
    storage capabilities with extremely low latency to end nodes [73]–[77]. SECTION
    IV. Open Research Challenges We present several novel open research challenges
    for 6G. Their causes and possible solutions are discussed and summarized in Table
    4. TABLE 4 Summary of the Research Challenges and Their Guidelines A. AI-Based
    Adaptive Transceivers How do we enable a 6G transceiver with a large number of
    intelligent, adaptive tunable parameters? A typical 6G transceiver is expected
    to have numerous tunable parameters. These parameters can be adaptively tuned
    via machine learning algorithms. For instance, consider the training of a deep
    Q-learning agent for intelligent caching in XR applications. The Q-learning agent
    can be trained in two ways: traditional machine learning and federated learning.
    Traditional machine learning requires shifting of data from end devices to the
    edge/cloud server for the training of the deep Q-learning agent deployed at the
    edge/cloud server. The sending of data from end devices to the edge server has
    a substantial cost in terms of wireless communication resources. By contrast,
    federated learning can be used to train the deep Q-learning agent efficiently
    by reducing wireless resource usage through sending only model updates (that have
    much less size compared with the whole training data) to the edge/cloud server.
    Similarly, federated learning can be used to enable intelligence in an adaptive
    transceiver. B. Intelligent Wireless Energy Harvesting How do we enable 6G smart
    applications in a sustainable fashion? Enabling 6G applications sustainably requires
    the use of energy-efficient devices and renewable energy sources. Wireless energy
    harvesting can be one of possible ways to enable sustainable operation of 6G.
    Wireless energy harvesting covers numerous harvesting scenarios: dedicated radio
    frequency harvesting sources, interference-aware harvesting, and ambient sunlight
    harvesting. However, substantial variations exist in harvested energy for these
    wireless energy-harvesting sources. Therefore, an intelligent power control must
    be developed for energy-harvesting devices. Traditional power control schemes
    for energy-harvesting devices assume the known system state (incoming harvesting
    energy and wireless channel), but this information is not available practically.
    Machine learning can be used to predict the future system state and address these
    challenges. Reinforcement learning can be one of the possible solutions with unknown
    statistical knowledge and observable current system state, but it has a limitation
    of use in only finite system states. Another approach to cope with this limitation
    is the use of Lyapunov opportunistic optimization and online-learning-based schemes
    [78]. C. Decentralized and Secure Business Models How do we enable a wide variety
    of geographically distributed and diverse players in 6G to interact cost effectively
    and securely? Novel decentralized, secure business models must be designed to
    enable a cost-effective interaction among various geographically distributed players
    in 6G economically and securely. A centralized business model will offer high
    latency, which is undesirable for ultra-high-speed 6G smart services. Therefore,
    new distributed business models for 6G must be developed. Different schemes can
    be used for security in business models. One of these schemes can be a blockchain-based
    secure service brokering between suppliers and providers. D. Intelligent Cell-Less
    Architecture How do we enable intelligent management of a large variety of different
    communication technologies in the cell-less architecture of 6G wireless systems?
    A 6G system will be based on a true cell-less architecture to avoid handover issues
    and offer seamless communication with improved quality of experience to end users.
    Therefore, a novel architecture for 6G enables a seamless interaction between
    numerous communication technologies, such as visible light communication, millimeter-wave
    communication, and terahertz communication. All access points/base stations of
    different communication techniques should serve the users in collaboration to
    improve the signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratio. Intelligent operation of
    6G can be enabled via intelligent cognitive radio with self-sustaining, adaptive
    features. A software-defined cognitive radio using machine learning can be used
    to perform several intelligent operations: self-protection against interference,
    self-fault recovery, self-optimization, and self-management. One possible way
    to enable software-defined cognitive radio is the use of deep Q-learning. Quantum
    machine learning can also be used to enable fast learning of machine learning
    models [32]. E. Distributed Security Models How do we enable distributed machine
    learning and distributed computing for 6G while preserving user privacy? A 6G
    wireless system will use AI to enable different smart applications and networking
    functions. Traditional machine learning models migrate user data to the edge/cloud
    server for training the learning model. Therefore, homomorphic encryption, which
    enables sending of encrypted data to the edge/cloud server rather than un-encrypted
    data, can be used to address this type of privacy concern. A novel distributed
    authentication scheme must be proposed for 6G wireless systems. Distributed ledger
    technology (using blockchain)-based authentication schemes can be one of the possible
    solutions for 6G-distributed authentication. F. Reconfigurable Smart Reflecting
    Surfaces-Enabled 6G How do we enable 6G wireless systems with reconfigurable smart
    reflecting surfaces to simultaneously improve throughput and energy efficiency?
    To enable 6G with high capacity using millimeter-wave and terahertz communication,
    we can use massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) with antenna arrays for
    meeting increasing demands in capacity [79]. Although an increase in frequency
    reduces the scattering and diffraction effect, it suffers from the blocking of
    electromagnetic waves by buildings. Additionally, high-frequency communication
    suffers from significant path loss. Coping with the aforementioned issues, we
    can use reconfigurable smart reflecting surfaces. A typical reconfigurable smart
    reflecting surface is comprised of several reconfigurable reflecting elements
    that can reflect impinging electromagnetic waves. In [80], Liaskos et al. used
    deep learning-based reconfigurable smart surface to improve wireless communication
    performance. Another approach is to use reconfigurable smart reflecting surface-based
    access points [81], which involve sending of an unmodulated carrier signal to
    smart surfaces with negligible fading by radio frequency signal generator. The
    reconfigurable smart reflecting surface then uses phase shifts to convey the bits.
    SECTION V. Potential Future Directions We derive several future research directions
    (overview is presented in Fig. 4) from the study as follows. FIGURE 4. 6G wireless
    systems: future directions. Show All A. Adaptive Machine Learning-Enabled 6G Machine
    learning can be considered an integral part of 6G, but applying a specific type
    of machine learning technique for 6G must examine the application nature. For
    instance, consider autonomous driving cars that generate 4,000 gigaoctet of data
    every day [82]. In this scenario, real-time interaction is necessary. Centralized
    machine learning based on one-time training can be used. However, the model trained
    via centralized machine learning might not produce good results due to the frequent
    addition of new data. Therefore, federated learning is preferred over centralized
    machine learning for this type of scenario. Federated learning offers the advantage
    of considering newly added data training but suffers from fairness issues. q -fair
    federated learning was proposed to deal with fairness issues [83]. In q -federated
    learning, local learning weights of devices with poor performance are given more
    weight, and vice versa. Although q-fair federated learning can enable efficient
    federated learning via adjusting weights, it suffers from the challenge of how
    to dynamically adjust weights. Therefore, centralized machine learning, where
    user privacy has less importance and does not suffer from frequent addition of
    data, can be used. Another way is to use distributed learning based on training
    a machine learning model using a dataset at a centralized location. Machine learning
    model parameters are then sent to the end devices. Finally, the end devices update
    the global learning models using their local datasets. The advantage of distributed
    machine learning is the one time-sharing of learning model parameters between
    the centralized server and end devices, thus avoiding resource fairness challenges.
    However, distributed learning needs the dataset at the centralized location having
    sufficient data (might not be all device data) from training, which again causes
    some privacy leakage to a lesser extent than centralized machine learning. B.
    Scalable and Reliable Blockchain-Enabled 6G Blockchain is a promising technology
    that offers secure storage of transactions in a distributed, immutable ledger.
    Various smart services that can be enabled by blockchain are smart healthcare,
    smart supply chain management, smart transportation, and smart property management.
    A 6G system is intended to provide enhanced scalability and reliability, extremely
    low latency, and low energy consumption. However, existing blockchain consensus
    algorithms might pose limitations in terms of scalability, reliability, latency,
    and energy consumption [84]. Implementation of blockchain to achieve key design
    aspects, such as fault tolerance, security, low latency, and decentralization
    simultaneously poses substantial challenges on scalability and reliability, which
    is one of the primary goals of 6G systems [2], [85]. A novel consensus algorithm
    that offers enhanced reliability and scalability while providing tradeoffs between
    fault tolerance, security, and latency must be proposed to benefit from the deployment
    of blockchain in 6G systems. C. 6G Network-As-An-Intelligent-Service A 5G network
    was envisioned to enable numerous smart services via transformation of network-as-an-infrastructure
    to network-as-a-service. Network-as-a-service offers the use of shared physical
    resources via network slicing to serve different smart services [86]. Network
    slicing uses SDN and NFV as key enablers. SDN offers separation of the control
    plane from the data plane, thus offering efficient network management [87]. NFV
    allows the cost-efficient implementation of different networking functions on
    generic hardware using virtual machines. Although network slicing enables efficient
    resources usage while fulfilling end-user demands, it might not perform well with
    an increase in network heterogeneity and complexity [4].Therefore, network-as-a-service
    must be transformed to network-as-an-intelligent-service. Network intelligentization
    will enable 6G systems to adjust various parameters adaptively, thus offering
    enhanced performance. D. Self-Sustaining 6G Networks A self-organizing (i.e.,
    self-operating) network offers optimization, management, configuration, and planning
    in an efficient, fast manner [88], [89]. Self-organizing network was systematically
    outlined in 3GPP Release 8. However, the traditional self-organizing networking
    scheme might not be feasible for 6G systems due to the presence of a complex,
    dynamic environment. Therefore, a novel, self-sustaining 6G network architecture
    must be proposed [2]. Self-sustaining 6G systems must adapt to the highly dynamic
    environment sustainably. Furthermore, emerging machine learning schemes must be
    used to enable efficient, self-sustainable 6G systems. E. Modeling for Terahertz
    and Millimeter Wave Communication We propose novel models (physical layer and
    networking layer) for millimeter-wave and terahertz bands because of their substantially
    different nature compared with existing lower-frequency bands. For fixed nodes,
    terahertz communication has fewer challenges than mobile nodes [90]. Therefore,
    we must propose novel schemes for terahertz communication in case of mobile nodes.
    Based on the new design models, we can propose an optimization framework to enable
    6G services according to their key performance indicators. F. Zero-Energy-Enabled
    6G We recommend designing zero-energy 6G systems. A 6G wireless communication
    system must use renewable energy and radio-frequency-harvesting energy for its
    operation (i.e., hybrid energy sources). However, energy from the grid station
    must be used when radio frequency harvesting energy level fall below the required
    energy level for their operation. The zero-energy wireless system must return
    the equivalent amount of energy to the grid during the time of excess radio frequency
    harvesting energy to account for the consumed energy from the grid. G. Routing
    Schemes for 6G-Enabled N-IoT and B-IoT N-IoT and B-IoT have a substantially different
    nature compared with traditional IoT. Therefore, novel routing schemes must be
    developed. Routing schemes with low computational complexity and short-range communication
    must be proposed due to limited energy, short-range communication, and low computing
    capabilities of nanonodes and bionodes. Moreover, nanonetworks can operate in
    a terahertz band, thus requiring substantial effort for routing protocol design
    [91]. Therefore, novel routing schemes based on energy-efficient forwarding and
    low computational complexity must be proposed for N-Iot and B-IoT. H. Meta-Learning-Enabled
    6G Machine learning is considered an integral part of 6G. However, training the
    machine learning model by selecting appropriate learning model parameters requires
    extensive experimentation. By contrast, meta learning provides machine learning
    models the capability to learn. However, 6G smart applications enabled by machine
    learning have a substantially different nature. Therefore, we recommend novel
    meta learning models to assist the learning of numerous machine learning models
    by offering them appropriate learning model parameters to enable different 6G
    smart applications. A two-stage meta learning framework can be used to solve different
    machine learning problems in 6G [92]. The first stage can select the machine learning
    model, and the second stage will implement the selected machine learning model.
    SECTION VI. Conclusion We have presented recent advances made toward enabling
    6G wireless systems, proposed a comprehensive taxonomy based on different parameters,
    and presented several open challenges along with important guidelines. We conclude
    that 6G systems will unlock the full potential of smart cities via enabling Internet
    of everything based smart services. AI will be an integral part of the 6G wireless
    system to solve complex network optimization problems. Terahertz communication
    will be considered as one of the key communication bands for 6G systems. It is
    essential to propose novel models for terahertz communication. Furthermore, new
    models must be proposed for quantum communication that is currently in infancy.

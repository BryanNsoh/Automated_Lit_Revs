    \ essential\nfor increasing crop yield and decreasing costs, while contributing\
    \ to environmental sustainability.\nThe intense use of technologies offers a means\
    \ for providing the exact amount of water needed by\nplants. The Internet of Things\

    1. Introduction\nAgriculture is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world,\
    \ amounting to up to 70% of the\ntotal use [1], which makes the case for smart\
    \ water management in order to guarantee water and food\nsecurity to the world’s\
    \ population. Irrigation systems and ﬁeld application methods for the cultivation\n\
    of crops play an important role therein. In an attempt to avoid loss of productivity\
    \ caused by water\nSensors 2019, 19, 276; doi:10.3390/s19020276\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n2 of 20\nstress (under-irrigation), farmers spray more\
    \ water than needed (over-irrigation) and as a result not\nonly productivity is\
    \ challenged but also water and energy are wasted. Precision irrigation, in its\
    \ turn,\ncan use water more efﬁciently and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation\
    \ and over-irrigation.\nThe smart management of water for precision irrigation\
    \ in agriculture is essential for increasing crop\nyield and decreasing costs,\
    \ while at the same time contributing to the environmental sustainability.\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things (IoT) [2] emerges as the natural choice for smart water management\n\
    applications, even though the integration of different technologies required for\
    \ making it work\nseamlessly in practice is still not fully accomplished. The\
    \ emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\nto the conjunction of several factors\
    \ such as inexpensive devices, low-power wireless technologies,\navailability\
    \ of cloud data centers for storage and processing, management frameworks for\
    \ dealing\nwith unstructured data from social networks, high-performance computing\
    \ resources in commodity\nplatforms, and computational intelligence algorithms\
    \ to deal with this monumental amount of data\n(aka big data analytics).\nCurrently,\
    \ there are some challenges to be overcome that still prevent the widespread use\
    \ of\nIoT for precision irrigation. Firstly, software development for IoT-based\
    \ smart applications, such as\nirrigation for agriculture, is not yet fully automatized\
    \ [3]. Secondly, advanced IoT software platforms\nare still missing, for automating\
    \ part of the process and integrating different technologies such as IoT,\nbig\
    \ data analytics, cloud computing and fog computing, for the deployment of pilot\
    \ applications for\nsmart water management. Thirdly, the integration of heterogeneous\
    \ and advanced sensors requires\nadequate standards and information models.\n\
    The SWAMP project developed and assessed an IoT-based smart water management platform\n\
    for precision irrigation in agriculture with a hands-on approach based on four\
    \ pilots in Brazil, Italy\nand Spain [4]. The SWAMP Platform can be conﬁgured\
    \ and deployed in different ways thus making\nup different SWAMP Systems, customized\
    \ to deal with the requirements and constraints of different\nsettings, countries,\
    \ climate, soils, and crops, which requires a good deal of ﬂexibility to adapt\
    \ to a\nrange of deployment conﬁgurations involving a varied mix of technologies.\n\
    This paper presents the SWAMP project, its architecture, platform and pilots,\
    \ as well as a\nscenario-based development process of derived systems. The SWAMP\
    \ layered architecture considers\nthree categories of services to ensure its replication\
    \ and adaptability. Entirely replicable services\ndeal with IoT services, storage\
    \ services, and data analytics and machine learning. Fully customizable\nservices\
    \ deal with water data management issues that specialize generic analytic services\
    \ into particular\ntechniques for different types of irrigation and water distribution.\
    \ Finally, application speciﬁc services\nrequire higher development effort since\
    \ they serve particular farms.\nThe SWAMP Platform contains the mainstream components\
    \ of FIWARE [5] and semantic features\nprovided by a SPARQL-based context engine\
    \ [6]. The platform may be deployed in a range of\ndifferent conﬁgurations for\
    \ component placement in the cloud or in the fog, involving the use of IoT\ncommunication\
    \ technologies and smart algorithms and analytics in the cloud, and fog-based\
    \ smart\ndecisions located on the farm premises. This is aimed at experimenting\
    \ with different deployment\npossibilities of the SWAMP Platform and providing\
    \ additional insights in terms of the replicability\nand adaptability of its components\
    \ to different settings. In other words, experimenting different\ndeployment conﬁgurations\
    \ is an important step for speeding up the learning process on how to deal\nwith\
    \ such a platform.\nAs scalability is a major concern for IoT applications, a\
    \ performance analysis of key software\ncomponents of its FIWARE-powered platform\
    \ was conducted, personalized for each pilot scenario.\nThe results show that\
    \ this platform can deal with the requirements of the pilots, but scalability\
    \ comes\nat a price. It was found that some FIWARE components must be ﬁne-tuned\
    \ to provide improved\nperformance and other ones must be completely re-engineered\
    \ to provide higher scalability using less\ncomputational resources. In addition,\
    \ MongoDB was identiﬁed as the bottleneck of the FIWARE tested\ninstallation that\
    \ may cause system crashes.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n3 of 20\nThe contributions\
    \ of this paper are threefold. Firstly, the SWAMP approach that is the result\
    \ of\na collaborative interdisciplinary project involving researchers and practitioners\
    \ in two continents is\nintroduced. Secondly, different system deployments for\
    \ the SWAMP Platform are presented. Thirdly,\nthe results of a performance analysis\
    \ study that reveals important ﬁndings for the scalability of SWAMP\nIoT Platform\
    \ based on FIWARE are shown.\nIn the remainder of this paper, Section 2 introduces\
    \ background and related work. Section 3\nintroduces SWAMP concepts, while Section\
    \ 4 presents the four pilots and Section 5 details the system\ndeployment scenarios\
    \ for the SWAMP Platform. Section 6 presents performance analysis results\nfocusing\
    \ on scalability of the SWAMP Platform. Section 7 discusses the key ﬁndings and\
    \ results and\nﬁnally Section 8 draws conclusions and future work.\n2. Background\
    \ and Related Work\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no open IoT-based Platform\
    \ speciﬁcally focused on precision\nirrigation for agriculture, so that a clear\
    \ comparison with SWAMP is not possible. On the other\nhand, IoT has many security\
    \ requirements, such as privacy, conﬁdentiality, integrity, authentication,\n\
    authorization and accounting [7], as well as the signiﬁcant challenges posed by\
    \ security threats to the\nsuccess of IoT platforms [8]. However, this is out\
    \ of the scope of this paper.\n2.1. IoT Systems for Precision Irrigation\nCurrent\
    \ open source IoT-based systems for precision irrigation are mostly theoretical\
    \ with limited\nproof of concept experiences. They are either too generic or too\
    \ speciﬁc and do not explicitly address\neasy system deployment for facilitating\
    \ replicability and streamlining the deployment of new systems.\nWhen it comes\
    \ to providing advanced features to water management, there are some isolated\
    \ initiatives\nnot necessarily connected to the existing platforms and architectures.\
    \ For example, the FIGARO project\naims at increasing water productivity and improving\
    \ irrigation practices through the development\nof a precision irrigation management\
    \ platform, but not directly involving IoT [9]. Also, Popovi´c\net al. [10] present\
    \ a case study of a specially designed and currently limited IoT-enabled platform\n\
    for collecting data in precision agriculture and ecological monitoring domains.\
    \ Agri-IoT [11] is a\ntheoretical IoT-based framework for data analytics and real-time\
    \ processing for smart farming that\nshares some similarities with SWAMP.\nIn\
    \ the last years, much has been said about the prospective uses for IoT combined\
    \ with cloud-based\nservices and big data analytics. In Europe, there is a current\
    \ concern to understand the challenges\nand compelling impacts of IoT in large-scale\
    \ pilots for smart agriculture. Brewster et al. discuss the\ndeployment of those\
    \ large-scale pilots for IoT in agriculture and describe technologies and solutions\n\
    that might be present in some agrifood domains, such as dairy, fruit, arable crops\
    \ and meat & vegetable\nsupply chain [12].\nFIWARE has been used as a computing\
    \ platform for many IoT-based applications for smart\nfarming.\nRodriguez et al.\
    \ [13] compiled a short literature review and presented the Agricolus\nplatform\
    \ for precision farming. López-Riquelme et al. presented an implementation of\
    \ FIWARE\nfor a speciﬁc scenario of precision irrigation in agriculture in the\
    \ south of Spain [14], however, it is\nfocused on a speciﬁc use case, providing\
    \ details of devices and equipment, as well as irrigation\ntechniques. In contrast,\
    \ this paper presents an architecture and a platform based on FIWARE, as well\n\
    as conﬁgurations for system deployments in four scenarios.\nFog computing is a\
    \ fairly new paradigm aimed at dealing with challenges related to the huge\namount\
    \ of data that will be generated with the increasing utilization of IoT-based\
    \ systems [15].\nA new technological trend to implement the fog is container-based\
    \ virtualization, which provides a\nlightweight alternative to traditional hypervisors\
    \ [16]. FIWARE Generic Enablers are also distributed\nas Docker containers in\
    \ order to be used in the SWAMP fog computing approach.\nFogFlow\nprovides a programming\
    \ model for IoT-based applications for smart cities distributed over the cloud\n\
    and the fog located in the network edge [17]. Even though FogFlow is integrated\
    \ into FIWARE,\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n4 of 20\nthe SWAMP project takes a clean\
    \ approach and uses directly the components provided by FIWARE,\nin combination\
    \ with new components developed speciﬁcally for the SWAMP precision agriculture\n\
    scenarios whenever needed.\n2.2. The FIWARE Platform\nFIWARE [5] has been attracting\
    \ general attention for being an open source EU-funded solution,\ncomprised of\
    \ a series of software components called Generic Enablers (GE) that perform functions\n\
    needed in IoT-based smart applications. GEs can be used to build different applications\
    \ that exchange\ninformation through a REST API following the OMA NGSI [18] standard\
    \ based on JSON. The central\naspect of the FIWARE NGSI Context Management information\
    \ model is the concept of entities and\ntheir attributes. There has been an ongoing\
    \ effort to develop a Context Information Management API\nbased on recent advances\
    \ in Linked Data (LD) [19] based on JSON-LD called NGSI-LD, deﬁned in\nRDF (Resource\
    \ Description Framework) [20]. Both NGSI and NGSI-LD are currently supported by\n\
    FIWARE, even though the NGSI-LD speciﬁcation is preliminary [21].\nSome FIWARE\
    \ GEs are considered key enablers, such as:\n•\nOrion: A publish/subscribe context\
    \ broker, considered the heart of FIWARE. Orion only stores\nthe latest version\
    \ of entity attributes and it needs to work together with other applications in\n\
    order to maintain historical data.\n•\nIoT Agent: Maps data coming from sensors\
    \ and going to actuators to the FIWARE NGSI information\nmodel to be stored in\
    \ Orion and further processed by other GEs or external applications.\n•\nQuantum\
    \ Leap: New GE that preserves Orion NGSI historical entity data as times series,\
    \ replacing\nthe old and less scalable STH Comet.\n•\nCygnus: A data processing\
    \ and distribution system for applications that require more elaborate\ndata ﬂow\
    \ management than simple historical data.\n•\nCosmos: A set of tools that interface\
    \ with popular Big Data Platforms.\nIt has been shown that different architectural\
    \ choices of IoT platforms affect system scalability\nand that automatic real-time\
    \ decision-making is feasible in an environment composed of dozens\nof thousands\
    \ of sensors continuously transmitting data [22]. Cruz et al. present a comprehensive\n\
    study that proposes qualitative and quantitative metrics and evaluates the performance\
    \ of various\nIoT platforms [23]. They did not focus on speciﬁc features of FIWARE\
    \ and did not evaluate different\nscenarios and infrastructures, such as fog computing.\
    \ Martínez et al. [24] give a detailed description\nof the architecture of a testbed\
    \ of the FIWARE platform conﬁgured for the precision agriculture\ndomain. It differs\
    \ from our approach because their test application connects directly to FIWARE\
    \ using\nNGSI JSON interface, while this paper uses an IoT Agent for MQTT and\
    \ an IoT sensor simulator for\ngenerating synthetic data.\nA preliminary performance\
    \ analysis of FIWARE for SWAMP revealed that fog computing does\nnot always improve\
    \ the overall system performance and can even make it worse [25]. This paper\n\
    differs from previous work as it evaluates different conﬁgurations of FIWARE and\
    \ its focus is on the\nscenarios of smart irrigation in agriculture deﬁned for\
    \ the SWAMP project.\n2.3. The SEPA Platform\nThe SPARQL Event Processing Architecture\
    \ (SEPA) [6] enables the detection and communication\nof data changes for the\
    \ Semantic Web of Things [26]. SEPA is based upon W3C SPARQL 1.1 [27],\na RDF\
    \ query language, where publishers and subscribers exchange data. The SEPA framework\n\
    offers developers a solution for implementing Dynamic Linked Data applications\
    \ and services.\nLinked Data refers to a set of best practices for publishing\
    \ and connecting structured data on\nthe Web [18]. Dynamic aspects of Linked Data\
    \ involve discovery, granularity level, description\nof changes, detection algorithms,\
    \ and notiﬁcation mechanisms. The SEPA broker is the core element\nof the architecture,\
    \ implementing a content-based publish-subscribe mechanism where publishers\n\
    Sensors 2019, 19, 276\n5 of 20\nuse SPARQL 1.1 Updates to generate events and\
    \ subscribers use SPARQL 1.1 Queries to subscribe to\nevents. The latter receives\
    \ SPARQL query results and subsequent notiﬁcations generated by changes\nin the\
    \ RDF knowledge base are expressed in terms of added and removed query results\
    \ since the\nprevious notiﬁcation.\n3. SWAMP: Concept and Overview\nThe SWAMP\
    \ project is developing a high-precision smart irrigation system concept for agriculture.\n\
    Within SWAMP, water management for agriculture is partitioned into three phases:\
    \ water reserve,\nwater distribution and water consumption. For Water Consumption\
    \ SWAMP provides real-time\nresponses for adapting irrigation as crop conditions\
    \ change. On the other hand, changes in water\ndistribution are performed in a\
    \ longer timescale. Distribution and Consumption management systems\nare integrated,\
    \ as water usage triggers water distribution. The management of water reserves\
    \ is\nnot considered.\nThe SWAMP Architecture is divided into ﬁve layers, as depicted\
    \ by Figure 1.\nSensors 2019, 19, x FOR PEER REVIEW \n6 of 21 \n \nFigure 1. SWAMP\
    \ Layered Architecture. \nDifferent layers of the architecture are comprised of\
    \ more generic components that are more \nprone to be ported to other settings,\
    \ whereas others are more application-specific and thus porting \nrequires new\
    \ development efforts. When it comes to the generality/specificity scale, the\
    \ SWAMP \narchitecture provides three categories of components: (a) Fully Replicable\
    \ Services: Layers 1, 2 and 3 \nof the architecture are generic enough to allow\
    \ them to be replicable in different settings; (b) Fully \nCustomizable Services:\
    \ Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the final application and therefore\
    \ \nmust be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques\
    \ and models of water \ndistribution and irrigation, which may require customization\
    \ for every new deployment; (c) \nApplication Specific Services: Services in Layer\
    \ 5 address particularities of pilots. \n4. SWAMP Pilots \n4.1. MATOPIBA Pilot\
    \ (Luís Eduardo Magalhães—Brazil) \nThe MATOPIBA region encompasses the Brazilian\
    \ states of Maranhão (MA), Tocantins (TO), \nPiauí (PI) and Bahia (BA), and is\
    \ one of the most critical irrigated agriculture frontiers in the country, \n\
    located in the cerrado, a savannah climate subtype. Typical crops are soybeans,\
    \ corn and cotton \nwhere irrigation is mostly performed by center pivots. Figure\
    \ 2 depicts the map of Northeastern \nBrazil showing the precise location of the\
    \ pilot in the municipality of Luís Eduardo Magalhães (a), \nFigure 1. SWAMP Layered\
    \ Architecture.\n•\nLayer 1: Device & Communication: a variety of sensor and actuator\
    \ technologies to acquire soil\n(e.g., moisture), plant (e.g., growing stage)\
    \ and weather (e.g., air temperature), as well as LPWAN\ncommunication technologies\
    \ (e.g., LoRaWAN [28]) are abstracted in this layer. The SWAMP pilots\nuse commercial\
    \ sensors as well as a homemade multiparametric sensor probe. Also, commercial\n\
    drones have been used to take images but a speciﬁc drone is under development\
    \ since one of\nthe partners is a drone maker. A complete description of the sensing\
    \ infrastructure is outside the\nscope of this paper.\n•\nLayer 2: Data Acquisition,\
    \ Security & Management: protocols and software components for\ndata acquisition\
    \ (e.g., MQTT [29] and LoRa Server [30]) are the key characteristic of this layer,\n\
    in addition to security and device management functions. The FIWARE IoT Agent\
    \ GE also belongs\nto this layer as it translates the internal FIWARE data representation\
    \ in JSON from/to devices.\n•\nLayer 3: Data Management: contains software components\
    \ in charge of data storage, processing\nand distribution based on FIWARE GEs\
    \ (Orion, QuantumLeap, Cygnus and Cosmos) and SEPA\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n6 of\
    \ 20\nSPARQL engine. A mapper between FIWARE JSON NGSI and SEPA RDF data models\
    \ also belong\nto this layer, as well as a mapper from external data sources,\
    \ such as historical agriculture yield\ndatabases and weather forecast services.\
    \ A distributed infrastructure composed of cloud servers\nand fog nodes work together\
    \ for dealing with massive amounts of data and make it available to\nthe upper\
    \ layers.\n•\nLayer 4: Water Irrigation & Distribution Models: traditional agriculture\
    \ models for estimating\nplant water needs using images generated by drones (crop-based\
    \ approach) and using soil sensors\nfor determining soil moisture (soil-based\
    \ approach) belong to this layer. Optimization models and\ntechniques for water\
    \ distribution based on plant water needs are essential whenever collective\n\
    networks replace individual water sources. Also, computational intelligence (e.g.,\
    \ machine\nlearning) works together with traditional models or in place of them.\n\
    •\nLayer 5: Water Application Services: irrigation services that make sense to\
    \ farmers and water\ndistributors via user interfaces.\nDifferent layers of the\
    \ architecture are comprised of more generic components that are more\nprone to\
    \ be ported to other settings, whereas others are more application-speciﬁc and\
    \ thus porting\nrequires new development efforts. When it comes to the generality/speciﬁcity\
    \ scale, the SWAMP\narchitecture provides three categories of components: (a)\
    \ Fully Replicable Services: Layers 1, 2\nand 3 of the architecture are generic\
    \ enough to allow them to be replicable in different settings;\n(b) Fully Customizable\
    \ Services: Layer 4 provides services that are closer to the ﬁnal application\n\
    and therefore must be aware of a level of detail that may vary for different techniques\
    \ and models\nof water distribution and irrigation, which may require customization\
    \ for every new deployment;\n(c) Application Speciﬁc Services: Services in Layer\

    \ useful to make a clear distinction between the SWAMP Platform and a SWAMP System.\n\
    The platform is a set of generic components depicted in Figure 1, used to build\
    \ SWAMP Systems.\nWhereas there is only one SWAMP Platform, each pilot requires\
    \ a system to be deployed to fulﬁll its\nspeciﬁc needs of irrigation or water\
    \ distribution. Generic components, mainly those from the lower\nSensors 2019,\

    \ be deployed in different ways in any system.\nOn the other hand, speciﬁc components\
    \ such as user interfaces belong to the system.\n5.1. SWAMP Baseline Scenario\n\
    Figure 6 depicts a baseline deployment scenario for the SWAMP platform that includes\
    \ three\nkey components, which are the SWAMP Cloud, the SWAMP Fog Hub and SWAMP\
    \ Field Fog Node.\nThis scenario represents the most complete and distributed\
    \ version of the SWAMP Platform, which is\nnot necessarily deployed as is in the\
    \ four pilots. For example, a fog infrastructure is not necessary in\nevery system\
    \ deployment of the SWAMP platform.\n \nkey components, which are the SWAMP Cloud,\
    \ the SWAMP Fog Hub and SWAMP Field Fog Node. \nThis scenario represents the most\
    \ complete and distributed version of the SWAMP Platform, which \nis not necessarily\
    \ deployed as is in the four pilots. For example, a fog infrastructure is not\
    \ necessary \nin every system deployment of the SWAMP platform. \nFigure 6 also\
    \ highlights a hierarchical organization of the fog, divided into Fog Field Nodes\
    \ \n(FFN) and a Fog Hub in the farm office. A FFN has a stable power source and\
    \ provides data \ntransmission, storage and processing capabilities to the sensors\
    \ spread in a farm plot, i.e., behaving \nas an aggregation point for LPWAN devices\
    \ [28]. Irrigation systems like the center pivot can host a \nFFN or even drones.\
    \ Its implementation may be as simple as a LoRaWAN Gateway that forwards \ndata\
    \ to the Fog Hub or may include storage and processing. \nThe role played by the\
    \ Fog Hub may also vary depending on farmer’s requirements of \nrobustness to\
    \ Internet disconnections, which may be frequent in agriculture frontiers. The\
    \ \nfunctionalities provided by a Fog Hub may vary from a sensor aggregation point\
    \ to a full-fledged \nmini cloud data center if farmers are willing to have full\
    \ control of their irrigation systems. The \nSWAMP Cloud stores and processes\
    \ data and smart algorithms are based on existing agriculture \nmodels and on\
    \ novel computational intelligence techniques, such as machine learning. \n \n\

    \ pilot has to deal with \ncommunication instability, distance from the farm office\
    \ to the center pivot, and even distance from \nFigure 6. SWAMP Baseline Scenario\

    \ from the farm to\nthe nearest downtown area A center pivot irrigates a circular\
    \ agricultural plot of 100 hectares that\nalternates soybeans and cotton and the\
    \ plot is further divided into different management zones based\non differences\
    \ in the soil properties. The center pivot controls the variable rate irrigation\
    \ sprinklers\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n10 of 20\n(actuators). The authors developed\
    \ multiparametric probes for soil sensing, which include moisture,\ntemperature\
    \ and electrical conductivity sensors at three depths. In intensive agriculture\
    \ areas the plan\nis also to experiment ultra-low-power wireless sensor solutions\
    \ based on wake-up radios combined\nwith LoRaWAN [32].\nFigure 7 depicts the MATOPIBA\
    \ scenario where cloud and fog software components of the\nSWAMP Platform are\
    \ based on the SWAMP architecture (Figure 1). In order to represent different\n\
    system deployment possibilities, the picture shows two plots, where the topmost\
    \ plot uses a Field Fog\nNode (FFN) to aggregate sensor data and the bottommost\
    \ plot represents the sensors sending data\ndirectly to the Fog Hub. Currently,\
    \ both alternatives are under consideration but only one will be used\nin the\
    \ ﬁnal version of the pilot scenario.\n \nIn its simplest possible implementation,\
    \ the Field Fog Node only contains a LoRaWAN \ngateway. On the other hand, the\
    \ complexity of the communication and processing of sensor data is \ndealt with\
    \ by the Fog Hub. A LoRaWAN Gateway (located either in the FFN or in the Fog Hub)\
    \ \nforwards sensor data via a Mosquitto MQTT Broker [33] to a LoRa Server that\
    \ in turn sends the data \nto the FIWARE IoT Agent. The IoT Agent converts the\
    \ data format into NGSI, which goes to \nFIWARE Orion Context Broker. FIWARE Quantum\
    \ Leap is needed for different applications, such \nas the User Interface and\
    \ the Drone Platform. Also, a lightweight Fog Analytics component based on \n\
    simpler statistical techniques is used for computing the irrigation prescription\
    \ map whenever the \nInternet connection with the cloud is not available. \nThe\
    \ Cloud is represented with its essential components, which include a FIWARE central\

    \ in the pilot.\nSimilarly to the Intercrop Scenario (Figure 9), there is no Fog\
    \ Hub and its functions are handed\nover to the Field Fog Nodes (FFN) and the\
    \ Cloud. The FFN has a simpler architecture compared to the\nIntercrop scenario,\
    \ where the LoRa Server is placed in the cloud, rather than in the FFN. Additionally,\n\
    in this scenario FIWARE components are combined with SEPA SPARQL-based semantic\
    \ engine that\nrepresents information in the RDF format and provides contextual\
    \ semantic queries. In FIWARE the\ncontext is established as an entity deﬁned\
    \ in JSON NGSI format, whereas in SEPA the context is a\nsemantic query. While\
    \ FIWARE Orion Context Broker notiﬁes all subscribers whenever an entity is\n\
    changed by a publisher, the SEPA engine notiﬁes subscribers whenever the results\
    \ of a semantic query\nis changed, which is more powerful than a single entity.\n\
    Figure 10 depicts the FIWARE components already described, along with the SEPA\
    \ SPARQL\nEngine, an NGSI-LD/RDF Mapper and two additional applications, the Water\
    \ Distribution User\nInterface and the Water Distribution Optimization Models.\
    \ Orion keeps its role as the data distribution\ncenter of the platform but the\
    \ NGSI-LD (Linked Data) semantic format must be converted to the\nSEPA RDF format\

    \ (1) SenSE generates\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n15 of 20\nsensor data and sends\

    \ Consumer; (4) Consumer receives data\nfrom Orion and computes the elapsed time\
    \ since it was generated by SenSE (a timestamp is embedded\nin the message and\
    \ physical machines are synchronized by NTP). For the MATOPIBA scenario, there\
    \ is\nan additional step, because of the cascading Orion solution, where the Cloud\
    \ Orion has to subscribe to\nthe fog Orion and the messages are then transferred\
    \ from one to the other.\nA lab testbed emulated the scenario for the experiments.\
    \ Both fog and cloud were implemented\nusing virtual machines (VM) in OpenStack.\
    \ The following standard Amazon AWS VM conﬁgurations\nwere deployed: cloud VM\
    \ equivalent to a t2.medium instance (2vCPU—4 GB of RAM) and the fog VMs\n(both\
    \ fog ﬁeld node and fog hub) equivalent to a t2.small instance (1vCPU—2 GB RAM).\
    \ The cloud\nwas composed of 6 VMs. Two different physical machines were used,\
    \ with the following conﬁguration:\nIntel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E3-1240 V2 @ 3.40 GHz—8\
    \ cores and 8 GB of RAM.\nThree categories of metrics were used in the reported\
    \ experiments:\n•\nApplication metric: The elapsed time is the average time taken\
    \ since a sensor data point is\ngenerated by SenSE until the Consumer receives\
    \ it. This metric represents how long it takes for\nsensor data to be available\
    \ to any subscribed application.\n•\nSystem metrics: CPU and RAM usage per Docker\
    \ container, which allows observing each\napplication, collected every 5 s.\n\
    •\nExperiment metrics: The duration of the experiment given by the number of replications\
    \ (because\nsome components crashed after some time) and the number of received\
    \ messages are used to\nunderstand how experiments unfolded.\nThe experiments\
    \ involved a large number of sensors, sending data every 10 min. The scenarios\n\
    were executed with four different workloads determined by the number of sensors\
    \ sending messages\nsimultaneously. For the MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios,\
    \ 1000, 5000, 10,000 and\n15,000 sensors were used. For the CBEC scenario, as\
    \ depicted by Figure 11d, the workload was tripled,\ntotaling 3000, 15,000, 30,000\
    \ and 45,000 sensors. Each experiment took 1 min and was replicated\n30 times,\
    \ totalizing 16 h of running experiments. Asymptotic conﬁdence intervals were\
    \ calculated\nwith a 99% conﬁdence level.\nThe conﬁguration of WANem captured\
    \ characteristics of a connection from a farm to a cloud\nbased on a simple experiment\
    \ that obtained the network parameters by pinging a public cloud using a\n4G connection,\
    \ which resulted in a connection of 10 Mbps with 45 ms of delay and 5 ms of jitter.\n\
    6.2. Results\nFigure 12 depicts the main scalability results according to the\
    \ elapsed time metric and following\nthe methodology described above. MATOPIBA,\
    \ Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios are shown in\nFigure 12a and Table 1 and CBEC\
    \ scenario in Figure 12b. These results highlight important observations\nand\
    \ ﬁndings:\n•\nScalability limits: For MATOPIBA, Guaspari and Intercrop scenarios\
    \ the viable workload goes\nup to 10,000 sensors transmitting packets every 10\
    \ min (Figure 12a) where an elapsed time less\nthan 1 s was observed. Under a\
    \ workload of 15,000 sensors, Table 1 shows that the elapsed time\nincreases to\
    \ dozens of seconds with a high variation.\n•\nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari\
    \ and Intercrop scenario yield very similar results for\nthe elapsed time, which\
    \ reveals that from a performance point of view there is no signiﬁcant\ndifference\
    \ if the MQTT Broker is placed in the fog or in the cloud.\n•\nCascading Orion:\
    \ The elapsed time is higher for the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and\nIntercrop,\
    \ caused by the two cascading Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, according\n\
    to Figure 11a. Whenever Orion receives a message it notiﬁes all subscribers of\
    \ the involved entity.\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n16 of 20\nIn this scenario, the\
    \ cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means that in order for\
    \ the\nSubscriber to receive a message, it passes through two Orion notiﬁcation\
    \ steps, which is causing\nthe additional delay (up to one second with 10,000\
    \ sensors) and larger conﬁdence interval.\n•\nDivide and conquer: The CBEC scenario\
    \ has three farms represented by three SenSE trafﬁc\ngenerators in Figure 11d.\n\
    In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm (which gives\n45,000 sensors),\
    \ the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the cloud, each one in a new VM\nand\
    \ using a separate MongoDB instance. That solution increased the scalability for\
    \ the CBEC\nscenario, which were able not only to deal with 15,000 (which is not\
    \ viable in the other three\nscenarios), but also up to 45,000 sensors.\n \n\
    \ \nLightweight fog = no fog: The Guaspari and Intercrop scenario yield very similar\
    \ results for the \nelapsed time, which reveals that from a performance point\
    \ of view there is no significant \ndifference if the MQTT Broker is placed in\
    \ the fog or in the cloud. \n \nCascading Orion: The elapsed time is higher for\
    \ the MATOPIBA compared to the Guaspari and \nIntercrop, caused by the two cascading\
    \ Orion components, in the fog and in the cloud, \naccording to Figure 11a. Whenever\
    \ Orion receives a message it notifies all subscribers of the \ninvolved entity.\
    \ In this scenario, the cloud Orion is a subscriber to the fog Orion, which means\
    \ \nthat in order for the Subscriber to receive a message, it passes through two\
    \ Orion notification \nsteps, which is causing the additional delay (up to one\
    \ second with 10,000 sensors) and larger \nconfidence interval. \n \nDivide and\
    \ conquer: The CBEC scenario has three farms represented by three SenSE traffic\
    \ \ngenerators in Figure 11d. In order to scale up to 15,000 sensors per farm\
    \ (which gives 45,000 \nsensors), the IoT Agent needed to be replicated in the\

    \ increased the scalability for the CBEC scenario, \nwhich were able not only\

    \ and information model:\nAdaptability: The platform must be ﬂexible enough to\
    \ adapt to different scenarios while keeping\nthe human effort at a minimum level.\
    \ As shown in this paper, the four SWAMP pilots provide\nenough diversity to assist\
    \ us in understanding the levels of generality and speciﬁcity to be provided\n\
    by different software components. Initially we identiﬁed three levels of components\
    \ regarding a\ngenerality/speciﬁcity scale (fully replicable, fully customizable\
    \ and application-speciﬁc) and intuitively\nplaced them in relevant layers of\
    \ the architecture. However, experience shows new tradeoffs, such as\nthe generality\
    \ of a component for collecting sensor data, like the FIWARE IoT Agent, which\
    \ must deal\nwith different combinations of data formats of sensors and wireless\
    \ technologies.\nDeployment: A variety of factors inﬂuence the design choices\
    \ for deployment alternatives of\nvarious fog/cloud conﬁguration scenarios: (a)\
    \ the stability and robustness of the Internet connection\nin the farm area, which\
    \ in some cases faces frequent disconnections that must be dealt with, such as\
    \ in\nthe Brazilian MATOPIBA pilot; (b) the availability of resources and interest\
    \ of farmers in maintaining\nan in-house fog-based IoT system in operation with\
    \ associated service level guarantees similar to a\ncloud environment, compared\
    \ to the disruptions caused by cloud intermittent access; (c) the capacity\nand\
    \ dependability of the fog nodes; (d) the use of LPWAN technologies for collecting\
    \ sensor data\nthat might require some minimum farm level infrastructure, such\
    \ as LoRaWAN, or relying on some\nyet-to-be-deployed or limited coverage public\
    \ service, such as NB-IoT or Sigfox [28]. There is no\n“one size ﬁts all” in IoT\
    \ systems for precision irrigation, which makes the case for ﬁnding different\
    \ ways\nof conﬁguring and connecting software components in cloud- and fog-based\
    \ deployments. The need\nSensors 2019, 19, 276\n18 of 20\nfor an automated mechanism\
    \ for system deployment, given different requirements, infrastructures\nand constraints\
    \ was identiﬁed and it is currently handled within the project, but this is out\
    \ of the scope\nof this paper.\nScalability: Currently, most open IoT-based systems\
    \ that report results are proof-of-concept\npilots or small-scale IoT-based services.\
    \ Currently there is no de facto IoT Platform even though\nthere are many candidates,\
    \ including commercial solutions such as Amazon AWS IoT and Google\nCloud IoT.\
    \ FIWARE was adopted as the underlying IoT platform for the most common functions\n\
    of data distribution and storage. However, as our performance analysis revealed,\
    \ FIWARE still\nneeds signiﬁcant improvements to become a scalable solution for\
    \ extreme scenarios with heavy data\ngeneration. For example, the CBEC consortium\
    \ provides irrigation water for about 5000 farms and in\norder for the optimization\
    \ of water distribution to succeed they will need everything to be dealt with\n\
    by a single platform. For sure these large scenarios will require a considerable\
    \ number of devices that\nwill stress the platform even more than our experiments.\n\
    Complexity: There is a tradeoff in terms of dealing with complexity when it comes\
    \ to developing\nIoT-based applications. The approach taken in the CBEC scenario\
    \ is based on a hybrid solution that\ncombines a FIWARE-enabled context broker\
    \ and a semantic engine based on the linked data ontology\nmodel. While FIWARE\
    \ Orion Context Broker notiﬁes all subscribers whenever an entity is changed by\n\
    a publisher, the SEPA engine notiﬁes subscribers whenever the results of a semantic\
    \ query is changed,\nwhich is more powerful than a single entity. This conﬁguration\
    \ of the SWAMP Platform allows us to\ncompare a solution where the context broker\
    \ is simpler and the complexity dwells in the applications\n(FIWARE) to a solution\
    \ where the context broker is more complex and thus the applications can be\n\
    simpler (SEPA).\n8. Conclusions\nThe emergence of IoT is a phenomenon that owes\
    \ to the conjunction of several factors and now\nstarts to become real with huge\
    \ effort both in research and business areas. In this context, the SWAMP\nproject\
    \ develops IoT-based methods for smart water management in precision irrigation,\
    \ and pilots\nthem in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. This paper introduced the SWAMP\
    \ architecture, pilots and deployment\nscenarios for the four pilots using FIWARE\
    \ as the underlying IoT platform.\nA performance analysis of key FIWARE components\
    \ personalized for each SWAMP pilot scenario\nwas undertaken to understand the\
    \ scalability limits of the system. The results show that this platform\nmight\
    \ be able to deal with the performance requirements of our pilots, even though\
    \ requiring specially\ndesigned deployment conﬁgurations and the re-engineering\
    \ of some components to provide higher\nscalability using less computational resources.\
    \ Particularly, our experiments showed that MongoDB is\nCPU greedy, which negatively\
    \ impacts system performance.\nSWAMP is an ongoing project and therefore there\
    \ are multiple paths for future work. Some\nexamples are improving the platform\
    \ deployment scenarios, reporting the overall working of the\nSWAMP approach in\
    \ the pilots, including the experience with irrigation models and analytics and\n\
    more advanced performance analysis.\nAuthor Contributions: SWAMP is a collaborative\
    \ project and therefore concepts, architecture, platform, pilots\nand deployment\

    impulse towards a larger introduction of Information and Communication Technology
    (ICT) in the agricultural field is currently experiencing its momentum, as digitisation
    has large potentialities to provide benefits for both producers and consumers;
    on the other hand, pushing technological solutions into a rural context encounters
    several challenges. In this work, we provide a survey of the most recent research
    activities, in the form of both research projects and scientific literature, with
    the objective of showing the already achieved results, the current investigations,
    and the still open challenges, both technical and non technical. We mainly focus
    on the EU territory, identifying threats and concerns, and then looking at existing
    and upcoming solutions to overcome those barriers. Previous article in issue Next

    computing5GSatelliteUAV 1. Introduction Smart Farming (SF) refers to the application
    of ICT to agriculture. Data collected and analysed through ICT techniques support
    efficient production processes [1], thus motivating scientists, practitioners,
    private and public companies to work towards the goal of developing and encouraging
    the use of innovative technologies to support farmers on the ground. According
    to the European Union (EU), the most relevant technologies and techniques to be
    fully exploited are the satellite imagery, the use of agricultural robots, a larger
    use of sensor nodes to collect data, and the potentialities of Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicles (UAVs) for aerial imagery and actuation. Those indications are contained
    into the declaration of cooperation on A smart and sustainable digital future
    for European agriculture and rural areas1 signed on April 2019 by 24 EU countries.
    According to the aforementioned declaration, the first obstacle towards a full
    implementation of SF in rural areas is the lack of connectivity, i.e., digital
    divide. The advent of 5G is promising to improve such a situation in rural and
    low-income areas [2], but scattered coverage must be still taken into account,
    as highlighted in recent surveys in the EU territory [3]. Rural areas remain challenging,
    not being covered by any Next Generation Access network: up to 53% at the end
    of 2017 in EU [3]. Putting this issue aside, a plethora of initiatives can be
    identified towards the objective of the digitisation of agriculture. As an exemplary
    case, Smart AKIS, an EU-funded thematic network promoted by the Agricultural European
    Innovation Partnership (EIP-AGRI) established in 2016, aims to close the gap between
    scientific knowledge and practitioners, in order to promote concrete solutions
    to be implemented. A solution can be defined as anything that makes the farming
    practice more controlled and accurate through ICT, reducing both the costs and
    the environmental impact, while also increasing the production. SF has the potential
    to also improve work safety, contributing to the sustainability of agriculture
    [1], but its socio-economic implications are debated [4]. In this innovative approach
    of farm management, a key component is the use of hardware and software technologies,
    like the deploying of sensor nodes, control systems, robotics, satellites for
    imagery and positioning, data storage and analysis, advisory systems, and terrestrial
    and aerial drones. However, the aim of SF should not be just in industrializing
    agriculture, but in making the whole process more efficient, sustainable, and
    of high quality, while respecting farmers’ needs. SF dates back to the middle
    of the 80’s, but it has been practiced commercially only since the 90’s [5]. However,
    many farmers are still skeptical about the actual advantages it can offer. This
    can be explained by considering the profit and the direct benefits for the farm.
    In fact, it is not straightforward to identify those [6], for instance when considering
    Capital Expenditures (CAPEX) and Operating Expenditures (OPEX) for software, machinery,
    and data. Farmers generally tend to identify SF as a set of tools that benefits
    only large holdings, both in crop and livestock production. This is linked to
    the perception of high costs and complexity of the involved technologies. What
    is lacking from this image is the possibility that innovative technologies might
    not be only large-scale and thus costly, but rather also slow and precise, plus
    small and cheap [7]. Nowadays, SF is rapidly taking advantage of recent technological
    advancements for improving agricultural practices [8], further than business models
    for lowering adoption costs. For instance, rental programs for farming equipment,
    like Trringo in India, make possible farm mechanization processes with affordable
    costs for farmers, also providing support services. Such an initiative can be
    categorised as cooperative farming, potentially increasing the penetration of
    SF in low-income areas. Karnott, a French company, is pushing both web services
    and hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready one. Karnott
    sells a control unit to be installed on agricultural machines, offering several
    services through a battery-powered device, collecting and exchanging real-time
    data, as well as geolocation. Then, collected data can be exploited through on-line
    services, like those provided by api-agro, a secure platform to share data. Available
    data can be accessed and fed to different management systems, thus offering a
    valuable repository for farms. Taranis offers a platform using aerial and satellite
    imagery joint with Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to provide a Decision
    Support System (DSS) for Precision Farming (PF) applications. AgriOpenData provides
    a DSS as well, exploiting blockchain, UAVs, and adding support services on top
    of it. When considering fully autonomous solutions, Iron Ox offers a complete
    robotic solution to grow plants, from seeds to harvest, with a hydroponic system
    able to strongly reduce the water consumption. At last, traceability is experiencing
    a revolution thanks to digital ledgers. Even if it cannot be considered immediately
    within the umbrella of SF, still the origin and the quality of agricultural products
    remains a central issue. Carrefour, a French multinational retailer, is betting
    on blockchain as a solution to provide trustable data to consumers and intermediate
    actors. Blockchain is used by Hectare Agritech in a farm trading platform as well,
    highlighting how innovative paradigms can be adapted to different use cases in
    the agricultural field. The aim of this work is to survey both research initiatives
    and scientific literature on the topic of SF, looking at recent technologies and
    techniques being used or being actively pushed for adoption. In addition, we discuss
    still open challenges hampering such an objective. The rest of this work is structured
    as follows: Section 2 surveys research and innovation projects covering SF activities
    in the EU territory, then the scope of the survey is enlarged by taking into account
    the state of the art in the scientific literature. Section 3 discusses the open
    challenges at today, considering both technical and non-technical factors. Finally,
    Section 4 draws the conclusions and opens to future directions. 2. State of the
    art This section provides two main contributions. The first one is in Section
    2.1, surveying relevant research projects recently funded by the EU in the field
    of SF; the aim is to highlight the increasing attention towards those activities,
    and then to identify the involved technologies. Table 1 provides an overview of
    surveyed R&I projects. Furthermore, Fig. 1 depicts relevant agricultural operations
    as faced by the described research projects, and the technological solutions exploited
    in the latter ones. The second contribution is in Section 2.2, surveying the scientific
    works that propose solutions for the implementation of SF. Table 2 provides an
    overview of surveyed literature, then a keyword analysis is proposed in Fig. 2.

    2. Number of occurrences of relevant keywords (at least 50) as they appear in
    the surveyed literature: the 4 categories, as proposed in Table 2, can be read
    internally, and each keyword is weighted (circle radius) in the cluster it belongs
    to. 2.1. EU research projects In last years, the EU has been actively undertaking
    R&I activities laying the ground for the digitisation of agriculture by exploiting
    data-empowered strategies; strategic interventions have been funded to support
    the uptake of digital technologies, to develop new digital solutions and to sustain
    the crucial assessment of the socio-economic impacts of digitisation. In Table
    1, 30 recent EU projects closely related to SF are presented: the first 21 projects,
    spanning from 2015 to 2019, propose, develop, and test the use of digital technologies
    in this field; the 9 projects in the last rows, spanning from 2012 to 2019, have
    the complementary objective of strengthen or evaluate the use of ICT in agriculture,
    for instance through challenge-based strategies, or by setting up marketplaces
    to browse existing solutions ready for use. Most projects jointly exploit multiple
    techniques and technologies; here, we highlight only the most prominent ones.
    2.1.1. Cloud/edge-based systems Cloud platforms are mainly exploited in projects
    that are related to monitoring activities, like growth of plants, water availability,
    soil moisture maps, and so on. There is a clear dominance of cloud solutions with
    respect to those based on edge solutions, because the former is a more established
    option than the latter. The AgriCloud P2 project proposed a cloud-based PF management
    system for a sustainable and intensive agriculture to secure long-term food supply
    in Europe. The APMAV project consists of an intuitive solution for agricultural
    management based on UAV technology and an intelligent cloud-based platform that
    provides farmers valuable, actionable and real-time recommendations for driving
    down costs and improving crop performance. The Flourish project leverages UAVs
    as well, aiming at surveying a field from the air, then at performing a targeted
    intervention on the ground with an Unmanned Terrestrial Vehicle (UTV). The idea
    is to provide a DSS requiring minimal user intervention to target PF applications.
    The SWAMP project develops Internet of Things (IoT)-based methods and approaches
    for smart water management in the precision irrigation domain, in order to utilize
    water more efficiently and effectively, avoiding both under- and over-irrigation.
    The AfriCultuReS project, beyond the use of cloud-based technology, also exploits
    the data collected from different sources (e.g. service providers, weather services)
    to develop an integrated agricultural monitoring and early warning system, based
    on remote sensing, to support decision making. The DataBio project makes intensive
    use of big data techniques related to the raw material production from agriculture,
    forestry, fishery and aquaculture for the production of food, energy, and biomaterials
    in a sustainable way, by means of a software platform integrating big data and
    Earth Observation (EO) methods. Data-driven activities are also proposed in the
    just started Dragon project, whose main efforts are directed towards skill transfers
    to ease PF adoption. Large heterogeneous data sources are considered and analysed
    to offer agricultural knowledge and information systems by ambitiously leveraging
    several techniques. The BigDataGrapes project makes use of big data techniques
    in the context of viticulture, supporting decisions by exploiting real-time analysis
    of large, diverse and multimodal data sources. It has been exploiting the use
    of UAVs as well in vineyards. Last but not least, the IoF2020 project is one of
    the most comprehensive projects from the point of view of SF digital technologies:
    in particular, this project accelerates the adoption of IoT, in order to secure
    sufficient, safe and healthy food and at strengthening competitiveness of farming
    and food chains in Europe. A large scale pilot programme has been started in IoF2020
    to develop and test specific technological solutions in the following sectors:
    arable, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and meat. 2.1.2. Unmanned vehicles The use
    of unmanned vehicles is another trend of great interest. Beyond the aforementioned
    Flourish, APMAV, BigDataGrapes, and Dragon projects, the PANTHEON project, by
    taking advantage of the technological advancements in the fields of robotics,
    remote sensing and big data management, aims at designing an integrated system
    where heterogeneous unmanned robotic components (terrestrial and aerial robots)
    move within the orchards to collect data and perform common farming operations.
    The SWEEPER project has proposed a robotic system to harvest sweet peppers in
    greenhouses, leveraging on machine vision techniques to acquire both colour and
    distance information, and then storing collected peppers in an on-board container.
    Another robotic platform has been developed in the ROMI project to assist in weed
    reduction and crop monitoring, reducing manual labour. Land robots also acquire
    detailed information on sample plants, and an UAV assists by providing information
    at crop level. The GreenPatrol-Robot project designed and built a satellite-guided
    autonomous robot for pest control in greenhouses. It exploits Galileo satellite
    services to navigate, achieving good positioning accuracy inside greenhouses.
    The AFarCloud project aims at the agricultural productivity increase via PF techniques.
    The proposed solution is a distributed platform for autonomous farming robots
    that allows the integration and real-time cooperation of agricultural systems
    to increase efficiency, productivity, and food quality. This platform is integrated
    with a Farm Management System (FMS) to support monitoring and decision-making
    solutions based on real-time data mining techniques. The RUC-APS project is centered
    on management approaches aiming at enhancing SF solutions in agriculture systems,
    applying operational research to optimise farm production. 2.1.3. Satellite-based
    activities Several projects are mainly based on improving the information derived
    from satellite optical data. The AGRORADAR project aims at delivering innovative
    algorithms and data models that can process Copernicus EO Syntethic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data to achieve precise and detailed information. The AUDITOR project develops
    an improved Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) augmentation system for
    services in PF applications. The project enables cost-effective PF services to
    farmers, like recommendations regarding site-specific application of water, fertilizer
    and pesticides. The WATER4AGRI project combines microwave data obtained from different
    satellites to provide datasets for retrieving key information about water availability
    for crops at field level. The SENSAGRI project combines optical and radar measurements
    to develop three prototype services for near real-time operations: surface soil
    moisture, green and brown Leaf Area Index (LAI), and crop type mapping. The MISTRALE
    project provides soil moisture maps to decision makers in water management using
    GNSS reflectometry (GNSS-R) via satellites and UAVs. The project has developed
    a prototype sensor embedded on a dedicated software platform. The APOLLO project
    brings PF closer to farmers through affordable information services, making extensive
    use of free and open EO data. The proposed services help farmers to make better
    decisions by monitoring the growth and health of crops, providing advice on when
    to irrigate and till their fields, and estimating the size of their harvest. The
    services are designed to be always available thanks to a web platform and a mobile
    application. 2.1.4. Mitigating digital divide Other research projects are mainly
    focused on bringing the advantages of SF to farmers in a way compatible with their
    needs and digital skills, thus reducing digital divide. The SMART-AKIS initiative
    sets up a self-sustainable thematic network on SF technologies designed for the
    effective exchange of knowledge among research, industry, and the farming community,
    disseminating direct applicable research and commercial solutions, and capturing
    grassroots level needs and innovative ideas. The 4D4F project (Data Driven Dairy
    Decision For Farmers) focuses on the benefits provided by sensors in monitoring
    animals and environment, supporting informed decisions. The project hosts a large
    repository of ICT solutions freely browseable by farmers. The SmartAgriHubs project
    brings together 164 partners in the European agri-food sector, carrying out 28
    flagship innovation experiments for digitisation in five agri-food sectors: arable
    farming, livestock, vegetable, fruits, and aquaculture. The overall goal of ICT-AGRI-2
    is to strengthen the research within the area of PF and to develop a common research
    agenda concerning ICT and robotics in agriculture in Europe. Its main objectives
    are: mapping and analysis of existing research and future needs; development of
    instruments and procedures for transnational funding activities; development of
    strategic research agenda and programmes; and establishment of international collaborations
    and networks. Other projects, like Nefertiti, Euraknos, and Desira are setting
    up thematic networks with the objective of promote networking activities, data
    sharing and knowledge exchange. They leverage the vast set of already available
    ICT tools to promote their use in SF contexts and to foster their adaption to
    practitioners’ needs. The DESIRA project, started at June 2019, intends to collect
    practitioners’ needs through 20 national living labs in EU and then to design
    ICT use cases to meet those demands in a Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI)
    fashion. The Fairshare project has data collecting and sharing as foremost objectives,
    in order to build a network able to reduce the agricultural digital divide. Finally,
    FarmingBySatellite is an initiative to promote the use of Galileo as GNSS and
    EO services. It launches a biyearly challenge to identify promising ideas using
    satellite technologies for SF purposes. 2.1.5. Considerations Summing up, some
    considerations can be made: monitoring fields and crops is quite diffused at today,
    leveraging local and remote sensing solutions, i.e., in-field sensors, UAVs, up
    to satellites. Another major challenge is the optimisation of water use. Unmanned
    vehicles enable semi- and full-autonomous scenarios, currently representing a
    major objective for both research institutes and private companies. Anyway, almost
    all surveyed projects aim at providing DSSs instead of autonomous solutions; in
    fact, there is still wide scepticism on them by practitioners as viable alternatives
    to human decisions. To feed DSSs, data analysis techniques are used, also supporting
    automatic actions based on feedback, and farmers’ decisions. Machine learning
    techniques are typically exploited for dedicated applications in the projects
    we considered, such as prediction and estimation of farming parameters to optimise
    livestock production or crop monitoring. 2.2. Scientific literature SF represents
    the evolution of agriculture driven by ICT technologies. ICT provides tools, methods,
    and techniques with the potential to improve both the modeling and the practice
    in this sector. SF is intrinsically tied to large-scale heterogeneous sensing
    [9], involving different hardware, algorithms, and protocols, thus too focused
    approaches have gained little traction at now. In what follows, we survey a very
    recent and exemplary subset of the scientific literature on such a topic, then
    schematised in Table 2. To further highlight what is currently trending in recent
    scientific literature, we show the most used keywords in Fig. 2, according to
    the four thematic clusters we define in Table 2. Each keyword is presented weighted
    in its cluster according to the number of occurrences. Finally, Table 3 maps typical
    application scenarios and data types to commonly used sensing solutions [10,11].

    techniques and management systems SF makes large use of sensor nodes to collect
    data on the environment and the phenomenon under observation. For instance, in
    the case of agriculture, soil sensors, placed at different depths, complement
    data collected from EO satellites, providing enriched information. More generally,
    indoor and outdoor Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), both mobile and fixed, are
    used to collect heterogeneous data [14] for evaluating different indexes, such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the excess green index,
    the LAI, and so on. Given the fundamental role played by data and data sources
    in this context [12], the historical evolution of sensing for PF in Ref. [5] offers
    a valuable perspective. At the beginning, three methodological approaches were
    considered: the first two ones, namely farming by soil and site-specific crop
    management, were contrasting because the former promoted soil mapping, while the
    latter promoted homogeneous actions in sub-units of farm fields, i.e., a punctual
    approach versus a clustered one. The third approach, namely proximal soil sensing,
    came later, consisting in continuous real-time sensing by sensors mounted on tractors.
    It can be considered the father of the PF approaches in use nowadays. Thanks to
    satellites, proximal soil sensing evolved into remote soil sensing, introducing
    spectral analyses. To allow farm managers to exploit all those heterogeneous data
    sources, increasing complex software platforms were introduced to take advantage
    of raw data and of subsequent elaboration: they are referred to as FMIS [13].
    2.2.2. Unmanned vehicles Real-time stream processing, analysis, and reasoning
    are key concepts towards automation in the agricultural field [22], i.e., towards
    a larger use of robots that can adapt to space- and time-varying conditions with
    minimal delay. Robots can perform very precise operations, and can operate in
    fleets, as proposed in Ref. [23], which considers both UTVs and UAVs. Moving systems
    rely on GNSS techniques for precise positioning, and PF applications need large
    accuracy. Several commercial systems integrate a GNSS receiver and use one or
    more fixed Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) reference base stations [26] for providing
    accuracy up to centimeters. Further than precise positioning, robots depend on
    machine-vision systems to navigate the environment [25]; according to the technology
    and the scenario under consideration, specific spectral signatures are of interest,
    as for instance hyperspectral imagery in both local and remote sensing. Commercial
    devices, to be used on board, already capture both RGB and Near Infrared Imagery
    (NIR) bands, and stereovision systems are used for 3D maps [25]. Further than
    terrestrial vehicles, aerial ones have been revolutionising the practices in this
    sector. PF is taking large advantage of UAVs, with several commercial systems
    able to fly at different speeds and altitudes [24], ranging from fixed to rotary
    wing machines. UAVs are used for monitoring scenarios, further than pesticide
    spraying, which is a key application for PF [18]. Heavy and large UAVs can be
    used for such a purpose in the case of large fields, jointly with multispectral
    techniques to generate NDVI maps to be used for spraying pesticides and fertilizers
    where needed. Such a potential has been subject to increasing attention in the
    last years. For instance, UAVs can be used to assess if an area has been subject
    to plowing, and the plowing depths. The authors in Ref. [15] consider the use
    of UAVs for such a purpose as an alternative to the use of satellites. In fact,
    according to the authors, even high-resolution satellites cannot classify the
    roughness of the terrain, thus motivating the use of UAVs. A RGB camera has been
    used for data collection and a visual assessment, and collected georeferenced
    data are analysed to assess the plowing depths. RGB and NIR are collected by means
    of an UAV also in Ref. [16], with the aim of classifying plants and weeds. The
    proposed system makes use of the Excess Green Index (ExG) [16] in the case of
    RGB-only; if NIR is exploited as well, NDVI can be estimated and used because
    of the richer information it provides. By combining these results with geometric
    features, sugar beets can be recognised even in the case of overlapping plants.
    NDVI has been used in viticulture for precision applications [21] as well: in
    fact, using an UAV to collect detailed images in a vineyard, plant rows can be
    discriminated from inter-rows, identifying missing plants with good precision.
    UAVs can be seen as part of a WSN, acting as mobile nodes [17], thus the analytical
    characterisation of the channel model between a moving UAV and fixed terrestrial
    nodes becomes of interest [20]. Low-power 802.15.4-based solutions have been investigated
    in rural contexts, using UAVs as data mules [19]. 2.2.3. IoT platforms As aforementioned
    in Section 1, Internet connectivity is a key requirement for SF. In fact, its
    availability allows IoT-based scenarios to emerge [33], increasing the degree
    of remote control and automation. This is well supported by IoT features, such
    as interoperability and easiness of integration [36]. Anyway, in rural contexts,
    terrestrial connectivity may be lacking. Because of this, aerospace solutions
    for connectivity are a viable option [8]. Looking at the literature, reference
    [30] proposes an IoT platform for PF based on FIWARE.2 It considers the case of
    a greenhouse, where Internet connectivity is likely available, thus opening to
    data exchanges via protocol stacks relying on common IoT protocols, like CoAP
    and MQTT. In greenhouses, the main objectives are typically climate control and
    soil monitoring. The Agricolus software platform, which is a FIWARE-based DSS
    for tobacco crops, is described in Ref. [29], designed to collect soil data via
    802.15.4-based WSNs. The FIWARE middleware is a software enabler in very different
    scenarios [13,29]. Along to climate control systems, irrigation systems have been
    proposed to optimise water use. In Ref. [28], FIWARE cloud components are integrated
    in a PF application to reduce water use. In Ref. [31], tomatoes in a greenhouse
    are monitored, and the authors propose an analytical framework to assess the performance
    of different tested configurations by relying on plant transpiration. The works
    in Refs. [27,32] consider the use of low-cost and general purpose sensor nodes,
    built upon the Arduino platform and upon MICAz Motes, respectively, as information
    sources in greenhouses. Being able to deploy low-cost and easily replaceable sensor
    nodes is a priority for a larger adoption of SF techniques. A core demand is related
    to power consumption: battery-powered devices lasting several years, as for instance
    ZigBee ones in Ref. [27], are fundamental in farm deployments. Apart from FIWARE,
    a plethora of different platforms can be identified as enablers for SF [34]. Those
    platforms aggregate heterogeneous data, then analysed and interpreted in order
    to provide additional value. Here, semantic analyses have been proposed as well,
    like for instance the valuable work in Ref. [35]. The Agri-IoT architecture, a
    layered and complex framework, provides additional value to DSSs because it further
    facilitates informed and accurate decisions thanks to semantic web and real-time
    reasoning. 2.2.4. Decision Support Systems DSSs are one of the most used solutions
    for SF because they provide support to farmers, offering a point of access to
    useful information, according to the aim of the system, and suggesting a plausible
    course of action in a given context. Aims can be very different: minimising the
    impact of diseases in tomatoes by applying automatic climate control [37]; ‘time-to-sow’
    alerts, and cattle monitoring [38]; anticipating potential crop dysfunctions in
    a proactive way [39]; pest control [40]; selecting appropriate alternative crops
    in a given area [41]. Those are just few examples of what can be offered by recent
    developments of DSSs in the agricultural sector. 2.2.5. Considerations Some considerations
    can be made also here: for instance, looking at Fig. 2, it is visible how data
    is a relevant keyword for all clusters. This is a key topic in the context of
    SF, thus deepened in Section 3. A notable exception is visible in the cluster
    Unmanned Vehicles, in which system outnumbers data: this can be explained by taking
    into account that unmanned vehicles are typically considered in an autonomous
    scenario, i.e., within a system composed of several interacting parts. The keywords
    pertaining to the cluster Unmanned Vehicles take the most part of Fig. 2, graphically
    highlighting the technological complexity of designed systems, and the very large
    number of operations that can be performed by those. Finally, what in Fig. 1 can
    be put in relation with what presented in Fig. 2: as an example, in the former
    monitoring operations are practically ubiquitous, and this is confirmed by the
    large number of occurrences of keywords like thing (as in smart thing or IoT)
    and sensor in the latter. 3. Open challenges This section briefly discusses the
    open challenges hampering a larger adoption of SF, summarised in Fig. 3 as well.
    Several technologies pushing for a larger adoption of SF practices have already
    been cited within this work, such as fully autonomous flight control, early identification
    of plant diseases, and reliable virtual fences [1], as well as more general ones,
    as AI, robotics, high performance computing, IoT, and 5G, which are reported within
    the EU declaration cited in Section 1. AI probably represents the largest challenge
    at now and, at the same time, opportunity in several sectors, including the agricultural
    one. The EU is largely investing on it because convinced it will be the upcoming
    disruptive game changer. In fact, the AI4EU initiative, started at the beginning
    of 2019, aims at the transformation of AI into a compelling solution in several
    application scenarios. Download : Download full-size image Figure 3. Overview
    of open challenges in the SF field: technical challenges (on the right) are discussed
    in Section 3.1, non-technical challenges (on the left) are discussed in Section
    3.2. 3.1. Technical challenges Looking at sensor nodes and sensor networks, we
    refer to the valuable works in Refs. [14,42], which survey the use of fixed and
    mobile solutions. According to the authors, advances are needed to further lower
    costs and to design specific solutions for the agricultural context, which requires
    solutions able to resist to difficult conditions (e.g., specific soil properties,
    exposition to high/low temperature, water resistance, fine dusts, and so on).
    Further than costs, solutions are needed toward larger energy efficiency, including
    energy harvesting techniques, and reliability in data collection and transmission,
    in order to minimize the need of maintenance for the deployed solutions. Specific
    issues of the agricultural domain need targeted answers, in particular the deployment
    strategies, to be designed according to fields segmentation and to farmers’ requirements.
    One of the main drivers of the diffusion of WSN in agriculture has been IoT: it
    has marked the transition from closed-source systems and disconnected software
    solutions towards connected systems built upon interoperable solutions. Those
    characteristics are favorable to cost reduction and to easiness of integration.
    Challenges here are overall related to network capabilities, data security, and
    data privacy [33]. Data is one of the most critical topic in the agricultural
    sector. Data ownership, protection, and security are perceived as not sufficiently
    close to farmers’ needs, thus becoming threats to be mitigated, if not completely
    avoided. In more words, nowadays, digital solutions for SF are under-utilised
    because practitioners fear data misuse and the loss of control over their business.
    Data protection must be enhanced to transform into a transparent operation, keeping
    in mind that agriculture is typically a private business activity (i.e., a not
    transparent activity), and data transfers to external systems (e.g. cloud) must
    be controllable and well described to increase acceptance. An option towards larger
    acceptance comes from the possibility for farmers to benefit from business with
    their data, and to benefit from public and official data released in an open fashion.
    On this, the valuable work of the EU with the Galileo services is a notable example
    of good practice, collecting and releasing data through application programming
    interfaces [43]. Further from data, open and used standards for data handling
    is compelling to move towards horizontal solutions instead of vertical ones [44].
    Large IoT platforms generate huge amounts of data to be analysed, thus calling
    for data analytic techniques able to extract meaningful information. Nowadays,
    big data immediately come to mind [45] as a set of strategies towards this objective,
    but it must be noted that its application to agriculture is recent. Generally
    speaking, the big data paradigm goes in an opposite direction with respect to
    acquiring more control over own data by farmers. To counteract that, the possibility
    for farmers to economically gain from sharing and accessing large volumes of data
    works as an incentive [46]. In Ref. [47], the authors underline the difficulties
    in discovering and combining large heterogeneous datasets in the agro-environmental
    field, often complicated by lacking of metadata. Furthermore, the need for semantic
    analyses and interoperability is highlighted in Ref. [47]. Natural language processing
    and machine learning techniques play a role here, facilitated by existing initiatives
    for building and maintaining open large repositories for training purposes, like
    CINERGI by Earthcube. Once meaningful information is available thanks to raw data
    sources and to analytics techniques, decision making is performed. This is where
    machine learning techniques and, more generally, AI can be fully exploited toward
    autonomous systems. To this aim, a fundamental challenge is moving intelligence
    from cloud platforms to closer computation platforms, such as edge solutions,
    handling and processing data close to the source, thus reducing delays. Multi-Access
    Edge Computing (MEC), jointly with 5G, is expected to play a role here. In the
    case of agricultural autonomous systems, real-time constraints are more easily
    satisfied by edge solutions than remote centralised systems. According to Ref.
    [48], in order to build sustainable infrastructure, the several emerging architecture
    paradigms (with different degrees of centralised and distributed entities) must
    comply to open standards for both easiness of implementation and cost reduction.
    Environmental monitoring and real-time agricultural data analytics and control
    can benefit from those paradigms, for instance by providing localized information
    about pollution and pests in the vicinity of edge servers [49]. 3.2. Socio-economic
    and other non-technical challenges This section discusses non-technical issues
    still holding back a larger diffusion of SF, at least in the EU. In fact, uptake
    in EU is rather low if compared to what expected [50]. Incentives and policies
    play a large role, considering national and EU rules, economical and skills perspectives.
    In Ref. [50], the authors show how financial and government incentives are the
    most influential solution, followed by training and other non-financial support.
    Farmers’ concerns are related to the time to recover the investment, and to the
    difficulties in evaluating the advantages; small farms have almost no adoption
    at all, also because the machinery has no support for more advanced technology.
    Sole farmers show a large interest in SF tools, which may come as unexpected,
    because it reduces exposure to occupational accidents and injuries; anyway, those
    barriers still hold back its use [51]. Because of those reasons, initiatives like
    those presented in Section 1 have a significant socio-economic value: cooperative
    farming with support services for a better handling of costs and needed investments;
    hardware solutions to transform legacy equipment into SF-ready machinery to avoid
    too high initial costs and to have time to familiarise with new technology; secure
    and open platforms for sharing data and getting back useful information, helping
    in assessing potential advantages. Research activities aiming at reducing the
    agricultural digital divide have an impact as well, helping farmers with new ICT-based
    tools in their daily work; on the other hand, different strategies in designing
    innovative ICT tools must be considered, like using natural language [52] to explicitly
    take into account potentially low-literate speakers. Nowadays, the right to access
    and use the collected data is at the center of the discussion: COPA-COGECA, an
    European farming representative organisation, in cooperation with CEMA, the European
    agricultural machinery association, has recently released a code of conduct to
    grant the data originator (i.e., the farmer) a leading role in controlling the
    access to and the use of data.3 The concerns on data use and access have been
    explored also in Ref. [4], highlighting existing scepticism by Australian farmers
    and divergence of expectations between involved actors. On the one hand, marketers
    and traders expect that big data techniques increase the reliability of predictions
    in the market dynamics; on the other hand, farmers are convinced that power asymmetries
    will increase, thus acting as a brake. Similar considerations are in Ref. [53],
    when looking to Ireland: whilst recognizing that SF is a real opportunity for
    the farming context, potential challenges and risks should be carefully considered
    to anticipate and reduce the gap among winners and losers. 4. Conclusions and
    future directions In this work, we surveyed the most relevant research activities
    aiming at improving and encouraging the adoption of SF techniques in agricultural
    contexts. Large efforts are currently poured to boost ICT use, at least in the
    EU, where this analysis is focused. On the one hand, the already established use
    of sensor nodes and heterogeneous data sources, as well as simple analytic techniques,
    is pushing DSSs in the farms; on the other hand, a growing need is there for ever
    advancing technology and open standards to consolidate existing scenarios in an
    interoperable and low-cost manner, as well as programmes to help ICT diffusion
    in areas suffering from digital divide. In the future, technology will have a
    growing role in agriculture [6]. Several operations will be automatised, from
    planting to harvesting, thanks to increased robotisation, both terrestrial and
    aerial one. Soil information will be readily available, thus allowing for e.g.
    a finer control of pests and pesticides, combining local information with other
    data sources, like weather and pollution data. In the end, an increase in production
    is expected, joint with a reduction in chemicals today in use, thus reducing pressure
    on soil. SF has the potential for a rapid and efficient growth in coming years,
    supported by policies that can fuel both R&D efforts and farmers’ adoption through
    investments. Anyway, the main barriers at today, i.e., vertical solutions, reduced
    digital skills and high costs for farmers, poor telecommunication infrastructures,
    and concerns on data ownership and use must be carefully addressed by technical
    and non-technical actors to facilitate SF adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

    plays a vital role in the economic growth of any country. With the increase of
    population, frequent changes in climatic conditions and limited resources, it
    becomes a challenging task to fulfil the food requirement of the present population.
    Precision agriculture also known as smart farming have emerged as an innovative
    tool to address current challenges in agricultural sustainability. The mechanism
    that drives this cutting edge technology is machine learning (ML). It gives the
    machine ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ML together with
    IoT (Internet of Things) enabled farm machinery are key components of the next
    agriculture revolution. In this article, authors present a systematic review of
    ML applications in the field of agriculture. The areas that are focused are prediction
    of soil parameters such as organic carbon and moisture content, crop yield prediction,
    disease and weed detection in crops and species detection. ML with computer vision
    are reviewed for the classification of a different set of crop images in order
    to monitor the crop quality and yield assessment. This approach can be integrated
    for enhanced livestock production by predicting fertility patterns, diagnosing
    eating disorders, cattle behaviour based on ML models using data collected by
    collar sensors, etc. Intelligent irrigation which includes drip irrigation and
    intelligent harvesting techniques are also reviewed that reduces human labour

    I. Introduction The population of the world will increase to 9.1 billion approximately
    thirty-four percent as of today by the end of 2050. Food requirement will increase
    by 70 percent and due to rapid urbanization, land availability for agriculture
    will decrease drastically in the coming years. India will be the most populated
    country by 2050 and presently it is already lagging the domestic food production.
    The main reason for reduced food production is the lack of planning, unpredictable
    weather conditions, improper harvesting and irrigation techniques and livestock
    mismanagement. In the last few years, nature has experienced a drastic change
    in weather conditions due to global warming. The average temperature of the earth
    has been increased due to which there is uncertainty in climatic conditions. Frequent
    droughts, heavy rainfall are the biggest challenge for poor farmers. According
    to the government of India annual economic survey, adverse climatic conditions,
    reduce the farmer’s income by 20-25%. Precision agriculture [1], [2] is one of
    the solutions to ensure food security for the entire world [3]. Precision agriculture
    also abbreviated as digital agriculture is a technology-enabled data-driven sustainable
    farm management system. It is basically the adoption of modern information technologies,
    software tools, and smart embedded devices for decision support in agriculture
    [4] as shown in figure 1. Mechanized agriculture and the green revolution are
    the two key components of the first and second agriculture revolution. Precision
    farming is an important part of the third agriculture revolution [5]. FIGURE 1.
    Precision agriculture. Show All John Deere introduced this technology in 1990
    for the sowing of seeds and spraying of fertilizers using global positioning system
    (GPS) controlled tractors. The main focus of precision farming is to reduce the
    production cost and environmental effects to increase the farm’s profitability.
    Digital technologies such as IoT [6], AI, data analytics, cloud computing, and
    block-chain technology play a key role in precision agriculture. In precision
    farming, IoT based smart sensors are deployed in the agriculture land for collecting
    data related to soil nutrients, fertilizers, and water requirements as well as
    for analysing the crop growth. Autonomous and semi-autonomous devices such as
    an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) [7] and robots are used for identifying weed
    and disease in the plants using computer vision techniques. Satellite images are
    also used in precision agriculture for monitoring the field and identifying the
    diseases in the plants. The data obtained from the deployed sensors [8] are processed
    and analyzed using ML algorithms to make farming practice more controlled and
    optimized. ML algorithms are also used for weather and rainfall prediction based
    on the data obtained from sensors, climatic records, and satellite images. This
    could save the lives of thousands of farmers who commit suicide because of crop
    loss due to uncertainty in weather conditions. Smart livestock management is an
    important component of precision agriculture. It helps in monitoring the health,
    welfare, productivity, and reproduction of animals throughout their life cycle.
    Sensors and cameras monitor animal’s health and computer vision techniques help
    in making intelligent decisions such as stopping the communal spread of diseases.
    Autonomous tractors and automated irrigation systems provide modern farming solutions
    to farmers. The widespread utilization of precision farming across the world is
    due to the presence of innovative machine and deep learning (DL) algorithms, high-speed
    internet access, and efficient computational devices. In [10] authors have discussed
    applications of ML for sustainable agriculture supply chain (ASC) performance.
    Authors have presented a unique ML-ASC framework that can guide researchers and
    agriculture practitioners to understand the role and importance of digital technologies
    in the agriculture industry. In [11] authors reviewed different ML applications
    in agriculture and discussed how digital technologies will benefit the agriculture
    industry. In this paper, the authors have presented a comprehensive review of
    the ML application for precision agriculture. This review article will provide
    an insight into the research community about the adoption of digital practices
    in the agriculture management system. It is anticipated that government agencies
    will frame policies to promote precision farming across the world. The main contribution
    of the article is outlined as follows: Applications of artificial intelligence
    and IoT in precision agriculture are discussed along with their practical implications.
    Foundation of ML and DL algorithms which find their application in precision agriculture
    has been discussed. Performance comparison for various ML, DL algorithms in precision
    farming has been carried out based on the state-of-art literature. Assessment

    with its statistical and performance analysis. Comparison of performance parameters
    of sensors used in IoT applications in precision agriculture is presented. Integration
    of wireless sensor network (WSN) with IoT and artificial intelligence in precision
    agriculture is discussed. Challenges and future trends of artificial intelligence
    in precision farming are briefly outlined. Table 1 highlights the major differences
    of this review article with other articles published in this field. The paper

    and access the knowledge-based agriculture system. Section 7 outlines the challenges
    and limitation of AI in precision agriculture. Section 8 presents the future trends

    the paper. TABLE 1 Key Differences of the Article With Published Articles SECTION
    II. Impact of Artificial Intelligence and IoT in Agriculture The term AI was first
    coined in the Dartmouth conference in the year 1956 by John McCarthy and he defined
    it as a science and engineering of making intelligent machines or more specifically
    intelligent computer programs. AI technology provides computational intelligence
    to machines so that they can learn, understand and react according to the situation.
    ML, DL, natural language processing (NLP), swarm intelligence (SI), expert systems,
    fuzzy logic, and computer vision are the subfields of AI as shown in figure 2.
    This field finds endless applications across different sectors of human life.
    Intelligent AI programs are widely explored in health-care, agriculture, finance,
    robotics, e-commerce and the automation industry. Samsung, Apple, and other electronics
    giant companies announced that they will be utilizing this technology in every
    device they will manufacture in the near future. IoT is another emerging technology
    in which smart sensors, devices are interconnected through the internet. These
    smart sensors can be utilized to gather data across different disciplines such
    as solar plants, agriculture fields, disaster-prone areas, manufacturing industry
    for efficient resource utilization. With the increase in population over the year’s
    demand for agriculture products is increasing day by day. However, with limited
    land availability for farming and reduce interest among the young generation to
    adopt farming as their profession, it has become a challenging task for the agriculture
    industry to satisfy the food requirement of millions of people. Now, the agriculture
    industry is widely adopting smart technologies like IoT and AI to efficiently
    cultivate organic products in limited land areas as well as to overcome the traditional
    challenges of farmers. FIGURE 2. Artificial intelligence techniques. Show All
    IoT based smart farming system is built for monitoring soil nutrients and soil
    moisture using sensors. ML algorithms are explored for determining the optimum
    amount of fertilizers required for soils before the sowing of crops. Drones are
    revolutionizing the agriculture industry. These drones are cameras enabled and
    are used for different applications such as field and crop monitoring, spraying
    of pesticides, and drip irrigation. The images captured by the drones over the
    entire lifecycle of crops can be examined using DL and computer vision algorithms
    for disease and weed identification. Thereafter, these drones are used for spraying
    pesticides over the weeds and infected crops. Over the years uncertainty in weather
    conditions is the main concern of farmers. Drip irrigation using drones is an
    efficient AI-empowered irrigation system which is basically trained on weather
    pattern and can effectively reduce the water problems of farmers. AI-enabled robots
    can be used for harvesting the crops at a much faster pace and in large volumes.
    Robots can reduce human labour to a large extent and can be used along with drones
    for monitoring the field. Livestock management is another major concern for farmers.
    IoT based sensors can be deployed in the field for health monitoring of cattle.
    This information can be utilized for protecting the bunch of cattle from diseased
    cattle. NLP based virtual assistant applications like chatbots can update the
    farmers with the latest advancement in technologies for agriculture. Farmers can
    finds solutions for their problems and incorporate the latest technology in their
    farming for improving their field productivity. Thus, AI and IoT are the two major
    technologies that will play a vital role in the agriculture industry. SECTION
    III. Machine Learning Algorithms ML is the subfield of computer science that gives
    computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel,
    1959) [12]. Alan Turing in the year 1950 proposed the concept of learning machines
    and wrote a research article “The Turing Test for Machine Intelligence” [13].
    He performed a test and examined the machine’s ability to demonstrate intelligent
    behaviour similar to humans. A machine or intelligent computer program learns
    and extract knowledge from the data, builds a framework for making predictions
    or intelligent decisions. Thus, the ML process is divided into three key parts,
    i.e. data input, model building, and generalization as shown in figure 3. Generalization
    is the process for predicting the output for the inputs with which the algorithm
    has not been trained before. ML algorithms are mainly used to solve complex problems
    where human expertise fails such as weather prediction, spam filtering, disease
    identification in plants, pattern recognition. FIGURE 3. A Machine learning process.
    Show All Today, due to the availability of innovative algorithms and large data
    sets through internet resources industries and research communities are widely
    using ML algorithms for solving a diverse set of problems. DL is the subfield
    of the family of ML algorithms which is trained from large sets and uses an artificial
    neural network (ANN) to make intelligent decisions. ML algorithms are categorized
    as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning as shown
    in figure 4. Supervised learning as the name suggests is learning with the supervisor
    or teacher. This set of algorithms works with labeled data-set which means corresponding
    to each input there are outputs. The algorithm builds an input-output relationship
    with this labeled data set and thereafter generalize or predicts outputs for unseen
    inputs. Supervised learning algorithms used for predicting the categorical value
    are known as classification algorithms and the algorithms that are used for predicting
    the numerical value are known as regression algorithms. Unsupervised learning
    algorithms works with unlabelled data and discovers unknown objects by grouping
    similar objects. The goal of an unsupervised learning algorithm is to extract
    hidden knowledge from the training data set thus this approach is difficult to
    implement than supervised learning algorithms. Reinforcement learning is another
    approach that learns from the environment through reward and punishment. AlphaGo,
    a chess-playing game developed by DeepMind utilized reinforcement learning for
    defeating the world’s best chess-playing computer program. FIGURE 4. Categorization
    of machine learning algorithms. Show All In this paper the performance of different
    ML algorithms are analysed and discussed in the field of agriculture. Table 2
    presents different types of supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning
    algorithms utilized for soil and weather prediction, disease and weed identification,
    intelligent irrigation and harvesting techniques as well as livestock management.
    TABLE 2 Machine Learning Algorithms SECTION IV. Machine Learning Applications
    in Precision Agriculture In many countries, the farmers rely on the traditional
    ways of farming which is based on the reliability of the suggestions from the
    elderly and their experience. This method leaves farmers at the mercy of random
    climatic conditions which are already getting random due to global warming and
    uneven rainfall patterns. The manual spraying method for pesticides led to improper
    usage of resources and harms the environment. AI and IoT enabled precision agriculture
    removes the randomness and assist new age farmer to optimize every step of the
    farming process. Figure 5 (a) and (b) presents a pictorial view of traditional
    agriculture and technology enabled farm management system. FIGURE 5. (a) Traditional
    agriculture cycle (b) Precision agriculture cycle. Show All Gaitán [14] provided
    a systematic study of the impact of extreme weather events, such as hail events,
    cold waves, heat waves, and their impact on agricultural practices. The author
    reported floods, droughts, frost, hail, heatwaves, and pest outbreaks are impacted
    by climatic conditions. The AI systems are applicable in each farming operation
    as depicted in figure 4 and some of them even extend beyond the conventionally
    recognized steps. In this section we will discuss the state of art techniques
    proposed/implemented by various researchers and practitioners worldwide. A. Soil
    Properties and Weather Prediction Prediction of soil properties is the first and
    the most crucial step which influences the selection of crop, land preparation,
    selection of seed, crop yield, and selection of fertilizers /manure. The soil
    properties are directly related to the geographic and climatic conditions of the
    land in use and hence is an important factor to take into consideration. The soil
    properties prediction mostly consists of predicting nutrients in the soil, soil
    surface humidity, weather conditions during the lifecycle of the crop. Human activities
    have highly affected the properties of soil and hence our ability to cultivate
    the crops [15]. In general, there are 17 essential elements as listed in table
    3 which play an important role in plant growth [16]. The growth of crops depends
    on the nutrients available in a particular soil. The soil nutrients are mostly
    monitored by electric and electromagnetic sensors [8]. Depending on the nutrients
    farmers make informed decisions as to which crop is optimal for the land. However,
    the nutrients can be added through fertilizers, manure, etc. but with an additional
    cost. Some of them may also damage the environment and have an adverse effect
    on the soil cycle. TABLE 3 Essential Plant Nutrients [2] A scientific analysis
    of soil nutrients, soil moisture, pH is important for determining the soil properties.
    Acar et al. [17] employed an extreme learning machine (ELM) based regression model
    for prediction of soil surface humidity. The author selected two terrains having
    area 4 KM2 and 16 KM2 located in Dicle university campus for experimental analysis.
    The real-time field data was extracted using polarimetric Radarsat-2 data, which
    was pre-processed using the SNAP toolbox [18] and features were added with the
    help of local measurements by separating the field into square grids. Once the
    pre-processing and feature extraction is done the data is passed to ELM based
    regression model to predict the soil surface humidity. The algorithm was tested
    with 5 different kernel functions and the prediction was validated using leave-one-out
    cross-validation technique. The experimental results confirmed the lowest root
    mean square error (RMSE) of 2.19% when using ‘sine’ kernel function. Wang et al.
    [19] deployed soft sensors based on ELM for the measurement of nutrient solution
    composition in the soilless cultivation method. The soilless cultivation method
    is an emerging planting method. It is imperative to monitor the pH value, temperature
    and concentration changes in nutrient solution composition as the performance
    of soilless cultivation is highly dependent on these parameters. The significant
    variables in a nutrient solution cannot be measured directly hence these are determined
    with the help of auxiliary variables. The authors utilized conductivity, pH value,
    flow rate, and temperature measurements for auxiliary measurements. These auxiliary
    measurements are fed to a deep belief network-based ELM which predicts the values
    of significant variables. For experimental analysis, the authors deployed the
    model to measure the concentration of SO 2− 4 , and H 2 PO − 4 in a nutrient solution.
    The authors reported an average RMSE of 1.2414 for predictions in SO 2− 4 and
    RMSE of 0.8892 for prediction of H 2 PO − 4 . Park et al. [20] utilized ML algorithms
    to predict the soil moisture using data from MODIS. The authors downscaled the
    AMSR2 soil moisture to 1KM using random forest (RF) and Cubist algorithms. An
    ensemble of these algorithms was used to obtain soil moisture data. The results
    obtained through the ML methods were compared with the statistical ordinary least
    squares technique. The ML model exhibited a R 2 (coefficient of determination)
    of 0.96 and an RMSE of 0.06, whereas a R 2 of 0.47 and a RMSE of 0.16 was associated
    with the statistical ordinary least squares. Reda et al. [21] explored ML algorithms
    to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) and total nitrogen (TN) in soil samples
    collected from four agricultural lands of Moroccan. Data set of near-infrared
    spectroscopy is utilized in comparison to traditional chemical methods as this
    technique reduces the computation time and resource utilization. The ensemble
    learning modeling algorithm presents the best performance among other regression
    models and back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) algorithm. The proposed algorithm
    presents R 2 of 0.96, RMSE of 1.92, performance to deviation (RPD) of 4.87 for
    SOC and R 2 of 0.94 and RMSE of 0.57, RPD of 4.91 for TN prediction. Morellos
    et al. [22] also utilized visible and infrared spectroscopy to determine TN, SOC,
    and moisture content (MC) in the arable field in Premslin Germany. Spectroscopy
    dataset is used for building the predictive ML model for estimating all three
    soil properties. Least square support vector machine (LS-SVM) and cubist ML algorithms
    outperform principal component regression and partial least square regression
    multivariate methods in terms of RMSE and residual prediction deviation (RPD).
    LS-SVM best predict SOC and MC with RMSE of 0.062 and 0.457, RPD of 2.24, and
    2.20. Cubist best predicts for TN with RMSE of 0.071 and RPD of 1.96. Andrade
    et al. [23] build ordinary least square regression, RF, cubist regression, XGboost
    prediction model for determining soil properties from portable X-ray fluorescence
    (pXRF) spectrometry dataset in Brazilian coastal plains. Three soil properties
    total nitrogen, soil organic matter (SOM), cation exchange capacity (CEC) were
    analyzed using RF, ordinary least squares regression (OLS), cubist regression
    (CR), XGBoost (XGB). RF algorithm gives the best performance with R 2 of 0.50
    for TN, R 2  0.75 for CEC and 0.56 for SOM. Deiss et al. [24] estimated the soil
    properties (clay, sand, pH, SOC) in northern Tanzania and USA Midwest from the
    spectroscopy dataset using ML algorithms. THE tuned SVM model outperforms the
    partial least square (PLS) regression model in terms of predicting all the soil
    parameters. Mahmoudzadeh et al. [25] explored the ML algorithm to predict SOC
    in the Kurdistan province of Iran. The simulation results suggest that RF accurately
    predicts SOC with R 2 of 0.60 and RMSE of 0.35% in comparison to SVM, kNN, Cubist,
    and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) ML algorithm. The study also suggests
    that air temperature, annual rainfall, valley depth, texture of terrain surface
    are some of the important factors that influence SOC spread over the Kurdistan
    region. Veres et al. [26] explored DL architecture such as CNN for predicting
    the soil properties from the infra-red spectroscopy dataset. Benke et al. [27]
    predict soil electrical conductivity (EC) and SOC in different regional locations
    of Victoria, Australia using pedotransfer function (PTF) based on ML algorithm.
    PTF basically converts soil measurement into soil properties and provides inputs
    for ML simulation algorithms. In the proposed approach PTF use Generalised Linear
    Mixed Effects Model (GLMM) model and Residual Maximum Likelihood (REML) to predict‘
    the soil properties. Traditional approaches to soil properties and crop yield
    prediction require time-consuming field surveys and the deployment of expensive
    sensors. Khanal et al. [28] proposed an alternative approach in which the dataset
    for the prediction of soil properties and crop yield is generated using remotely
    sensed aerial images of agricultural land. Five soil properties, viz. pH value,
    magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), SOM, CEC, and crop yield were predicted using RF,
    SVM, Cubist, NN, Gradient Boosting Model (GBM) ML algorithms. NN presents the
    highest prediction accuracy for SOM having R 2 of 0.64, RMSE of 0.44 and CEC having
    R 2 of 0.67, RMSE of 2.35; SVM best predicts K having R 2 of 0.21, RMSE of 0.49
    and Mg having R 2 of 0.22, RMSE of 4.57; and GBM best predicts pH having R 2 of
    0.15, RMSE of 0.62. RF outperforms other algorithms in terms of crop yield prediction
    and presents higher accuracy having R 2 of 0.53 and RMSE of 0.97. Labrador et
    al. [29] estimate calcium and Mg content in soil using generalized regression
    NN and genetic algorithm (GA). The digital elevation model and satellite images
    were used as input to the prediction model for estimating the soil properties.
    Chlingaryan et al. [30] discussed different ML approaches used in precision agriculture
    for accurate crop yield prediction and soil nitrogen estimation over the last
    fifteen years. Ju-Young et al. [31] investigated a seasonal climatic forecasting
    model using regularized ELM to predict day-wise mean air temperature at field
    level for a period of 90 days. The authors selected data from Korea Metrological
    Administration using the Met GloSea5GC2 model [32]. The authors fed 240 days of
    forecast data and hindcast data from the ensemble based model to the RELM algorithm.
    The algorithm performance was evaluated by measuring: RMSE, mean absolute error
    (MAE) the model prediction vs the actual values. The authors achieved an RMSE
    in the range of 1.02 to 3.35 which outperformed the meteorological data which
    has an RMSE range of 1.61 to 3.37. Soil moisture content is an important parameter
    to acknowledge in the agriculture industry as it addresses precise irrigation
    scheduling. Stamenkovic et al. [33] build a support vector regression (SVR) prediction
    model to predict soil moisture content from remotely sensed hyperspectral images.
    Song et al. [34] proposed a macroscopic cellular automata (MCA) model and combined
    its deep belief network (DBN) to predict soil moisture content over a cornfield
    in northwest china. The simulation results of DBN-MCA outperforms the multi-layer
    perceptron (MLP)-MCA in terms of RMSE. Acheing [35] explored the SVR model (i.e.
    RBF), ANN, DNN for simulating soil water retention curve (SWRC) curve of loamy
    sand. Dataset of loamy sand subjected to wetting and drying condition is collected
    using a reflectometer and tensiometer. RBF based SVR model best predicts SWRC
    under both wet and dry conditions. Feng et al. [36] estimate soil temperature
    at various soil depths of Loess Plateau of China. Four different ML algorithms
    ELM, generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), backpropagation neural networks
    (BPNN), and RF were investigated for predicting the soil temperature. ML algorithms
    were trained with air temperature, wind speed, relative humidity, and vapour pressure
    and solar radiation as input parameters and the simulations show that ELM outperforms
    other ML algorithms in terms of RMSE, MAE, Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) and
    concordance correlation coefficient. Mohammadi et al. [37] explored ELM for predicting
    daily dew point temperature in different parts of Iran. This part of the world
    experience different climatic conditions throughout the year. The proposed model
    accurately predicts dew point temperature than SVM and ANN algorithms. Zhu et
    al. [38] accurately predict daily evapotranspiration in Northwest China using
    hybrid particle swarm optimization (PSO)-ELM model to optimize crop water requirement
    in agriculture. Alizamir et al. [39] accurately predicts soil temperature at different
    depths of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cm using ELM, ANN, classification and regression trees,
    group method of data handling using dataset obtained from Mersin station operated
    by Turkish Meteorological Service. The simulation results suggest that soil temperature
    can be estimated easily using air temperature upto depth of 50 cm while for depth
    of 100 cm additional information of solar radiation and wind speed is required.
    Rainfall prediction plays a critical role in the water resource management system,
    flood risk assessment, and the agriculture industry. Acknowledging the chaotic
    nature of rainfall, it is very difficult for statistical approaches to accurately
    predict the rainfall. Cramer et al. [40] evaluated the performance of seven ML
    algorithms for rainfall prediction. The statistical results show that the radial-basis
    function neural network (RBFNN) shows the best performance among other state of
    the art algorithms. Sierra and Jesus [41] predicted the rainfall in Tenerife,
    an island in Spain based on atmospheric synoptic patterns using different ML algorithms
    and found NN gave the best performance among other ML algorithms. Kamatchi and
    Parvathi [42] employed NN for weather prediction and proposed a hybrid recommender
    system for enhancing the success ratio of the system. Lazri et al. [43] build
    a multi-classifier model for estimating precipitation using MSG images (Meteosat
    second generation) and dataset obtained using radar. The proposed approach shows
    that the proposed multi-classifier improves the standard of classification. Shardoor
    and Rao [44] surveyed three different approaches i.e. ML techniques, data mining
    techniques, and satellite forecasting techniques for rainfall prediction. Table
    4 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms for prediction of soil
    properties and weather prediction. TABLE 4 Different ML Algorithms for Prediction
    of Soil Properties and Weather Conditions B. Crop Yield Prediction A significant
    piece of information for any farmer is the prediction of crop yield and how the
    yield can be increased. pH value, soil type, and quality, weather pattern: temperature,
    rainfall, humidity, sunshine hours, fertilizers, and harvesting schedules are
    some of the parameters which play an important role in predicting the crop yield
    [45]. Scientifically manual farming can be considered as a feedback control system
    in which the corrective action is taken once a setback in a crop is observed.
    The crop yield will highly depend on the efficiency of the optimal utilization
    of the above-mentioned resources. If some kind of anomaly goes undetected in the
    initial stage may harm the crop yield in an unprecedented way. Singh et al. [46]
    assessed hailstorms on India’s wheat production and observes that in February
    and March 2015 alone the hailstorm events caused a decline of 8.4% in national
    wheat production. For financially weak farmers in a country such as India, where
    intermittent storage of harvested crops is a rare resource, accurate weather predictions
    may turn to be miraculous for farmers. ML models when systematically applied to
    a system act as feedforward control. With the help of accurate ML models, we can
    anticipate the factors which are going to affect the crop yield. Hence the corrective
    action can be taken before even an anomaly hits the crop production. Kamir et
    al. [47] used ML models to identify the yield gap hotspots in wheat production.
    Authors generated very high-resolution yield maps using data from various sources
    between 2009 and 2015. The data was collected from various sources:(a) NDVI time-series
    data across Australia using the MOD13Q1 data set [48], (b) rainfall and temperature
    data were collected from historic climate data at Australia bureau of metrology,
    (c) maps for observed grain yield were collected at source using intelligent harvesting
    machines. The dataset generated were tested with 9 ML algorithms: RF, XGBoost,
    Cubist, MLP, SVR, Gaussian Process, k-NN, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression
    Splines. The authors combined predictions from each of the algorithms into ensembles
    for prediction optimization [49]. Out of these algorithms, SVR with RBFNN outperformed
    other algorithms and investigators were able to achieve the yield estimate with
    an R 2  of 0.77 and an RMSE value of 0.55t ha −1 . The results were validated
    using 10-fold cross-validation techniques applied to the full data set. Aghighi
    et al. [50] used various advanced regression algorithms to predict the yield of
    silage maize crops. The authors selected maize fields located at Moghan Agro-Industrial
    and Animal Husbandry Company (MAIAHC), which is about 28,000 hectares’ area and
    located in Iran. The crop yield dataset was collected for around 40 silage maize
    fields were collected for a period from 2013-2015. In addition to it, the historic
    crop yield data the authors also gathered time-series NDVI data from Landsat 8
    OLI satellite. The data was fed to advanced regression algorithms: (a) Gaussian
    Process Regression, (b) SVR, (c) Boosted Regression tree (d) RF Regression models
    and the prediction form each of the regression models were compared and evaluated.
    Authors found out the boosted regression tree reported best evaluation parameters
    with an average R-value of higher than 0.87, and RMSE in a range of 8.5 to 11.10,
    with a mean value of 9.5 during the period 2013-14. Kuwata and Shibasaki [51]
    employed DL models to estimate the crop yield. Authors deployed SVR for predicting
    the yield of corn in Illinois. For input following dataset was employed by the
    authors: (a) 5 year moving average of corn crop yield, (b) The enhanced vegetation
    index is obtained using the MOD09A1 dataset MODIS satellite, and (c) Historic
    climatic data. The dataset was fed to support the vector regression model and
    the authors reported an RMSE of 8.204 and a correlation coefficient of 0.644 for
    the model. For result, validation authors conducted 10-fold cross-validation on
    the full data set. Kulkarni et al. [52] utilized DL models to predict rice crop
    yield. The authors utilized soil properties and nutrients measurements recorded
    over 31 years and historic rainfall data. The input data was fed to recurrent
    neural network models for crop yield prediction. For effective prediction the
    authors explored different activation functions viz. sigmoid, reLu, and linear
    in the neural network. Chu and Yu [53] builds an end to end summer and winter
    rice prediction model in 81 counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region,
    China. The proposed BBI model works in three stages, in the first stage the original
    area data and time series metrological data is pre-processed and its output works
    as input for the second stage where BPNN and RNN (recurrent neural network) learns
    deep spatial and temporal features from the input data. In the third stage, BPNN
    learns the relationship between deep features and rice yield to predict the summer
    and winter rice yields. The performance of the model is evaluated in terms of
    error and rate of convergence, the model presents lowest error values with MAE
    and RMSE of 0.0044 and 0.0057 for summer rice prediction and 0.0074 and 0.0192
    for winter rice prediction while the algorithm converges within 100 iterations.
    Feng et al. [54] proposed a hybrid approach for wheat yield prediction in new-south
    Wales in southeastern Australia. Multiple growth specific indicators, viz. agricultural
    production system simulators (APSIM), NDVI, and SPEI (Standardized Precipitation
    and Evapotranspiration Index) are used before the prediction of wheat yield using
    regression models (multiple linear regression (MLR) and RF). APSIM+ RF hybrid
    model presents the best performance among other predictors in terms of prediction
    accuracy. Cai et al. [55] integrated two data sources, i.e. climate data and satellite
    data over fourteen years to predict the wheat yield in Australia using ML algorithms
    (SVM, RF, and NN). Simulation results show that climate data provides distinctive
    information in comparison to satellite data for yield prediction with R 2 of around
    0.75. Planting the crops on accurate date plays an important role in improving
    productivity and reducing financial loss. Gumuscu et al. [56] explored three supervised
    ML algorithms; kNN, SVM, and decision trees for predicting planting dates; early,
    normal, and late for wheat crops in Turkey. The authors utilized climate data
    of the last 300 days to train ML algorithms and explored GA for feature selection.
    kNN classification ML algorithm shows robust performance and best predicts the
    planting dates of wheat crops. Several African, American, and Asian countries
    are the major producer of coffee in the world. Nevavuori et al. [57] explored
    a deep learning approach, i.e. CNN for wheat and barley yield prediction in the
    agriculture field of Pori, Finland. NDVI and RGB dataset obtained from cameras
    installed in UAV is used to train the six-layer CNN. RGB dataset best predicts
    the crop yield in CNN with MAE of 484.3 kgha−1 and mean absolute percentage error
    (MAPE) of 8.8%. Koirala et al. [58] reviewed deep learning approaches for fruit
    detection and yield estimation. CNN in the context of computer vision is widely
    used for feature extraction from images that provide useful insight to object
    detection and yield estimation. Kouadio, et al. [59] predicted the Robusta coffee
    yield using ML techniques from soil fertility dataset of Vietnam. ELM model outperforms
    multiple linear regression and RF algorithm with RMSE of 496.35 kg ha−1 and MAE
    of 326.40 kg ha−1. Gamboa et al. [60] predict the cocoa yield in Santander, Columbia
    using a generalized linear model (GLM) and SVM. In recent decades researchers
    have explored statistical and probabilistic models for crop yield prediction.
    Gyamerah et al. [61] proposed a novel robust probabilistic forecasting model based
    on quantile random forest and Epanechnikov kernel function (QRF-E) for crop yield
    prediction in Ghana. The proposed approach didn’t only predict discrete yield
    values but completely showcase probability descriptions for prediction interval
    for the two crops groundnut and millet. The simulation result shows the superior
    performance of the proposed algorithm in terms of prediction intervals coverage
    probability and prediction interval normalized average width under uncertain weather
    conditions. Peng et al. [62] explored remote sensed satellite-based Solar-Induced
    Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) dataset for training ML algorithms to predict maize
    and soybean yield in the mid-west region of the United States. Simulation results
    show that non-linear algorithms such as SVM, ANN, RF best predict the crop yield
    in comparison to least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression (LASSO)
    and ridge regression (RIDGE) algorithm. Khaki and Wang [63] predicted the hybrid
    maize yield with a dataset of 2,267 locations of the United States and Canada
    between the years 2008 to 2016 using deep neural networks (DNN). Genotype, weather,
    and soil properties were the three components used to train DNN. The proposed
    model accurately predicts the maize yield with RMSE of 12% of the average yield
    for predicted weather dataset and 11% of the average yield for perfect weather
    dataset and outperforms LASSO, shallow neural network (SNN) and regression tree
    (RT). Simulation results show that environmental factors have a large impact on
    the prediction accuracy of crop yield. In most areas of Africa, agriculture field
    data is scarcely available thus remotely sensed dataset is widely used for monitoring
    the field. Leroux et al. [64] explored the ML algorithm for predicting the maize
    yield in Burkina Faso with a remotely sensed dataset. A process-based crop model
    SARRO which is basically designed to simulate attainable agricultural yields under
    tropical conditions is used in this study. RF outperforms MLR in maize yield prediction
    with R 2 of 0.59 at the end of the season and 0.49 before two months of harvest.

    using climate, satellite, and country-specific datasets in the mid-west region
    of the USA. Maimaitijiang et al. [66] explored the potential of UAV with DNN for
    soybean yield prediction from the fields of Columbia, Missouri, USA. Multi-modal
    information such as canopy spectral, structural, and thermal features extracted
    from images obtained from the sensors installed on UAV is used as the input dataset
    for training DNN. The simulation result shows that DNN accurately predict the
    crop yield and outperforms partial least square regression (PLSR), RF, SVR algorithms
    with R 2 of 0.720 and RMSE of 15.9%. Zhang et al. [67] explored ANN for prediction
    of annual crop planting utilizing a historical cropland data layer (CDL) dataset
    of corn-belt of mid-west, USA. Kocian et al. [68] utilized both approaches to
    predict crop growth in greenhouses. IoT smart sensors are installed in the greenhouses
    to monitor different environmental parameters, soil properties and plant growth
    parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), accumulated dry weight (DW) and evapo-transpiration
    (ET). These parameters are in real-time send to the cloud through IoT devices
    and permit the implementation of an agriculture decision-support system. The probabilistic
    Bayesian network is explored in the proposed system to predict crop development
    parameters. Shahinfar and Kahn [69] explored ML algorithms for early prediction
    of adult wool growth in Merino sheep of Australia. Model Tree algorithms best
    predict the wool growth in comparison with NN with a correlation coefficient of
    0.93, 0.90, 0.94, 0.81 and 0.59, MAE of 0.48 kg, 0.41 kg, 0.92 μm , 6.91mm and
    6.82 N/ktex, for predicting Greasy Fleece Weight, adult Clean Fleece Weight, adult
    Fibre Diameter and adult Staple Length. Table 5 presents a comparative study of
    different ML algorithms for crop yield prediction. TABLE 5 Different ML Algorithms
    for Crop Yield Prediction C. Disease and Weed Detection Disease fungi, microorganisms,
    and bacteria take their energy from the plants they live on, which in turn affects
    the crop yield. If not detected at the right time may account for a huge economic
    loss to farmers. A lot of financial burden goes to a farmer in the form of pesticides,
    to get rid of diseases and restore the functioning of crops. Excessive use of
    pesticides also leads to environmental damage and the effects of the water and
    soil cycle of the agricultural land. Using an optimally designed AI system during
    crop growth period not only reduces the risk of crop disease and minimizes the
    economic impact, but it also results in minimizing the adverse impact of unsystematic
    farming on the environment. Sambasivan and Opiyo [70] used a CNN based DL model
    to detect disease in cassava crops for imbalanced datasets. The authors took a
    database of 10,000 labeled images that were pre-processed to improve the image
    contrast using contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization algorithm. The
    model evaluation was done using the performance metrics: confusion matrix, accuracy
    measure, precision measure, sensitivity, and F1 score. The authors reported a
    best-case accuracy of 99.30% and the lowest accuracy was reported as 76.9%. Ramcharan
    et al. [71] used DL algorithms to detect diseases in cassava crops. Authors deployed
    deep CNN to identify three different diseases and two types of pests from a set
    of 11,670 images dataset. Author’s utilized GoogLeNet algorithm based Inception
    v3 in Tensor Flow. The authors achieved efficiency in a range of 80% to 93.0%,
    and the validation of the results was done with the help of the confusion matrix.
    Mohanty et al. [72] employed DL methods to detect crop disease from the image
    dataset of plant leaves. The authors used a public database consisting of smartphone
    generated 54,306 images of diseased and healthy plants leaves. These images were
    resized to 256×256 pixels and were assigned 38 different class labels of crop-disease
    pair, and transformed into 3 datasets color, grayscale and segmented. The dataset
    was then fed to two of the most common deep CNNs: AlexNet [73] and GoogLeNet [74].
    The authors achieved an accuracy of 99.34% for GoogLeNet, and an accuracy of 85.53%
    for AlexNet network. The results were validated using F1 score, authors achieved
    a mean F1 score of 0.9886 for GoogLeNet, and a mean F1 score of 0.9848 for AlexNet.
    Amara et al. [75] used LeNet based CNN architecture for disease detection in banana
    leaves. Authors utilized data from open source local and digital libraries which
    were pre-processed and resized to 60×60 pixels, and the model was implemented
    for RGB as well as grayscale images. Hughes and Salathe [76] utilized this developed
    model for the identification of diseases in the images dataset. The authors achieved
    the best F1 score of 0.9971 for detection in RGB images and a score of 0.976 for
    grayscale images. Ferreira et al. [77] deployed CNN for the identification of
    weeds in soybean crops. The image dataset for soy plantation located at São José
    farm, Campo Grande Brazil was acquired using phantom DJI3 drone. The images are
    segmented using the SLIC algorithm into square grids. For training, the segmented
    images were manually annotated to their class. The segmented images dataset was
    fed to AlexNet (a convolution neural network) for classification. The performance
    of the AlexNet was compared with SVM, AdaBoost, and RF. To evaluate the performance
    of the AlexNet the model was fed with a balanced dataset and the authors reported
    an overall accuracy of above 90% and 96.3% images were correctly classified. Waheed
    et al. [78] proposed a cost-effective optimized dense CNN (DenseNet) for disease
    detection in corn leaves with an accuracy of 98.0%. Simulation results show that
    the proposed model outperforms other CNN models such as EfficientNet, VGG19Net,
    NASNet, and XceptionNet in terms of fewer parameters, accuracy, computation complexity,
    and computation time. Pereira et al. [79] proposed an expert system for identifying
    three species of aquatic weeds from aquatic weed leaves dataset based on their
    shape and supervised pattern recognition techniques. The author explored five
    shape descriptors with different shape-based skills viz. Beam Angle Statistics
    (BAS), Fourier Descriptors (FD), Moment Invariants (MI), Multi-scale Fractal dimension
    (MS), and Tensor Scale Descriptor (TSD) along with five ML algorithms viz. Optimum-Path
    Forest (OPF), SVM, Naive Bayes, ANN, MLP. Simulation results show that OPF using
    the BAS-100 descriptor presents the best results with a recognition rate of 96.41%
    in comparison to other approaches. Jiang et al. [80] proposed a semi-supervised
    CNN feature-based Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) for identifying weeds utilizing
    6000 images of corn, lettuce, radish, and mixed weed dataset. The proposed approach
    works in two parts, i.e. in the first part CNN model is used for feature extraction
    thereafter in the second part GCN graph is explored utilizing CNN feature dataset
    for extracting feature of an unlabelled dataset using labelled dataset. The proposed
    approach shows the best results in comparison with AlexNet, VGG16, and ResNet-101
    approaches with recognition accuracies of 97.80%, 99.37%, 98.93%, and 96.51% on
    four different weed datasets. Oppenheim and Shani [81] explored CNN for identifying
    four different types of diseases in potatoes. The simulation result shows that
    the model trained on 90% of the images and tested on 10% of images give the best
    results with 96% accuracy. Sugar beet contributes around 30% of world sugar production.
    Leaf spot diseases in sugar beet can create a loss of around 10 % to 50 % of yearly
    sugar yield. Rumpf et al. [82] proposed SVM with a radial basis function as a
    kernel based model for early detection and classification of three diseases Cercospora,
    leaf spot, leaf rust, and powdery mildew in sugar beet leaves. Diseased and non-diseased
    leaves were classified with an accuracy of 97% and three diseases were identified
    with accuracy higher than 86%. Ozguven and Adem [83] proposed updated faster R-CNN
    for leaf spot disease identification and classification in sugar beet. Leaf spot
    disease initially generates as small circular spots and later spread over the
    entire leaf surface. The proposed R-CNN architecture changes its parameters according
    to the images and the disease infected regions, which improves the overall classification
    rate to 95.48%. Bah et al. [84] explored CNN for weed detection in images obtained
    using UAV from bean and spinach fields. The proposed model first identifies the
    crop rows and then identifies the inter-crop row weeds which are used as a training
    dataset for CNN for crop and weed identification and classification. Kerkech et
    al. [85] identified the vine diseases from visible and infrared UAV images obtained
    in the Center Val de Loire region in France. A CNN model is trained with this
    dataset of images to classify each pixel according to different instances, namely,
    shadow, ground, healthy, and symptom. The model identifies with an accuracy of
    92% at grapevine-level and 87% at leaf level. Oslen et al. [86] explored robust
    deep learning models Inception-v3 and ResNet-50 for weed species identification
    and classification from a dataset of images collected in Australian rangeland.
    Simulation results show that the average classification performance of both the
    models is 95.1% and 95.7%. These results found fruitful for automatic real-time
    robotic weed control in the agricultural field. Sudars et al. [87] establish an
    experimental set up with RGB digital cameras in Latvia to collect images of the
    field having 6 food crops and 8 weed species grown in normal field conditions
    and controlled environment. This dataset can be utilized by deep learning algorithms
    for weed identification and classification. Sethy et al. [88] identified the rice
    leaf disease based on a hybrid CNN and SVM. In this model, CNN is explored for
    deep feature extraction from 5932 diseased rice leaf images and this data is used
    as input for SVM classifier. The resnet50 with SVM classification model best classify
    with respect to other models with F1 score of 0.9838. Garcia et al. [89] proposed
    an ML and DL learning hybrid approach for weed and crop identification in the
    agriculture fields of Greece. Image dataset of two crops tomato and cotton and
    two weeds black nightshade and velvetleaf was generated for training and testing
    of the model. Initially CNN (Xception, Inception-Resnet, Vignette’s, Mobilenet,
    and Densenet)) is used for feature extraction and this feature set is later used
    to train ML classifier (SVM, XGBoost and Logistic Regression) for classification.
    The simulation result shows that Densenet and Support Vector Machine outperforms
    other approaches with F1 score of 99.29%. Shah and Jain [90] identified the disease
    in cotton leaf through ANN with some image pre-processing techniques. Yu et al.
    [91] explored deep learning algorithms with a dataset of images for identifying
    dandelion, ground ivy, and spotted spurge in perennial ryegrass. Parraga-Alava
    et al. [92] generated a robusta coffee leaf image dataset (RoCoLe) for disease
    identification using ML algorithms. Glezakos et al. [93] proposed an innovative
    method to identify two viruses Tobacco Rattle Virus (TRV) and the Cucumber Green
    Mottle Mosaic Virus (CGMMV) in plants. In the proposed research Bio-Electric Recognition
    Assay (BERA) technique is utilized to obtain time-series information of the two
    viruses by measuring the waves through biosensors for 331s. This time-series data
    is preprocessed using GA to eliminate noise and for dimensionality reduction of
    a large dataset. Thereafter this meta-data is used to train MLP neural network
    classifier. The proposed model is tested against other ML classifiers via cross-validation.
    Ramesh and Vydeki [94] explored optimized deep NN with the Jaya algorithm for
    the identification of paddy leaf diseases. A dataset of rice plant leaves was
    taken from the agricultural field to identify and classify normal, bacterial blight,
    brown spot, sheath rot, and blast diseases. Simulation results show that the proposed
    model accurately classifies the diseased and normal images with an accuracy of
    98.9%, 95.78%, 92%, 94%, and 90.57% for blast affected, bacterial blight, sheath
    rot, brown spot, and normal rice leaf images. Chechlin’ ski et al. [95] explored
    CNN for weed identification in four plant species at different growth level and
    under varying light conditions. CNN architecture combines U-Net, MobileNets, DenseNet,
    and ResNet models for classification of weeds in crops. In [96]–[99] author has
    reviewed machine and deep learning techniques for weed, pests and disease identification,
    and classification in crops at different growth stages. Table 6 presents a comparative
    study of different ML algorithms for disease and weed identification. TABLE 6
    Different ML Algorithms for Disease and Weed Identification D. Drip Irrigation
    In the modern era, irrigation for crops has been improvised using the concept
    of drip irrigation [100], where the system consists of thin plastic tubes placed
    in or above the soil along the vertical rows of the plants for nurturing the water
    supply to the crops. Employing the proper operational management of drip irrigation,
    minimizes the utilization of water supply for crop production, and provides a
    better yield of crops. Socio-economic and environmental demands have widely appreciated
    in use of drip irrigation on farmlands for agriculture, especially for the high
    cost valued crops i.e., vegetables and fruits. Furthermore, drip irrigation is
    based on the low-pressure watering system in comparison to sprinkler systems;
    this makes the system more efficient in terms of energy consumption [101]. Various
    advantages have been observed using drip irrigation in agriculture over other
    irrigation systems which include sub-irrigation systems or sprinkler irrigation
    systems. These advantages are entitled to minimal usage of water supply, usage
    of soluble fertilizers through a drip irrigation system, automated system, minimization
    of soil erosion, uninterrupted activities, minimized weed problems, facilitation
    of double-cropping. Precision irrigation is another innovative approach in intelligent
    farming where it uses the water intelligently that further helps the farmers to
    achieve better yield in crops with minimal water usage. It can also be featured
    as providing the right amount of water, at the right time and the right place
    in the field. It focuses its implementation based on variable rate irrigation
    (VRI) methods employing drips or sprinklers. [102]–[104]. Advancements in the
    field of on-farm sensor technologies, weather forecasting, IoT based sensor detection
    system of vegetation and precision-based smart irrigation produces a huge size
    of data that ultimately benefits the farmers in optimizing the usage of water
    resources, improve the yield of crops and maximizes the profit of farmers [105].
    ML and DL and reinforcement learning are employed on the historical data and it
    provides various opportunities for real-time prediction and decision making purposes
    for smart irrigation which are solely based on the data collected by the sensors
    and IoT enabled systems [106]–[109]. Roberts et al. [110] have discussed that
    a sensor-based control system might create some bottleneck in terms of reducing
    the reliability of decision support tools on process-based crop models, which
    further may require costly calibration and affect in generating an uncertain representation
    of soil-plant-atmosphere processes. Further, ML techniques have been employed
    extremely well for protection analysis of hydrological processes i.e., soil moisture
    and groundwater levels [111], [112]. Li et al. [113] utilized ANN for estimating
    nitrate distribution in different types of soils under a drip irrigation system.
    Kavianand et al. [114] proposed a fully automated drip irrigation system based
    on the ARM9 processor along with different kinds of sensors equipped for monitoring
    the PH content and nitrogen content of the soil and controlling the irrigation
    of the field. Emmanuel et al. [115] establishes an experimental set-up in a greenhouse
    in Malaysia to monitor the growth of mustard leaf vegetable plants through IoT
    devices and alongside developed a data-driven model of drip irrigation system.
    Soil moisture, irrigation volume, evapotranspiration were measured through sensors
    and were given to the Raspberry Pi 3 controller for storing it in the cloud. This
    data was utilized by different predictive models ARX, BJ, and state-space models
    to predict soil moisture content for an optimized drip irrigation system. ARX
    model outperforms other predictive models in terms of MSE and response time. Seyedzadeh
    et al. [116] explored ML algorithms to optimize the uniform emitter discharge
    rate of drip irrigation system under varying pressure and temperature conditions.
    In this model operating pressure, water temperature, discharge coefficient, pressure
    exponent, and nominal discharge were taken as input parameters while ration of
    emitter discharge to nominal discharge is taken as output temperature. Authors
    explored four different ML algorithms for optimizing emitter discharge rate and
    simulation results show that LS-SVM presents best results with the least error
    of mean absolute error. Peng et al. [117] utilize soil moisture, soil electrical
    conductivity, air temperature, and light intensity parameters to build an optimized
    irrigation prediction model using backpropagation NN in China. The proposed prediction
    model presents good results with MSE of 0.00857724. The authors also identified
    an optimized layout and network arrangement for pipe in a drip irrigation system
    using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The simulation results present
    that the H-shaped network layout is more suitable for field crop irrigation than
    the comb-shaped and fish bone-shaped layout. Drip irrigation system gives the
    best performance when the wetting front dimension, i.e. diameter, depth, and upward
    movement are optimized. Shiri et al. [118] explored soft-computing approaches
    viz., gene expressions programming (GEP), and RF techniques in modeling wetting
    front dimensions over different soil types for surface and sub-surface irrigation
    system. Proposed model, best predicts ETc with an improved correlation coefficient
    and decreases MSE and MAE. Elnesr and Alazba [119] explored ANN for predicting
    the wetting front dimensions from the dataset of a well-tested HYDRUS 2D/3D model.
    The simulation results show that the proposed model has a good correlation of
    0.93-0.99. Chang et al. [120] developed a smart irrigation model based on ML with
    the LoRa P2P network to learn the irrigation experiences from the expert farmers
    working on greenhouse organic crops. Singh et al. [121] have discussed an ML and
    IoT based model for soil moisture prediction during irrigation. Torres-Sanchez
    et al. [122] proposed a decision support system for irrigation management of citric
    crops in southeast Spain. In the proposed model smart sensors are deployed in
    the field to monitor water supplied previous week, weather data, soil water status,
    and based on this data three regression models SVM, RF, and Linear regression
    was trained to build the irrigation decision support system. RF best predicts
    with comparatively less prediction error. Hellín et al. [123] explored the Partial
    Least Square Regression (PLSR) and Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS)
    model for building a smart irrigation decision support system crops in southeast
    Spain. Goumopoulos et al. [124] proposed a real-time adaptable intelligent and
    autonomous closed-loop irrigation management system. The authors built an experimental
    set-up in a greenhouse and deployed wireless sensors for monitoring the plant
    growth and environmental conditions along with plant growth control actuators.
    Estimation of evapotranspiration (ETc) plays a vital role in water resource management
    system. Chen et al. [125] estimate crop actual ETc from temporal convolution network
    (TCN) from the dataset of lysimeters for maize under drip irrigation with film
    mulch. Simulation results show that the proposed model best predicts ETc with
    an improved correlation coefficient and decreases MSE and MAE. Table 7 presents
    a comparative study of different ML algorithms for drip irrigation. TABLE 7 Different
    ML Algorithms for Drip Irrigation E. Livestock Production and Management Livestock
    production is basically related to the production and management of cattle i.e.,
    sheep, pigs, etc. for human consumption in terms of meat. Livestock production
    and their management are based on the farming parameters of these cattle i.e.,
    health, food, nutrition, and behaviour to optimize their production in such a
    way that the economic efficiency of this livestock can be maximized. In the present
    scenario, Artificial intelligence, IoT and Blockchain technologies [126] are widely
    explored to improves livestock sustainability and for analysis of their chewing
    habits, eating patterns, their movement patterns i.e., standing, moving, drinking
    and feeding habits, indicate the amount of stress the animal is going through
    which in turn helps in predicting the vulnerability to disease, weight gain, and
    production of the livestock. Furthermore, an ML-based weight predicting system
    can help in the estimation of their body weight 90–180 days before the slaughtering
    day. According to these analyses and estimations, farmers can change their diet
    plans and living conditions for their better growth in terms of health, behaviour,
    and weight gain which in turn will improve the economic efficiency of these livestock
    [127], [128]. Villeneuve et al. [129] build a decision support system that encounters
    not only real-time data but also expert knowledge for precision sheep farming.
    Livestock production and management can be further classified into two sub-categories,
    i.e., animal welfare and livestock production. Animal welfare generally deals
    with the animal’s health and their well-being; for this ML techniques are applied
    to their health monitoring feature for prospective of early disease detection.
    Whereas, livestock production employs the ML on the estimation of the balanced
    production of livestock for the producers to achieve economic benefits. Dutta
    et al. [130] described a procedure for the classification of cattle behaviour
    employing the ML techniques for data collection using collar-based sensors i.e.,
    magnetometers and three-axis accelerometers. In this study, events such as oestrus
    and dietary changes on cattle have been analyzed for their well-nutrition. Pegorini
    et al. [131] presented an automatic identification and classification of chewing
    habits of claves employing ML-based techniques for analysing their health and
    behavioural patterns. Ebrahimie et al. [132] proposed ML predictive model for
    estimating Sub-Clinical Mastitis (SCM) from milking parameters in dairy herds.
    Mastitis is an inflammatory disease that is widely affecting the dairy industry.
    Author’s explored four classification models decision trees, stump decision trees,
    parallel decision trees, and random forest to discover SCC independent of Somatic
    Cell Count (SCC) which is widely used to measure SCM worldwide. RF with Gini Index
    criteria best predicts SCM with an accuracy of 90%. Ebrahimie et al. [133] explored
    the attribute weighting model (AWM) for identifying lactose concentration and
    electrical conductivity in milk, which are two of the major indicators of SCM
    in dairy cattle. Hyde et al. [134] also explored RF to predict the route of transmission
    of germs and classify them into contagious (CONT) or environmental (ENV) with
    ENV further sub-classified into non-lactating “dry” period (EDP) or lactating
    period (EL). The simulation results show that an accuracy of 98% was achieved
    for discovering CONT vs ENV and 78% for discovering EDP and EL. Esener et al.
    [135] utilized spectral profiles dataset to discriminates CONT and ENV strains
    using GA, NN, and quick classifier. Ebrahimi et al. [136] predicted sub-clinical
    bovine mastitis using a large milking dataset collected through an automated in-line
    monitoring system in commercial New Zealand dairy farm. The simulation results
    show that GBM outperforms other ML model and best predict sub-clinical bovine
    mastitis with an accuracy of 84.9%. Sharifi et al. [137] explored meta-analysis
    and decision trees data mining tools to discover genes that can help to find mastitis
    in dairy cattle. Machado et al. [138] explored the RF model to identify factors
    influencing the occurrence of Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) viral disease
    in cattle in southern Brazil. The proposed approach identifies that insemination,
    the number of cattle in neighbouring farms, and routine rectal palpation are among
    the main factors of the occurrence of this disease. Matthews et al. [139] developed
    an ML-based automated monitoring system for tracking animal behaviour and movement
    i.e., standing, moving, feeding, and drinking by employing the depth video cameras
    and sensors. Qiao et al. [140] explored the DL technique Mask R-CNN for examining
    cattle health and welfare information in precision livestock management. The proposed
    model extract key features from image frames, enhance the image to remove non-uniform
    illumination shadow influences, segment image of cattle from the background image
    using the Mask R-CNN DL tool, and lastly extract cattle contour lines from the
    segmented image. The proposed approach outperforms SharpMask and DeepMask image
    segmentation models with mean pixel accuracy of 0.92 and an average distance error
    of 33.56 pixels. Liakos et al. [141] explored ML model for predicting healthy
    cattle and cattle suffering from lameness utilizing basic features of cattle which
    includes per day habits of cattle like steps taken, overall walking, lying, and
    eating habits. Morales et al. [142] employed a method based on SVM for early detection,
    warnings, and production issues of eggs in the poultry farms. The simulation results
    show that the proposed technique alerts a day before with an estimation accuracy
    of 0.9854. The identification of livestock is an important aspect of monitoring
    growth and animal welfare. Hansen et al. [143] explored deep learning techniques
    CNN for identifying pigs faces from the dataset of digital images of pigs obtained
    from commercial farm environment where the parameters such as dirt and lighting
    are highly unpredictable. The proposed approach accurately predicts the faces
    with an accuracy of 96.7%. Fenlon et al. [144] build a decision support system
    using predictive ML algorithms to provide calving assistance in the dairy industry.
    Four ML techniques multimodal regression, decision trees, RF, and NN were explored
    to predict three calving difficulties unassisted, slight assistance, and veterinary
    assistance. The simulation result shows that NN and multimodal regression models
    accurately classify 75% of calving difficulties with an average prediction error
    of 3.7% and 4.5%. Fenlon et al. [145] analyzed calving difficulties in dairy herds
    in Ireland using ML algorithms. A dataset of parity, log days in milk, inter-service
    interval, difficulties faced in the last calving, herd body conditions were built
    to predict conceptions using artificial insemination in the Iris dairy industry.
    Logistic regression outperforms RF, decision trees, and Naive Bayes in predicting
    conception using artificial insemination. Borchers et al. [146] explored RF, linear
    discriminant, and NN for calving prediction in dairy cattle by examining their
    behaviour which includes number the of steps, lying time, standing time, transition
    from one state to other and total motion 14 days before the predicted calving
    date. Although, the innovative algorithms play a crucial role in livestock management
    but combining livestock data with public data will improve precision livestock
    farming standards [147]. Table 8 presents a comparative study of different ML
    algorithms for livestock production and management. TABLE 8 Different ML Algorithms
    for Livestock Production and Management F. Intelligent Harvesting Techniques Smart
    harvesting systems helps the farmers to harvest agriculture goods by reducing
    human efforts. In this approach, technologies such as smart sensors, robotics,
    UAVs, and IoT devices [148], AI, and ML-based computer vision techniques are employed
    to intelligently harvest the crops. The research community has provided a comprehensive
    review of different intelligent techniques used to automate the agriculture industry
    [149]–[151] and have analyzed the potential and challenges of this decision support
    system [152]. In the last few years, different robots have been developed for
    harvesting fruits and vegetables [153]. Smart harvesting offers better insight
    into the crops and helps farmers to achieve the potential harvest of crops which
    leads to increased productivity. Smart harvesting system has numerous advantages
    in comparison to traditional harvesting approaches like it requires less labour,
    optimized crop yield, maximum probability, better insight into crops, reduced
    cost of harvesting, and cost-efficient production. A significant problem in the
    Japanese agriculture industry is a labour shortage. Sakai et al. [154] utilized
    machine vision for asparagus robot harvesting in Nagasaki prefecture. The speed
    of asparagus robot harvesting is three times faster than the human being. Since
    asparagus harvesting is modeled on their size and doesn’t require color properties
    thus laser sensor is used to collect 3D distance information in the proposed work.
    Monta et al. [155] also explored laser sensors along with color cameras for tomato
    harvesting through robots. Preter et al. [156] developed an autonomous system
    consisting of e-vehicle, cameras, robotic arm, localization system, gripper, quality
    monitoring, and logistic handling system, which can efficiently detect, plucks,
    and puts the strawberries in a box. The proposed robot prototype is fast enough
    to pluck the fruit in just 4 seconds. Hayashi et al. [157] practically evaluated
    the performance of strawberry harvesting robots in a greenhouse test field. The
    proposed autonomous system efficiently access the fruit position and its maturity
    level and pick the fruit with and without suction in a duration of two to three
    weeks without damaging the fruit. Horng et al. [158] proposed a smart harvesting
    system that employs IoT and smart image recognition systems for the detection
    of mature crops using object detection feature trained on MLP neural network.
    The mature crop can be harvested using a robotic arm whose movement is predicted
    using ML algorithms. Zhang et al. [159] explored Regions-CNN (RCNN) for multi-class
    canopy object detection in shake and catch the apple harvesting system. A dataset
    of RGB images was created in the commercial orchard using a Kinect v2 sensor and
    pre-trained RCNN is utilized for real-time detection of apple, branches, and trunks.
    The authors also developed an estimation algorithm to predict shaking location
    based on the results of RCNN. Spectral and thermal images have also been explored
    for the detection of fruits and vegetables [160], [161]. Zhang et al. [162] investigated
    eleven canopy parameters using principal component analysis (PCA) and classified
    the removal status of apples into mechanically harvested and mechanically unharvested.
    Zhang et al. [163] reviewed technology progress in the mechanical harvesting of
    apples which includes shake and catch, robots, and harvest assist platforms. Pise
    and Upadhye [164] explored Naive Bayes and SVM ML techniques for grading of harvested
    mangoes based on their color, size, features, quality, and maturity. Grading of
    fruits increases the profit of the agriculture and food industries. A mango image
    dataset comprising of three different colors red, green, and yellow is created
    and is used for training and testing the ML algorithm. The proposed approach presents
    limited scope as it can detect defects in a particular surface area which can
    be overcome by creating a dataset of rotational view images. Wu et al. [165] explored
    NN for recognition, classification of fruits and vegetables, and obstacle avoidance
    in a harvesting robot. Table 9 presents a comparative study of different ML algorithms
    for intelligent harvesting. TABLE 9 Different ML Algorithms for Intelligent Harvesting
    SECTION V. IoT Applications in Precision Agriculture Precision agriculture refers
    to a system with minimizing direct involvement of the caretaker/farmer except
    when there is an urgent need or an emergency i.e. when there is a failure in the
    system. IoT helps in maintaining the defined standards of parameters needed for
    day to day work in agriculture. The parameters can be measured using the required
    sensors and can be uploaded to an IoT cloud for remote monitoring so that the
    direct involvement of farmers is minimized. The IoT cloud can be used for control
    purposes also, say for example in detecting and avoiding animal intrusion in the
    agriculture field. Sensors are an integral part of IoT for precision agriculture
    without which the monitoring and controlling becomes next to impossible task.
    Figure 6 shows the trend search of keywords “IoT in agriculture” and “sensor in
    agriculture” on google in the last 10 years. Apart from monitoring and controlling,
    IoT in agriculture is also used as data-storage technology. Parameters like properties
    of soil, crop yield, seasonal behaviour data, temperature changes, etc can be
    stored on the IoT cloud which will be helpful in analyses, prediction, and deciding
    on estimated crop production. FIGURE 6. Google trend response for keywords IoT
    in agriculture and sensor in agriculture for the last 10 years. Show All A. Sensors
    for IoT in Precision Agriculture IoT is defined as the interconnection of things,
    where one example of a thing is a sensor. A group of sensors can communicate with
    every other sensor and thereby with the control center. A WSN in IoT has the benefits
    of increasing the efficiency of production, enhancing the yield quality, detecting
    and avoiding plant-eating pets, detecting the fires in the farms [166]. IoT has
    helped in increasing the scope of farming, animal, and pet rearing along with
    smart irrigation [167]. Sensors form an integral part of IoT architecture in agriculture.
    A sensor is defined as a transducer that converts the sensed parameter (soil moisture,
    for example) into the equivalent electrical signal. Depending on the nature of
    the output signal they generate, sensors are classified as analog or digital sensors.
    An analog sensor’s output needs to be converted to digital before it is being
    fed, processed by any IoT system. On the other hand, sensors that generate signals
    in digital form can be directly connected to any IoT system. Table 10 compares
    the list of some important sensors applicable in precision agriculture. Addressing
    the complete list of sensors available for precision agriculture is beyond the
    scope of this article, although, table 10 provides the list of sensors and their
    parameters that are very widely used and covers almost every aspect of IoT in
    agriculture. A pair of sensors and actuators can be used to collect information
    about some of the vital parameters of precision agriculture and react to perform
    predefined action whenever required. IoT plays an important role in assuring that
    the action performed happens instantaneously with minimum delay. The factors that
    can affect the real-time decision making and causes a delay is the tolerance of
    the measuring parameter and the communication protocol used. The operating temperature
    where the sensors are placed have a proportional effect on tolerance. An increase
    temperature on either side will increase the tolerance of the measuring parameter
    and sensor reading will deviate the value of the measurand from the actual value.
    The communication protocol is used to send the readings of the sensor to the microcontroller
    from where the value will be uploaded to the IoT cloud. The data rate of communication
    protocol decides the time required for this data transfer. TABLE 10 Sensor Parameters
    Used in Precision Agriculture B. Wireless Sensor Networks in Precision Agriculture
    WSN is the collection of spatially displaced sensor deployed to monitor the physical
    parameters of the environment and coordinating the collected data at central location.
    IoT transfers the recorded data to cloud which is further processed and analyzed
    through intelligent algorithms. In precision agriculture integration of artificial
    intelligence with WSN allows real time monitoring and intelligent decision making
    in agriculture fields. IoT sensor network which includes soil moisture senor,
    electrochemical sensor, optical sensors, etc. continuously monitor the field data
    and works as a training data for ML and DL algorithms. Edge computing enabled
    AI systems assist in reducing the amount of data to be uploaded to IoT cloud by
    identification of meaningful data to be communicated and discarding the redundant
    data. Intelligent processing of data generated from nodes result in better management
    of sensor network In [185] author utilized AI driven sensor network to classify
    land as suitable, more suitable, moderately suitable and unsuitable after every
    cultivation. In [186] author developed a power efficient WSN using Arduino microcontroller
    and ZigBee module to monitor and control essential parameters that effect crop
    growth such as soil and weather conditions in Florida, USA. In [187] author integrating
    sensor nodes with AI systems to reduce the power consumption of nodes by optimizing
    the performance and data transmission of respective nodes. RNN based Long-Short
    term (LSTM) network was built which increases the runtime of a single sensor and
    guarantees 180 days autonomous operation using Li-ion battery. The proposed system
    continuously monitors the growth dynamics of plant leaves. In [188] author presents
    an autonomous system built with low power sensor nodes and IoT based cloud platform
    to estimate level of phosphorous in soil through ANN. Author incorporates dynamic
    power management system to maintain balance between energy consumption and estimation
    accuracy. In [189] author presents GA optimized WSN for precision agriculture
    applications. Thus, we conclude that integrating artificial intelligence with
    WSN, IoT plays a key role in assuring the best yield of crops. SECTION VI. Assessment
    and Evaluation of Knowledge-Based Agriculture System In this section ML algorithms
    used by different researchers in the precision agriculture system are analyzed.
    The agriculture industry is facing many challenges across the world, and a knowledge-based
    agriculture system allows sustainable use of resources by the farmers aiming to
    get maximum output from the agriculture land. There are two basic stages in precision
    agriculture, i.e. pre-processing stage and processing stage. In the pre-processing
    phase market trends are studied and based on geographical conditions and soil
    properties of the land seeds are selected and the land is prepared for precision
    agriculture system. In the post-processing stage machine vision techniques are
    explored for disease and weed identification while intelligent techniques are
    used for irrigation and harvesting. In this article, author reviewed and discussed
    70 articles where multiple ML algorithms are presented for performance optimization
    of the agricultural cycle. Figure 7 shows the classification of articles based
    on different applications of precision agriculture. FIGURE 7. Classification based
    on agriculture cycle. Show All Figure 8 depicts the cumulative distribution of
    the ML and DL models used by researchers in precision agriculture. The graph depicts
    the broad categorisation of the techniques with their applications to agricultural
    cycle. It has been observed that in majority of the literature the researchers
    have applied multiple algorithms for classification and parameter prediction.
    Regression models and ANN together make up around 65% of the AI techniques employed
    by researchers. Hence, it is important to investigate the techniques used and
    compared by the authors. The individual best performing algorithms have already
    been covered in appropriate sections, however the figure 8 depicts the distribution
    of the various regression algorithms and DL models throughout the literature.
    ELM algorithm is widely explored in prediction of soil properties such as soil
    moisture, soil temperature, surface humidity, ETc. ANN accurately predicts the
    rainfall and crop yield across different regions of globe. DL based CNN model
    finds wide applications for accurate disease and weed classification in agriculture
    crops. ANN model best predicts the nitrate content and water requirement in drip
    irrigation system. SVM regression model estimates the emitter outflow discharge
    under varying temperature and pressure conditions. Decision Tree algorithm accurately
    identify the chewing habits and predicts SCM in dairy herds. CNN have widely explored
    for livestock identification. Metaheuristic optimized ML algorithms are also explored
    by researchers in precision agriculture. FIGURE 8. ML techniques used in precision
    agriculture applications. Show All In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 22 different regression algorithms for prediction, however 5 most commonly
    used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 9. Remaining 17 algorithms
    which are used either only for comparison or employed as a support algorithms
    have been classified into others. FIGURE 9. Regression algorithm in precision
    agriculture. Show All DL models have contributed significantly and outperforms
    ML classification algorithms in classification of crop disease and weed as well
    as for livestock diseases identification. Figure 10 shows CNN, ANN and RNN algorithms
    explored in precision agriculture. In the reviewed articles, authors have used
    around 10 different DL/NN algorithms for prediction/classification, however 8
    most commonly used algorithms are identified and depicted in the figure 10. Remaining
    2 (LeNet, and Caffee) algorithms which are used either only for comparison or
    employed as a support algorithms have been classified into others. FIGURE 10.
    Classification algorithm in precision agriculture. Show All A. Performance Comparison
    of ML Algorithms in Precision Agriculture The application of ML and DL algorithms
    highly depends on the agriculture cycle and the dataset involved. This section
    discusses the advantages and limitations of various ML and DL algorithms such
    as regression and classification algorithms based on the agriculture cycle involved.
    1) Soil Properties and Weather Prediction The application of AI techniques in
    prediction of soil parameters and weather is dependent on various factors. The
    researchers generally employ around 3 to 4 algorithms in for prediction and select
    the algorithms which has most accurate prediction and is robust to factors such
    as: noise, non-linearity, outliers etc. the most commonly employed algorithms
    are ELM, RF, SVR, and cubist algorithm. Advantages of using ML in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Non-linear dataset – these predictions often
    attributes a non-linear dataset which can be utilized for accurate prediction
    by regression algorithms such as: ELM, RF, SVR Large dataset – the dataset for
    is often obtained from satellite which can be well handled by the regression algorithms
    with less convergence time and accurate predictions. Insensitivity to outliers
    – Weather patterns often encounter outlier events which may affect the prediction
    accuracy, however algorithms such as ELM, NN are robust to outliers and provide
    accurate predictions. Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML
    exhibit low error indices such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of
    accuracy for statistical analysis. Challenges and limitations in prediction of
    soil properties and weather pattern: Varying geographical conditions poses a challenge
    for universal design of the prediction algorithms. Soil parameters prediction
    is highly dependent on the sample selection philosophy. Dataset selection and
    filtering is a challenge for researchers with non-computing background. 2) Crop
    Yield Prediction The application of AI techniques in prediction of crop yield
    is a mammoth task and lack of availability of a universal model makes designing
    of the algorithm challenging. The most promising algorithms for crop yield prediction
    are regression algorithms, and neural networks. Advantages of using ML in crop
    yield prediction: Complex dataset – crop yield prediction involves enormous dataset
    composing of satellite data and/or historic data. Faster and accurate predictions
    can be made by utilizing the AI techniques such as regression algorithms (SVR,
    RF) Neural networks (CNN). Parameter variation – the crop yield depends on a lot
    of parameters, like climatic factors, soil quality, NDVI, altitude, air parameters.
    The AI based prediction systems handle the parameters dependency efficiently.
    Accurate prediction – prediction of parameters using ML exhibit low error indices
    such as RMSE, and R2 which are standard measures of accuracy for statistical analysis.
    Challenges and limitations in prediction of crop yield: Varying parameters and
    complex datasets pose a challenge for universal design of the prediction algorithms.
    Dataset selection is critical due to the complexity; as an improper selection
    of data may result in underfit/overfit prediction pattern. 3) Disease and Weed
    Detection The applications of AI techniques in disease and weed detection primarily
    depends on the advances in image processing. CNN’s are the most prominent choice
    for building a disease identification system. Training dataset will govern the
    performance of the algorithm, although these are available in open-source format,
    users have to be cautious while using the dataset. Advantages of using ML in detection
    of weed and disease in a crop field: Prediction accuracy – AI offer accurate detection
    of disease and weeds with an accuracy of 99% which is better compared to manual/classical
    techniques. Robust prediction – the algorithms can predict the disease/weed even
    with smartphone images, which is commonly available with farmers. Easy configuration
    – with CNN being the most common and reliable technique, designing a disease/weed
    detection system is not a complex job unlike other systems discussed in text.
    Challenges and limitations in detection of weed and disease in a crop field: The
    accuracy of prediction depends on the quality of training dataset some of which
    is available as an open-source dataset, but is applicable to only a limited number
    of crops. Improperly labelled data may result in a disastrous prediction system,
    as the training of the system plays a major role in the performance of the system.
    Overtraining the model may result in a sensitive prediction system. 4) Drip Irrigation
    Smart irrigation systems are not only crop friendly but are environmental friendly
    too. The combination of IoT with the AI not only reduces the manual intervention
    but also utilizes the available in an optimum way to ensure no adverse effect
    to environment. Regression and Advantages of using ML in drip irrigation for an
    agricultural field: Optimum resource utilization – accurate estimation of irrigation
    requirements results in a system which optimizes the resource (water, electricity)
    utilization (NN algorithms). Crop protection – optimized irrigation practices
    minimizes water related damage to the crops and hence increases the crop yield.
    Robust to weather variations – an accurately designed AI based (Regression algorithms)
    irrigation system handles the random weather events in a better way when compared
    with the non-AI based irrigation methods. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation
    for an agricultural field: Accurate prediction sometimes depends on the number
    of sensors and hence increases the initial investment of the farmers. An incorrect
    sensor placement in the filed affects the accuracy of the system, hence sensor
    optimization becomes imperative in designing a smart irrigation system. The architecture
    of prediction system highly depends on the dataset; hence no universal guidelines
    can be laid out for system design. 5) Livestock Production and Management The
    livestock management primarily focuses on the well-being of the farm animals and
    uses advanced image recognition (CNN) algorithms, and regression techniques to
    detect and predict the disease/ disease spread. Advantages of using ML in livestock
    production and management: Decreased risk of diseases – AI systems assists in
    identifying the livestock diseases and also helps in combating the disease, by
    predicting the root of diseases and transmission (Regression algorithms). Minimization
    of disease spread – timely diagnosis and treatment reduces the risk of spreading
    the disease. Psychological analysis – advanced image recognition and behavioural
    analysis (CNN techniques) help is detecting the stress in animals ensuring heath
    of the livestock. Challenges and limitations in drip irrigation for an agricultural
    field: With varying geographic and climatic conditions the attributes of the cattle
    and diseases changes hence, no universal system can be designed to cater to the
    diversities. Some viruses are difficult to predict even using the state-of-art
    prediction algorithms. 6) Intelligent Harvesting The applications of AI techniques
    in harvesting is primarily an assistive technology for automatic harvesting systems.
    Harvesting prediction system largely relies on the advances in image processing
    and CNN’s are the most prominent choice for building these systems. Advantages
    of using ML in intelligent harvesting: Assistive technology – AI in conjunction
    with existing harvesting robots exhibit high accuracy in harvesting. Image processing
    – the identification of harvesting relies on the state-of-art image processing
    algorithm (CNNs) and hence the developments in the image processing algorithms
    result in direct accuracy enhancement of intelligent harvesting techniques. Universal
    algorithms – the AI harvesting techniques largely depend on image recognition
    methods, hence CNNs can easily be deployed for implementing intelligent harvesting
    techniques. Challenges and limitations in intelligent harvesting: The accuracy
    of the prediction systems largely depends on the training dataset, hence accurately
    labelled dataset is a primary requirement of implementing an intelligent harvesting
    system. Inaccurate harvesting recognition system result in economic loss for farmers,
    as a delay in harvesting might lead to an overripe crop or early harvesting might
    lead to rejection of the product. SECTION VII. Challenges and Limitations of Artifical
    Intelligence in Precision Agriculture Artificial intelligence has the potential
    of playing an important role in meeting the food requirement of entire world.
    However, there are certain challenges which are hampering its adoption in agriculture
    industries which are outlined as follows: A recent government survey in India
    estimated that literacy rate of Indian farmers is very low therefore bridging
    the gap between farmers and technology is a challenging task. Farmers are less
    motivated to come out from their comfort zone and learn digital skills to improve
    their farming standards. Agriculture lands are mostly situated in rural areas.
    Implementation of IoT architecture and WSN which requires cloud services for data
    storage and analysis is a big issue in rural areas where reliable internet connectivity
    is not available. Accurate prediction and classification through cognitive ability
    of machines is difficult in varying geographical conditions. Initial set up of
    digital farming which includes hardware and software requires huge investment.
    Deployment of smart sensors and other electronic gadgets requires heavy energy
    consumption. SECTION VIII. Future Trends of Artifical Intelligence and IoT in
    Precision Agriculture Agriculture industry is globally US$5 trillion industry
    and now it has been revolutionized with artificial intelligence and IoT technologies.
    These innovative tools are assisting famers to improve crop yield, monitor soil
    parameters, livestock health and temperature conditions, control pests and improve
    other agriculture related tasks. Conventional ML and DL models such as SVM, RF,
    ANN finds difficult to accurately estimate soil parameters and weather conditions
    in varying ecosystem. Therefore, swarm intelligence optimized robust and adaptive
    ML and DL algorithms such as SVM-PSO, ANN-GWO algorithms can be explored to effectively
    forecast different parameters in precision agriculture. In large agriculture fields
    swarm intelligence inspired autonomous system can be built for crop health and
    growth monitoring. UAV swarm can be utilized for near real time field and livestock
    monitoring through computer vision and DL algorithms and accordingly swarm of
    UAV can be used for spraying of pesticides and fertilizers in the infected crops.
    Greenness of crops can be identified through UAVs installed cameras and an automated
    irrigation system can be built in large agriculture fields. Swarm of mobile robots
    can be used in the agriculture fields to efficiently automate task such as harvesting,
    weed identification and elimination, etc. Metaheuristic algorithms can be explored
    for nodes localization in agriculture fields in order to optimize the sensor deployment
    in the field and keep the minimize cost to farmers. Offline service chatbots can
    be built to assist farmers in developing countries where farmers don’t have good
    internet connectivity. These chatbots can assist farmers by providing timely advice
    based on expert recommendations and will help to resolve their specific farming
    problems. Artificial intelligence assisted renewable energy plants can be installed
    in agriculture lands to maximize the power output of clean energy in unpredictable
    weather conditions. This will allow for sustainable agricultural practices. Artificial
    intelligence can also be explored in vertical and soilless agriculture. In near
    future artificial intelligence systems, robotics and smart sensor technology will
    automate the whole farming process starting from seed sowing to intelligent fruits
    and vegetables harvesting and packaging. SECTION IX. Conclusion Precision agriculture
    is empowering the farmers with technology intending to get optimum outputs with
    precise inputs. IoT enabled smart sensors, actuators, satellite images, robots,
    drones are some of the key technological revolutions that boosted the agriculture
    industry. These components play a vital role in collecting real-time data and
    accordingly making decisions without human support. Artificial intelligence which
    is the automation of intelligent behaviour is continuously benefiting our planet
    and helping humans in various aspects of life. In this paper, authors have reviewed
    ML applications for precision agriculture. The impact of AI and IoT in smart farm
    management is discussed with a brief introduction to ML algorithms which are most
    commonly used in precision agriculture. Regression algorithms are the backbone
    for soil properties, weather, and crop yield prediction. DL algorithms such as
    CNN and ML classification algorithms such as SVM, Decision trees, and RF were
    explored for the identification of disease and weeds in the plants. Smart irrigation
    systems and harvesting techniques play an important component in precision agriculture
    as these techniques quickly complete the work and reduces human labour. Drones
    and robots enabled with a digital camera are employed for this work. Livestock
    management is an important concern for farmers across the world. Knowledge-based
    agriculture system which includes smart IoT devices and AI tools efficiently handle
    livestock management. As a scope of future work, NLP based chatbots can be built
    for famers and more ML, DL and hybrid algorithms can be explored in the agriculture
    industry for sustainable use of available resources. Authors Figures References

    is the biggest consumer of freshwater in the world, which makes a case for the
    intensive use of technology to optimize the use of water, reduce the consumption
    of energy and improve the quality of crops. While the Internet of Things (IoT)
    and other associated technologies are the natural choice for smart water management
    applications, their appropriateness is still to be proven in real settings with
    the deployment of on-site pilots. Also, IoT-based application development platforms
    should be generic enough to be adapted to different crops, climates, and countries.
    The SWAMP project develops IoT based methods and approaches for smart water management
    in precision irrigation domain and pilots them in Italy, Spain, and Brazil. In
    this paper, we present the SWAMP view, architecture, pilots and the scenario-based
    development process adopted in the project. Published in: 2018 Global Internet

    IEEE Conference Location: Bilbao, Spain I. Introduction Water is vital for ensuring
    food security to the world’s population, and agriculture is by far the biggest
    consumer amounting to 70% of freshwater [7]. The leading causes of water wastage
    are leakages in distribution and irrigation systems, as well as, the field application
    methods, which result in wastage and the cultivation of crops. The most common
    irrigation technique, surface irrigation, is also the least precise one, which
    wastes a high percentage of the water by wetting areas where no plants can benefit
    from it. On the other hand, localized irrigation can use water more efficiently
    and effectively, avoiding both under-irrigation and over-irrigation. However,
    in an attempt to avoid loss of productivity by underirrigation, farmers feed more
    water than is needed and as a result not only productivity is challenged but also
    water is wasted. Therefore, technology should be developed and deployed for sensing
    the level of water needed by the plantation and for flowing the water in the proper
    amount to places where and when it is needed. Sign in to Continue Reading Authors

    Abstract: Digitalization has impacted agricultural and food production systems,\
    \ and makes applica-\ntion of technologies and advanced data processing techniques\
    \ in agricultural ﬁeld possible. Digital\nfarming aims to use available information\
    \ from agricultural assets to solve several existing challenges\nfor addressing\
    \ food security, climate protection, and resource management. However, the agricultural\n\
    sector is complex, dynamic, and requires sophisticated management systems. The\
    \ digital approaches\nare expected to provide more optimization and further decision-making\
    \ supports. Digital twin in\nagriculture is a virtual representation of a farm\
    \ with great potential for enhancing productivity and\nefﬁciency while declining\
    \ energy usage and losses. This review describes the state-of-the-art of\ndigital\
    \ twin concepts along with different digital technologies and techniques in agricultural\
    \ con-\ntexts. It presents a general framework of digital twins in soil, irrigation,\
    \ robotics, farm machineries,\nand food post-harvest processing in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. Data recording, modeling including artiﬁcial\nintelligence, big data,\
    \ simulation, analysis, prediction, and communication aspects (e.g., Internet\n\
    of Things, wireless technologies) of digital twin in agriculture are discussed.\
    \ Digital twin systems\ncan support farmers as a next generation of digitalization\
    \ paradigm by continuous and real-time\nmonitoring of physical world (farm) and\
    \ updating the state of virtual world.\nKeywords: digital twin; digitalization;\
    \ digital farming; farm management; smart farming\n1. Introduction\nOne of the\
    \ main global challenges is how to ensure food security for the world’s\ngrowing\
    \ population whilst ensuring long-term sustainable development. According to the\n\
    Food and Agriculture Organization, agricultural and food productions will need\
    \ to grow\nto feed the world population, which will reach around 10 billion by\
    \ 2050 [1]. Due to the\nincrease in world population and market demand for higher\
    \ product quantity and quality\nstandards, the issue of food security, sustainability,\
    \ productivity, and proﬁtability becomes\nmore important. Furthermore, the economic\
    \ pressure on the agricultural sector, labor,\nenvironmental, and climate change\
    \ issues are increasing [2,3]. Therefore, the enhancement\nof efﬁciency through\
    \ effective integrated smart technologies and techniques has been\nwidely considered\
    \ in recent years.\nIn this context, digital agriculture (also known as smart\
    \ farming or smart agriculture)\ntools can support the deeper understanding of\
    \ interrelations within the agricultural pro-\nduction system and the consequent\
    \ effects on the performance of farm production while\nbalancing human health\
    \ and well-being, social and environmental aspects, and sustain-\nability associated\
    \ with agricultural system [4–6]. Due to advances in data generation, data\nprocessing\
    \ and human-computer interactions, digital farming has progressed in recent\n\
    years [7]. One of the main features of digitalization in agriculture is the introduction\
    \ of inno-\nvative Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of\
    \ Things (IoT), big data\nanalytics and interpretation techniques, machine learning\
    \ and Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI).\nData acquisition and analysis in digital farming\
    \ by means of smart technologies are\nsupporting complex decision-making approaches\
    \ [8,9]. They enhance ﬁnal productivity,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22020498\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n2 of 16\nreduce costs,\
    \ and optimize the decision-making process. Furthermore, ICT tools present\nadvantages\
    \ for on-farm management, efﬁciency, quality control, and the food supply chain\n\
    as well as decision support tools [10]. The AI and big data support better and\
    \ precise\nfarm monitoring, data acquisition and analytics, improve information\
    \ extraction from\nsensors as well as farm management [11]. For instance, crop\
    \ health and productivity can\nbe monitored and controlled using advanced AI and\
    \ deep learning techniques [12]. Data-\ndriven approaches augment on-farm decision-making\
    \ capabilities, improve crop yield,\nreduce losses, and therefore, beneﬁt farmers.\
    \ The IoT and wireless technologies enable\nreal-time data transferring and monitoring\
    \ in digital farming [13,14]. The IoT, along with\ncloud computing systems, can\
    \ facilitate communication between software platforms and\nsensors, pieces of\
    \ machinery, crops, and animals in digital farming. However, by increasing\nthe\
    \ number of sensors and generating large amounts of data in digital farming could\
    \ cause\nhigh load on the cloud server and reduce the response speed [15]. In\
    \ this context, in may\nbe impractical to always store and process data in the\
    \ cloud systems [16]. An alternative\ntechnology which has been recently introduced\
    \ to the smart farming is edge-computing\nthat enables computation at the edge\
    \ of the network [17]. It helps to reduce network load\nand supports real-time\
    \ data processing in agricultural ﬁelds. Furthermore, cyber-physical\nsystems\
    \ have been introduced through smart farming systems to develop hardware and\n\
    software, improve adaptability, and safety and security of computer-based algorithms\n\
    and systems [18]. It enables adaptability, practicality, security, and safety\
    \ of collected\ninformation in agricultural ﬁeld e.g., climate, irrigation, soil,\
    \ nutrition, and yield for\nbetter management.\nAccording to ref. [19], digital\
    \ farming approaches can provide farmers with useful\ninformation about (I) the\
    \ use of fertilizers, chemicals, seeds, and irrigation management\nstrategies,\
    \ (II) the environment protection, (III) pest, climate, and crop monitoring man-\n\
    agement solutions, (IV) market demands and business conditions. However, agricultural\n\
    production systems are complex, dynamic, and require sophisticated management\
    \ [20].\nDigitalization approaches are expected to provide more monitoring, data\
    \ analysis and\noptimization capabilities, and further decision-making supports.\n\
    To enhance the efﬁciency of these systems, an emerging paradigm has been proposed\n\
    and implemented in digital agriculture, that is, digital twin. The digital twin\
    \ was ﬁrstly\npresented by NASA for monitoring of spacecraft behavior and can\
    \ be deﬁned as a virtual\nor digital representation of physical systems to simulate\
    \ the behavior of the physical\nsystem [21,22]. There are different deﬁnitions\
    \ for digital twin available in the literature\nwhich have been reviewed by [23–25].\
    \ Based on the reported deﬁnitions, the component\nof digital twin can be characterized\
    \ by physical and virtual objects, as well as a set of\nconnections between physical\
    \ and digital assets [26].\nThe physical system or physical world in agriculture\
    \ is a complex and dynamic\nenvironment and includes basic information and features\
    \ of the object or device such\nas shape, position, cooler, material, and live\
    \ objects [27]. The physical system is one\nof the key components, and a digital\
    \ twin without a physical world is a model [28],\nand system boundaries of a digital\
    \ twin are identiﬁed based on the real physical world [29].\nThe physical system\
    \ can be a single component of an object or the whole object with sub-\ncomponents\
    \ located in a physical environment [28]. The physical world in agriculture can\n\
    be an animal itself or located in a farm including building, feeding strategies,\
    \ number of\nanimals [30], or a crop with different soil, climate, and irrigation\
    \ conditions [22], robots\nand agricultural pieces of machinery, e.g., tractors,\
    \ harvesters and fertilizers, as well as\noperators. The physical world can include\
    \ a whole object (e.g., whole machine) or sub-part\nof the object, or a single\
    \ asset of the object connected with other objects. In an agricultural\ncontext,\
    \ the physical system may be some aspects of the crop, soil, and irrigation systems,\n\
    or animal body. The physical world requires measurement technologies and sensors\
    \ to\ncollect and receive data from the physical object. Examples of digital twins\
    \ in smart\nagriculture include optical sensors for plant canopy and disease [31,32],\
    \ soil and weather\nsensors for crop [33], barn sensors such as temperature, humidity,\
    \ ammonia for animals [34],\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n3 of 16\nGlobal Positioning\
    \ System (GPS) and Real-Time Kinematic-Global Navigation Satellite for\ntracking\
    \ of agricultural robots [35], and food supply chain.\nThe connection between\
    \ physical and virtual worlds depends on the developed digital\ntwin. This component\
    \ enables data transmission between virtual and physical systems.\nIt interprets\
    \ the collected data from the physical system and updates the state of the\nvirtual\
    \ system, and transfers feedbacks from the virtual system to the physical world\
    \ [25].\nThe connection components can be varied depending on the source, type\
    \ and volume of\ndata, data transfer rate and speed, as well as the minimum delay\
    \ between data acquisition\nand feedbacks. Wireless and IoT techniques have been\
    \ used in digital twins of agricultural\nconcepts to connect between physical\
    \ and virtual worlds (such as [34,36,37]).\nThe models and data of the physical\
    \ world are represented in a virtual system.\nThe virtual world may also include\
    \ different processing and simulation concepts, software,\nmachine learning, data\
    \ mining, and AI models. In this context, data processing and analyt-\nics by\
    \ means of AI techniques to support decision-making and feedback to the physical\n\
    system were suggested by some researchers [38,39]. The virtual twin may simulate\
    \ and\ncontrol the physical system, optimize a process, and predict unseen issues\
    \ in the physical\nsystem. For example, an application layer of a digital twin\
    \ reported by [22] provides\nreal-time monitoring of weeds, crop growth, and expected\

    \ and evaluation of soil quality to sustain plant productivity is the basis of\n\
    land-use strategies in agricultural farms [48]. Crop health and productivity depends\
    \ on\nthe quality and properties of the soil. More detailed information about\
    \ the agricultural\nsoil may reduce the potential use of chemical fertilizer and\
    \ pesticide dosages, therefore\nimproving the underground water, protecting the\
    \ environment and human health. It also\nsupports deﬁning plant density in a more\
    \ efﬁcient way. Digital technologies are supporting\nscientists to better understand\
    \ and study soil in agriculture. Soil monitoring sensors such\nas moisture, temperature,\
    \ organic matter, and soil pollutant sensors are playing critical\nroles in digital\
    \ agriculture [49]. For instance, soil moisture information can be used to\nassess\
    \ irrigation efﬁciency in agricultural ﬁelds [50]. Furthermore, to support the\
    \ decision-\nmaking process of smart farming, digital soil mapping is an essential\
    \ paradigm that can be\ndeﬁned as spatial soil information based on ﬁeld and laboratory\
    \ investigations coupled\nwith soil inference systems [51]. Digital soil assessment\
    \ approaches have a direct impact on\ncrop yield and performance by identifying\
    \ zones that may cause low crop yield. Digital\nalternative methodologies for\
    \ soil survey and identifying key soil characteristics could\nhave the possibility\
    \ to quantify the trend of agricultural soil conditions [52].\nThe advancement\
    \ of knowledge and technology (e.g., wireless sensors, IoT, AI) in\ndigital agriculture\
    \ could lead to digital twin paradigms of soil in agriculture. The recent\ndevelopment\
    \ of digital soil mapping techniques may support digital twins by digital\nrepresentation\
    \ of knowledge obtained from the soil in virtual entrainment [53]. For in-\nstance,\
    \ digital soil mapping could be used to describe soil variation in digital twins\
    \ using\ninformation from complex soil variation at a speciﬁc depth, time, and\
    \ special locations [52].\nAdditionally, the decision about crop management depends\
    \ directly on the crop water\nrequirements, soil properties, and availability\
    \ of water. In order to manage soil and crop\nrequirements in smart farming, digital\
    \ technologies have been used to meet the requirement\nof smart or precise water\
    \ management strategies. Wireless system networks, IoT, edge-\ncomputing, local\
    \ weather-based controllers, and soil sensors are some of the digital tools\n\
    based on smart irrigation systems. The mentioned tools can be used in the digital\
    \ twin of\nsoil and irrigation systems. For example, ref. [37] developed a digital\
    \ twin concept for smart\nwater management in the agricultural domain. Information\
    \ of air and ground temperature,\nand humidity sensors, soil moisture, and ambient\
    \ light as well as geospatial position\nsensors were collected. An IoT system\
    \ was used to connect the cloud and the physical\nsystem. A virtual environment\
    \ including decision-making tools and models was designed\nto inform the data\
    \ collected by connection device (the IoT system) and to send feedback\nto the\
    \ physical system. They also presented a digital twin system architecture including\n\
    monitoring devices (i.e., soil probe, weather information, irrigation system,\
    \ machines,\nand other equipment) in a physical system (farm) with could serve\
    \ as a connection between\nthe physical and virtual systems to visualize satellite\
    \ and drone images.\nIn another study, to evaluate and forecast plants’ irrigation\
    \ requirements, and support\nirrigation and water distribution planning, a digital\
    \ twin for a smart water management\nsystem was developed by [54]. Data of the\
    \ physical world (agriculture ﬁeld) such as\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n5 of 16\n\
    weather, fertilizer, and soil type as well as information from developed models\
    \ that simulate\nthe behavior of soil and crops were considered as input data\
    \ for the digital twin. The digital\ntwin concept also consisted of a Soil Agent\
    \ (includes hydrological models and soil data),\nCrop Agent (includes crop models\
    \ and evaporation data), and a Field Avatar, which is a\ndigital representation\
    \ of the ﬁeld such as geological models and weather data [54]. In their\ndeveloped\
    \ digital twin concept, the information from Soil Avatar and Crop Avatar feed\n\
    into the Field Avatar, and an IoT system was used for data transformation and\
    \ connection\nbetween the physical and virtual worlds.\nDue to increase in world\
    \ population, water and energy management, storage, and proper\ndistribution of\
    \ water become more essential for water users in agricultural sectors, which can\n\
    be managed through a collective irrigation system [55]. A digital twin of water\
    \ systems\ncoupled with big data can reduce risk and uncertainty of water management,\
    \ explore\nconsumption patterns, and optimize operation planning [56]. Furthermore,\
    \ in a collective\nirrigation system, improvement of water efﬁciency could help\
    \ to reduce water losses. In this\ncontext, a digital twin concept was created\
    \ using ﬁeld and laboratory tests of a collective\nirrigation system network to\
    \ evaluate energy, pumping facilities, water losses and water use\nefﬁciencies\
    \ [57]. The developed digital twin methodology was based on information from\n\
    the physical system, i.e., infrastructure data, acquired information through telemetry,\
    \ data\nanalytics from laboratory tests and ﬁeld measurements, IoT data transferring\
    \ as connection,\nenergy balance, water balance, and hydraulic model in the virtual\
    \ system. It was found\nthat the digital twin of the irrigation management system\
    \ made it possible to understand\nsystem processes, maintenance, and management\
    \ strategies [57].\nA digital twin of soil and irrigation systems in smart farming\
    \ enables digital repre-\nsentation of information from agricultural soil, and\
    \ provides prediction and fundamental\nunderstanding of water requirement and\
    \ soil components for crop farming. Exchanging\ninformation from the soil as a\
    \ physical system to a virtual system using IoT, cloud, fog,\nand edge-computing\
    \ technologies in digital twin may allow evaluating the state of soil and\nirrigation\
    \ systems. In particular, the edge-computing technique that saves and performs\n\
    the data processing near the soil monitoring and irrigation devices can improve\
    \ the perfor-\nmance and overcome issues of cloud-based system in digital twin\
    \ concepts. Furthermore,\nit could offer different irrigation recommendations\
    \ based on crop requirements which are\nnot solved yet by the researchers.\n3.\
    \ Digital Twin in Crop Production\nThe use of digital and ICT tools in crop production\
    \ technologies, in particular agri-\ncultural machineries, e.g., tractors, combine\
    \ harvesters, fertilizers, and sprayers, plays an\nimportant role in the improvement\
    \ of overall efﬁciency by reducing the cost of fuel, fertiliz-\ners, human labor,\
    \ and parameters which affect production efﬁciency and sustainability [58].\n\
    Digitalization has modernized agricultural machinery application and management\
    \ policies\nusing collected information and advanced data analytics approaches.\
    \ It allows to optimize\nthe performance and enhance the use of advanced tools\
    \ in manufacturing. For instance,\nbased on the European Agricultural Machinery\
    \ Association, a digital farm machine should\nbe able to assist and support drivers\
    \ by sending and receiving data via sensors and ICT\ntools, enable the best and\
    \ optimal use of machinery, and the technology should facilitate\nthe automated\
    \ operation of the devices [59]. The application of AI, big data analytics,\n\
    and wireless and IoT technologies have led to signiﬁcant changes in farm technology\
    \ roles\ntowards the development of autonomous systems. The role of agricultural\
    \ machinery in\nthe implementation of digital agriculture was stated by [58] as\
    \ data collected from sensors\nmounted on typical and autonomous agricultural\
    \ machinery and transferred via an IoT\nplatform. Then, the information was analyzed\
    \ by data analytics such as AI, fuzzy logic,\nand big data analysis to support\
    \ farmers, consumers, and markets [58]. In this context,\ncombining digital tools\
    \ with autonomous machines and robots could help farmers to do\nmore effective\
    \ practices and improve the quality of products [60]. Nowadays, with ad-\nvancements\
    \ in digital technology, the real-time visualization of smart farm equipment\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n6 of 16\nconditions is possible through digital twin approaches\
    \ [40]. It allows contact to the system\n(e.g., machinery and robots), simulates\
    \ the condition of the system, and monitors the\nbehavior and operation as well\
    \ as the maintenance situation of the machines (Figure 2).\n \ntransferred via\
    \ an IoT platform. Then, the information was analyzed by data analytics \nsuch\
    \ as AI, fuzzy logic, and big data analysis to support farmers, consumers, and\
    \ markets \n[58]. In this context, combining digital tools with autonomous machines\
    \ and robots could \nhelp farmers to do more effective practices and improve the\
    \ quality of products [60]. Now-\nadays, with advancements in digital technology,\
    \ the real-time visualization of smart farm \nequipment conditions is possible\
    \ through digital twin approaches [40]. It allows contact \nto the system (e.g.,\
    \ machinery and robots), simulates the condition of the system, and \nmonitors\
    \ the behavior and operation as well as the maintenance situation of the machines\
    \ \n(Figure 2).  \n \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital twin concept for\
    \ crop production technology. \nDigital twin in design and manufacturing of products\
    \ (e.g., farm machinery) requires \n(I) geometric (e.g., size, shape) and physical\
    \ properties of an object, (II) in the detailed \ninformation of the product which\
    \ can illustrate dynamic processing of the object, (III) in-\ntegration of geometric,\
    \ physical, and process information [61]. Digital twin approaches \nmake it possible\
    \ to model, design, simulate, and develop agricultural machinery that \nwould\
    \ yield more productive machines in terms of energy and power efficiencies. For\
    \ \ninstance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\
    \ be modeled \nin digital twin concepts, and the effect of different factors on\
    \ energy consumption can also \nbe explored there [62]. In the agricultural context,\
    \ ref. [40] reported that a commercially \navailable digital twin platform for\
    \ agricultural machinery is able to track the machines in \nreal-time, monitor\
    \ the energy consumption, economic efficiency of crop management, and \ntrajectories\
    \ of tractors by considering the specific conditions of the farm. It has also\
    \ been \nreported that using digital twins could potentially impact the training\
    \ of unskilled har-\nvester operators and lead to high macro-economic benefits\
    \ [63].  \nWithin the digital farming technologies, robotics, as an important\
    \ technology in crop \nproduction, has played an essential role in digitalization\
    \ and has been drawing more at-\ntention in recent years. To optimize the robotic\
    \ application process, reduce costs, and in-\ncrease the quality and efficiency\
    \ of the product, the digital twin concepts can be used for \nvirtualization of\
    \ the robot environment by introducing a remote operating system [64]. By \nproviding\
    \ simulation and remote operation possibilities and modeling various interac-\n\
    tions between robot and environment in digital twin concepts, accuracy, performance,\
    \ \nand flexibility may enhance, and the final product cost may decline. Ref.\
    \ [65] analyzed the \nhuman-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform.\
    \ Their developed digital \ntwin helps to improve operational productivity and\
    \ comfort. In another study, a digital \nFigure 2. An architecture of the digital\

    For instance, it was shown that overall energy consumption of machinery could\

    the human-robot interactive behaviors using a digital twin platform. Their developed\n\
    digital twin helps to improve operational productivity and comfort. In another\
    \ study,\na digital twin approach was proposed to assist the remote programming\
    \ of a robot [66].\nThe developed digital twin system consists of a robot (as\
    \ a physical object), and a gaming\nplatform (as a virtual system) which was able\
    \ to observe the motion of the robot, ease\nprogramming for complex environments\
    \ as well as introduce a remote operating system\nfor communication across different\
    \ platforms [66]. In the agricultural context, an approach\nwas recommended by\
    \ [35] that the development of a digital twin paradigm for agricultural\nrobots\
    \ may improve predictive emulation of the vehicles, operational scheduling, digital-\n\
    Sensors 2022, 22, 498\n7 of 16\nization, economic, environmental, and social sustainability\
    \ in agriculture. Furthermore,\nthe digital twin paradigm makes it possible to\
    \ overcome common challenges in the control\nof robot components in the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context, a research group demonstrated\nthe possibility of a digital\
    \ twin concept for a desktop version of an agricultural robot [67] to\ncontrol\
    \ the motor and indoor localization capabilities of the robot. Besides, the digital\
    \ twin\nconcept was used to predict movement and monitor the safety mechanism\
    \ of the robot [67].\nHowever, their developed digital twin concept needs different\
    \ kinds of calibrations to be\napplicable in different environmental conditions.\n\
    In another study, to simulate complexity of the crop production process, variability\
    \ of\nplant, soil, environment, and technologies in the agricultural ﬁeld, digital\
    \ twin concepts\nwere developed [68]. Three ﬁeld robots for different agricultural\
    \ applications were used to\ndevelop different digital twin concepts and optimize\
    \ sensor-based autonomous navigation.\nIt is reported that the developed concepts\
    \ could provide considerable information in prepar-\ning ﬁeld experiments, and\
    \ better evaluation for the use and positioning of sensor systems\ntowards demonstrating\
    \ and implementation of the developed robotic technologies [68].\nIntegration\
    \ of the digital twin systems with technologies and management strategies\nin\
    \ crop production can provide a new phenomenon for digitalization in agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld.\nManagement strategies can be improved and optimized by providing reliable\
    \ forecasts of\nthe key parameters in digital twins [69]. The digital twin systems\
    \ can not only act as a man-\nagement system, but it may also be used to revolutionize\
    \ agricultural farm management\nstrategies [40]. For instance, a digital twin\
    \ concept was applied in a greenhouse to discover,\nanalyze, and extract behavior\
    \ of farmers [70]. Sensor data were analyzed using deep learn-\ning techniques\
    \ to establish decision-making models to replicate expert famers’ experience\n\
    for transferring to young farmers. It was found that the developed digital twin\
    \ module\ncould improve control and management strategies in crop farming [70].\
    \ In this context,\nthe use of distributed architecture in digital twin may increase\
    \ efﬁciency and reliability\nof the module by proper resource handling [71]. A\
    \ distributed digital twin concept was\ndeveloped to handle resources over different\
    \ stakeholders and platforms in agricultural\nlandscape [72]. It consists of different\
    \ components, i.e., stakeholders, applications in agri-\nculture and farm management,\
    \ sensor data, analytics and simulation tools, virtual model,\nIoT, and resource\
    \ registry which makes interoperable and cross-scale management possible\nin agricultural\
    \ landscape [71].\nIn addition, the use of digital twin system as a decision support\
    \ system can beneﬁt and\nbe adopted for crop farming applications, and optimization\
    \ of products and farm system\nperformance. A digital twin model was implemented\
    \ by [36] in sustainable agriculture\nfor monitoring and control of product qualities,\
    \ adjustment of environmental conditions,\nidentiﬁcation of forecasting, and decision\
    \ support scenarios. In addition, a novel approach\nbased on digital twin paradigms\
    \ was developed to forecast yield, vegetation quality,\nand duration of plant\
    \ development [33]. Consequently, the quality of crop production\ncould be improved\
    \ due to detailed analysis and control of plant growth, and the efﬁciency\nof\
    \ farms could be improved due to automation of decision support processes through\n\
    the developed digital twin concept. Digital twin along with forecasting models\
    \ were able\nto provide feedback to farmers for a better decision-making scenario\
    \ in a reported study\nby [73]. Their proposed digital twin system consists of\
    \ a monitoring system to collect\nenvironmental condition data from an underground\
    \ farm, as well as data analysis and\nmodeling techniques to identify key parameters,\
    \ critical trends, and forecast operational\nscenarios. Furthermore, digital twin\
    \ was able to optimize productivity of crops in a\ngreenhouse environment through\
    \ climate control strategies and treatments related to\ncrop management [74].\n\
    Information from crop production machineries (e.g., tractors, harvesters, robots)\
    \ have\nbeen used in smart farming to optimize the performance and efﬁciency,\
    \ and reduce the fuel\nand energy consumption. However, the digital twin concepts\
    \ collect real-time data from\nthe devices and characterize the states of the\
    \ physical object continuously. This capability\nmakes it possible to predict\
    \ and prescribe solutions using the collected information from\nSensors 2022,\
    \ 22, 498\n8 of 16\nthe farm machineries. Hence, big data analytics coupled with\
    \ AI models are able to detect\nfailures in the machines before or in the early\
    \ stage of when breakdowns happen. In this\ncontext, the use of state-of-the-art\
    \ edge-computing systems may reduce latency by the\nlimited amount of transmitted\
    \ data and provide information from the crop production\nmachineries such as autonomous\
    \ robot, harvesters, and tractors to the digital twin concepts.\nThe digital twin\
    \ paradigm in crop farming can change production productivity, farm man-\nagement,\
    \ and sustainability at farm level. Advanced statistical models, machine learning\n\
    and data analytic approaches can provide farmers with more precise information\
    \ to make\nbetter decisions that were not possible previously. Based on the past\
    \ (historical) and current\ncontinuous knowledge from crop (sensors deployed at\
    \ farm) and environment data, the dig-\nital twin systems provide information\
    \ about future states of the farm, and offer solutions\nfor turning the collected\
    \ information into useful and actionable on-farm knowledge.\n4. Digital Twin in\
    \ Post-Harvest Process\nPost-harvest process is a stage of agricultural products\
    \ after harvesting until consum-\ning the products, which may include transportation,\
    \ drying, cooling, storage, and market-\ning. Through digital farming approaches,\
    \ the post-harvest processes could beneﬁt from loss\nreduction, improvement of\
    \ monitoring and optimization of food processing, storage condi-\ntions, marketing,\
    \ and transportation. Digital solutions allow monitoring real-time agri-food\n\
    supply chain to increase robustness and resilience of the chain [75], and lower\
    \ food waste\nand losses. The IoT platform supports the reduction of food losses\
    \ in post-harvest pro-\ncessing [76], and tracking of the product through the\
    \ food supply chain. To achieve food\nsecurity AI and big data analytics enable\
    \ data processing, optimization, and management\nin food and crop post-harvest\
    \ stages [77], also reducing waste and improving overall prof-\nitability [78].\
    \ The ICT offers solutions to monitor and control quality criteria of food and\n\
    agricultural products during post-harvest processing [43]. However, different\
    \ environmen-\ntal conditions, processing factors, and dynamic features of agricultural\
    \ product (e.g., shape,\nsize), environmental parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity),\
    \ handling, transportation,\nand storage of the products inﬂuence the quality\
    \ of post-harvest process [79].\nTo overcome these issues and increase the efﬁciency\
    \ of the system, digital twin ap-\nproaches have been used in post-harvest processing\
    \ to continuously monitor the products\nand update the processing stages [80].\
    \ Digital twins, as an expanding family of digital\nfarming could strengthen agri-food\
    \ systems, affect knowledge and skills of farm manage-\nment [44]. Digital twin\
    \ in post-harvest processes can be deﬁned as a digital representation\nof harvested\
    \ agricultural products based on the information collected from the products.\n\
    In this context, ref. [42] reported the digital twin concept of food processing\
    \ may include:\n(I) data collected from a physical system (food process operation)\
    \ by means of sensors that\nmeasure properties and variables of products and environmental\
    \ parameters, (II) an IoT\nplatform to provide sensor communication, data storage\
    \ and big data analytics, high-\nperformance computing, and link to the digital\
    \ twin assets, (III) a simulation platform that\nuses input data from physical\
    \ system for optimization, testing and validation of models,\nand provides decision\
    \ supports in the virtual world. In order to beneﬁt food process-\ning by developing\
    \ digital twin models, it is important to include accurate information\nrepresenting\
    \ production processes of the product, e.g., equipment, labor, and to create\n\
    realistic models with all existing boundaries and barriers [81]. In a study reported\
    \ by [82],\na digital twin of mango fruit was developed to simulate and qualify\
    \ thermal and associ-\nated bio-chemical behavior of the fruit through a post-harvest\
    \ supply chain. In order to\ndevelop the digital twin concept, environmental air\
    \ temperature as input was considered,\nand the actual supply chain conditions\
    \ were mimicked within mechanistic ﬁnite element\nmodels [82]. Moreover, the impact\
    \ of higher air speed on storage life, cold chain length,\nand delivery air temperature\
    \ on the fruit quality were considered in the digital twin. It was\nreported that\
    \ the digital twin allows to monitor and predict temperature-dependent fruit\n\
    quality losses, improve refrigeration and logistic processes, consequently, it\
    \ can reduce\nfood losses [82]. Furthermore, it is reported that the digital twin\
    \ can help horticultural\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n9 of 16\nproducts along with\
    \ the post-harvest life, and can be used to forecast the shelf-life of\nagricultural\
    \ products through the cold chain [45]. It can support food consumers as well\n\
    as food business owners for tracking of the products, logistics, and marketing\
    \ decisions;\nhowever, the existing digital twin concept needs to be enhanced\
    \ by considering more bio-\nchemical and physical features [45]. Ref. [83] proposed\
    \ a digital twin concept food supply\nchain analysis. Their developed digital\
    \ twin includes: (I) a network based on knowledge\nfrom, e.g., customers, suppliers,\
    \ and factories, (II) some parameters, e.g., in production,\ntransportation, warehouses,\
    \ sourcing, shipment costs, and policies, (III) various operational\nparameters,\
    \ e.g., demand, quality, target inventory, and vehicle capacity. It was found\n\
    that the developed digital twin can be used for optimization, simulation, and\
    \ analysis of\noperation and performance changes in the food supply chain [83].\n\
    According to [43], digital twin in post-harvest can be considered as mechanistic,\n\
    statistical, and intelligent models; however, it was found that the physics-based\
    \ mechanistic\ndigital twin concepts can evaluate the quality of fresh agricultural\
    \ products better than\nthe others. Physics-based digital twins were developed\
    \ on 331 cold chain shipments of\nfour fruits (i.e., cucumber, eggplant, strawberry,\
    \ raspberry) by [84]. Based on digital twin\nconcepts, it was found that the quality\
    \ of fruits may be affected (around 43–85%) before\nbeing delivered to stores.\n\
    The post-harvest processing has improved through the application of digital solutions\n\
    over the last several years. However, the use of the digital twin paradigm is\
    \ receiving more\nattention in post-harvest food processing due to the future\
    \ product quality prediction and\ncost reduction. The digital twin of post-harvest\
    \ processes may be developed to model,\noptimize, represent, and characterize\
    \ the design and operational parameters such as quality,\nsafety, ingredients,\
    \ shelf-life, and product status, which need to be considered by researchers\n\
    in future studies.\n5. Challenges and Future Needs\nSummary of the digital twin\
    \ concepts developed in the literature for different purposes\nin agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds, including soil, irrigation, crop monitoring, robotics, farm machinery,\n\
    and post-harvest processing, is presented in Tables 2–4. These tables show that\

    \ the agricultural\nsoil by considering the soil quality and properties may accommodate\
    \ plant productivity,\nhealth, and yield, save water, and reduce chemical usage.\
    \ Many elements of the soil,\nirrigation, and environmental parameters in agricultural\
    \ land can be continuously mon-\nitored, analyzed, and their management strategies\
    \ optimized using big data analytics,\nmachine learning models, and decision support\
    \ systems embedded in the digital twin\nconcepts. The combination of soil and\
    \ irrigation digital twin approaches to record, monitor,\nand analyze agricultural\
    \ land changes may lead to improved performance of crop farming.\nFor instance,\
    \ simulation of soil structure along with data-driven updating models could\n\
    connect farmers to the farm using the IoT technology and present, in detail, pictures\
    \ of\nparameters that impact the soil, irrigation, and crop yield. However, few\
    \ studies focus on\nthe development of digital twin concepts of agriculture soil\
    \ with higher degree of ﬂexibility\nas well as considering a wider range of operation\
    \ than existing simulation models. Soil\nsensors could constantly measure and\
    \ record the dynamic condition of arable soil, e.g.,\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n\
    11 of 16\nwater holding capacity, moisture, temperature [53]. These data, along\
    \ with information\nfrom soil structure and simulation techniques, can be transferred\
    \ to digital twin concepts,\nand constant feedback from the digital world may\
    \ advise real-time responses for soil and\nwater management as well as control\
    \ systems. In recent years, there has been rapid growth\nin the digital farming\
    \ scenarios, use of remote sensing, digital soil mapping, and develop-\nment of\
    \ software platforms. However, researches needed to fuse the developed techniques\n\
    along with the IoT, edge-computing, AI, data analytics, and simulation techniques\
    \ that\ncould lead to development of a digital twin paradigm is in an early stage\
    \ and needs to\nbe addressed in future studies. Furthermore, researchers need\
    \ to consider the practical\nchallenges of digital twin-based systems in soil\
    \ and irrigation as digital twins are multi-\nand interdisciplinary techniques\
    \ and require systems engineering perspectives [90].\nDigital twin offers real-time\
    \ simulation of farm machinery and robots that can beneﬁt\noptimal design of the\
    \ products, interaction with the environment, energy usage, and main-\ntenance\
    \ strategies. Digital twin concepts have the possibility to predict failures in\
    \ farm\nmachinery and support decision-making scenarios in plant production. Farm\
    \ owners can\nbe able to connect to the machines through virtual world for monitoring\
    \ and tracking of the\ndevices in agricultural farms. Digital twin systems are\
    \ accompanied by recording a large\namount of data and exchanging information\
    \ between different assets; hence compiling\nand analyzing these data is a challenge\
    \ facing farms, particularly in some rural areas with\npoor internet and technological\
    \ infrastructures [91]. Other alternatives, e.g., Long Range\ntechnology based\
    \ on wireless sensor networks communication and edge-computing could\nbe used\
    \ to mitigate internet access problems in rural areas for the connection part\
    \ of the\ndigital twin concepts [32,92]. Future opportunities for the implementation\
    \ of digital twin\nsystems in crop farm technologies could lie in the development\
    \ of standards as well as data\ntransferring and communication strategies in this\
    \ context.\nThe digital twin of crop production using big data collected from\
    \ crop and farm ma-\nchinery as well as robots, analytical and AI models, IoT,\
    \ and satellite and drone information\ncould allow simulating crop, environmental,\
    \ and farm conditions in the digital world to\ndetermine unknown and unseen issues\
    \ before happening in the physical world. Agricul-\ntural objects (crops in particular)\
    \ need frequent updates in data to support information\nanalysis and decision-making\
    \ processes [93] which in turn can promote sustainable farming\npractices and\
    \ save energy usage in crop productions. In this context, greater effort should\n\
    be focused in the future on characterization and development of frameworks for\
    \ more effec-\ntive practical digital twin paradigms. In crop farming, all information\
    \ may not be recorded\nand tracked using digital sensors; however, combining data\
    \ from different sources could\nimprove the virtual representation of the farm\
    \ operation and environment [73]. Continuous\nmonitoring of crops in digital twin\
    \ systems by simulating the dynamic farm conditions\nand considering the effect\
    \ of management, climate, and environmental conditions on the\nplant growth and\
    \ use of data-driven models along with sensor fusion techniques could\nhelp to\
    \ identify deviations from the normal conditions of the plant, and forecast growth\n\
    stages to reduce risk of environmental and management effects. In future, different\
    \ digital\ntwin concepts might be applied to copy the complex physical system\
    \ of crop farming in\nthe digital world and incorporate variable sensors, data\
    \ collecting strategies, modeling,\nforecasting, and simulation approaches in\
    \ crop farming.\nIn addition, digital twin concepts can support monitoring, tracking,\
    \ and analysis of\nfood through the entire supply chain. Development of a digital\
    \ copy of an agricultural\nproduct to monitor post-harvest processing could be\
    \ used to optimize the process, reduce\nenergy use, labor, and food losses based\
    \ on information from different sensors and simula-\ntion models. Future studies\
    \ need to be carried out to consider more environmental and\npost-harvest product\
    \ features for the development of robust digital twins [45]. Another\nmajor challenge\
    \ in the development of digital twin for post-harvest processing to minimize\n\
    quality losses and improve the shelf-life of the product is considering the value\
    \ chain of\nagricultural products from farm to fork [43], which has not been addressed\
    \ yet. In post-\nharvest processing to reduce uncertainty in digital twins and\
    \ enable the consumer to trust\nSensors 2022, 22, 498\n12 of 16\nthe output of\
    \ digital twin concepts, detailed experimental and data collection approaches\n\
    along with numerical modeling and validation techniques need be considered.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nEmploying digital technology has helped agricultural farm managers\
    \ to improve\nefﬁciency, yield, and reduce losses. There are different types of\
    \ digital farming paradigms\nin the literature that could be used in digital twin\
    \ concepts as the next generation of\ndigitalization in the agricultural ﬁeld.\
    \ The results of this review show that the digital twin\nconcepts in agriculture\
    \ and food processing have, so far, been little exploited in research.\nThere\
    \ are several research challenges and opportunities in different stages of digital\
    \ farming.\nDigital twin paradigms can be meaningfully utilized for soil and irrigation,\
    \ crop, robots and\nfarm machinery, and post-harvest food processing in the agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld. In this context,\nmost of the studies have focused on the development\
    \ of digital twins by considering some\nlimited parameters in agricultural sectors.\
    \ Deploying of state-of-the-art technologies, e.g.,\nAI, advanced statistical\
    \ and optimization models, big data analytics, and three-dimensional\nsimulation,\
    \ offer further possibilities for improvement in farm management. With real-\n\
    time and continuous information about agricultural assets, virtual models can\
    \ predict\nand address unseen issues in the ﬁelds. It may support farmers to decline\
    \ the economic\npressure on the agricultural sector and labor issues, and help\
    \ policy makers responsible for\nfood security and environmental protection, towards\
    \ strengthening the agriculture sector.\nIn addition, it facilitates the work\
    \ of researchers exploring methods to track and monitor\ncrop farm machinery,\
    \ agricultural and post-harvest products or reduce water, chemicals,\nand energy\
    \ usage in digital farming. Although many digital twin systems in engineering,\n\
    manufacturing, and health contexts have been developed, further attempts need\
    \ to be\nconsidered in the agricultural context towards the development of digital\
    \ twin systems\nthat can monitor, record, and analyze data, to predict and prescribe\
    \ the best decision for\ndigital farming management.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Abstract: Smart farming is a development that has emphasized information and communication

    technology used in machinery, equipment, and sensors in network-based hi-tech
    farm supervision

    cycles. Innovative technologies, the Internet of Things (IoT), and cloud computing
    are anticipated

    to inspire growth and initiate the use of robots and artiﬁcial intelligence in
    farming. Such ground-

    breaking deviations are unsettling current agriculture approaches, while also
    presenting a range of

    challenges. This paper investigates the tools and equipment used in applications
    of wireless sensors

    in IoT agriculture, and the anticipated challenges faced when merging technology
    with conventional

    farming activities. Furthermore, this technical knowledge is helpful to growers
    during crop periods

    from sowing to harvest; and applications in both packing and transport are also
    investigated.

    1. Introduction

    Sustainable agriculture is a measure of the endurance and sustenance of food grains

    produced in an eco-friendly manner [1]. Sustainable agriculture helps in the encourage-

    ment of farming practices and approaches to help sustain farmers and resources.
    It is

    economically feasible and maintains soil quality, reduces soil degradation, saves
    water

    resources, improves land biodiversity, and ensures a natural and healthy environment
    [2].

    Sustainable agriculture plays a signiﬁcant role in preserving natural resources,
    halting

    biodiversity loss, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions [3].

    Sustainable agriculture farming is a method of preserving nature without compromis-

    ing the future generation’s basic needs, whilst also improving the effectiveness
    of farming.

    The basic accomplishments of smart farming in terms of sustainable agriculture
    are crop ro-

    tation, the control of nutrient deﬁciency in crops, the control of pests and diseases,
    recycling,

    and water harvesting, leading to an overall safer environment. Living organisms
    depend

    on the nature of biodiversity, and are contaminated by waste emissions, the use
    of fertilizers

    and pesticides, degraded dead plants, etc. The emission of greenhouse gases affects
    plants,

    animals, humans, and the environment; hence, it necessitates a better environment
    for

    living things [4] (Figure 1).

    Agriculture is the largest contributor in India, with an 18% gross domestic product

    involving approximately 57% of people in rural areas. Over the years, although
    India’s

    total agronomic output has increased, the number of growers has fallen from 71.9%
    in 1951

    to 45.1% in 2011 [5]. The Economic Survey 2018 revealed that the number of agricultural

    workers in the total workforce will drop to 25.7% in 2050. In rural areas, farming
    families

    gradually lose the next generation of farmers, overwhelmed by higher costs of
    cultivation,

    low per capita productivity, inadequate soil maintenance, and migrations to a
    non-farming

    or higher remunerative occupation. Presently, the world is on the verge of a digital

    revolution, and so it is the appropriate time to connect the agricultural landform
    with

    wireless technology to introduce and accommodate digital connectivity with farmers.

    Figure 1. Factors of sustainable agriculture.

    Regrettably, not all parts of the Earth’s surface are suitable for agriculture
    due to

    various restrictions, such as: soil quality, topography, temperature, climate,
    and most

    relevant cultivable areas are also not homogenous [6]. Further, existing farming
    land is

    fragmented by political and ﬁscal features, and rapid urbanization, which consistently

    increases pressure on arable land availability (Figure 2). Recently, total agricultural
    land

    used for food production has declined [7]. Furthermore, every crop ﬁeld has different

    critical characteristics, such as soil type, ﬂow of irrigation, presence of nutrients,
    and pest

    resistance, which are all measured separately both in quality and quantity regarding
    a

    speciﬁc crop. Both spatial and temporal differences are necessary for optimizing
    crop

    production in the same ﬁeld by crop rotation and an annual crop growth development

    cycle [8].

    Figure 2. Key issues of technology in the agriculture industry.

    In most cases, variations in characteristics occur within a single crop, or the
    same

    crop is grown on the whole farm and requires site-speciﬁc analyses for optimum
    yield

    production. New technology-based approaches are needed to produce more from less
    land,

    and to address these various issues. In traditional farming practices, farmers
    frequently

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    3 of 26

    visit their ﬁelds throughout the crop’s life in routine farming activities to
    better understand

    the crop conditions [9]. The current sensor and communication technologies offer
    an precise

    view of the ﬁeld, from which farmers can detect ongoing ﬁeld activities without
    being in

    the ﬁeld in person. Wireless sensors monitor the crops with higher accuracy and
    detect

    issues at early stages, often facilitating the use of smart tools from initial
    sowing to the

    harvest of crops [10].

    The timely use of sensors has made the entire farming operation smart and cost-

    effective, due to precise monitoring. The various autonomous harvesters, robotic
    weeders,

    and drones have sensors attached to collect data over short intervals. However,
    the vastness

    of agriculture puts extreme demands on technological solutions for sustainability
    with

    minimum ecological impact. Sensor technology through wireless communication helps

    farmers to know the various needs and requirements of crops without being in the
    ﬁelds,

    and they are then able to take remote action [11].

    2. Smart Farming

    Historically, ancient agriculture practices were related to the production of
    food in

    cultivated lands for the survival of humans and the breeding of animals [12],
    and was

    called the traditional agricultural era 1.0. This mainly resorted to using manpower
    and

    animals. Simple tools were used for farming activities, such as sickles and shovels.
    Work

    was mainly conducted through manual labor, and subsequently, productivity continued
    at

    a low level (Figure 3).

    Figure 3. Agricultural decision support system framework.

    During the 19th Century, new types of machinery appeared in the agricultural indus-

    tries, in the form of steam engines. The wide use of agricultural machinery and
    abundant

    chemicals by farmers signaled the start of the agricultural era 2.0, and outwardly
    improved

    effectiveness and productivity of farmers and farms. However, considerably harmful
    impli-

    cations, such as chemical pollution, environmental devastation, waste of natural
    resources,

    and excess utilization of energy, simultaneously developed.

    The agricultural era 3.0 emerged during the 20th Century, due to the rapid growth
    of

    computation and electronics. Robotic techniques, programed agricultural machinery,
    and

    other technologies enhanced the agricultural processes efﬁciently. The issues
    that had arisen

    during agricultural era 2.0 were solved, and policies were readapted to the agricultural
    era

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    4 of 26

    3.0 through work distribution, precise irrigation, the reduced use of chemicals,
    site-speciﬁc

    nutrient application, and efﬁcient pest control technologies, etc.

    The next agricultural era is also the current iteration of agriculture, the agricultural

    era 4.0, involving the engagement of recent technologies, such as the Internet
    of Things, big

    data analysis, artiﬁcial intelligence, cloud computing and remote sensing, etc.
    The adop-

    tion of new technologies has signiﬁcantly improved agricultural activities by
    developing

    low-cost sensor and network platforms, aimed towards the optimization of production

    efﬁciency, along with reductions in the usage of water resources and energy with
    minimum

    environmental effects [13]. Big data in smart farming provides extrapolative overviews
    of

    real-time agricultural situations, allowing farmers to make effective decisions
    [14]. Real-

    time programming is developed with artiﬁcial intelligence concepts and embedded
    in IoT

    devices, helping farmers make the most suitable decisions [15].

    Smart farming promotes precision agriculture with modern, sophisticated technology

    and enables farmers to remotely monitor the plants. Smart farming helps agricultural
    pro-

    cesses, such as harvesting and crop yields, as the automation of sensors and machinery
    has

    made the farming workforce more efﬁcient [16]. The technologies convert traditional
    farm-

    ing methods to automatic devices, causing a technological revolution in agriculture.
    Today,

    the technology in agriculture has altered the way farming is conducted, and conventional

    techniques have been transformed by the Internet of Things [17].

    In terms of optimizing farm labor requirements and increasing the quantity and

    quality of products, smart farming is an emerging modern technique implemented
    with

    information and communication technologies (ICT) [16]. Modern ICT technologies,
    such

    as the Internet of Things, GPS (Global Positioning Systems), sensors, robotics,
    drones,

    precision equipment, actuators, and data analytics, are used to identify the farmers’
    needs

    and select suitable solutions to their problems. These innovations increase the
    accuracy

    and timeliness of decisions taken, and improve crop productivity. Several multilateral

    organizations and developing countries around the world have proposed smart farming

    technologies to increase agricultural output [18].

    Sensors are constantly monitoring crops with greater accuracy, detecting any undesir-

    able conditions during the early stages of the crop’s lifecycle. Current farming
    incorporates

    smart tools from crop sowing to harvest, storing, and conveyance. The appropriate
    use of a

    wide variety of sensors has made the entire operation both more efﬁcient and proﬁtable,

    due to its accurate monitoring competencies. In addition, sensors that collect
    data quickly

    are directly available online for further evaluation, and they provide crop and
    site-speciﬁc

    agriculture for every site.

    The many issues related to crop production are addressed by smart agriculture
    and

    monitoring, particularly regarding changes in soil characteristics, climate factors,
    soil mois-

    ture, etc., to improve the spatial management practices that increase crop production
    and

    avoid the excess use of fertilizers and pesticides [19]. The ANN models in smart
    irrigation

    water management (SIWM) regulate irrigation scheduling support systems (DSS) and
    offer

    data on irrigation efﬁciency, water productivity index, and irrigation water demand
    and

    supply on a real-time basis. Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) is an upcoming technology,

    especially in developing countries, due to its potential to improve food security,
    farm

    system resilience, and lower greenhouse gas emissions [20]. Smart agriculture
    technology

    based on IoT technologies has many advantages in all agricultural processes and
    practices

    in real-time, including irrigation, plant protection, improving product quality,
    fertilization,

    disease prediction, etc. [21]. The beneﬁt of smart agriculture lies in its collection
    of real-time

    data on crops, the precise assessment of soil and crops, remote monitoring by
    farmers,

    supervising water and other natural resources, and improving livestock and agricultural

    production. Therefore, smart agriculture is considered to be the progression of
    precision

    agriculture through modernization and smart methods to attain various information
    of

    farm activities that are then remotely managed, and reinforced by suitable alternative

    real-time farm maintenance solutions.

    3. Internet of Things

    The Internet of Things (IoT) is a new technology that allows devices to connect

    remotely to achieve smart farming [22]. The IoT has begun to inﬂuence a vast range

    of industries, from health, trade, communications, energy and agriculture, to
    enhance

    efﬁciency and performance across all markets [23–25].

    Current applications provide information on the IoT’s effects, and its practices
    that are

    yet to be observed. However, by considering the advancement of technologies, one
    can

    envisage the IoT technologies perform a crucial role in numerous activities of
    farming, such

    as the utilization of communication infrastructure, data acquisition, smart objects,
    sensors,

    mobile devices, cloud-based intelligent information, decision-making, and the
    automation

    of agricultural operations (Figure 4).

    Figure 4. Barriers in the implementation of smart agriculture technology.

    The IoT technology monitors plants and animals and remotely retrieves information

    from mobile phones and devices. Sensors and instruments empower farmers to assess

    the weather and to anticipate production levels. The IoT plays a role in water
    harvesting,

    monitoring and controlling the ﬂow amount, assessing crops’ water requirements,
    time of

    supply, and the saving of water, more than ever before [26]. Sensors and cloud
    connectivity

    through the gateway can remotely monitor the status and water supply based on
    soil

    and plant needs [27]. To correct nutrient deﬁciencies, pests, and diseases, farmers
    cannot

    monitor and observe every plant manually, but IoT technology is still beneﬁcial
    and has

    led farmers to a new milestone in modern agriculture [28].

    Recently, the development of IoT technologies has played a major role throughout
    the

    farming sector, particularly through its communication infrastructure. This has
    included

    connecting smart objects, remote data acquisition, using vehicles and sensors
    through

    mobile devices and the internet, cloud-based intelligent analysis, interfacing,
    decision

    formation, and the automation of agricultural operations. These proﬁciencies have
    revo-

    lutionized the agriculture industry in terms of resource optimization, controlling
    climate

    effects, and improving crop yields.

    Researchers have proposed different methods, architectures, and various equipment
    to

    monitor and convey crop information at different growth stages, based on several
    crop and

    ﬁeld types. Many manufacturers provide communication devices, multiple sensors,
    robots,

    heavy machinery, and drones to collect and then distribute data. Food and agriculture

    organizations, along with other government organizations, develop guidelines and
    policies

    for regulating the use of technologies to preserve food and environment safety
    [29,30].

    Fundamentals of IoT Applications in Agriculture

    The accessible, inexpensive and interactive tracking platform provides consolidated

    information on traditional agricultural methods, techniques, implements, crop
    pests and

    diseases, etc., collected from various sources for sustainable agriculture. Interactive
    agricul-

    ture allows easy access to the data by users through multiple devices, such as
    computers

    and mobile phones [31].

    1.

    Robust Models: The distinctive features of the agriculture sector are diversity,
    com-

    plexity, spatio-temporal variability, and uncertainties of the right types of
    harvests

    and facilities.

    2.

    Scalability: The variation in farm size from smaller to larger; hence, the results
    should

    be scalable. The placement and testing planning should be progressively scaled
    up

    with fewer expenses.

    3.

    Affordability: Affordability is vital to farming achievement, and therefore price
    should

    be suitable with signiﬁcant assistance. Standardized platforms, products, tools,
    and

    facilities could obtain a satisfactory price.

    4.

    Sustainability: The problem of sustainability is a vital issue due to strong economic

    pressure and intense competition worldwide.

    4. Technologies Used in Smart Farming

    4.1. Global Positioning System (GPS)

    GPS accurately records latitude, longitude, and elevation information [32]. Global

    Positioning System satellites transmit signals and permit GPS receivers to compute
    their

    location in real-time, and provide continuous positions while moving. The exact
    location

    information offers farmers the opportunity to discover the precise position of
    ﬁeld data,

    such as pest occurrence, type of soil, weeds, and other barriers. The system facilitates
    the

    recognition of various ﬁeld locations in order to then apply the necessary inputs
    (seed,

    fertilizer, herbicide, pesticide, and water) to a particular ﬁeld [33].

    4.2. Sensor Technologies

    Technics, such as photo electricity, electromagnetics, conductivity, and ultrasound,
    are

    used to estimate soil texture and structure, nutrient level, vegetation, humidity,
    vapor, air,

    temperature, etc. Remote sensing data can differentiate between crop types, categorize

    pests and weeds, locate stress in soil and plant conditions, and monitor drought
    [34].

    Plant health is affected by many factors, such as soil moisture, nutrient availability,

    exposure to light, humidity, the amount of rainfall, the color of leaves, etc.
    The plants are

    monitored by maintaining the optimum temperature and light intensity, and conserving

    water and energy through micro-irrigation. Different sensors are used to detect
    many

    parameters. If they cross a threshold, the sensor senses the changes and transmits
    them

    to the microcontroller to perform the required actions until the parameter returns
    to its

    optimum level [1].

    The temperature, humidity, soil pattern monitoring, airﬂow sensor, location, CO2,

    pressure, light, and moisture sensors are generally used in sensing technologies.
    Prominent

    sensor characteristics include reliability, memory, portability, durability, coverage,
    and

    computational efﬁciency, and make them suitable for agriculture [35]. Currently
    available

    wireless sensors play a vital role in collecting data on crop conditions and providing
    other

    information. These sensors are standalone types and can be integrated with advanced

    agricultural tools and heavy machinery, based on application necessities.

    The major sensor types with their corresponding working procedure and purpose
    are

    represented in Table 1.

    [57].

    4.3. Variable-Rate of Technology (VRT) and Grid Soil Sampling

    Variable-rate technologies (VRT) are used in farming to predict the delivery rate
    of

    inputs based on a predetermined map extrapolated from GIS for the placement of
    inputs at

    variable amounts in the right place and at the right time [16,33]. Grid soil sampling
    is soil

    collection from a systematic grid to establish a map for every parameter. These
    maps are

    the basis for VRT and are loaded into a variable-rate applicator. The computer
    and GPS

    receiver direct and control the changes in the delivery amount or fertilizer product,
    based

    on map features [58,59].

    New technologies, such as variable rate technology and associated practices (grid
    soil

    sampling), potentially improve soil fertility management and assess the spatial
    distribution

    of nutrients and yields [60]. In grid sampling, samples are collected from sampled
    sections

    based on the subdivision of a ﬁeld into small areas, or cells, by superimposing
    the grid

    lines onto the ﬁeld. Composite samples represent an entire area of each much smaller
    area

    (grid-point sampling) at the intersections of grid lines. Soil-test values from
    grid sampling

    are mapped by interpolating methods from non-measured locations between sampled

    points. The variability of phosphorus and potassium is ﬁeld-speciﬁc, and each
    ﬁeld should

    be fertilized differently to improve nutrient management practices by uniform
    applications

    of fertilizers and manure for better precision agriculture [61].

    4.4. Geographic Information System (GIS)

    The GIS comprises hardware and software designed to provide compilation, storage,

    retrieval, attributes analysis, and location data to generate maps and analyze
    characters and

    geography for statistics and spatial methods [62]. The GIS database provides information

    on ﬁeld soil types, nutrient status, topography, irrigation, surface and subsurface
    drainage,

    quantity of chemical applications, and crop production, and also establishes the
    relationship

    between elements that affect a crop on a particular farming ﬁeld [63]. Apart from
    data

    storage and display, the GIS is used to assess present and alternative management
    by

    compounding and altering data layers for decision-making.

    4.5. Crop Management

    Satellite images provide information on variations in soil conditions, as well
    as crop

    performances affected by topography within the ﬁeld. Therefore, farmers can exactly

    monitor production factors, such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides, that are
    responsible

    for yield increase and efﬁciency.

    The spatial coverage and temporal revisit frequency of satellite images provide
    the

    information in near real-time at a regional scale. The relationship between the
    spectral prop-

    erties of crops and their biomass/yield experiments [64] is predicted by spectral
    reﬂectance

    properties of vegetation, especially in red and near-infrared combinations (vegetation

    indices) to monitor green foliage. Among the different indices, the normalized
    difference

    vegetation index (NDVI) is the most popular indicator to assess vegetation health
    and crop

    production, due to the closely related leaf area index (LAI) and photosynthetic
    activity

    of green vegetation [25]. Crop monitoring methods are based on the interpretation
    of

    remote-sensing-derived indicators by comparing actual crop status to previous
    or normal

    seasons [65]. The relationship between vegetation indices and biomass permits
    early crop

    yield estimation in certain periods before harvest [66]. The automated data acquisition,
    pro-

    cessing, monitoring, decision-making, and management of farm operations [67],
    including

    the basic functions of crop production (yields), proﬁts and losses, farm weather
    prediction,

    ﬁeld mapping, soil nutrients tracking, are the more complicated functionalities
    available

    through automated ﬁeld management.

    4.6. Soil and Plant Sensors

    Sensor technology, a signiﬁcant constituent of precision agriculture, provides
    soil

    properties information, fertility, and water status. Hence, new sensors have been
    developed

    based on desirable features and established apart from currently available sensors
    [68].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    9 of 26

    Soil sensors and plant wearables monitor real-time physical and chemical signals

    in soil, such as moisture, pH, temperature, and pollutants, and provide information
    to

    optimize crop growth conditions, ﬁght against biotic and abiotic stresses, and
    increase

    crop yields. Soil organic matters (SOMs), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium

    (K) are the most important nutrients for crop production. The NIR reﬂectance-based

    sensors measure the spatial variation of surface and subsurface soil nitrogen
    [69]. SOM is

    predicted based on optimal wavelengths by assessing soil spectral reﬂectance in
    IR and

    visible wavelength regions [70]. The soil nitrogen and phosphorus are predicted
    using

    NIR spectrophotometry technology [71–73]. The soil apparent electrical conductivity
    (ECa)

    sensors collect information continuously on the ﬁeld surface, since ECa is sensitive
    to

    changes in soil texture and salinity. Soil insects/pests are detected using optoelectronic,

    acoustic, impedance sensors, and nanostructured biosensors [74].

    4.7. Rate Controllers

    Rate controllers are designed to control the delivery rate of inputs by monitoring
    the

    speed of vehicles across the ﬁeld, and altering the ﬂow rate of material on a
    real-time basis

    at the target rate. Rate controllers are commonly used as stand-alone systems
    [75].

    4.8. Precision Irrigation in Pressurized Systems

    Recent developments in irrigation systems have introduced irrigation machines,
    de-

    voted to motion control, GPS-based controllers, sensor technologies, and wireless
    commu-

    nication to monitor soil and climatic conditions together with an assessment of
    irrigation

    parameters, i.e., ﬂow and pressure, to attain greater water utilization efﬁciency
    by crop.

    These technologies show signiﬁcant potential; however, further progress is required
    before

    they can become commercially available [76].

    4.9. Yield Monitor

    Yield monitors are the combination of sensors and components, including a data

    storage device, a computer, and user interface, that control integration and interaction

    components. The sensor measures yield continuously by evaluating the force of
    mass or

    volume of grain ﬂow. The mass ﬂow sensor was based on the principle of transmitting

    microwave energy beams and measuring the energy that bounces back after hitting.
    In

    yield monitors, GPS receivers create yield maps based on the location yield data
    [77].

    The yield monitor is mounted on a harvester and connected with the mobile app
    for

    displaying live harvest data, and automatically uploads to the web-based platform.
    The

    app can generate and share high-quality yield maps with an agronomist, and farmers

    can export other farm management data for analysis. In horticultural crops, to
    precisely

    determine the yield quantity and quality of produce, fruit growth is considered
    one of

    the most relevant parameters in the crop progressing period [78]. Color images
    are used

    to track fruit conditions for estimating fruit maturation, making decisions for
    harvesting,

    and targeting the right market [79]. Satellite images are one of the options for
    real-time

    monitoring of the yield of crops over vast areas; for example, Sentinel-1A images
    are used

    to map the rice yield and crop intensity in Myanmar [80].

    The crop yield estimation system was designed using both software and hardware

    components. Based on a Bluetooth terminal android application and yield estimator

    software program, crop yield is estimated using a mathematical calculation through
    a

    mobile application [81]. Satellite-based crop yield predictions based on spectral
    signatures

    reveal the estimated yields are as reliable as actual yields. The maize yield
    predictions

    were successfully carried out under varying environments using machine learning
    and

    satellite-derived data assimilation in crop models [82].

    4.10. Software

    The software has multiple tasks, such as mapping, display controller interfacing,
    data

    processing, analysis, and interpretation, etc. Most commonly, software is used
    to generate

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    10 of 26

    the maps for soil properties and nutrient status, yield maps, variable rate applications

    maps for inputs, and overlaying different kinds of maps with advanced geostatistical

    features [83].

    5. Applications in Agriculture

    By adopting the current sensor and IoT technologies in agriculture, each characteristic

    of conventional farming practices is rehabilitated. The incorporation of wireless
    sensors

    and IoT in smart farming answers many of the issues facing conventional agriculture;
    for

    example, land suitability, drought monitoring, irrigation, pest control, and yield
    maximiza-

    tion. Figure 5 demonstrates the order of main applications, facilities, and devices
    for smart

    agriculture applications. Using advanced technologies at various stages in the
    following

    few applications enhances efﬁciency and revolutionizes agriculture.

    Figure 5. Hierarchy of probable applications, facilities and devices for smart
    agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    11 of 26

    5.1. Soil Mapping and Plant Monitoring

    Soil analysis estimates the nutrient status of the ﬁeld based on GPS position
    and

    ﬁeld-speciﬁc information, and critical decisions are then taken according to the
    nutrient

    deﬁciencies at different stages of the crop. The factors controlling soil fertility
    status are

    topography, type and texture, cropping pattern, application of fertilizer, irrigation,
    etc. [84].

    Soil mapping is useful for assessing crop suitability or varieties in a speciﬁc
    ﬁeld, as well

    as planting depth, the physical, chemical and biological properties of soil, in
    order to

    best utilize resources. Presently, a wide range of sensors and tools are used
    to monitor

    soil properties, such as water-holding capacity, texture, and absorption rate,
    which assists

    farmers in tracking the soil quality and adopting suitable remedies to avoid soil
    degradation

    such as erosion, alkalization, acidiﬁcation, salinization, and pollution. Drought
    is another

    concern that affects plant productivity and crop yield. Remote sensing techniques
    that

    can obtain soil moisture data frequently assist in analyzing agricultural drought
    in remote

    regions. Soil moisture maps generated from satellite data are used to estimate
    the soil water

    deﬁcit index (SWDI), which enables the development of prediction models based
    on soil

    physical properties [85,86].

    Various factors, such as soil type, soil nutrients, irrigation, and pests, affect
    rice yield

    and quality. The IoT-based mobile application aids crop management and provides
    real-

    time information on soil nutrition and characteristics. The system consists of
    electrical

    conductivity (EC), temperature sensors with a T-Beam microcontroller, and IoT
    connectivity,

    and the estimated EC value near the calibration solution is 12.88 mS/cm, and 150
    mS/cm

    is less than 2% of the calibration solution’s value. The measured EC values are
    linearly

    proportional to temperature and depth, and values of 1.04 and 3.86 mS/cm were
    noticed

    with and without fertilizer at 5 cm depth, while it was 0.656 and 420 mS/cm at
    10 cm depth,

    respectively [87].

    Plant monitoring conducted through the IoT ADCON-based station, with sensors

    and mobile devices (smartphones and tablets), farmers are able to collect data
    on soil and

    ambient parameters, such as leaf wetness, air and soil temperature, soil and air
    humidity to

    improve the grape productivity, and crop quality from seeding to harvest. Further,
    the data

    transmission system highlights the soil-plant-atmosphere interactions needed to
    optimize

    agricultural production [88]. By analyzing the data from soil moisture, carbon
    dioxide,

    light, and temperature sensors in bell peppers grown in a greenhouse were compared
    with

    day and night CO2, rolling the doors and windows of the greenhouse open and closed,

    based on soil moisture [89].

    5.2. Irrigation

    According to the UN Convention to Combat Desertiﬁcation (UNCCD), 168 countries

    will be inundated with desertiﬁcation by 2030, and nearly 50% of the world population

    lives in high water shortage areas [90]. Considering the water crises and increasing
    demand

    for farming and other activities, it must be provided to regions with water quantities.
    Water

    resources are conserved by adopting more controlled and efﬁcient irrigation systems;
    for

    example, drip and sprinkler irrigations. Water demand estimation for crops is
    controlled

    by soil type, precipitation, irrigation method, crop type, and requirement, as
    well as soil

    moisture retention. Using air and soil moisture control systems with wireless
    sensors

    optimizes water resources and improves crop health. In the current scenario, a
    substantial

    increase in crop productivity is anticipated using IoT techniques, namely CWSI
    (crop water

    stress index)-based water management [91], calculated from the crop canopy at
    varying

    crop growth stages and air temperatures. The information from climate data, sensors,
    and

    satellite imaging are related to the CWSI model for water requirement calculation,
    and

    predictions using the irrigation index values can be used for every ﬁeld based
    on slope or

    soil variability to improve water usage efﬁciency.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    12 of 26

    5.3. Site-Speciﬁc Nutrient Management

    Fertilizer is a either natural or synthetic chemical substance that provides nutrients
    for

    plant growth and soil fertility. Both nutrient deﬁciency and excessive fertilizer
    use harms

    soil, plant health, and the environment [92]. The site-speciﬁc soil nutrient fertilization
    under

    smart agriculture estimates the required quantity of nutrients precisely, and
    minimizes

    their negative effects through excessive use on soil and in the environment. The
    site-

    speciﬁc soil, nutrient measurements are inﬂuenced by soil types, crop type, yield
    targets,

    exchange capacity, use efﬁciency, the type of fertilizer, weather conditions,
    etc. The IoT-

    based fertilizing technique estimates the nutrient’s spatial patterns of distribution
    [93,94].

    The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) was obtained from satellite
    images to

    observe crop nutrient status [95,96], crop health, vegetation vigor, and plant
    density, as well

    as soil nutrient level. Recent technologies, like GPS [97], geo mapping [98],
    variable rate

    technology (VRT) [99,100], and autonomous vehicles [101] strongly contribute to
    IoT-based

    smart fertilization. Apart from these, fertigation [102] and chemigation [103,104],
    i.e., the

    use of water-soluble fertilizers in soil amendments and pesticides, are considered
    effective

    management practices to improve fertilization efﬁciency.

    5.4. Crop Pest and Disease Management

    The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) concluded that an annual global crop

    yield loss of 20- 40% was only due to pests and diseases [105], and these losses
    are controlled

    by the use of pesticides and other agrochemicals [106]. Most of them are harmful
    to human

    and animal health, and ultimately cause contamination of environmental systems
    [107,108].

    The IoT-based devices, such as robots, wireless sensors, and drones, precisely
    spot and

    control the crop opponents by real-time monitoring, modelling, and disease forecasting,

    increasing overall effectiveness [109,110] more than traditional pest control
    procedures.

    The IoT-based disease and pest management process depends on detection and image

    processing. The remote sensing imagery and ﬁeld sensors are used to collect data,
    such

    as plant health and pest incidence, in every ﬁeld for the entire crop period.
    IoT-based

    automated traps [111,112] capture, count, and describe insect types, and further
    upload

    data to the Cloud for complete analysis. Due to advancements in robotic technology,

    an agricultural robot with multispectral image sensing devices and precision spraying

    nozzles is utilized to detect and control pest problems more accurately under
    the IoT

    management system.

    5.5. Yield Monitoring and Forecasting

    The yield monitoring mechanism conforms to yield, moisture content, and quality
    of

    produce. The quality depends on pollination with good pollen, especially under
    changing

    environmental circumstances [113–115]. Crop forecasting predicts the yield before
    the crop

    harvest, and assists the farmer in future planning, decision-making, and further
    analysis of

    the yield quality. Maturity determines the right harvesting time by monitoring
    the crop at

    different development stages, including factors such as fruit color, size, etc.
    Predictions of

    the correct harvesting time aids in maximizing crop quality and production, and
    regulates

    market management strategies. Therefore, farmers should know the exact harvest
    time of

    crops to obtain proﬁt. Figure 6 outlines the idea of a farm area network, representing
    the

    whole farm in real-time conditions.

    The development and installation of a yield monitor [116] on a harvester, connected

    with a mobile app, shows real-time crop harvest, and automatically transmits data
    to

    the manufacturer’s web-based platform. To estimate crop production and monitoring,

    satellite images are exploited to cover vast areas [80]. For fruit crops, multicolor
    (RGB)

    satellite images [79] are utilized to track the diverse fruit conditions, especially
    fruit size

    and color, and plays a major role in estimating its maturation, making decisions
    on harvest,

    and market opportunities. Similarly, multiple optical sensors are used [117] to
    monitor

    shrinking fruits during drying conditions.

    6. Role of IoT in Advanced Farming Practices

    Adopting the new methods based on sensor and IoT-based technologies improved

    the yield of crops more than conventional agriculture processes. The involvement
    of new

    sophisticated sensor-based technologies in controlled environments plays an important

    role in enhancing the quality and quantity of produce.

    6.1. Greenhouse Farming and Protected Cultivation

    Growing plants in a controlled environment gained popularity in the 19th Century,

    and is considered one of the oldest methods of smart farming. These practices
    further

    accelerated during the 20th Century in countries facing severe weather conditions
    [118].

    Crops grown in indoor conditions are less affected by the environment. As a result,

    crops grown traditionally under suitable conditions are today being raised at
    anytime and

    anywhere by the use of sensors and communication devices. The success of crop
    production

    under a controlled environment depends on various factors, such as shed structures
    and

    material for controlling wind effects, aeration systems, accuracy of monitoring
    parameters,

    decision support system, etc. [119]. One of the greatest challenges in greenhouses
    is the

    precise monitoring of environmental parameters; hence, it requires several measurement

    points to predict the various parameters for controlling and ensuring the local
    climate. In

    an IoT-based greenhouse, sensors are used to measure and monitor the internal
    parameters,

    such as humidity, temperature, light, and pressure [120].

    The smart greenhouse has helped farmers automatically conduct farm work, without

    manual inspection, and protects the plants from hailstorms, winds, ultraviolet
    radiation,

    and insect and pest attacks. Hibiscus plants are grown with the required wavelength
    during

    the night using lights, temperature, and air humidity sensors. A study revealed
    a reduction

    in 70–80% water requirement, and the IoT enables direct contact between the farmer
    and

    consumer to make farming as efﬁcient and proﬁtable as possible [121]. The IoT-enabled

    automated system increased the productivity of rose plants grown in a greenhouse
    by

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    14 of 26

    monitoring and controlling various parameters, such as humidity, mist, CO2 level,
    UV light

    intensity, pH and EC value, water nutrients solution level, temperature, and amount
    of

    pesticides, through sensors for further efﬁcient detection and diagnosis [122].

    6.2. Hydroponics

    Hydroponics, a subdivision of hydroculture, is growing plants without soil to
    improve

    greenhouse farming beneﬁts. Hydroponic-based irrigation systems enable a balanced
    rate

    of application of dissolved nutrients in the water to crop roots as a solution.
    Presently,

    the available systems and sensors [123] detect a wide range of parameters and
    perform

    data analysis at predetermined intervals. Precise measurement and monitoring of
    nutrient

    content in solution is crucial for plant growth and considers its demands. On
    a real-

    time basis, the wireless-sensor-based prototype [124] has delivered a solution
    for soilless

    cultivation, and measures the concentration of numerous nutrients and water levels
    [125].

    An automated smart hydroponics system integrated with IoT consists of three major

    components: input data, cloud server and output data. These monitor lettuce cultivation

    from anywhere through the internet by analyzing parameters, such as pH level,
    water,

    nutrient-rich water-based solution, room temperature, and humidity, on a real-time
    ba-

    sis [126]. The hydroponic system of the deep ﬂow technique is a method for cultivating

    plants by placing roots in deep water layers, and ensuring the continuous circulation
    of

    plant nutrient solution. The plant growth elements data, such as pH, temperature,
    humid-

    ity, and water level in the hydroponic reservoir, are acquired by sensors integrated
    into

    Raspberry Pi, and data are processed and monitored automatically on a real-time
    basis to

    ensure proper water circulation [127].

    6.3. Vertical Farming

    The industrial-based agricultural farming practices damage soil quality at a faster

    rate than nature can reconstruct. The alarming erosion rate and use of fresh water
    for

    agriculture has led to the reduction of arable land, and increased the overburden
    on present

    water reservoirs [128]. Vertical farming (VF) offers an opportunity to keep the
    plants in a

    precisely controlled environment, signiﬁcantly reducing resource consumption and,
    at the

    same time, increasing production at varied times; and only a portion of the ground
    surface

    is needed depending on the number of stacks. VF is also extremely effective in
    higher

    yields and reducing water consumption compared to traditional farming [129]. The
    carbon

    dioxide measurement is the most critical parameter; hence, nondispersive infrared
    (NDIR)

    CO2 sensors play a vital part in tracking and controlling the conditions in vertical
    farms.

    6.4. Phenotyping

    Phenotyping is an emerging crop engineering technique, relating plant genomics
    with

    ecophysiology and agronomy. The advancement of genetic and molecular tools is
    signiﬁ-

    cant for crop breeding; however, quantitative analysis of crop behaviors, such
    as pathogen

    resistance, grain weight, etc., is inadequate due to the absence of effective
    technologies

    and efﬁcient techniques. In this condition, [130] reported that plant phenotyping
    is highly

    useful in investigating the quantitative characteristics responsible for growth,
    resistance

    to various stresses, yield quality, and quantity. The sensing technologies and
    image-based

    phenotyping describe screening of biostimulants and an understanding of their
    mode

    of action [131]. IoT-based phenotyping is intended to observe the crop and related
    trait

    measurements, and offer facilities for the breeding of crops and digital agriculture
    [132].

    The trait analysis algorithms and modelling support determine the relationships
    among

    genotypes, phenotypes, and their growing condition.

    7. The Role of the Engineer in Smart Farming

    Farmers face many issues when they adopt IoT-based agriculture. Therefore, engi-

    neers must develop solutions for speciﬁc problems related to smart farming techniques.
    An

    engineering role concerns the application and use of innovative technologies and
    methods

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    15 of 26

    for precision agricultural machinery, and smart farming is a creative way to mechanize

    agricultural engineering through means different from conventional mechanization
    [133].

    The concepts and synergy-based information are obtained from different technology
    areas,

    such as agricultural mechanization, mechatronics, instrumentation, control systems,
    and

    knowledge in artiﬁcial and computational intelligence [134]. Big data, satellite,
    and aerial

    images have revolutionized precision agriculture, and these new technologies increase

    production efﬁciency by creating a balance between productivity and environmental
    pro-

    tection. As a system integrator, engineering combines technical experience and
    strong

    business skills in both the public and private sectors [135].

    At the same time, engineering exploits the rewards of digital transformation in
    the

    entire agri-food chain, from day-to-day farming activities to supporting sales
    operations,

    logistics, and the maintenance of farm assets. For example, knowledge of the IoT,
    AI,

    mobile, precision farming technologies, remote sensing, advanced analytics, the
    Cloud,

    RPA, and blockchain technologies are necessary [136]. The data collected from
    the various

    types of machinery through sensors and other devices generates responses concerning

    cereals, viticulture, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and monitoring [137].

    The use of digital technologies and control systems to automate production processes

    also reduces manual human intervention. The production process, from ﬁeld to ﬁnal

    product, is carried out by planning, organizing, and analyzing data received from
    machines.

    The data acquired are stored in historical archives and correlated with each other
    to

    retrieve useful information for products through traceable systems working based
    on

    radio-frequency signals [138].

    7.1. Purpose

    Purpose is based on the user’s ﬁnal requirement, and inﬂuences the monitoring
    of

    crops during the growth period. Sensors provide the IoT solutions to their problems.

    For example, the end-user is a corn farmer, faced by problems mainly concerning
    water

    usage and ensuring that a crop gets adequate water; therefore, water level and
    moisture

    monitoring sensors are accommodated to prevent water wastage.

    7.2. Technology

    Distance plays an important role in technology selection because the sensors collect

    data and send to the server; hence, similar technology cannot be used for varying
    distances.

    For example, radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) or near ﬁeld communication (NFC)
    and

    low power, wide area network (LPWAN) technologies could send data over a distance
    of

    hundreds or even thousands of meters.

    7.3. Power Requirements

    Most IoT solutions are spread across a large farm, so it is better to develop
    low-

    power applications. On the other hand, more data transmission requires huge data
    costs

    and power consumption; hence, designers need to consider developing cost-effective
    IoT

    solutions for farmers. Usually, engineers save costs with customized IoT-based
    farming

    solutions, and develop apps for sending the data less frequently.

    7.4. Data Frequency

    The end user’s necessities are critical in deciding the number of sensors and
    data

    packets. Sometimes, a farmer does not require information frequently, but developer
    design

    an IoT application to function on a continual and real-time basis, with very high
    data

    frequency.

    7.5. Placement of Sensors

    Sensors are placed in such a way that they provide optimal performance, even if
    the

    farm has all the essential sensors with proper placement.

    8. Barriers to Implementing Smart Farming Technologies

    Technology adoption is a method with a certain level of heterogeneity factors
    that

    are affective [139]. Technology implemented in farming systems has provided accuracy,

    efﬁciency, and eased time pressures. Although smart farming increases the productivity
    of

    crops, there are still problems in adopting these technologies

    8.1. Cost of Technology

    Existing technologies minimize the workforce and perform extremely fast with high

    accuracy. Therefore, it is anticipated that machines would probably replace a
    human work-

    force in the near future. However, it is impossible, since many countries have
    experienced

    poverty wherever the workforce was the main source for the agriculture sector.
    The imple-

    mentation of devices and technologies requires a huge amount of money; therefore,
    farmers

    face difﬁculties in terms of affordability when they look beyond conventional
    tools.

    8.2. Lack of Financial Resources

    Financial supporters could provide adequate loans to farmers if farmers did not
    get

    the anticipated yield, perhaps because unexpected calamities like drought, ﬂood,
    pests,

    and diseases impacted the crops.

    8.3. Literacy Status of Farmers

    The education level among the farmers is one of the greater challenges in implementing

    technologies in developing countries. The knowledge needed encompasses educational
    and

    technical abilities to manage the tools. The level of education increases a farmers’
    aptitude

    to process information, and thus make decisions using smart farming technologies
    [140],

    facilitating farmers’ use of computers [141]. Farmers in developing nations are
    mostly

    uneducated and unskilled because of a lack of desire to gain knowledge, or any
    new

    technology awareness [142]. Hence, it is a reason for farmers in choosing traditional

    farming over smart farming [143]. Farmers have considered that usage is too complex,

    sometimes incapable of recognizing the icons used in a mobile application as the
    farmers

    use general icons based on traditional understanding. Farmers need to be digitally
    literate

    to reinforce the advantages of smart farming technologies and, simultaneously,
    agri-tech

    companies should ensure farmers easily understand the limitations of the technology.

    8.4. Lack of Integration between the Systems

    Integration across systems is one of the areas where smart farming technologies
    needs

    to be advanced further by incorporating production, property management, and decision-

    making tools. The communication between academics and interdisciplinary groups
    must

    overcome the gap between agricultural and information science. More emphasis has

    been given to increasing user effectiveness during the development of an information

    system [144]. The basis for improved decision-making is based on the timely obtain-

    ability of superior quality data; hence, data must be integrated to generate information

    and knowledge.

    8.5. Telecommunications Infrastructure

    Farming activities mostly occur in rural areas more effectively in arable land
    than

    contaminated land. However, poor telecommunication infrastructure makes data transmis-

    sion unreliable, especially through mobile phones and tablets. Smart farming necessitates

    a real-time connection with the internet to enable the use of information. In
    addition,

    various operation control systems, such as fertilizers, pesticides, and seed volume,
    requires

    high-quality internet connection to produce outcomes. Recently, with the expansion
    of

    mobile phones, rural producers have gained to access mobile internet; however,
    signal

    quality and input speed are limited.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    17 of 26

    8.6. Data Management

    Farmers are facing problems in organizing and manipulating data obtained by the

    sensors. The weather stations are generating data; however, farmers do not recognize
    how

    to use the information and how to change the data into a more available form.
    Its complex

    systems, alongside issues of acceptability and usability, lead to incorrect calculations.

    Farmers, consultants, and others involved in the production process must provide
    greater

    accessibility to data and information in productive systems.

    9. Current Challenges and Future Expectations

    In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the United Nations and international

    community established a goal to end hunger by 2030. Currently, the World Health
    Organi-

    zation reports that more than 800 million people are facing food shortages worldwise
    [145].

    In addition, the increasing global population is increasing the demand for quality
    food;

    therefore, food and cash crops could improve overall crop production.

    Figure 7 represents the future challenges agriculture is anticipated to face in
    2050. This

    illustration offers three major problems: (1) feeding 10 billion people, (2) limitations
    in the

    expansion of land, and (3) the reduction of greenhouse gases emissions. These
    challenges

    lead to new thinking about water scarcity, shrinking arable land, rural labor,
    climate condi-

    tions, and much more. The diminishment in rural populations due to urbanization
    is not

    only shrinking communities, but is also leading to ageing populations; therefore,
    younger

    growers must step forward to take responsibility. The generation shift and population

    imbalance create further implications for the workforce and production.

    Figure 7. Challenges in sustainable future agriculture.

    The further shrinking of arable land and the suitability of particular crops in
    speciﬁc

    regions are due to geographic and ecological conditions. Abrupt weather changes
    enhance

    the intensity of environmental issues, such as drought, groundwater depletion,
    and soil

    degradation, affecting crop production. Moreover, traditional agricultural methods
    have

    historically met food demands by employing fertilizers and pesticides; however,
    it increases

    food production only to a certain level and negligent use of chemical deteriorate
    the envi-

    ronment. In developing countries, various problems facing the agricultural sector
    include

    no suitable crop selection, soil testing, efﬁcient irrigation systems, weather
    forecasting,

    animal husbandry, etc. Technological advancements have proved beneﬁcial in developed

    countries, both quantitively and qualitatively, but, in developing countries,
    50% of the

    population is already engaged in agriculture.

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    18 of 26

    The future of agriculture is expected to interconnect with artiﬁcial intelligence
    and

    big data services. As a result, the systems will converge into a single unit,
    where farm

    machinery and management start from seeding to production forecasting. Few of
    the key

    technologies and methods are focused on achieving sustainable future agriculture.

    9.1. Communication

    The achievement of the IoT in agriculture mostly depends on connectivity between

    devices [146]. Most telecom operators provide connectivity services, but represent
    a small

    percentage of smart farming as a whole. Cellular operators offer new services
    to target

    growers and enhance market facilities, especially in rural areas. The success
    of cellular

    technology is feasible when service providers guarantee its beneﬁts, such as ﬂexibility,

    portability, and extravagance, of both-way communication at low cost. In developing

    countries, mobile services and smartphone technology offer a hopeful future for
    farmers

    to enhance their crop yields. The low power wide area technology (LPWA) is anticipated

    to play a major role in smart farming agriculture, due to its improved facilities,
    efﬁcient

    coverage, low power consumption, and cost economics. The cellular operators with
    robust

    IoT create signiﬁcant returns by offering smart agriculture facilities in collaboration
    with

    LPWA technology.

    9.2. Wireless Sensors and IoT

    Placing wireless sensors around the ﬁeld provides timely information on a real-time

    basis to farmers in order to make decisions and act in order to obtain higher
    crop yields.

    Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with GPS technology update all information on
    crop

    growth and terrain features. Recently, digital images and signal processing offer
    additional

    competencies to WSN, and precisely ascertain crop quality and health. The IoT
    technology

    can streamline tasks in a predictable manner by diagnosing crop requirements at
    each

    stage to maximize their effectiveness. In the future, IoT will be upgraded to
    the ﬁfth-

    generation (5G) cellular mobile communication technologies, to provide real-time
    data

    to farmers at any time and everywhere. Based on this achievement, around 29 billion

    IoT-based components are expected to operate in the agriculture sector by the
    end of 2022.

    Furthermore, it is expected to create 4.1 million data points daily from farms
    by 2050 [147].

    9.3. Drones and Unarmed Vehicles

    Farmers widely use drones for crop growth monitoring, spraying nutrient solutions

    and water, and pesticides in tough terrains and for different crop heights. Drones
    have

    proven their value for spraying speed, area coverage, and precision, compared
    to tradi-

    tional machinery. Due to advancements in technology, drones are equipped with
    various

    sensors, and 3D cameras provide comprehensive capabilities in land management
    by

    farmers. With the addition of UAVs in agriculture, many challenges, particularly
    the in-

    corporation of technologies and use in inclement weather conditions, are addressed
    by

    farmers. Other than drones, robotics in agriculture has also enhanced productivity
    due to

    higher yields achieved by spraying and weeding without human intervention. The
    seeding,

    transplanting, and fruit harvest/picking robots have recently added a new efﬁciency
    level

    to traditional methods.

    The UAV technology in smart agriculture provides information on fertilization,
    ir-

    rigation, use of pesticides, plant growth monitoring, weed management, crop disease

    management, and ﬁeld-level phenotyping to enhance cultivation practices. A new
    method

    of 3D modeling has been used to monitor crop growth parameters to determine the
    height

    of maize and sorghum plants under ﬁeld conditions using UAV, and the average root
    mean

    square error (RMSE) of sorghum height with hand sampling ﬁeld data was 0.33 m
    [148]. The

    UAV and 3D models were also restored to extract leaf area index (LAI) in soybean
    plants,

    the measured LAI predicted accuracy corresponding to the handheld device (R2 =
    0.92)

    was correlated with destructive LAI measurements (R2 = 0.89) [149].

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    19 of 26

    Weed detection and management were assessed by integrating low-resolution multi-

    spectral high-resolution RGB images [150] using the Random Forest (RF) technique
    in

    ﬁeld-grown rice and sugar beet crops [151]. Multi-spectral digital images obtained
    by

    UAVs are used for evaluating vegetation indices (VIs) and multi-temporal VIs to
    predict

    grain yield in wheat [152]. The indices, including the normalized difference vegetation

    index (NDVI), spectral vegetation index (SVI), and green area index (GAI), are
    evaluated in

    wheat crops to predict grain yield [153], monitor breeding [154], detect plant
    stress caused

    by yellow rust disease [155], and quantify plant density [156]. The usage of pesticides
    in

    agriculture is crucial for crop yields and the environment, and efforts have been
    made to

    develop and evaluate an algorithm to self-adjust UAV routes during chemical spraying
    in a

    crop ﬁeld to reduce the waste of pesticides and fertilizers [157].

    9.4. Vertical Farming and Hydroponics

    The shrinking of arable land and rapid urbanization results in greater pressure
    on the

    present resources [158], which causes hardships for food production with current
    agricul-

    ture practices. Vertical farming (VF) navigates land and water shortage challenges,
    and

    is highly suitable for adoption in nearby cities. Hydroponics plays a key role
    in lowering

    water requirements. Hydroponics, along with VF, increases available arable land
    without

    distressing forests and other natural habitats. The presence of advanced technologies,

    especially the IoT, makes the agriculture industry highly remunerative with a
    reduction in

    labor requirements and other resources, in addition to minimizing environmental
    impact.

    9.5. Performance Analysis Using Machine Learning

    Data analytics and machine learning concepts are applied to analyze the real-time

    data. In crop production, identifying the best genes is an important process that
    can be

    conducted using machine learning techniques. In agriculture, machine learning
    is used to

    envisage the best genes suited for crop production, especially for selecting seed
    varieties

    that are highly suitable to speciﬁc climate conditions and locations. Machine
    learning

    algorithms identify high demand products and currently unavailable products. Recent

    developments in machine learning and analytics allow farmers to correctly categorize
    their

    harvests before it is processes and delivered to customers.

    Machine learning (ML) in big data systems solves the issues related to farmers’

    decision-making, crops, animal research, land, food availability and security,
    weather

    and climate change, and weeds [159]. ML-based applications accommodate a large
    number

    of agricultural activities, such as yield prediction based on a deep memory model
    for

    maize [160], binary classiﬁcation model with logistic regression technique to
    assess rainfall

    intensity [161], and a short-term memory model to predict soil water content with
    data

    parameters of rainfall, temperature, water diversion, evaporation, and time for
    the next

    1, 2, and 7 days with greater R2 compared to artiﬁcial neural networks [162].
    As a result,

    the agricultural sector is increasing farmers’ incomes, and so communities are
    further

    integrated into the agricultural value chain to reduce poverty and provide access
    to health

    care, education, and nutritious food for their families [163].

    9.6. Renewable Energy, Microgrids and Smart Grids

    Smart farming requires extensive energy due to power consumption by long-standing

    sensor placement, use of GPS, and data transmission. Traditionally, using renewable
    energy

    sources in remote areas solves long-term power issues. Smart grids and microgrids
    are

    integrated into distributed energy sources (DERs). Recent advances in storage
    devices

    combine electricity and heat systems to stock energy and use the heat produced.

    Globally, smart grid technology enables a smooth transition from traditional to
    smart

    energy systems, ensuring energy security. In developing countries, power-strengthening

    systems integrated with renewable sources have enhanced the transport sector,
    and in-

    creased bioenergy use in the power sector through profuse renewable energy sources

    identiﬁed using smart technologies, such as, energy storage devices, smart appliances,

    Agriculture 2022, 12, 1745

    20 of 26

    computational intelligence, and the IoT. For example, the smart grid provides
    a broad

    range of opportunities for power sector reform in Nepal, alleviating the rural
    electricity

    problem by implementing smart microgrids, and subsequently, connecting to the
    national

    grid [164]. The Dayalbagh renewable energy smart microgrid in India is a small-scale

    electricity system comprising distributed loads and renewable energy resources,
    acting as a

    single controllable entity in the grid. The smart microgrids are integrated into
    renewable

    resources and form building blocks of smart grids, especially for the dairy plant
    to produce

    various dairy products [165].

    The mixed integer linear programme (MILP) systematically and efﬁciently managed

    energy consumption and subsequently lowered the cost, especially in residential
    areas,

    by scheduling the use of smart appliances and charging/discharging electric vehicles

    (EVs). The model generates its own energy from a microgrid containing solar panels

    and wind turbines, and forecasts wind speed and solar radiation for effective
    energy

    management. MILP-based energy planning sustains the effectiveness and productiveness

    of energy-efﬁcient techniques [166].

    10. Conclusions

    Smarter and more efﬁcient crop production methodologies are needed to address
    the

    issues of shrinking arable land and the food demands of an increasing world population.

    There is a necessity for everyone to be aware of food security in terms of sustainable

    agriculture. The growth of new technologies for increasing crop yield and encouraging

    the adoption of farming by innovative young people as a legitimate profession.
    This

    paper emphasized the role of many technologies used for farming, particularly
    the IoT,

    in making agriculture smarter and more effective in meeting future requirements.
    The

    current challenges faced by the industry and future prospects are noted to guide
    scholars

    and engineers. Hence, every piece of farmland is important to enhance crop production
    by

    dealing with every inch of land using sustainable IoT-based sensors and communication

    technologies.
